[KANA]
What's this?

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
A message from Morrigan.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
It's on a device just like
the one Miss Mariah has.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.768 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Grandmother sent us a message?

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
But, sir. Why do you have
this thing to begin with?

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY grunts]

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
Well. Morrigan's a very old
friend of mine, you see.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh?

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.195 position:50% align:center
Never mind that, Sis.
What's the message say?

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
"Listen well. I seek
three Artifacts.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
If I obtain the Glyph
of the Wind God,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
the Ring of the Thunder God,

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
and the Violin of the Earth God,
I'll release Maeve Hoshisato."

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Mother could finally
leave LÃ¡routir Village?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
That's awesome.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
This task sounds like it will be

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
quite the undertaking.
I may need some assistance.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
Would you care to help?

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Of course I would!
Surprised you have to ask.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.933 position:50% align:center
It involves stealing sadness,
so I have to go.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
It's what master thieves do!

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
Then what Miss Li said is true?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.155 position:50% align:center
You're absolutely certain
Maeve is absent

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
from the Hoshisato mansion?

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
Yes. The only family members
there are the children.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
Even that nuisance,
Mamoru, is MIA,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.124 position:50% align:center
what with his performances
and exploits overseas.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
Lucky us. Sounds like the
perfect time to strike.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
I can provide you with
the men you need.

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
That mansion is a straight up
gold mine of treasure.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
Any risk involved would be
well worth the effort.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN]
Mm.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
But before we commit,
I need to know...

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.140 position:50% align:center
What exactly do
you want in return

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
for such
valuable information?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE]
We want nothing.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
My organization is still
small and insignificant.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
Being welcomed to a gathering
of such important men

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
is a reward in and of itself.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
[MEN chuckle]

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
What's your first name, Miss Li?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
You gentlemen may
call me Michelle.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
I won't forget this.
Thank you, Michelle.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
[MICHELLE]
I am at your service.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Australia?

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Mm-hm.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
Master Gregory and I will
be having a show there.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
But, what about the
Artifact fetch quest

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
we have to do to get
Mother back home?

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
That's the whole reason
we booked the gig.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
We've been looking
into the Artifacts

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
your grandmother mentioned.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
And we found out where the
Violin of the Earth God is.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
Then that means...

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
It's somewhere in Australia?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
That's correct, sweet pea.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Hence why we chose to hold our
next performance abroad.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Time out for a second!

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
I'm still the one who's
stealing it, right?

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
All three of us are.
At least I hoped so.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, YUMEMI]
Mm.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
I guess you'll have to tag
along for the ride, then.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.168 position:50% align:center
Guess? Oh, I'm going!

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
This time there's nothing that
can stand in my way!

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
That's right.
'Cause we have to save Mom.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Hm. What about you, kid?

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh! I have to go.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
It's what the partners
of master thieves do.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
[ALL shiver]

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
It's freezing!

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
Why on earth is it so cold?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
Aren't seasons in the
southern hemisphere

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
flip-flopped with ours?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
That is very true.
I came during Japan's winter.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
Kinda forgot Australia
had one, too.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI sneezes]

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
Master. We can't just
stand around like this.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
Your daughters will catch
their death of cold if we do.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry off to our lodgings.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Right. Master Gregory
arrived ahead of us.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
He'll be here to pick
us up any minute now.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
I hope I haven't
kept you waiting.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
It took quite a bit of time
to find a rental car

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
that could fit everyone.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
[DINA]
Hmph.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh?

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
[BRIAN]
Welcome, Sir Camelot!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
Everybody. Allow me to
introduce our host, Brian.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
He's the upstanding
son of an old friend.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
The moment he heard I
was coming to Australia,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
he insisted I stop
by for a spell.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
This, is my unworthy appren--

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to meet ya,
mister Hoshisato!

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
Bloody oath, mate. Feel free
to make yourselves at home!

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you for having us.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts]

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
Come in, the door's open.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
Master Gregory!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
What have we here?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
Fresh off the plane and you're
already hard at work again.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I have to keep at
it if I wanna master it.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
If only Mamoru
possessed a fraction

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
of the diligence you have.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
I know! I'll grant you a reward!

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
How's that sound?

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
Something you'd enjoy, like
showing you my best trick!

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
 Oh, wow, would you really?

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Yes. Watch closely, now.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
Muscle Magic!

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO yelps]

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
Ta-da.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
Impressive.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
The best trick
I have up my sleeve,

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
or should I say what
used to be my sleeve,

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
requires this lovely dove.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
Were you expecting
something so classic?

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
Honestly? Not at all. He, he.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
Oh! Because this
particular magic trick

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
was the first I ever learned,

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
it was also the one that
gave me the hardest time. Heh!

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
 However, I still
practiced it every day,

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
and eventually,
I performed it on stage!

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
Fairly soon I realized it wasn't
as difficult as it used to be.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
That realization gave
me a confidence boost

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
that stuck with
me my whole life.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
Ooh! Ahh!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO yelps]

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.973 position:50% align:center
The more you practice,
the better you get.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
So what was once my
worst trick is now my best.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
Although magic is
something we show to others,

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
its true essence lies
in what remains unseen.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
Not just in terms
of misdirection,

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
but in the countless hours of
practice no one considers.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
Perhaps... I've already
given away too much.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
What say you? Did you find
this lesson informative?

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
It's pretty evident
at this point.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
One of the Artifacts
we need is there.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
You sure? It's at a warehouse?

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem right considering
the large entrance

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
required for moving cargo.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
We scoped out what
seems like an entrance,

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
but only two people used
it in the past seven days.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
Very suspicious.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Yeah.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
I'll check it out.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI] It's far too
dangerous, mademoiselle.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
Someone as beautiful as you
should not be someplace as 

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
treacherous as that by yourself.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
Meaning you...?

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI]
Will be coming with you, yes!

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
I'm certain the two of us
will make a great team.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Uh...

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI]
So, how 'bout it?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
Why don't we go somewhere
more private to strategi--

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Daddy!

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI, MARIAH gasp]

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
Do you seriously have to hit
on every woman with a pulse?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
We both know that she's
just gonna reject you!

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get
an idea like that?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
I wasn't thinking about
how sexy Mariah is,

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of her safety!

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
Were you also thinking of Mom?

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
Fine, point taken!
Please don't tell your mother!

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Hmph. Y'know, if I actually
cared about you, I might.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI]
You don't care about me?

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
More importantly.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
Someone explain
what she's doing here.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
Jeeves, every cup of tea you
make is truly remarkable

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.902 position:50% align:center
in every way.

00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
Thank you, my lady.
Your words flatter me.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
I don't like this one bit.
Smells fishy.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Like the distinct scent
of someone plotting

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
to betray you yet again.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
But we aren't.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Mm?

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
Tomiko didn't come just
for a cup of tea.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
She's here to look after the
mansion in my stead.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
Multiple organizations
of the hostile variety

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
have joined together.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
They've been lying in wait for
Mamoru and Maeve to leave 

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
their home, which means they
could launch an attack any day.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
They can throw whatever
they want at me.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
It won't matter in the end.
I'll take them all down.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah? How?

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
I can't get over how
yummy this tea is.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Don't ignore me
when I'm talking to you!

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
Stop stressing.
I promise she's on our side.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
So get used to it.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
She speaks the truth!

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know I received a
formal invitation to be here.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
If it's for my Jeeves, then it's
Tomi-Tomi to the rescue.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:51.174 position:50% align:center
I am so terribly grateful.
If only you knew how much.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Whoa.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Mm.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]
Oh! Wasn't expecting company.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
What are you doing up so early?

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
My body felt like it
was time to be awake,

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd go for a walk.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.818 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Just wondering.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
But is there something
on your mind?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Kinda.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
I was trying to come up
with a finishing move.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.534 position:50% align:center
What? You mean,
like, in fighting?

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It got brought up
in a conversation I had

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
with Ema last night.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
You know, Lady Kana.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
Becoming a professional
master thief

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
requires you to invent some
sort of finishing move.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
Geez.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
There you go again, acting like
I'm the heroine of a manga.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
I'm serious.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
Even Lady Maeve developed
a maneuver like that.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Oh, no way!

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
It's a top-secret move
she only resorts to using

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
when she absolutely has to.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
And it can mean the difference
between life and death.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] I think Ema
might be onto something.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh?

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
Sounds cool. You should do it.

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
And now you're up to speed.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
A finishing move, huh?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
What's your take on it, Makoto?

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
My take? I kinda agree
with your sister.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
A move like that would be
awesome and heroic.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I know, right?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
That's settles it!

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely coming
up with a finishing--

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
[KANA sneezes]

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
It... won't be a sneeze.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
I'll help you think of a move
once we get back home to Japan.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Mm-hm.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
Don't stay outside in
your PJs for too long.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
You'll catch cold.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Oh...! Uh. Mm-hm.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.282 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Looks like it's almost time.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
Then we should go ahead
and proceed as planned.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
Even if it means you're alone.

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Right.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
No offense, Masayoshi,
but you would slow me down.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
Well, Jeeves.
You and Tomiko take care.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA]
Don't you worry, honey.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
We'll be just fine.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
Jeeves and I have the
power of love on our side,

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
and nothing in existence
can beat that.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH chuckles] I certainly
hope so. See you later.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
Lady Mariah.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
I pray you return without
so much as a scratch.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.
Is that genuine concern?

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
It's different now. I'm not
like I was when I was a child.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
Kokomi. I can't have you
getting involved in this mission

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
any further than
you already are.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
So be a good girl
and go home, okay?

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
I know, Daddy. I'm not dumb.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
You'd better be
careful out there.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
[MASAYOSHI]
Hm? Ah, it isn't a big deal.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
I'm used to this kind of thing.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
And if it does get a
little hairy, I'm still good.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Hmph. Don't overuse it, okay?

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
For everybody's sake.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
No one should have to
look at your bald head

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
'cause you ignored
that thing's toll.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.035 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Jeeves is worried
that I might get hurt? Please.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
That's one of the silliest
things I've heard in a while.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] I'm not some
helpless little kid, 

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
desperately chasing
after her big sister

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
for fear of getting left behind.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
I've grown up.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Lady Tominozawa. They're here.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
Our unwanted,
yet anticipated guests.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
Oh? Whaddaya say,
my lovey-dovey butler-boo?

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Let's go give them a
proper welcome, yes?

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] The eastern rear
gate will be the best place

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
to receive them.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
Consider it done.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what's that?

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKER B]
What, a guard?

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKERS shout]

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA]
I come to greet you

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
and you can't even
stand on ceremony?

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
Oh, goody. I was worried
this wouldn't be fun.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA chuckles]

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKERS grunting]

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA] You naughty boys
have no manners, do you?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
Maybe a nice, hard spanking
will instill some etiquette!

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKER grunt, shout]

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA chuckles] This is
the elegant magic of Tomi-Tomi.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
And even grade-schoolers
know that gunfire

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
isn't what's most
effective against paper.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
Send in the scepters.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKERS grunt]

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
This is quite a surprise.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
I wasn't expecting you to have
Brass Scepters at your disposal.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
You've certainly gone to
great lengths to break down

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
these doors, even preparing some
Artifacts you'll undoubtedly 

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
misuse right before our eyes.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
[ATTACKERS grunt]

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
Such a pity. All that time
and energy you spent

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
planning this attack
will be in vain.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
You fiends!

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
Ready yourselves for
a sound thrashing!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
I promise. I will make it hurt
as much as I possibly can.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
My current master abhors
people like you.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
People who would use their
Artifacts for murder!

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
This is on her behalf!

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] It looks like some
kind of research facility.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
Being able to get in
undetected is great,

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
but it's less fun if they
don't know it's me.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center

No. It's a good imitation,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
but that's all it is.

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
Are these idiots really
trying to manufacture

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
their own Artifacts?
How pathetic.

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
It's unacceptable.
Absolutely unacceptable!

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
I had every intention of
remaining undetected

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
during this mission--
but change of plans!

[GANG BOSS] Huh? The butler
turned into a beefcake?

You're talkin' crazy, man!

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Is there some kind of problem?

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
[GANG BOSS] Got the guys I sent
to raid the Hoshisato place

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
on the phone. They're gettin'
their butts handed to them!

[OLD MAN]
Hm...

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
Masayoshi Kikyouin.
To what do we owe this honor?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd drop by
and say hey.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Plus, I wanted to see
the looks on your faces.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
Because what I'm about
to tell you gentlemen,

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
may come as a bit of a shock.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
As soon as I learned your
little group was targeting

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
the Hoshisato mansion,
I made plans to oppose you.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
[IT COMPANY PRESIDENT]
You've got some nerve.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. But wait,
it gets better!

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
I just received a call
from my associate.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
That research lab you have?
You know the one.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
Apparently, something awful
happened to it.

[OLD MAN]
Kikyouin.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
If your reason for being
here was to gloat,

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
then you are an utter fool.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
You've got it all wrong.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
I'm way too busy
for that nonsense.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
I'm here because you're
gonna give me some info.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
Nothing much,

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
just where I can find the
Ring of the Thunder God.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
I've heard its name
is more impressive

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
than the Artifact itself.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
So your lives are
definitely more valuable,

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
at least in this case.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
If we actually dignified
threats with a response,

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't be the
men we are today.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
You don't have to respond.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
You can sit there nice and
quiet and let me do the rest!

Looky here!

It's not at your mansion,
it's at your side piece's place,

If you're wondering,

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
these sunglasses are
more than just stylish.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
They can read people's minds.

Well unless they

Old man.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
You've been in the
business for this long

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
and you still haven't
grasped what's happening?

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
You had a whole bunch
of bodyguards earlier.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
Emphasis on the word "earlier,"
if you catch my drift.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
Now that you know
where things stand,

I think it's time we
got down to business.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
And let's not forget.
I have this.

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
So if you lie to me,

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
you'll only make yourself
look more stupid.

[gasps]

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
I rushed back because I
thought you might need

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
some assistance
guarding this place.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
I guess I was
worried for nothing.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
I simply asked our
uninvited guests 

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
to leave and they did
just as I requested.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.945 position:50% align:center
Yes, I have no doubt they did.

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
So. How did you fare in
your task this evening?

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
I did all right.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH chuckles]

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
Oh! This does bring
back memories.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
It's been a very long
time since I've seen

the Glyph of the Wind God.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
Ah, but where are my manners?

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
I nearly forgot to greet
you upon your return.

[MARIAH]
Huh?

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, Lady Mariah.

I take it?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] After Masayoshi engaged
in a friendly negotiation,

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
they were happy to
hand over the Artifact.

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Really?

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
He does have a "friendly"
way about him.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] The only casualties
suffered were some strands

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
of Masayoshi's hair,
but he'll recover.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
You'd think he was a little girl
from the way he was crying 

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
about it, though.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU laughs] I'll send
him a grow-hair-soon card

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
to convey my condolences.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
On a more serious note,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
we'll get to work on our
end of this mission.

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center

Hm?

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
Mariah and her
team have obtained

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
the Ring of the Thunder God,

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:46.598 position:50% align:center
and they snagged the
Glyph of the Wind God, too.

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
What? But how?

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI, MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
With the same
skill and precision 

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
we'll need when the time comes.

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Because it's not over yet.

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
It sure isn't!
