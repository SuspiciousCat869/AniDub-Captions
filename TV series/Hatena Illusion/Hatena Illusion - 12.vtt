00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:14.500 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Don't try it.

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle
You'll just wind
up getting hurt.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.708 align:middle
If you hand over your
Artifact to me, nice and easy,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle
I'll let you walk away with
your life still intact.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.583 align:middle
In your dreams!

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle
Though I don't know
what's going on,

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.875 align:middle
I do know we can't trust
anything she tells us.

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.042 align:middle
[MICHELLE] Children should
respect and obey their elders.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:34.833 align:middle
If you deserved it, I would!

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle
I am truly astounded by
how annoying you are.

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:42.458 align:middle
Well, how about we
make a trade instead?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.542 align:middle
The Bow of the Earth God!

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:45.917 align:middle
[MAKOTO grunts]
What the...?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.667 align:middle
[DINA grunts]

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.333 align:middle
[MAKOTO shouts]

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.417 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Defiant little children...

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.375 align:middle
...should be properly
disciplined.

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:32.958 align:middle
[DINA]
Makoto.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.333 align:middle
Are you all right?

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.958 align:middle
I'm fine. Run away!

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:41.125 align:middle
[MICHELLE] If you value
your girlfriend's life,

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.917 align:middle
then you better tell me
your Artifact's true name.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.042 align:middle
You're not going to
hurt either one of us!

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.958 align:middle
Please, stop it. Just go.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.417 align:middle
You're as ignorant
as he is sassy.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.667 align:middle
And though I admittedly hate
sassy kids with a passion,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.042 align:middle
kids who happen
to be ignorant...

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.875 align:middle
...are the most loathsome
creatures of all!

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.917 align:middle
[MAKOTO, DINA grunting]

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.333 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Hold on as tight as you can!

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle
Dina!

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.958 align:middle
[DINA grunts]

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:16.417 align:middle
Just how many Artifacts
do you have?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.125 align:middle
I'll be taking that
one as well!

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle
You can either be
target practice,

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.792 align:middle
or surrender your
second Artifact

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.083 align:middle
and divulge both of
their true names.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:27.458 align:middle
Fine, I will.

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:30.375 align:middle
I'll hand it over, then I'll
tell you its true name.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.708 align:middle
But only if you agree
to let Dina go!

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:34.417 align:middle
That's not fair!

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle
I see you're finally
thinking logically.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
I won't have long to act.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle
It might only take
her one glance

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.667 align:middle
to realize this
isn't an Artifact.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.792 align:middle
So the moment I give it to her,
I'll take Smile Stick back,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:53.417 align:middle
and teleport Dina somewhere
far away from here!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle
I may not survive,
but at least she will.

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.333 align:middle
Hold it.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.625 align:middle
Set it down there.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.875 align:middle
[grunts]
Okay.

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:10.833 align:middle
[MAKOTO grunts]
Now return to me, Smile Sti--!

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.542 align:middle
[MAKOTO shouts]

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle
Oh, no!

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle
Oh, you poor thing.

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.542 align:middle
I don't know what other tricks
you may or may not

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.375 align:middle
have up your sleeve,

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:22.042 align:middle
but before anything
else happens, 

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.625 align:middle
you're going to comply and tell
me the true name of your wand.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:27.083 align:middle
[MAKOTO whimpers]

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.667 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Well?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.708 align:middle
Its name is, uh...

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.208 align:middle
[grunts]

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:37.458 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:48.083 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:52.958 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Hatena?

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.625 align:middle
[MICHELLE gasps]

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.375 align:middle
So you did this?

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:04.125 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Is that power and light

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.458 align:middle
emanating from her Artifact?

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.333 align:middle
I asked you a question.

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.208 align:middle
Are you the one
that hurt Makoto?

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:14.458 align:middle
Who cares?
What does it matter, huh?

00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:15.708 align:middle
Fire!

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle
[GAUGAU growls]

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.542 align:middle
[UNDERLINGS shout]

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.792 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Tsk!

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.667 align:middle
Hatena, please, be careful!

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.292 align:middle
Let's go, Findabair. Draíocht.

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle
You lowlife.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle
By abusing Artifacts,
you've made others suffer.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:44.583 align:middle
You'll pay... for everything!

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.167 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
I think I've heard enough!

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.458 align:middle
I'll blow you away!

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.833 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:55.792 align:middle
What's going on exactly?

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.875 align:middle
Is this power
coming from Muffy...

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958 align:middle
...or Hatena?

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:05.833 align:middle
How dare you... harm my partner!

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:13.125 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Impossible...

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.125 align:middle
[shouts]

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.917 align:middle
Hatena, no! Wait!

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:32.333 align:middle
[KANA] The master thief Hatena
may steal from people,

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle
but she doesn't kill them.

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.917 align:middle
'Cause her Mama taught
her better than that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.958 align:middle
[UNDERLINGS gasping, shouting]

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.083 align:middle
[footsteps]

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle
[MAKOTO sighs]

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:51.042 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Safe to say it's over now.

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:54.417 align:middle
So give us the Bow of the Earth
God without any fuss.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.458 align:middle
[MICHELLE giggles, laughs]

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.375 align:middle
That scarf is fantastic.

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.583 align:middle
Though most things made by
Maeve Hoshisato usually are.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:13.833 align:middle
[MAKOTO, KANA grunt]

00:07:17.417 --> 00:07:19.375 align:middle
[laughs]

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:22.083 align:middle
Got too cocky for your
own good, didn't you?

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:27.125 align:middle
[MICHELLE] I'm gonna kill you
right here, right now.

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.625 align:middle
Then I'll take that amazing
Artifact of yours!

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:33.125 align:middle
Even if you don't tell me its
true name, somebody else will!

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:35.667 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
That's not gonna happen.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle
Why's that?

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.708 align:middle
[MAKOTO] My Smile Stick works
just fine inside your barrier.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.208 align:middle
Nullification magic
can't affect it.

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:47.125 align:middle
And that's only one of the
many abilities it has!

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle
Ha! Right. I'm sure.

00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:53.417 align:middle
[MAKOTO] You don't believe me,
but that'll be your downfall.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.083 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Sit tight, Hatena.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:57.625 align:middle
A few more seconds,
and this'll all be over.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle
And, Dina? Once we get home,

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle
I'll show you the magic
trick I've been saving.

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.208 align:middle
The one even you're
incapable of doing.

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.917 align:middle
[KANA]
Makoto...

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.333 align:middle
It's show time, everyone!

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:11.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:16.125 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:17.708 align:middle
Matter transformation!

00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:19.792 align:middle
It'll explode on you
if you fire it!

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:21.042 align:middle
[MICHELLE grunts]

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:25.208 align:middle
[EMA shouts]

00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:26.458 align:middle
[groans]

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:31.833 align:middle
My apologies for the wait.

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.917 align:middle
Are you guys okay?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.917 align:middle
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle
Oh, thank God. You're alive!

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.958 align:middle
Of course I am.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle
[KANA]
Thank goodness!

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.333 align:middle
[EMA]
Careful, my ladies.

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:46.208 align:middle
If you hug Master
Makoto too hard,

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.333 align:middle
you might wind up squeezing out
what little life he has left.

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle
[KANA] Sorry! I forgot
how hurt you are!

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:54.458 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Nah, it's fine.

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:56.875 align:middle
Who knew Smile Stick
had a power like that?

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle
But boy am I glad it does,

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:00.458 align:middle
since it certainly worked
out in our favor!

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:03.167 align:middle
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Guess I fooled you, too.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.708 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:07.542 align:middle
[DINA] What sort of name is
"matter transformation" anyway?

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle
If she had tried to shoot you...

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle
...you'd be six feet
underground mate.

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:16.083 align:middle
[KANA yelps]

00:09:16.167 --> 00:09:19.292 align:middle
[chuckles]
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:21.625 align:middle
You would pick up on a
sleight of hand like that.

00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:23.917 align:middle
I appreciate you
playing along, though.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle
Lucky for you,
it actually worked.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle
You looked,
dare I say, impressive.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.708 align:middle
Well, you two sure are friendly.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle
[gasps] Sorry if this comes
across as rude, Dina,

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:37.833 align:middle
but I think your
chest got bigger!

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:40.625 align:middle
[EMA] I assumed this might be
the case for quite some time.

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:44.208 align:middle
I also assume this possibility
never once crossed your mind,

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.583 align:middle
did it Lady Kana?

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:47.875 align:middle
But Dina is, in fact, a female.

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.083 align:middle
[KANA gasps]

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.833 align:middle
Geez, Sis. You're dense.

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.833 align:middle
Y'know, I just found out
a bit earlier, myself.

00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:55.792 align:middle
[DINA]
Hmph.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle
[KANA]
What?!

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.167 align:middle
[MAMORU]
If it's all the same,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle
I'll be taking the Artifacts
that you stole.

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:07.917 align:middle
No hard feelings, right?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.167 align:middle
Uh!

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:15.292 align:middle
Thank you, lad, for keeping
Dina safe during such chaos.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.833 align:middle
If anyone's grateful, it's me.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle
Having her by my
side helped a lot.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:21.583 align:middle
[KANA]
Dina is really a girl,

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.458 align:middle
and she spent the whole
night with Makoto!

00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle
[KANA whines]

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:29.583 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
She okay?!

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:31.125 align:middle
I believe she'll be fine,

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.417 align:middle
though it does appear she's had
far more than she can take.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle
Oh, not again.

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:38.958 align:middle
My sweet baby girl.
You shouldn't get so worked up.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.458 align:middle
Hey, everybody! Nice flight?

00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle
[KANA]
Kokomi!

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.875 align:middle
You're not gonna believe
what I'm about to say.

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle
It turns out that Dina
is actually a girl!

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:52.917 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle
I know!

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:57.667 align:middle
Oh, wow. You mean you're
just now finding that out?

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.042 align:middle
Why, though? Why would you dress
like a boy in the first place?

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:02.208 align:middle
[DINA]
Because.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:03.833 align:middle
I wanted to become
my uncle's apprentice,

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:05.333 align:middle
but he only takes on boys.

00:11:05.417 --> 00:11:07.917 align:middle
Wish I'd been aware of
such a fun fact about me.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.667 align:middle
[DINA gasps]
Don't pretend it's not true!

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.667 align:middle
I've heard you say
girls were no good!

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.958 align:middle
That honestly doesn't sound
like something I'd say.

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.833 align:middle
You liar!

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle
[grunts nervously]

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.208 align:middle
Now, now. As exciting
as all this is,

00:11:22.292 --> 00:11:24.458 align:middle
it might be best kept
for later, m'kay?

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:28.458 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Let's go, Hatena.
And don't look so bummed, Dina.

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:40.083 align:middle
Okay, transport these three
items to Lároutir Village!

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:47.083 align:middle
That's that. I don't see why
Maeve wouldn't be released now.

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle
Did you hear that?

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.875 align:middle
Finally!

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.167 align:middle
Mama's really coming home!

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle
[MAKOTO] At least, she was
supposed to come home.

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:00.833 align:middle
Activate Solais!

00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:03.292 align:middle
[yells]

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.542 align:middle
That was a fairly
decent attack, Lady Kana.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:10.167 align:middle
[grunts]

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle
[DINA] Why aren't you practicing
with your Artifact, too?

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:16.667 align:middle
Well, I'd rather not
depend on it too much.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.417 align:middle
I wanna be an accomplished
magician using my own abilities,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.292 align:middle
just like Master Gregory.

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:23.667 align:middle
That so? I suppose
you really are worthy

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.208 align:middle
to be the junior
apprentice under me.

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle
[MORRIGAN chuckles]

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.833 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Before we knew it,
summer had arrived.

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle
[SEI]
Hey, bro!

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.125 align:middle
What's up? Are you
behaving yourself?

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:43.667 align:middle
You bet I am!
Are you doing the same?

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.167 align:middle
[MAKOTO laughs]
Trying to.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.292 align:middle
Hi, hun. How's school going?
You getting along all right?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle
Yeah. Loving every minute of it.

00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:55.917 align:middle
The girls definitely
outnumber the boys, 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.417 align:middle
but it's not too bad.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle
In fact, I think it's what
brought all the guys in my class

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.167 align:middle
closer together.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.625 align:middle
You know,

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:06.167 align:middle
we'd love it if you brought
everyone for a visit soon.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.542 align:middle
Okay.

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.208 align:middle
I'll try to bring it up once
Miss Maeve is back home.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Even though...
I have no idea when that'll be.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:18.667 align:middle
[KANA]
Makoto!

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.833 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Uh?

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:21.458 align:middle
[KANA] We got a letter
from the village!

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:26.375 align:middle
[JEEVES] It's a message from
none other than Lady Morrigan.

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle
It says we must obtain yet
another Artifact she specifies.

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle
Huh.

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:36.292 align:middle
This is endless. Think she'll
ever let Momma come back home?

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle
We have no choice, right? Right?

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:46.208 align:middle
Um... Right!

00:13:49.042 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle
[YUMEMI] Security has been
completely shut down.

00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:53.667 align:middle
Gaugau will lead
the way for you.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.708 align:middle
Thanks, Sis, you rule.
Seriously!

00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:59.083 align:middle
Let's go, partner.

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:00.458 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm!

00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:08.875 align:middle
[KANA]
Is that it, Gaugau?

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.208 align:middle
[GAUGAU]
Hm!

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:11.958 align:middle
[KANA] Do you mind disengaging
the alarm for us?

00:14:12.042 --> 00:14:13.208 align:middle
Gau!

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle
[KANA]
Yep, that's Mother's crest.

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:17.583 align:middle
Bingo!

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:18.833 align:middle
Muffy!

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.875 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Nice! Let's snag it.

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.583 align:middle
[KANA]
Wait!

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.792 align:middle
I've made it my mission
to steal sadness away

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:31.667 align:middle
in the blink of an eye!
That prize is mine!

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.083 align:middle
'Cause the Master Thief
Hatena aims to win!

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.625 align:middle
Now you say something!

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.833 align:middle
Why? Who are you
even talking to?

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle
You're missing the point!

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.792 align:middle
It's just the Master
Thief Hatena's way!

00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle
All right, fine!

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:45.417 align:middle
I am also here to
steal sadness away!

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.583 align:middle
I'm Makoto the Magnificent.

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:52.708 align:middle
[KANA groans]
I guess that'll have to do.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:53.708 align:middle
[MAKOTO sighs]

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.458 align:middle
[KANA grunts]
And... it's ours!

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:56.667 align:middle
That was easy!

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.917 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:58.333 --> 00:14:59.625 align:middle
[KANA gasps]

00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:00.875 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Look out!

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.583 align:middle
[KANA gasps]
What's that?

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.708 align:middle
[KANA yelps]

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:12.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.125 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
I'll save you!

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:14.375 align:middle
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle
What the...?

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:24.083 align:middle
[KANA]
Huh?

00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:25.625 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Let her go dammit!

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:27.292 align:middle
[GAUGAU growls]

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle
Oh, no! That thing
is strangling her!

00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle
[MORRIGAN] If you'd like
experience having your 

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:42.958 align:middle
head cut off,
stay just like that.

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.083 align:middle
Crushing you is another option,

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:48.083 align:middle
or perhaps you would prefer
it if I blew you to smithereens!

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:51.042 align:middle
You're the one who did this.
Let her out of there!

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle
Learn your place, boy!

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.167 align:middle
So brash.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.042 align:middle
[yells]

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.167 align:middle
Stop it!

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.708 align:middle
Something wrong?

00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:04.417 align:middle
This might be a good time to
call out the power of Findabair,

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.667 align:middle
like you did before.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.417 align:middle
[grunts]

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.333 align:middle
Let's go, Smile Stick!

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:14.667 align:middle
What the, why aren't
you working?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.083 align:middle
Gaugau, too?

00:16:17.167 --> 00:16:19.792 align:middle
You nullified our Artifacts,
didn't you?

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:22.792 align:middle
You're moments away
from a crash course lesson

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.958 align:middle
about what happens to
people who get wrapped up

00:16:25.042 --> 00:16:26.833 align:middle
in the world of Artifacts!

00:16:26.917 --> 00:16:31.792 align:middle
[screams]

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:33.375 align:middle
Let her go!

00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:35.042 align:middle
Right now!

00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:37.583 align:middle
That's enough!
You're hurting her!

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:43.042 align:middle
I'll do anything!
Please just stop it.

00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:45.167 align:middle
[MAEVE]
I'm with Makoto on this one.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.417 align:middle
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:55.875 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Miss Maeve!
And Miss Mariah!

[grunts]

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:00.542 align:middle
You're being much
too stern, Mother.

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:02.667 align:middle
She's your own flesh and blood.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.042 align:middle
[MAKOTO, KANA gasp]

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.417 align:middle
[MORRIGAN chuckles]

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:14.625 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Wait, you're--!

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.792 align:middle
I might listen to you
if I acknowledged you.

00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:24.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:26.083 align:middle
Perhaps.

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:29.625 align:middle
But the fact still remains she's
your granddaughter, Mother.

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.708 align:middle
It's been awhile, Lady Morrigan.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.375 align:middle
You think you'll stand a chance
if you band together against me?

00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle
[MAMORU]
That's a very good question.

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.125 align:middle
Especially since you're
most likely a duplicate

00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:50.708 align:middle
made by an Artifact.

00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:51.958 align:middle
Huh.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:54.958 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:57.375 align:middle
Only one way to find out!

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.583 align:middle
[grunts]

00:18:02.292 --> 00:18:04.833 align:middle
[MARIAH grunts]

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.083 align:middle
[MORRIGAN]
Hm!

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.542 align:middle
[KANA grunts]

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle
Hatena!

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:14.125 align:middle
Hey! Don't move if you're hurt!

00:18:18.083 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle
[KANA]
Grandmother.

00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:23.917 align:middle
You're here to show me how
inexperienced I am, right?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.625 align:middle
To show me how much further
I still have to go.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.208 align:middle
It's true.

00:18:30.292 --> 00:18:34.167 align:middle
Just because I was able to draw
out a little of Muffy's power,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.333 align:middle
I may have gotten a
momentary ego boost.

00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:42.542 align:middle
[KANA] And compared
to people like Mama.

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:47.667 align:middle
Or Auntie, or Papa,
or Ema, or Jeeves...

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.958 align:middle
...I don't even hold a candle!

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:51.375 align:middle
[KANA grunts]

00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:58.417 align:middle
[KANA] But, I fully intend
to get stronger every day!

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.125 align:middle
And eventually...
we'll be equals!

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.625 align:middle
Oh?

00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:06.833 align:middle
[KANA]
That's right!

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle
Because I am the proud
daughter of Maeve!

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:13.167 align:middle
The Master Thief, Hatena!

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.625 align:middle
Kana...

00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:16.542 align:middle
[KANA]
And, not only that,

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle
I also have my dependable
little sister.

00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle
Not to mention, the single best
partner ever, right, Makoto?

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle
[MAKOTO chuckles]

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:31.708 align:middle
[MORRIGAN laughs]

00:19:31.792 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle
[MORRIGAN laughs] You're going
to get stronger because

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:35.833 align:middle
you have others to support you?

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:37.167 align:middle
[shouts]

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle
[KANA shouts]

00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:43.375 align:middle
An ambition like that
is purely juvenile!

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:44.833 align:middle
[KANA grunts]

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.167 align:middle
[MORRIGAN growls]

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:50.667 align:middle
[grunts]

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.917 align:middle
[growling continues]

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.292 align:middle
[MAMORU]
I disagree.

00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:59.458 align:middle
Valuing others' support
isn't childish. Not at all.

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:02.667 align:middle
Though it might not sound
convincing coming from me.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.583 align:middle
[grunts]

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle
[MORRIGAN] Heh. Is being
forced to witness your

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:17.167 align:middle
family melodrama some
kind of punishment?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.167 align:middle
[MORRIGAN] I'm curious what
your intentions are, Mariah.

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:26.042 align:middle
So you choose to side
with them too?

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.958 align:middle
I pray that the Star's guidance

00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:34.667 align:middle
falls upon every
last one of you.

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:46.333 align:middle
Well. It ended
just as it should.

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:48.125 align:middle
Love conquers all.

00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle
Is that a line you got
from one of your anime?

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:55.125 align:middle
It's simply a
universal principle.

00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle
Sweetheart. That was wonderful.

00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.958 align:middle
Don't forget how
you're feeling now.

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:01.792 align:middle
You're here. You're really here!

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:02.792 align:middle
[MAEVE chuckles]

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle
[YUMEMI]
Mom!

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:07.417 align:middle
Ah... I made it.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.708 align:middle
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle
I'm also sorry if my
absence made you sad.

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle
[KANA]
Mm-mm. It wasn't your fault.

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:21.125 align:middle
Hope you know... you've got
some catching up to do.

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:23.458 align:middle
A lot happened while
you were gone.

00:21:23.542 --> 00:21:24.542 align:middle
[MAEVE]
Mm...

00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:27.042 align:middle
Welcome home, my lady.

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:32.083 align:middle
Ema. Thank you for
all you've done.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.625 align:middle
It's my pleasure.

00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:35.417 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.958 align:middle
And Makoto! You managed
to keep your promise.

00:21:40.042 --> 00:21:42.708 align:middle
Thank you for
protecting everyone.

00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:44.833 align:middle
Uh! No prob.

00:21:44.917 --> 00:21:46.708 align:middle
I should be thanking you, too.

00:21:46.792 --> 00:21:48.292 align:middle
'Scuze me?

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:50.458 align:middle
I'll have you know that while
you were away doing whatever,

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.083 align:middle
I made sure these kids were--

00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:54.083 align:middle
Well taken care of, right?

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:55.958 align:middle
Leave me alone, okay?

00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:57.042 align:middle
[MAMORU laughs]

00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:59.958 align:middle
[ALL laugh]

00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:01.708 align:middle
[MARIAH]
Oh, whatever!

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
At last, the Hoshisato household

00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle
got some long awaited peace.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle
Good morning everyone.
Did you sleep well?

00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:28.625 align:middle
I know I did! Ha, ha!

00:22:28.708 --> 00:22:29.875 align:middle
[MAMORU, MAEVE]
Good morning.

00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.417 align:middle
[YUMEMI]
Ugh. Morning.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.917 align:middle
Wow. You look so nice!

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.042 align:middle
[MAMORU, MAKOTO]
Mm-hm!

00:22:37.125 --> 00:22:38.458 align:middle
[giggles]

00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:39.417 align:middle
[KANA, MAKOTO]
We're off!

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.958 align:middle
[MAEVE]
Take care!

00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:45.708 align:middle
I can't believe how
much they've grown.

00:22:45.792 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle
Same here.

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:49.875 align:middle
What Kana spoke about
that fateful night,

00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:52.875 align:middle
may be a whole lot closer
than any of us thought.

00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle
[DINA]
Ha! Illusion...!

00:22:58.458 --> 00:22:59.833 align:middle
[GREGORY]
Just curious.

00:22:59.917 --> 00:23:02.542 align:middle
But would you like to start
attending school as well?

00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:03.792 align:middle
Huh?

00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:06.333 align:middle
You'd pull off a girl's
uniform quite nicely.

00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:09.417 align:middle
You wretched old creeper!

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.458 align:middle
Hey Makoto. I'll try
my best regardless,

00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:15.208 align:middle
but it'd be nice if I
had some kinda reward.

00:23:15.292 --> 00:23:16.458 align:middle
Sure whatcha thinkin'?

00:23:16.542 --> 00:23:19.875 align:middle
Don't give in so easily!
You're gonna spoil her!

00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:21.667 align:middle
Come on, let's go!

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.042 align:middle
[MAKOTO gasps]
What's gotten into you, Hatena?

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle
It's just...

00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:30.208 align:middle
...Partners should
stick together, shouldn't they?

00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:34.458 align:middle
[GAUGAU]
Gau... gau!

00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:36.917 align:middle
Gau, gau! Gau, gau!

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.458 align:middle
Gau...
