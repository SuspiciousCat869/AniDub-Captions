00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
We solve the problem
by taking the bear!

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
Hey. There's an
open window. Weird.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Does this mean...

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
...someone else
already snuck inside?

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Keep it movin', partner.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Why are schools
so creepy at night?

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
Speaking of creepy,

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
you think that window was
open because of the monster?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
This is a heist,
not a test of courage!

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
Nothing's scary.
Everything's fine.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
Gotta power through
for my little sister!

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
I found it! It has to be.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
Looks like Gaugau's
backwater cousin.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.209 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
And it's locked.

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Hm! Good thing you have
a master thief at your side!

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Muffy, go! Unlock!

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
That's awesome.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
I'm good at making the
impossible possible.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
Makoto? Thank you.
I mean for everything.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
How could I call
myself your partner

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
if I didn't have your back?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
[thudding]

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU growls]

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
Something's here!

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU gowls]

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
[KANA yelps]

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU]
Gau. Gau.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
Gaugau?

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Oh crap!

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
[sirens buzzing]

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
Never seen a school with
such high-tech security.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
And I know where it came from!

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
I forgot about
it until just now.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Once they knew their kids
were going to school here,

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
Father and Mr. Kikyouin
installed this stuff.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] There's no need
for either of you to worry.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
I disabled the system so
it won't send any alerts.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
That you, Sis?

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I'm delighted to
report we've captured

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
your first official
theft on video.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
For posterity.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
Ema, too?

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
I am present as well.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
And I'd like you to
accompany Gaugau

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
back to the mansion immediately.
The lecture I have in store

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
is going to last well
past your bedtime.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
[KANA, MAKOTO]
Right.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
I had it planned out.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
Tonight, Gaugau was gonna
get the clay bear back.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
I even did a
preliminary investigation.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So Gaugau was the "monster"

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
that started up those rumors?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
I wish you'd have
left this alone.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Is the real reason you
chose to stop attending

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
school because of
this clay creature?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
That's what we thought.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
We wanted to help!

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
So we... Well--

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
I know you were only doing it

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center
because you were
worried about me.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm really grateful.
That goes for both of you.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
Then, I guess there's
nothing keeping you

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
from going back to school!

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
That has nothing
to do with this.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA]
What?

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.924 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
This is why she wanted it.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Whoa.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's an Artifact?

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
Very accurate assessment.

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
So, how did it go?

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
We got it. But we still
have no clue why

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
she refuses to go
back to school.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Man. This is one tough case.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What should we do now?

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Yumemi isn't the
only one feeling down.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
Why not do something
for your partner, too?

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] Please take good care
of it while I'm gone, all right?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Mama. I wish I
wasn't such a failure.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Wonder if
Yumemi's doing alright?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Um. Gaugau? Oh, geez!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
I need to tell you something.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO yells]
Since when could he talk?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
Please don't be rude.
I'm a she, not a he!

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
My mistake. You're a
very feminine bear.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
My ability to speak is new.
I mean fresh-fresh!

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Not even Yumemi knows.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Oh. But why?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU]
She's always been introverted

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
and socially awkward.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
Think of how much harder it
would be for her to make 

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
friends if she knew
I could talk.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
I gotcha.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU] I came to you for
a very specific reason.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
'Cause she looks up to you.
So you're the one I wanna tell.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
She's been keeping it hidden,
but Yumemi inherited power

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
as a practical magician
from her Mother.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, she sees it as
more of a curse than a gift.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
She doesn't desire
the power because

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
she knows how much
her sister does.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana strives to be
like their mom, after all.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
The last thing she wants is
for her sister to be sad.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
It's heartbreaking to
see how much she cares.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
That bear.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
She ordered me to get it before
anyone realized it was magical.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
And because of me,
people found out anyway.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
No. The truth was bound
to get out eventually.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
So maybe you can
help expedite that!

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
She won't be able to hide
it if she gets much stronger.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:49.662 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Right. Makes sense.
Y'know, you're one nice bear.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
It's true, but don't tell.
It's our little secret.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I see.
That's what's going on here.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
Do we get involved?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Yes. And I have
just the thing in mind.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
What?

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
Kana?

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
Huh? Mama?

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
No way! You're here!

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I missed you so much,
my darling girl.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I had no idea you were home!

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
When did you get in?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
I have so much I want
to talk to you about!

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
Ha! My, you're energetic!

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
I suppose absence does
make the heart grow fonder.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh?

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.502 position:50% align:center
What the heck is this?
Why did Miss Maeve just melt?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
That is unfortunate.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:42.549 position:50% align:center
The radio waves must
need to be properly tuned.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
I shall go adjust it.

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Adjust what?

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Mama?

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
I should've known.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
If I whip up an Artifact
too fast, its quality suffers.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
I'll make a mental
note to fix it.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Um. Hi, Miss Maeve.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Oh, wow!
Look how much you've grown!

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
I hope that wand I repaired
for you came in handy.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure did!

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I see you've taken
excellent care of it.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
I believe you'll be able to
use it to its full potential.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I'm kind of confused.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
The "me" you see here was
produced by an Artifact.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
Thinking of it as a replica
might be easiest.

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
Bottom line is you aren't
actually here right now, huh?

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
No.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Your grandmother isn't the most
agreeable person at the moment.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
It pains me to do it, but I
had to postpone my return.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to hear that.
But, Yumemi's in trouble!

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
She quit school!

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
I know. Ema made sure
to tell me all about it.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
Don't worry I'll sit
down and have a nice,

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
long talk with your sister.

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
You're always giving your best

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
even when I'm not around
to see it with my own eyes.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
That makes me so proud.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
Yumemi? Are you awake?

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Yeah... Mom!
I don't believe it!

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
Then again, maybe I shouldn't.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I don't know why I'm
so surprised by how quickly

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
you figured it out.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
I wish I could see
you in person.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
You know that, right?

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Uh-huh. But this works for me.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Any version of you is
better than nothing at all.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
I can feel how much stronger
you've gotten in my absence.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Can you?
I've been trying to suppress it.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
My power has a way of
messing things up.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
That's to be expected.

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
You haven't learned
how to control it yet.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I can't be
there to teach you.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
But I have faith you'll be
able to handle it until I am.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
Do you really believe in me?

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] Of course.
You're my daughter after all.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling this day
was fast approaching

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
and that's a big part of
why I gave you Gaugau.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
Is it really?

00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
Your emotions can impact
your power a great deal.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.356 position:50% align:center
Artifacts made when
you're angry, for example,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
can be aggressive.
Sometimes even worse.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
You must've been fairly upset

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
when you made that
clay bear of yours.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Maybe I'm not
mature enough for this.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
You're young,

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
but you're also capable of being
levelheaded when needed.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
That's important when
you're enchanting.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
You could be like our ancestors
and take cold showers

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
or meditate before
tapping into your power.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Hard pass. I hate being cold.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
Guess I can't argue with that.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
There's one last thing I want
you to remember, 'kay?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
You can use your emotions
to your advantage,

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
so don't just bottle
them up inside.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.771 position:50% align:center
There are times when
strong feelings help

00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
and have a positive effect
on what you create.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] Is it fair to
say you like Gaugau?

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Way more than fair!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
Gau!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] Well, she's a product
of those strong emotions

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
I just told you about.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
I was thinking of you
when I made her.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
I so very much wanted
you to be happy.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
And I couldn't get
that beautiful smile

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
of yours out of my head.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU]
Gaugau.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
Aw, Gaugau. I love you!

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
Keep practicing
one day at a time.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
You won't be able to
master it right away,

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
so don't be discouraged. Deal?

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
Gaugau will be there
beside you. Makoto, too.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
Don't forget Ema and Jeeves.
They want you to succeed!

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
And, yes. You should rely
on your loving sister, too.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
Can you do that?

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm-hm. I'll try.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
We're here.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. She came.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
You had every right
to be concerned,

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
but she's doing much better now.
Isn't that right, love?

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm-hm.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
You're the best!

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps]

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
Listen up, you two.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
Yumemi's ability to
make Artifacts is a gift,

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
but it's not something you
should discuss with others.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
If the wrong person found out...

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
She would be targeted and
maybe even taken away.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.
And as sad as it may be,

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
your grandmother would be
the first one after her.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Such a shame,

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
I'm aware Lady Morrigan
Lároutir is the elder.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
However, well, frankly speaking,

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
I consider her to be
a stubborn old bat!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
Never heard that side of you.

inherited the power.

numb to my antics?

[KANA] Wait! What if I gave
the family crest to Yumemi?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
It's used for Artifacts,

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
so it's bound to help
her control her powers!

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
