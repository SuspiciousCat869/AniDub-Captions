00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.138 position:50% align:center
Yes! I will safeguard your
secrets above all else!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
For the sake of the
smiles they help create!

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Excellent answer.
You can be my apprentice.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
you may call me "Master."

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
Thanks Master!
It truly is an honor!

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Now that you'll
be living in this house,

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
please think of us
as your family.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Wait a second!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
Is he seriously going
to be living here?

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
You were rather gung-ho
when you agreed to all this.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
That was before I knew
Makoto is a boy!

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
Take it easy there, Hatena.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Don't call me Hatena!
It's Kana to you!

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
Oh. My bad, Kana.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
You sound so disrespectful!

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
I'll work on that, but I came
all this way because I really

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
want to hone my craft as
a magician, so please--

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Trust a boy to be oblivious.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
It is nearly time to make
your departure, Master.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Thank you, Jeeves.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
I leave everything in
your capable hands.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Um. Where are you going?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] It just so
happens I have business

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
to attend to overseas.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
Apologies, girls,
but it's work related.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
You understand, right?

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Hold on! If you're leaving,
then I'm coming with you!

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
Isn't there an entrance
ceremony taking place today?

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
Well. Yeah! You're not planning
on missing it, are you?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Kana.
I wish I could be there.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
But at least you won't be alone
now that you have Makoto.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
That's my number one problem!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
On that note...

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA gasp]

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
I'll see all of your smiling
faces in one month's time.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
Adios!

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
There he goes.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Levitation magic, huh?
Or illusion.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Whatever you call it,
it's amazing!

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
That's Master Hoshisato for ya!

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Forgive the delayed
introduction. This is Yumemi,

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
the younger daughter
of the Hoshisato family.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
We met when you were little,

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
but I highly doubt you remember.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Check this out, Yumemi!

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
My word. He's quite
dexterous, isn't he?

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Crimson power, hear my call.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Catch it.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
For me?

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's a token
of our friendship.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you again!

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
It's very nice.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
Lady Yumemi's smile is
a rare and splendid sight.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
Well. The cause of that
smile somewhat upsets me.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
[KANA growls] I refuse to
stand by and let that boy

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
live in this house!

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
Jeeves, surely there must be
something you can do!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you are in the
wrong here, lady Kana.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] To callously
drive someone's child

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
out into the streets before
the entrance ceremony

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
would disgrace the
Hoshisato family name.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we shall keep Master
Makoto here with us until

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
your father's return.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
Rgh. Fine then.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
He's welcome to stay,

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
but only until we can get
in touch with my parents.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
And not as a tenant,
but as a temporary guest!

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
A compromise well struck.
Quite reasonable, yes.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Hatena. I promi--

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I told you not to
call me that! Good grief!

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Everything you
need should be in there,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
though it might require
some digging since we've

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
been using the room for storage.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] This'll work.
Thanks. I appreciate it.

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Oh! You cleaned up quick
enough to impress a maid.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
I've made a mess or
two disappear before.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I'll leave some fresh
sheets for you right here.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you, Ema.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
Yes, well. I try.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
Whoa. This room has a floor.
Never would've guessed that.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Well, I don't
see what's so great

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
about cleaning a stupid room.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] It's astounding that
you did this by yourself.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
You even spruced up
the Artifacts!

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
Artifacts?

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] I'm referring to the
objects right behind you.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Should I have asked
before I touched them?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] No, you arranged them
in a magnificent manner. Bravo!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I sorted
them by type and--

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO shouts]

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Man! I'm
so sorry about that!

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
I'd like to pay for it, if
there's any way I can!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Don't bother.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
It isn't like that hunk
of junk ever worked.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
No, this simply will not do.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
You shattered a remarkably
precious item to pieces.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll do whatever it
takes to make this up to you!

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Hm. Sounds good to me,
what should he do?

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
We may not be able to
salvage the item,

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
but we could still
salvage the situation.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
The mansion is understaffed,
so what if we put him to work

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
as a butler-in-training and
allow him to use his wages

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
to pay for this mishap?
Would that be fair?

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Extremely!
Please, put me to work!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. You will
indeed work. Nicely.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Great plan,

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
except Makoto will be long
gone before he pays it off.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I second Ema's great plan.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
Whose side are you on?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
I suppose that settles it.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
As of this moment, Makoto is
officially employed here.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
[KANA shouts]

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
I must admit,

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
this is not how I pictured
your visit turning out,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
but I look forward to
working alongside you.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Same here!

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] I can't help but feel
you may have overstepped

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
a boundary.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Then you don't see what I do.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
Their reunion was intense.
Under the proper circumstances,

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
the eventual encounters that
follow will be even more so!

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
[EMA laughs] You know Lady Kana
called Makoto a prince!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
That has the makings of a
beautiful love story.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
I believe they just need a
gentle nudge to get them closer.

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
And I'll be there
to provide them

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
with all the nudges
they may need!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
Ah. Young love at
its best! Oh, yes!

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
I'm the captain and I'll
go down with this ship!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
You... should get a hobby.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Ugh! Why?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I know I said that he could
stay, but I didn't mean it!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
I can't live under the same
roof as some stupid boy!

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
I blame Father
wholeheartedly.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Momma. I could really
use you right now,

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
but you don't even bother
to give us a call.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
This place is like a
big maze. This way? Huh?

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.197 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hm?

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I'm sorry!

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO groans]

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
No! Makoto, you idiotic pervert!

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
Why does everything hurt?

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
Master Makoto,
please exercise some caution

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
when choosing your
time to bathe.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana tends to frequent
this bathroom rather often.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
Your timing is flawless, Ema.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I don't think I've ever
been so embarrassed

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
in my entire freaking life!
He definitely saw me!

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
That does it. He is outta here!

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
No way he's staying
after a stunt like that!

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
Hey. Makoto.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
It'll be all right, Hatena!

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
[growls, barks]

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunting]
Mangy mutt!

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center

He didn't hurt you, did he?

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Nah. Everything's fine.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You ended up breaking
your wand, though.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
Your safety matters a
lot more than my wand.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center

Huh? Oh, you mean it? Thank you.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
Y'know, it's almost like
I have a real-life prince!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
 Aw, you're gonna
make me blush.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You want to be like
my daddy when you grow up,

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, a magic guy--

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
A magician.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Yeah, that. He was
so cool at that show I saw!

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
And your mom,
the marvelous Miss Maeve,

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
she was great up there, too!

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You be like my dad,
and I'll be like my mom!

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
It's a plan.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
So, when you become like Miss
Maeve and I become like

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Mr. Mamoru, would you wanna
share a stage with me?

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
[KANA chuckles]

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
If we're sharing a stage,

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
then that'll make
us partners, won't it?

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You bet!

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
We'll be two of the best
partners the world's ever seen!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's a promise!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts, gasps]

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What the heck? Geez.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
[EMA] You greet the dutiful
maid who comes to wake you

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
in the morning
by screaming in terror?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
A horrid habit like that
should be scolded out of you.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Never mind. Change into this.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Um. Good morning,
Haten--I-I mean Miss Kana.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
And same goes to you, Jeeves.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Yes, good morning.
That suit truly suits you.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center
Good morning.
From the looks of things,

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
I take it you're actually going
through with the training.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Follow me, Master Makoto.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
You need to learn your
way around the mansion.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Good idea. I do
have a tendency to get lost.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
[EMA] There are a number
of rooms in the basement.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the toolshed
and smokehouse in the yard.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
If you fail to
memorize them all,

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
you will ultimately fail
at being a butler.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
If you're going to work in
this mansion, you're going

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
to need to be aware of
one last, very important fact.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens,
you can never act surprised.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
[EMA] This is the very mansion
Lady Maeve's ancestors lived in.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
It was built hundreds
of years ago,

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
yet they managed to move it
here from overseas.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
And you know what they say
about old buildings, don't you?

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Uh. That they're haunted?

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not talking
about ghosts.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
You are fully aware of who
owns this property, right?

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
Yes. Mamoru Hoshisato and
his partner, Miss Maeve--

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
the magicians of the century!

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Correct. And as such
a renowned magician,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
Master Mamoru has countless
tricks set up around the house.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Not even I know where that
mischievous man put them.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
Oh, I think I understand now.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Excellent.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
The mansion's one thing,
but the city's another.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
You'll be asked to run errands
and will need to know your way.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana. Might you be so kind
as to show him around town?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
No way! Why should I help him?

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Because you have the most
free time out of everyone.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
This mansion is incredible!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Magic one-oh-one is to
hide that which can't be hidden.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
Big mansions make
that principle easy.

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Makes sense.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
Come on. Keep up.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
Don't want you falling behind
and getting lost again.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
[NANA giggles] Hey, look!
It's the candy magician!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
How's it going?

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for what you did.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh?

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
This kind boy came to
my daughter's rescue

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
when she got lost yesterday.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
It looks like Nana
wasn't the only one

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
who found her way, though.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Luckily, everything
worked out just fine.

Huh?

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
So, are you two on a date?

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Uh! That is a definite no!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Buh-bye!

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
You could've told me the real
reason you were late yesterday.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center
Guess so, but I was lost
and would've been late

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
even before I ran into her.

enjoy your little date?

Why is everyone saying that?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
It was a joke.

she never asks anybody
to play with her.

Absolutely! Look! Here goes!

[MAKOTO] It's just some wand
I picked up from a toy store.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
I bought it right after I saw

Makoto, did our mother
make this wand for you?

No, but she fixed it
for me one time.

Made it good as new
