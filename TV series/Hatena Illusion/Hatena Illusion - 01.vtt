00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I want to come with you!

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.308 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
I appreciate the sentiment,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.519 position:50% align:center
but I'd prefer if you
steered clear of danger.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
Understand, Kana?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
Danger doesn't scare me.
I'm the Master Thief, Hatena!

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.110 position:50% align:center
That's very sweet of you.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
But there's no need
for you to rush.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
Findabair. Watch over
her for me.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
Jeeves, is everything
ready to go?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Lady Yumemi is
in control of the security.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
You may proceed at any time.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE]
Well, sounds like that's my cue.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Please be careful.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
And don't forget Makoto
will be here soon.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] Right.
There's a prize to collect.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
The master thief, Maeve,
is up to the task.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
Mama...

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
Good morning, everyone. I hope
you got a good night's rest.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES, EMA]
You as well, lady Kana.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI sighs]
Good morning.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
Would you like a beverage?

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
Coffee'd be nice.
Just black is fine.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
One coffee coming right up.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.095 position:50% align:center
Here you are.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
Bleh!

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
A little milk might help.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
Um. Thanks, Yumemi.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Kana. Do you recall
what's so special about today?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I do, father.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
My dear friend, Makoto,
will be arriving today.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
We haven't seen one
another in years.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
Oh! I can hardly wait!

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
[KANA] We'll be together
again soon. Very soon!

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
I don't remember your
friend very well.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
Makes me anxious.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't worry!

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
You were so little and
Makoto is very easygoing!

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
Things would be absolutely
perfect if mother were here.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I wonder where could she be?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
She told me that she
would be back in time

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
for the entrance ceremony.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
Man... I am so lost.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Aw, geez. At this rate,
I'm definitely gonna be late.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
[NANA sobs]

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey, what's wrong?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[NANA] I can't find my mommy.
Do you know where she is?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
I don't. To be honest,
I'm just as lost as you are.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
[NANA wails]

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
But it'll be okay!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
If you stay put, I'm sure
she'll come right back!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
You mean mommy's
gonna come here?

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know!
Hey, kiddo. Watch this!

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
[NANA gasps]
What is that?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
This... is my magic wand.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
Magic wand?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
So cool, wow!

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
Oh, sweet power, hear my call.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Huh...? Ah! It's candy!

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[NANA'S MOTHER]
Nana!

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Mommy!

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
[EMA] We have been
expecting you, Makoto Shiranui.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
You're... a maid?

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
The Hoshisato's maid,
to be precise.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
You may address me
as Ema Sakurai.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
I'm Makoto Shiranui,
but I guess you knew that.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
Still nice to make it official.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
[EMA] This way.
The master is expecting you.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
To be late on your very
first day. Quite a bold move.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
I should apologize.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Such genuine
confusion is endearing. Truly.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
Ema. Please refrain
from teasing our guest.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
I beg your pardon.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
My name is Jeeves Wodehouse.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
I serve as the
Hoshisato's butler.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh. Pleasure to meet you, sir!

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
[EMA chuckles] You strike me as
the shy and submissive type.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
Makoto!

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you're here!
It's been way too long!

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
I've missed you!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh...

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh? What's wrong?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I bet you've
forgotten who I am.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Uh. You're Hatena, right?

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
You bet! That's me!

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Y'know, you can drop the
nickname if you want to.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
Call me Kana.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I'm stunned.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
You've gotten so pretty,
I barely recognized you.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Same old outburst.
That's classic Hatena!

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
Usually, "Hatena" isn't a name
I like people to call me by.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
I'll let it slide
because it's you, though.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
It's really been a long time!
I'm glad I got to see you.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Same! It's hard
to believe you're here!

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
remembering our promise.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I've heard a
great deal about you...

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
...being Lady Kana's prince.
Is that correct?

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hm?

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
Ema! Uh. Not like
a "prince" prince.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
You remember when that
stray dog attacked us?

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
You protected me without
a second thought!

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
Just like a courageous
prince from a fairytale.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
Gah! Did I actually
say that out loud?

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO laughs]

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.180 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I have to admit,
you've changed, too, Makoto.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
You look more like a boy now.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Uh, what do you mean by that?

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I mean, your hair
is still short

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
and your clothes look fresh
off a Boys R Us rack.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
I thought you might wear
something cute today, at least.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
"Cute" isn't really my style,

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
but thanks for lookin' out.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Even your voice is masculine.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
Is that the idea?

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
Are you intentionally
trying to be more boyish?

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
I bet I know why!
You want to be like my father!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
That's it, isn't it?

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Lady Kana.
A moment, if I may?

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI grunts]

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Makoto is a boy.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.340 position:50% align:center
Okay, what kind of prank are you
trying to pull off now, Ema?

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
Wow. You come up with the
craziest things sometimes.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Seems I have no choice.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
Turn this way, my lady,
and you scoot a bit closer.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry. There.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
Some kind of game?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
This is silly.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey. Why is your
chest as flat as your back?

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.443 position:50% align:center
Who the heck are you?

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I'm Makoto.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
But how is that even
remotely possible? No!

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU laughs]

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
[KANA, MAKOTO shout]

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Things sound lively in here.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
The two of you celebrating
your reunion?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Now, that's an entrance!

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
Father, there's been
a development.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
What has you in such a
distraught state? I'm all ears.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
It's awful.
Makoto turned into a boy!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU chuckles] I see why that
would be a cause for concern,

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
if Makoto wasn't, in fact,
already born as a boy.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
No way!

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:49.237 position:50% align:center
Right then. I see a
glimmer in your eye.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
I know it well.
The bright spark of ambition!

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Glad it shows! I came to town
just like I said I would.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
So please teach me the
ways of your magic!

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Trickery! Illusions! Magic!

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
Whatever the name, its purpose
remains the same.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
To make the audience
believe they're dreaming!

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
When a magician chooses
to reveal his secrets,

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
it's the equivalent of
entrusting his life's

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
essence to somebody.
Do you grok my mouth music?

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.138 position:50% align:center
Yes! I will safeguard your
secrets above all else!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
For the sake of the
smiles they help create!

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Excellent answer.
You can be my apprentice.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
you may call me "Master."

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
Thanks Master!
It truly is an honor!

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Now that you'll
be living in this house,

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
please think of us
as your family.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Wait a second!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
Is he seriously going
to be living here?

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
You were rather gung-ho
when you agreed to all this.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
That was before I knew
Makoto is a boy!

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
Take it easy there, Hatena.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Don't call me Hatena!
It's Kana to you!

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
Oh. My bad, Kana.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
You sound so disrespectful!

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
I'll work on that, but I came
all this way because I really

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
want to hone my craft as
a magician, so please--

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Trust a boy to be oblivious.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
It is nearly time to make
your departure, Master.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Thank you, Jeeves.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
I leave everything in
your capable hands.

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Um. Where are you going?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] It just so
happens I have business

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
to attend to overseas.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
Apologies, girls,
but it's work related.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
You understand, right?

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Hold on! If you're leaving,
then I'm coming with you!

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
Isn't there an entrance
ceremony taking place today?

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
Well. Yeah! You're not planning
on missing it, are you?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Kana.
I wish I could be there.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
But at least you won't be alone
now that you have Makoto.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
That's my number one problem!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
On that note...

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA gasp]

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
I'll see all of your smiling
faces in one month's time.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
Adios!

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
There he goes.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
Levitation magic, huh?
Or illusion.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
Whatever you call it,
it's amazing!

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
That's Master Hoshisato for ya!

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Forgive the delayed
introduction. This is Yumemi,

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
the younger daughter
of the Hoshisato family.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
We met when you were little,

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
but I highly doubt you remember.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Check this out, Yumemi!

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center
My word. He's quite
dexterous, isn't he?

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Crimson power, hear my call.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Catch it.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.632 position:50% align:center
For me?

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's a token
of our friendship.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you again!

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
It's very nice.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
Lady Yumemi's smile is
a rare and splendid sight.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
Well. The cause of that
smile somewhat upsets me.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
[KANA growls] I refuse to
stand by and let that boy

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
live in this house!

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
Jeeves, surely there must be
something you can do!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you are in the
wrong here, lady Kana.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] To callously
drive someone's child

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
out into the streets before
the entrance ceremony

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
would disgrace the
Hoshisato family name.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we shall keep Master
Makoto here with us until

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
your father's return.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
Rgh. Fine then.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
He's welcome to stay,

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
but only until we can get
in touch with my parents.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
And not as a tenant,
but as a temporary guest!

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
A compromise well struck.
Quite reasonable, yes.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Hatena. I promi--

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I told you not to
call me that! Good grief!

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Everything you
need should be in there,

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
though it might require
some digging since we've

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
been using the room for storage.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] This'll work.
Thanks. I appreciate it.

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Oh! You cleaned up quick
enough to impress a maid.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
I've made a mess or
two disappear before.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I'll leave some fresh
sheets for you right here.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center
That's very kind of you, Ema.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
Yes, well. I try.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
Whoa. This room has a floor.
Never would've guessed that.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Well, I don't
see what's so great

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
about cleaning a stupid room.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] It's astounding that
you did this by yourself.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
You even spruced up
the Artifacts!

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
Artifacts?

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] I'm referring to the
objects right behind you.

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Should I have asked
before I touched them?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] No, you arranged them
in a magnificent manner. Bravo!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
As you can see, I sorted
them by type and--

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO shouts]

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Man! I'm
so sorry about that!

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
I'd like to pay for it, if
there's any way I can!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Don't bother.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
It isn't like that hunk
of junk ever worked.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
No, this simply will not do.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
You shattered a remarkably
precious item to pieces.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll do whatever it
takes to make this up to you!

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Hm. Sounds good to me,
what should he do?

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
We may not be able to
salvage the item,

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
but we could still
salvage the situation.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
The mansion is understaffed,
so what if we put him to work

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
as a butler-in-training and
allow him to use his wages

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.231 position:50% align:center
to pay for this mishap?
Would that be fair?

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Extremely!
Please, put me to work!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. You will
indeed work. Nicely.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Great plan,

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
except Makoto will be long
gone before he pays it off.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I second Ema's great plan.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
Whose side are you on?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
I suppose that settles it.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
As of this moment, Makoto is
officially employed here.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
[KANA shouts]

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
I must admit,

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
this is not how I pictured
your visit turning out,

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
but I look forward to
working alongside you.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Same here!

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] I can't help but feel
you may have overstepped

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
a boundary.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Then you don't see what I do.

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
Their reunion was intense.
Under the proper circumstances,

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
the eventual encounters that
follow will be even more so!

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
[EMA laughs] You know Lady Kana
called Makoto a prince!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
That has the makings of a
beautiful love story.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
I believe they just need a
gentle nudge to get them closer.

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
And I'll be there
to provide them

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
with all the nudges
they may need!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
Ah. Young love at
its best! Oh, yes!

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
I'm the captain and I'll
go down with this ship!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
You... should get a hobby.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Ugh! Why?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
I know I said that he could
stay, but I didn't mean it!

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
I can't live under the same
roof as some stupid boy!

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
I blame Father
wholeheartedly.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Momma. I could really
use you right now,

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
but you don't even bother
to give us a call.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
This place is like a
big maze. This way? Huh?

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.197 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hm?

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.366 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I'm sorry!

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO groans]

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
No! Makoto, you idiotic pervert!

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
Why does everything hurt?

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.172 position:50% align:center
Master Makoto,
please exercise some caution

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
when choosing your
time to bathe.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana tends to frequent
this bathroom rather often.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
Your timing is flawless, Ema.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I don't think I've ever
been so embarrassed

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
in my entire freaking life!
He definitely saw me!

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.812 position:50% align:center
That does it. He is outta here!

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
No way he's staying
after a stunt like that!

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
Hey. Makoto.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
It'll be all right, Hatena!

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
[growls, barks]

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunting]
Mangy mutt!

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
He didn't hurt you, did he?

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Nah. Everything's fine.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You ended up breaking
your wand, though.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
Your safety matters a
lot more than my wand.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh? Oh, you mean it? Thank you.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
Y'know, it's almost like
I have a real-life prince!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
 Aw, you're gonna
make me blush.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You want to be like
my daddy when you grow up,

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.602 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, a magic guy--

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
A magician.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Yeah, that. He was
so cool at that show I saw!

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
And your mom,
the marvelous Miss Maeve,

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
she was great up there, too!

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.697 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You be like my dad,
and I'll be like my mom!

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
It's a plan.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
So, when you become like Miss
Maeve and I become like

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Mr. Mamoru, would you wanna
share a stage with me?

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
[KANA chuckles]

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
If we're sharing a stage,

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
then that'll make
us partners, won't it?

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
You bet!

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
We'll be two of the best
partners the world's ever seen!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's a promise!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts, gasps]

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
What the heck? Geez.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
[EMA] You greet the dutiful
maid who comes to wake you

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
in the morning
by screaming in terror?

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
A horrid habit like that
should be scolded out of you.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Never mind. Change into this.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Um. Good morning,
Haten--I-I mean Miss Kana.

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
And same goes to you, Jeeves.

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Yes, good morning.
That suit truly suits you.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:15.869 position:50% align:center
Good morning.
From the looks of things,

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
I take it you're actually going
through with the training.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Follow me, Master Makoto.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
You need to learn your
way around the mansion.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Good idea. I do
have a tendency to get lost.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
[EMA] There are a number
of rooms in the basement.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Not to mention the toolshed
and smokehouse in the yard.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
If you fail to
memorize them all,

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
you will ultimately fail
at being a butler.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
If you're going to work in
this mansion, you're going

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
to need to be aware of
one last, very important fact.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens,
you can never act surprised.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
[EMA] This is the very mansion
Lady Maeve's ancestors lived in.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
It was built hundreds
of years ago,

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
yet they managed to move it
here from overseas.

00:17:57.452 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
And you know what they say
about old buildings, don't you?

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Uh. That they're haunted?

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not talking
about ghosts.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
You are fully aware of who
owns this property, right?

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
Yes. Mamoru Hoshisato and
his partner, Miss Maeve--

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
the magicians of the century!

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Correct. And as such
a renowned magician,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
Master Mamoru has countless
tricks set up around the house.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Not even I know where that
mischievous man put them.

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
Oh, I think I understand now.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Excellent.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
The mansion's one thing,
but the city's another.

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
You'll be asked to run errands
and will need to know your way.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana. Might you be so kind
as to show him around town?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
No way! Why should I help him?

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Because you have the most
free time out of everyone.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
This mansion is incredible!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Magic one-oh-one is to
hide that which can't be hidden.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
Big mansions make
that principle easy.

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Makes sense.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
Come on. Keep up.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
Don't want you falling behind
and getting lost again.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
[NANA giggles] Hey, look!
It's the candy magician!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
How's it going?

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for what you did.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh?

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
This kind boy came to
my daughter's rescue

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
when she got lost yesterday.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
It looks like Nana
wasn't the only one

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
who found her way, though.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Luckily, everything
worked out just fine.

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
So, are you two on a date?

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Uh! That is a definite no!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
Buh-bye!

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:23.246 position:50% align:center
You could've told me the real
reason you were late yesterday.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center
Guess so, but I was lost
and would've been late

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
even before I ran into her.

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
[KANA grunts]

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Still playing the prince
and rescuing damsels, huh?

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Hatena.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
[KANA] How many times
do I have to tell you?!

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
We're back!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Welcome home.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Did the two of you
enjoy your little date?

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Why is everyone saying that?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
It was a joke.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey there, Yumemi.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI groans]

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
But it's already noon.
Where're you going anyway?

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
To get started on my chores.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Like what?

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Games and stuff.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Ah. So you're
a gamer girl, huh?

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
That's right.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
You think you might want to
join me sometime, Makoto?

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
Sure. That's cool.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
That's just plain weird,

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
she never asks anybody
to play with her.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
This upsets me greatly.

00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps]

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
Would you mind showing me that
trick you did one more time?

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! Look! Here goes!

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
Now then...

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
Wait! Let me see that!

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Geez! What for?

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Stop being a baby and let go!

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
[EMA] You may want to make
note of your proximity.

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] It's just some wand
I picked up from a toy store.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
I bought it right after I saw
your father perform.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
May I... take a look?

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
It smells like Mother.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh? Are you serious?

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Makoto, did our mother
make this wand for you?

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
No, but she fixed it
for me one time.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
Made it good as new
after I broke it.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
You probably remember it, too.

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
That day when the
stray dog came after us?

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Uh. That kind of rings a bell.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Well?

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
You can speak freely.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
So spill already!

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
His wand. There's no doubt that
was Mother's symbol on it.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
Then our mission is clear!
We take it back!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
The only kind of person
she would entrust an Artifact

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
to is the good kind.
And as far as I can tell,

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
Makoto has been taking
really good care of it.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's besides the point!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
I don't care how good he is,
we can't ignore an Artifact!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
Do what you want, but I'm going
to help Mother and get it back!

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
[KANA chuckles]

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.536 position:50% align:center
There's a prize to collect.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
And the master thief,
Hatena's up to the task!

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:17.379 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:46.092 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Gau!

00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:47.385 position:50% align:center
Gau, gau!

00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.763 position:50% align:center
Gau? Gau, gau, gau!

00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:51.473 position:50% align:center
Gau!
