her how amazing it was!

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing
that with us.

It'd be really nice if
you'd come over

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.234 position:50% align:center
and visit us at the house
again sometime soon.

Thanks for opening
the door, Sis.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
I wanted to apologize
face-to-face.

you when I opened it.

to talk to is Makoto.

Aw, come on, don't be like that.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
I brought some tea
and cookies for you!

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.465 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I don't need
your sweets. I have my own.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
Something I would like, though,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
is for Makoto to teach
me more magic tricks.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
If that's really what you
want then you got it.

she talk to you and not me?

[MAKOTO]
Yeah.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
I sincerely wish Lady
Yumemi would consider

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
resuming her studies,
especially since this matter

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
has led several people
to meddle in her affairs.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
We only "meddled" 'cause Kokomi
insisted we be proactive

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
and figure things
out for ourselves.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
I'm certain the madam's request
for us to be more mindful

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
played a large part
in that decision.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
I believe Lady Maeve foresaw

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
situations like
this transpiring.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
Whatever I'm incapable of doing
for them, I leave to you.

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

She's here already.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
I did tell you to
"come visit soon," I guess.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize
you'd come so soon,

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center

Thank you for waiting.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
Lady Yumemi will see you
in the reception room.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
It makes me very happy
that you came down

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
and said hello
this time around.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
Have you had a chance to read
the letter I wrote you yet?

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm-hm. I read it.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
Then you know all about
the funfest coming up!

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what the odds were,

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
but you and I are in
the same group again!

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
Guess we lucked out.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
I wish we really had lucked out,

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
then Ryusei wouldn't be
in the group with us.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
He sure does pick on you a lot,
and he never knows when to quit.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
He does?

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
That girl came here twice,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
and all Yumemi can do is give
her two-syllable replies?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Nope, not on my watch,
little sister!

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Please don't do
something you'll regret.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center

Owie.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
I'd really like to know
what the two of you

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
were doing behind that curtain.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Oh, um. I was just
cleaning and slipped. Eh-heh.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.913 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Pretty sure the
jig is up, but nice try.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm glad
that you're here.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to apologize
for what that boy in our class

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
did to you.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
A boy in our class
did something to her?

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.215 position:50% align:center
Give you three guesses as
to who was responsible,

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
but it happened when they
dropped by our school

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
a little earlier. They came
'cause they were worried.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
Why didn't I know about
this fieldtrip you took?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't talk to me,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd get
answers another way.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
You didn't even ask
if it was okay!

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
Don't be mad.
It's not a big deal.

I shouldn't have?

Nah, you're fine.

Are you alone this time?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yep. It's just me.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center

to come and say hello.

I'd be bummed, too,
if my sister hated me.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
I don't really hate her.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
But I am still upset with her.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
I get that.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
But the fact that she's worried
about you just means she cares.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
I know she does.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
This sucks. What do I do?

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
It's not a long-term fix,
but here's an idea.

cure for sadness I know. Honest.

was when Master pulled me up.

better than my dad's.

carried away here, okay?

[KANA]
Mm? Yumemi!

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
I never should've
told you I hated you

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.267 position:50% align:center
because I don't and I'm
really sorry I said it.

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I'm sorry, too!
I should've minded

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
my own business and
respected your privacy.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go to school if
I were getting picked on

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
by a bunch of mean boys either,

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center

you're coming from!

Um.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center

don't pick on me that much.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50% align:center
What? I mean that's great,

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
but if they're not the reason
you skip school, then what is?

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
Does there have to be a reason?

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Uh. Yeah, there kinda does.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Then I guess it's because
I don't want to go.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's your only excuse?

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
In that case, you need to
get your butt to school.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] I don't want to.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
[KANA] If you don't go,
then you won't graduate,

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
then you won't get a good job,

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
and it all spirals
downward from there!

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
I get bored because the lessons
they teach are way too easy.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.769 position:50% align:center

different issue,

listen to reason,

convinced by force! Muffy!

As for the structural
damage being inflicted,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
the mansion can utilize
its own Artifact power

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
to automatically repair itself,
at least to some degree.

Gau!

Hey! Knock it off
before you get hurt!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
How ironic.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
No! Makoto!

[grunts]

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.159 position:50% align:center
Owie.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
Whatever possessed
you to do that?

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
Hard to say.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
It's like my legs just
had a mind of their own.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
Don't sit up too fast.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
It's really not as
bad as it looked.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
I should go let Yumemi know, she
probably thinks she killed me.

[EMA chuckles]

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're okay. Gaugau and
I are both terribly sorry.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Don't stress about it.
I'll recover just fine.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
The foyer, however, might be
a cause for concern.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
If my big sister wasn't
such a hothead,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
then none of this
would've happened.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Well, she's frustrated
because she really wants

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
you to get an education.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
I don't care what she wants.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.616 position:50% align:center
What I want is to
drop out of school.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
I know the lessons
are boring to you

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
because you've already
surpassed that level, mentally.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
But aren't there other fun
things that you only get to do

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
while you're at school?

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
The boys don't make it fun.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Boys at that age
can be tough to deal with.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
We don't look alike.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Who's "we?"

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
They say I don't look
anything like my sister.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
And that my blond hair
is a strange color.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So then,

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.018 position:50% align:center
is that the real reason you
don't want to go to school?

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
Because the boys tease
you about those things?

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Not exactly.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
It's common for siblings
to have different features,

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
hair color included.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
That doesn't bother me.
I get it.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
What bothers me is being
told I'm strange.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
I know we're different,
but I don't want to hear it.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
And that's okay.

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
You're allowed to feel bad when
people say things like that.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
Especially when you
love your big sister

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
and just wanna be close to her.

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
[gasps, whimpers]

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Kinda off-topic,

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
but do you think you'd be down
to learn some card magic?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
Like right now?

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
Watch closely. Here we go!

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Pick a card.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
I swear. It's just
flat-out ridiculous!

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
She shut herself up in her
room and sends Gaugau down

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
whenever she needs something!

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
Do you understand the words
coming out of my mouth?

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
How could I not understand when
it's all you've talked about?

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
Could we change the topic
for five minutes, please?

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just on my mind.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
We haven't made any
progress yet, so...

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
Maybe there's a way we can
force her out of her room.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
We could start by taking
Makoto as our hostage.

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
Bet she'd come out for that!

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
Let's not get drastic.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Silence, you!

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
Anyone who dares to venture
inside the dolly's room

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
must suffer the appropriate
consequences that await them!

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
I think taking him hostage
would just make her

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
more mad at me
than she already is.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
You seriously need to
learn how to take a joke.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
I miss the days when
she would sit in my lap

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
and let me brush her long,

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
beautiful hair for
as long as I wanted.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
Now she's all Makoto-this
and Makoto-that

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
and forgets everyone else.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
That silky blonde hair of hers
is nothing short of flawless.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
It's nearly identical to
Mama's and just touching it

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
used to make me so happy.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
You know, I get the
admiration thing,

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
but it almost sounds like you're
a little jealous of her.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
It's hard not to be when she's
so much like our mother.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
She's super smart, too.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
If she would actually apply
herself by going to school

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
and studying like
she's supposed to,

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
she'd grow up to
be just like her.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
In all honesty, she has
the potential to turn out

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
even better than Mama,
so I think it's a shame.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
For the record, I gotta say,
your hair is really pretty, too.

Oh, uh...

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] It doesn't matter if
it's not the same color as hers.

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
There are all sorts of beautiful
women in the world, and once

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
both of you are grown up,
you'll be two of them!

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Makoto!

me with embarrassment,

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
you're doing fantastic!

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center

wanted to come here today

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
and properly apologize
to Yumemi.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I smashed
the clay bear you made

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
just because I
thought it was lame.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
And I'm sorry for all the times
I flipped up your skirt.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
I said your hair was
really weird. I'm sorry.

I think your hair is kinda cool.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
Yumemi. Those were some

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Not again!

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't worry,
I'll go and talk to her.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I'm coming in.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
Okay, so that could've panned
out a lot better than it did.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
I know how sensitive
you are about your hair,

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure it was worse
than usual since Hatena

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
was right next you,

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
but that kid didn't say that
stuff because he thought

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
you were insecure about it.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
He said it because he genuinely
thinks your hair is pretty.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
He was being nice.
They all were.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] I don't get it.
What am I supposed to say?

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to do when
someone tells me they're sorry.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
How 'bout... "It's all good",
or "I forgive you."

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
Something like that. Maybe?

 I bet she can do real magic
'cause she's a Hoshisato!

No, it's not because
of my family.

it and everything.
