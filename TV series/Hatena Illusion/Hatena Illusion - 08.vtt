00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Okay, Jeeves.
Could you enlighten me as to why

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
Mariah had the
audacity to say that?

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
And are you really just
gonna bow down and obey her?

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
That's why... it hardly makes
sense for a couple of

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
inexperienced children
to possess such items.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
I need you to return
the Artifacts

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
that are currently in your care.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
You'll need to find
another place to call home.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
Lady Mariah is acting under
the orders she received

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
from her mother,
Lady Morrigan.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
And I am obligated
to do as she says.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
Were she present, Lady Maeve
could contest such demands,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
but sadly she is not.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
I refuse to believe you'd choose
somebody like Mariah over us!

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
Consider his point of view.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.146 position:50% align:center
Jeeves looked after both your
mother and Lady Mariah,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
from the time they
were small children,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
he's not choosing sides.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
As outlandish as it may appear,

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
I do, in fact, believe that
Lady Mariah has you

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
and your sister's best
interest at heart.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
She wants us to
leave our own home!

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
I'm aware.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
And perhaps leaving the mansion
is actually the right course

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
of action to take at
this point in time.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.627 position:50% align:center
I see no problem so long
as her requests

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.046 position:50% align:center
are out of
consideration for you.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Hold it! I hereby declare
the area behind me off limits.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
Relax. I'm just here to
tidy up the bedroom, Dina.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.442 position:50% align:center
[DINA]
Yeah, right.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
He's my master, so I'll do
the cleaning for him. Clear?

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
You're really surprised?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
This magic is as
basic as it gets.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
And you call yourself
a magician. Hmph.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Looks like Mariah's
gonna get her way

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
and drive us out of the house.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
Do you think Mom
could do something?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Maybe if we could reach her.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
As difficult as that sounds,

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
it might be possible
with the right Artifact.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
One that could find her
and deliver a message

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
like a carrier pigeon.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you're the one
who would have to make it.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
You're probably right.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
If I focus, I think
I can do it, though.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI grunts]

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
Find her.
Please, locate my mother!

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI sighs]

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
It's just not gonna work, is it?

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
I'm a ways away
from Mom's level.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
Maybe I have to be a magician
of her caliber to do it.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps] Well, it looks
like you did something!

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center

[ARTIFACT yells]

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Ow! That hurts!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be
a messenger pigeon,

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
not a bird of prey!
Ouch! Stop it!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
It failed. Oh, well.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Yumemi, don't just sit there!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Get this freakin'
abomination under control!

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Mm? Must've taken a break.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I'm here to clean the room.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.876 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
Come on in.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
Forgive the intrusion.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Is the secret behind
this trick obvious?

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
No, sir. Not in the least.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
Care to give it a go?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah! Sure!

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY] You're missing
a vital tool, yes?

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
I assumed you'd be utilizing an
Artifact, much like Mamoru does.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer to do this
on my own ability.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought!

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
Master, why waste your precious
time teaching Makoto magic

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
when he's not even
your apprentice!

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY] Calm yourself, Dina.
No teaching took place.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
I was merely observing him.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
That so? Hmph.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.147 position:50% align:center
[DINA]
More basic magic.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth, you don't
impress me in the slightest.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
And unless you can perform
a trick that I can't,

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
I'll never approve of you
being my uncle's apprentice!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
That's all it would take
for you to get off my case?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
One magic trick, and you'll
truly accept me?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
If I can't replicate it,
then... yes.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.418 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY grunts]

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO exhales]

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
Master? Is that you?

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
Welcome home, sir!

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
Still ambitious, I see.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
I overheard your declaration to
dazzle Dina with your magic.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Good luck with that endeavor.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Master, you're right on time.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
Lady Mariah is waiting
to speak with you.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Father, please explain.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
What on earth was going
through your head

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
when you agreed to let
Mariah live in our home?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Hm...
Well, my darling, you see--

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
Why is the woman
who stole our crest

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
now trying to steal
our whole mansion?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
Oh... I give up.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
You tell her, since she
won't listen to me.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
Maeve warned me. She did say
the mansion was housing

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
a few more guests than usual.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
You actually saw Mother?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
Did she mention when
she was coming home?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
It was the same old story.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
She said there's still something
she has to take care of.

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
Took you long enough,
my asinine apprentice!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
Master Gregory!

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
What was the point
of inviting me,

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
if all you're going
to do is neglect me?

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] I promise it
wasn't intentional, Master.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
I only just arrived.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[DINA]
Introductions would be fitting.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
I suppose they would.
He is your senior apprentice,

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
so of course you'd
want to meet him.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
This is Dina Camelot, my most
prized apprentice. Unlike you.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Well, nice to
make your acquaintance.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
I'm Mamoru Hoshisato.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Believe me, the
pleasure's all mine!

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
I want to be a magician
as good as you are someday!

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.137 position:50% align:center
That's the goal
I keep striving toward!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
I'm really not
anything special, though.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
Master, you must be famished.
Let's head to the dining room.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
Hm?

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Father!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
We're kinda in the middle
of an important conversation!

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] I'm sure Mamoru's
travels were exhausting.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
And what you want to
discuss is far too draining.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
Why not let him rest?

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, my precious angel.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[KANA grunts]

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
This sucks!

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
I've had it up to here
with waiting around!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
Yumemi? We need Artifact
power and we need it ASAP!

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Like Muffy and Gau-Gau?

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] She means the
ones that I've made.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
Or should I say, tried to make.
Some turned out pretty bad.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
There may finally be
an exception, though.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
I have a new
Artifact that attacks.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
If it's meant for offense,
let's use it against Mariah!

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
Sounds dangerous to me.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
We won't really hurt her, we'll
just get her out of the mansion.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Let's do it, after a test run.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
We need to make sure
it can activate.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
It's time to link up. Omit Home.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
There. It's connected.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
That's super amazing!

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
Little sis, I'm so proud of you!

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[KANA, MAKOTO shout]

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
Stop! Test run is
officially over!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
I already tried to cancel it.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
But it won't!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
Do something! Hurry!

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps]
It's stuck!

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Wha--?

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
[ALL shouting]

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU yells]

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. Seems as though
they want to get rid of me.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
Serves me right for thinking
of their happiness.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
Maybe next time I'll reconsider.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Don't say that. Even if
they're not, I'm grateful.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
It's no use! I can't get
this thing under control!

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
[KANA] If you have an idea,
now's the time!

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
Smile Stick! Vanishing Magic.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, great!

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:11.736 position:50% align:center
If we wanna stop it, then we're
gonna have to destroy it!

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] After all the trouble
you went through to make it?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
Seriously? This trouble
trumps that trouble!

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right!

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
Have Muffy and Gaugau protect
the both of you, all right?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU]
Gau!

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
Um... command...
Wait, what number was it?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.378 position:50% align:center
Oh, just... Guard Mode, go!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU]
Gau!

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
Now! Destroy it before
it's too late!

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
C'mon! Please!

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
[GAUGAU growls]

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
Just break already!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Makoto!

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
You okay?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
Man. That could've gone
a lot better than it did.

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
You're hurt. You risked
your life for our sakes.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
Just a scratch.
Nothin' to worry about. Swear.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. It's my fault
'cause it was my Artifact.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
Are you well?

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Uh, we're fine.
Nothing happened here.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
A mountain of
rubble is nothing?

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
Do we really look that gullible?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
The result of a
runaway Artifact.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
Quite a mess, isn't it, Jeeves?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Yes. I am
terribly sorry, Lady Mariah.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Someone even got injured.

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
I'm curious as to what
you would've done

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
if it had turned out any worse.
Care to elaborate?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
You already know.
I want apologies.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
From both of you.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
I'm very sorry.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Yeah. Me, too.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
For the record, I got hurt
'cause I was careless.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
So please don't blame
them for my mistake.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Though that may be true,

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.090 position:50% align:center
this isn't about
the blame game.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
It's much more serious,

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
and that's why I believe it's
time the two of you left.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
Father! Why won't you
say something?

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
She wants us gone and
you don't care at all?

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
That can't be true.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
Remember, I am only
acting on behalf

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
of your grandmother's orders.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I haven't
made myself clear,

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
but these terms
are nonnegotiable.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
Continue to disobey me and
I'll expel you myself.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
Even if it's before
Gregory and Dina leave.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
I don't mean to pry,

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
but must things really
play out this way?

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Yes. And you know why, Ema.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
Though I didn't
want this either.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
So then,

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center
I suppose we should address
the matter of your new home.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
And spare me the "This is
our home" speeches.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
If you think we're just gonna
lie down and take this,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
then think again.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
But your father wasn't
very opposed to the idea,

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
was he? He took off
again this morning.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
And he has Gregory
in tow this time.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:03.324 position:50% align:center
Do you know why that is?
What he's doing?

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
He's doing it because
he's concerned!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
If you only knew the
outrageous number of people

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
who covet Artifacts,
you'd surrender yours.

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Doubtful.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
You're as stubborn as ever.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
Maybe Ema can talk
some sense into you.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.387 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? So you'd rather
reinforce their poor choices?

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
I am charged with
protecting them,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
not advising them
on their choices.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
Well, once they're gone,

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we can find some
other task for you to manage,

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
If it does come to that,

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
I have every intention of
leaving right alongside them.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
I will not require your
assistance in finding new tasks.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
It's likely come
to your attention,

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
but if you take your leave,
I take your Artifact.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
While I'd hate to see you go,

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
at least I get quite
the consolation prize.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
This "consolation prize"

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
was my personal
property to begin with.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
There is no justification for
the village to take it from me.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] What? Is it not one
of my sister's Artifacts?

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
It's true that Lady Maeve
changed it into an Artifact.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.888 position:50% align:center
However, the uniform
itself is mine.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Maeve sure made things
harder than they had to be.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
[KANA] This "Mariah Says"
game is getting really old!

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.564 position:50% align:center
Major bummer, girl.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
She thinks we're in danger,

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
but our Artifacts are
what protect us!

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
Preach.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
And don't they
require contracts?

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
Say it gets stolen.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
Would the thief even be
able to use its magic?

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
You don't need a contract
with an Artifact

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
to utilize its basic abilities,
so the answer is, yes.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
What? They really could?

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Yeah, but if you
want to use its true power,

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
you have to enter into a
contract with its real name.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
And the only two ways
to break that contract

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
are by having the
original owner order it,

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
or by having the original
owner eliminated.

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
You serious?

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
Because there are those
who would use such means

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
without a second thought.

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
Owning an Artifact
is considered unsafe.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Danger doesn't scare me.
I'm the Master Thief, Hatena.

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
And letting go of Muffy would
be letting go of my dream.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hey, I'm back!

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
Could I talk to you
for a sec, Makoto?

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
A class at the pool?

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I dunno how to swim.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
But I would disappoint
my classmates

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
if I didn't participate.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
Because your classmates
think you can do anything.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Expectations at their finest.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
There's a real easy fix
to this problem, though.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
Why don't I give you
swimming lessons?

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
But, I'm afraid of water.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Okay, forget the lessons.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
Let's go have some fun.
Water won't seem so scary

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
if you associate it more with
something happy, right?

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Uh-huh.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Wow, this is a lot fancier
than I was expecting.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
Public pools aren't good
for secret training.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
Plus, who knows what kind of
creeps would've showed.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
I could get used to this place.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
And speaking of creeps,
what are you doing here?

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
What else? Trying to
indulge myself.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
I declined the
invitation at first,

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
but your father did insist.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
Let's get started.
I'm ready to go!

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
You got it. Let's swim!

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
Awesome! That's it! Doin' good!

See? It's not scary,
just go under nice and easy.

[YUMEMI]
Uh...

[YUMEMI gasps]

If it's bothering you,
then speak up, girlfriend!

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
Tell 'em you wanna join!

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
No way. I can't.
Getting in the water means

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
I'd have to strip down
to my bathing suit.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
Someone with a bod like yours
should not be self-conscious!

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.900 position:50% align:center
Even Makoto would notice you if
he got a gander at your goodies.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]
Him taking notice of me

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
is what I'm trying to avoid!

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hatena! You girls coming?

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
Well, so much for
him not noticing.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
Kokomi!

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
Looks like those two have
settled down. About time.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
Why so quiet?

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
Do you really have to chase
them out of their home?

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
The way you say it
sounds so mean.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center

[KANA, KOKOMI shout]

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
You know, if I had
my jacket off,

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
you'd pay more attention!

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
[KANA laughs]

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
He would.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] You want to keep that
world hidden from the children,

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
Let's take care of this quickly,

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
while they're still getting
their lives back on track.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
I don't enjoy
seeing their tears.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
You must be blind, Lady Mariah.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
Happiness can be a truly
terrifying feeling.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
[EMA sobs]

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
Through thick and thin, I stay.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
[EMA] With the mansion...
and the Hoshisato family.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
It's the path I've chosen.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Which is exactly why....

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
...I also choose to
preserve those smiles.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
[EMA] But is it the right
choice this time, Lady Maeve?

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Everybody. We need to talk.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center
I've been protecting you.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
I shielded you from a world
I did not want you to enter.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
A very dangerous world.
For years.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
But, I believe that may have
been a mistake on my part.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
What world? What do you mean?

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
[EMA] As long as Lady Maeve's
blood runs through you,

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
your world is
destined to coincide

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
with the world of Artifacts.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
You will need strength to
withstand being in its center.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
Very much so.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
I ask you again.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
Lady Kana, do you wish to assist
your mother in her mission?

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
I want that more
than anything.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
I want to become stronger
and master Muffy.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
I want to prove myself!
To Mama and Mariah!

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
And you have the resolve?
Are you absolutely certain?

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Well then.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
Uh, when did Jeeves get here?

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
I shall instruct you in
the most appropriate method

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
to utilize your Artifacts.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I'm not saying you
aren't strong enough, Jeeves.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
It's just that. I can't
use Muffy against you.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
There's no way you
wouldn't get hurt.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
Your concern for me
is endearing, Lady Kana.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
But I'm not exaggerating when
I say I am much tougher

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
than I look.

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
So please feel free to come at
me without any reservations.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
[KANA, MAKOTO]
Um...

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Still not convinced?

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
I told you my looks
can be deceiving.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
Very well, I shall give you
a further demonstration.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES shouts]

00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA yell]

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
Jeeves, is that you?

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
Mm. I'm the Jeeves you know,

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
but I've assumed my combat form.

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
This mansion itself
is one giant Artifact,

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
and I am but one
small part of it.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
I was created to
act as a guardian

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
for the Lároutir family.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
I have loyally watched
over Lady Maeve, 

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
her sister, and countless
others for many generations.

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
That also includes
Lady Morrigan.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Unbelievable.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
You were an Artifact
all these years?

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
I can hold this form
for 15 minutes

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
if the elder is not present.
That should be plenty of time.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Plenty of time to do what?

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps, grunts]

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
Hatena!

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Playing dumb won't
do you any good in this fight.

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
I can immobilize an
opponent in three seconds.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
If that doesn't motivate you to
get serious, then nothing will.

00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:08.179 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Sounds like
I'm missing out on the fun.

00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:10.306 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Perfect timing for once.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.767 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I could
ask you a favor.

00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:13.893 position:50% align:center
Were you?

00:23:13.977 --> 00:23:15.437 position:50% align:center
If at all possible,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.231 position:50% align:center
I would like you to please give
Lady Kana another chance.

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:19.941 position:50% align:center
Her first test was so pitiful.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:22.360 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt a second
would be different.

00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:24.487 position:50% align:center
She should know what the
weight of protecting herself

00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:27.741 position:50% align:center
feels like. She needs to
realize how demanding it is.

00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
And who better to show her
those things than you?

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.796 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES]
Gau gau gau.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.967 position:50% align:center
Gau gau gau gau.
Gau gau gau. Gau?

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:51.639 position:50% align:center
Gau gau gau! Gau gau gau,
gau gau gau. Gau.
