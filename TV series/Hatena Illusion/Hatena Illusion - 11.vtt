[YUMEMI]
I've been researching

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.917 align:middle
the Violin of the Earth
God's whereabouts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.958 align:middle
According to P-chan,
it should be right... here.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.292 align:middle
Or, more specifically,
it's in the hands of a man

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.333 align:middle
who poses as a business mogul,
but he's really a crime lord

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:24.333 align:middle
who spent a great deal of money
so his daughter could have

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:26.500 align:middle
a leg up in her
violin competition.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:28.625 align:middle
He must really want her to win.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.875 align:middle
But if she used an Artifact,
that's cheating, big time.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle
And that's just wrong.
Even if he did it out of love.

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:39.958 align:middle
It's not fair to anybody.
Especially not to his daughter.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.667 align:middle
I'm sure she'd wanna
win on her own.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.583 align:middle
Probably doesn't even realize
she's been using an Artifact.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle
[MAKOTO, YUMEMI, KANA groan]

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:49.333 align:middle
She's in luck.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.083 align:middle
Because I'll steal
that sadness before

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.208 align:middle
she even has a
chance to feel it!

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.542 align:middle
[YUMEMI] I'm making an
identical copy of the Artifact

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.333 align:middle
for you to leave in its place.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:58.833 align:middle
It'll be finished soon.

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:00.458 align:middle
You'll be happy
to hear the notice

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:02.208 align:middle
has already been sent ,too.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
What notice?

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.667 align:middle
[EMA] The notice regarding
the Artifact.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.792 align:middle
Since we are kind enough
to inform our targets

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:10.875 align:middle
of the intended theft,
they, in turn,

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle
are kind enough to inform us
of the Artifact's true name

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:15.792 align:middle
once it's successfully stolen.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.583 align:middle


00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.792 align:middle
Duh! Although, it'd be nicer
if they just gave it to us.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:24.083 align:middle
Sis had complete creative
freedom in writing this notice.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.417 align:middle
What'd you say?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.083 align:middle
"I'm the master thief Hatena!

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.333 align:middle
And I'll be coming to steal
the Violin of the Earth God

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.833 align:middle
in the near future,
so keep your eyes peeled!

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.667 align:middle
You've been causing
sorrow in the world,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.917 align:middle
but you'll no longer do so by
abusing an Artifact's power!"

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:16.958 align:middle
[KANA] The Artifact is being
kept in an instrument 

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:19.125 align:middle
storeroom on the third floor.

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.542 align:middle
Yumemi's gonna piece together
an electronic key

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:22.958 align:middle
to unlock it for us.

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.875 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
She's really amazing.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.417 align:middle
[MAKOTO] I hope you knock
'em dead tonight, Master!

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.917 align:middle
And... Master.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.125 align:middle
If I could choose, I'd much
rather be lending my talents

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle
to you than the stage.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.292 align:middle
Show them what you can do!

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:37.083 align:middle
Yeah!

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.167 align:middle

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.375 align:middle
Uh?

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:41.792 align:middle
We need to get going
or we'll be late.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.833 align:middle
[GREGORY]
Then let's be on our way.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.792 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.083 align:middle
[DINA]
Hmph.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle
Do you think you're
ready for this, Makoto?

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle
Vanishing Magic!

[KANA grunts]

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle
Not bad. That's totes our
quickest break-in yet!

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:06.125 align:middle

They already found us?
Man, they're as quick as we are!

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle
I've got this. Let's go, Muffy.

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:15.042 align:middle
Jeeve's Style!

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle
[GUARDS gasp, grunt]

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle
Sweet attack. But why'd you
name it after Jeeves?

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle
[KANA]
Think about it.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.042 align:middle
Jeeves has managed
to knock us out

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.083 align:middle
more times than
I can remember.

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:27.667 align:middle
So once I came up with
a move that KO's people,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.083 align:middle
I knew exactly what to call it.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.542 align:middle
Bingo! Found one of
those keys. Now what?

[KANA] Looks like it worked.
Awesome job, Yumemi!

[MANSION OWNER] All right,
listen up, you little twerps.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.208 align:middle
This isn't just an
Artifact to me.

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:01.292 align:middle
It's a testament to
my social standing

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.458 align:middle
and the literal instrument
that will make my daughter

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:05.375 align:middle
the best musician in the world.

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:09.125 align:middle
You can try and take it,
but not without a fight.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle
I've never seen
real-life guns before.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:14.208 align:middle
Same. But for some reason
they're not that scary.

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle
Huh. I wonder why.

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:18.333 align:middle
If I had to guess,
I'd say it's because

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle
we've seen Artifacts that
do way more damage.

Those men may not have stood
a chance against your Artifacts,

I thought you'd meet up
with us after the show,

it turns out you weren't

yourself an apprentice?

Uh. Well, I...

[DINA] You should be
ashamed for skipping out!

Mister Mamoru and Master Gregory
are both your teachers.

Do you know how lucky you are?

You should've shown
them the same support

they've had the
grace to show you!

Hey. It's just
a misunderstanding.

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:01.083 align:middle
At least you cleared
something up.

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:04.083 align:middle
Rest assured, boy, I will never
acknowledge you as a magician.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:07.083 align:middle
I was right not to accept you
from the moment we met!

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.958 align:middle
I believe that's
quite enough, Dina.

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle
There was a good reason
for his absence.

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:14.708 align:middle
He couldn't be at my performance

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:17.958 align:middle
because I needed him
to accompany Kana.

00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:21.292 align:middle
Dina. Your mind has
become so narrow.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.625 align:middle
And these assumptions
are not helping that.

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:25.583 align:middle
You're your own worst enemy.

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle
Maybe so. But I still
refuse to accept him.

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:32.417 align:middle
And you can't change that!

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:38.542 align:middle
Ah, man.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:42.375 align:middle
I hope you weren't offended,
lad--er... Makoto.

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:46.708 align:middle
Nah. He really didn't say
anything that wasn't true.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.333 align:middle
So, please, go easy on him.

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:52.292 align:middle
The last thing he needs
is for you to be angry.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.833 align:middle
You're his hero.

00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle
[GREGORY]
Hmph. Very considerate.

00:08:56.083 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle
Dina could stand to learn
a thing or two from you.

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle
[EMA]
I'll put on some tea.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:06.542 align:middle
First, we celebrate the
success of your mission!

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:08.042 align:middle
Good point.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle
Don't let Dina's sour mood
put a damper on your triumph.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:13.542 align:middle
You've earned this.
So why not enjoy it a little?

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.042 align:middle
Right.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.958 align:middle
[MICHELLE giggles]
Kudos on doing such a great job.

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:24.875 align:middle
It all went according to plan,
and I just couldn't be happier.

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:35.125 align:middle
Why do I let myself get
so frustrated with him?

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle
[grunts]

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:41.833 align:middle
[DINA]
He's not even worth it.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.583 align:middle
[KANA sighs]
I'm exhausted.

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:47.875 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, I know the feeling,

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.167 align:middle
but don't you still
have to pack?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle
Unfortunately, yes.
But it's a waste of time.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.583 align:middle
I can't get everything
to fit like it did before!

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.042 align:middle
[knocking]

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:59.042 align:middle
Hey. How's the
packing coming along?

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.583 align:middle
Good! Nearly finished now.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.792 align:middle
[KANA]
Just curious,

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.958 align:middle
but have you gotten
in touch with Mother?

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:08.167 align:middle
No. Though not for
lack of trying.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.167 align:middle
Oh, I see. But that won't
be the case for much longer!

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle
Once we deliver the Artifacts,
she'll be free, right?

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle
Yes, she will.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:21.125 align:middle
The sooner we get to Japan, the
sooner we can make that happen!

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:24.167 align:middle
But before we head home, Brian
wanted to throw us a party.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.208 align:middle
That sound like something
you'd be interested in?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.417 align:middle
[MAKOTO, KANA]
Yeah!

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.917 align:middle
[MAMORU]
Hm.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.625 align:middle
[BRIAN]
Too right!

00:10:36.708 --> 00:10:38.542 align:middle
Here's to Sir Camelot
and Mister Mamoru's

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.583 align:middle
astonishing performance
Down Under!

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:41.958 align:middle
Raise a cheer!

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:45.833 align:middle
[KANA, MAKOTO giggle]

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle
[BRIAN]
I'll drink to that!

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:55.958 align:middle
Thank you, Brian.
It's been delightful.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:59.042 align:middle
Oh, no worries, mate.
I was honored to host you.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.958 align:middle
I mean, you're the great
Mamoru Hoshisato, after all.

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:04.542 align:middle
You're more than welcome
anytime you're in the Outback.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.792 align:middle
Has your business
been faring well?

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.875 align:middle
Compared to when my father
was in charge, not really.

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.583 align:middle
That so? If you're having
trouble, I can lend a hand.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.667 align:middle
I am still indebted
to your father.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle
Very kind of you to offer.

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:20.417 align:middle
Though, were my father alive,
you'd never had to make that 

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.667 align:middle
proposition in the first place.

00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle
[GREGORY]
Hm...

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:31.125 align:middle
[YUMEMI sighs]

00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle
Master, it's getting late.

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle
So it is. Time just flew by.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:38.542 align:middle
I suppose we better
call it a night.

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.958 align:middle
But it was really fun!

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:42.583 align:middle
Gotta say how much I've
enjoyed havin' you lot around.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:44.458 align:middle
Although, I should also
apologize for keeping

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:46.458 align:middle
your daughters up
till such a late hour.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle
[EMA] Come on, sleepyhead,
it's time to go.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.833 align:middle
[YUMEMI groans]

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:53.708 align:middle
[EMA] You need to wash up
before you go to bed.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.542 align:middle
[YUMEMI]
Ha. Fat chance.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:58.125 align:middle
[KANA]
And here we go again.

00:11:58.208 --> 00:12:00.542 align:middle
I hope you have a
good night, Dina.

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:02.792 align:middle
[DINA scoffs]

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:04.167 align:middle
Dude...

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle
[KANA]
Okay, Yumemi.

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:15.583 align:middle
See, its not so--hey, where do
you think you're going?

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.375 align:middle
It's just a showerhead,
gimme a break!

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:22.208 align:middle
[YUMEMI groans]

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:24.583 align:middle
I simply can't express
how proud I am of you.

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:27.167 align:middle
You made that heist
look like a cakewalk.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.917 align:middle
Thanks. I guess Jeeves's
training paid off for us.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.417 align:middle
I'd say.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.958 align:middle
Your compatibility with Makoto
played a much larger part.

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:36.458 align:middle
In other words,
we can chalk it up to love!

00:12:36.542 --> 00:12:39.125 align:middle
[Kyelps] Well, I mean,
of course I care about him, 

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:40.583 align:middle
he's my partner,

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:42.792 align:middle
someone I can rely on and
feel strangely at ease with.

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.625 align:middle
Uh-huh. Sounds like
prince material to me.

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:46.958 align:middle
Then check your ears!

00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:48.208 align:middle
[EMA]
Hm?

00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:50.667 align:middle
[KANA]
Something wrong?

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.667 align:middle
Listen to me.
I want you to stay put.

00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:56.875 align:middle
[EMA grunts]

00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.792 align:middle
[KANA yells]

00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.917 align:middle
Hatena!

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle
[MAMORU]
Girls! Are you all right?

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.125 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:08.292 align:middle
Oh. Hello there.

00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:11.542 align:middle
It's a relief to
see you're safe.

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.542 align:middle
[KANA groans]
Yeah, we're fine!

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.667 align:middle
But someone won't be
if he doesn't get out!

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.917 align:middle
[gasps]
Right! We were just leaving!

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:22.708 align:middle
[EMA] Master Mamoru.
Who are these men?

00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:25.833 align:middle
The only place I've seen
them before was the party.

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle
They must know Brian.

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:30.958 align:middle
Which makes me think he's
the one who arranged this.

00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:34.292 align:middle
So then, was the
violin his objective?

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:39.542 align:middle
There's no time to find out.
We're leaving. Immediately.

00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:40.667 align:middle
[MAMORU]
Mm?

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.083 align:middle
[MICHELLE]
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle
But consider your evacuation
plans hereby thwarted.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.375 align:middle
Who are you?

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle
Me? You're looking at the
real lord of this manor.

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:53.125 align:middle
But I also respond
to Michelle Li.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.125 align:middle
[giggles]

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.917 align:middle
Brian doesn't own this place?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.375 align:middle
That's right. My group
bought it from your friend,

00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:01.667 align:middle
and acquired this mansion,
plus everyone employed here.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.083 align:middle
Mister Brian's business
isn't doing so hot.

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:07.542 align:middle
It's amazing how much debt you
can accrue when that happens.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.292 align:middle
No way!

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:12.875 align:middle
She found the violin!

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.417 align:middle
[MICHELLE] I went for
a little treasure hunt

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.958 align:middle
while you were busy blowing
bubbles in your bath water.

00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:19.958 align:middle
Please don't! We need
that for our Mom's sake.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:22.333 align:middle
If you take it, then she
can't come home.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:23.833 align:middle
Yumemi...

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.042 align:middle
Sounds like a
personal problem.

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:29.208 align:middle
I'd wager you don't even
know what the true nature

00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:31.542 align:middle
of this Artifact is, do you?

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:37.083 align:middle
I see. So it's true.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.167 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.875 align:middle
[MAMORU]
There are two parts to a violin.

00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle
The part we need is the bow,

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:43.542 align:middle
for that's the actual
Violin of the Earth God,

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:45.958 align:middle
but the instrument itself
is something else.

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:47.917 align:middle
A separate Artifact.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.708 align:middle
[MICHELLE] Right, so let's
see what's behind

00:14:49.792 --> 00:14:51.708 align:middle
Artifact number two!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.667 align:middle
[MICHELLE] Do you recognize it
now that it's not camouflaged?

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.667 align:middle
Although, I'm very glad it was.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.875 align:middle
Otherwise I wouldn't
have been able

00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.583 align:middle
to slip through your barrier.

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.583 align:middle
What barrier are
you talking about?

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:03.958 align:middle
The one that I put up.

00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle
I like to be prepared
for anything.

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.417 align:middle
So I used defensive
Artifacts to protect us,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.958 align:middle
thus making a barrier.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.833 align:middle
And then, it was ruined.

00:15:11.917 --> 00:15:13.917 align:middle
Your barrier became worthless
once your daughter brought

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.708 align:middle
that violin here.
Some Artifacts don't mix.

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.625 align:middle
Too bad. Maybe next time
you'll tell her sooner.

00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle
It's my fault?

00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle
No, Kana, it's not. I'm the
one who made a mistake.

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:28.542 align:middle
Yeah. An extremely large one.

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:30.042 align:middle
Got that right.

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle
[UNDERLING A]
Here you are.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:35.125 align:middle
I'd like you to meet every
Artifact-user's worst enemy.

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:39.958 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle
Huh? Muffy? What's the matter?

00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:47.417 align:middle
[KANA]
Muffy?!

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.375 align:middle
[YUMEMI]
Gaugau!

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.042 align:middle
Oh no. It couldn't be.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:57.083 align:middle
The forbidden White Orb
of Disillusionment.

00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:00.458 align:middle
It's been the downfall of
many a hidden village.

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:04.125 align:middle
Yes. With the power to render
all other Artifacts useless,

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.875 align:middle
this little ball reigns supreme.

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.667 align:middle
Even the Hoshisatos are
defenseless against it.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.417 align:middle
So! Let's make a deal.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.875 align:middle
I will return the Violin
of the Earth God to you!

00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.625 align:middle
But you must give me all your
Artifacts--every last one!

00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:20.208 align:middle
And obviously, you must
also reveal their true names

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle
to me when you do.

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle
If we refuse?

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:24.375 align:middle
Gee, what do you
think will happen?

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:26.167 align:middle
You'll, of course,
lose the violin.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.083 align:middle
Then, you'll lose your lives
and I'll take my spoils anyway.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.833 align:middle
Artifacts are one thing,
but my daughters?

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:40.708 align:middle
They're too precious to risk,
so I'll do as you say.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:41.333 align:middle
Father!

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.708 align:middle
I have no choice!

00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:45.292 align:middle
Were your mother here,
she would do the same thing.

00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:49.333 align:middle
Smart boy! But I took extra
precautions just in case.

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:52.583 align:middle
One can never be too careful.

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:54.125 align:middle
Keep your filthy hands off!

00:16:54.208 --> 00:16:56.083 align:middle
If you hurt my Master,
I'll make you pay!

00:16:56.167 --> 00:16:57.833 align:middle
[MAKOTO]
Oh, no! They got Dina!

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:01.083 align:middle
Bloody hell! Hey!
What in the world's going on?

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:03.125 align:middle
Now, hand them over.

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:05.917 align:middle
Do it nice and easy and
everyone gets to live.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle
I'll give you whatever you want.

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:09.458 align:middle
Just don't harm the children.

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:11.875 align:middle
That's it. That's all I ask.

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:12.458 align:middle
Ema.

00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:13.875 align:middle
Right.

00:17:17.833 --> 00:17:20.542 align:middle
Within this case is
every last Artifact

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.333 align:middle
I've managed to collect.
They're yours now.

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle
As are the children's.
Let me gather them for you.

00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:29.917 align:middle
Very well. But have the
maid make the transaction.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.917 align:middle
Fine.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.167 align:middle
Right.

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle
[gasps]

00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:42.208 align:middle
That dove.

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:49.667 align:middle

[UNDERLINGS grunting, coughing]

00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:57.875 align:middle
What? But how?
Their Artifacts were nullified!

00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.167 align:middle
Oh. Perhaps you haven't heard.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.458 align:middle
But I'm somewhat of a magician
who can do his own magic!

00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle
[EMA] Don't worry, girls,
I've got you!

00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:07.458 align:middle
I'm used to this
kind of smokescreen.

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:08.458 align:middle
It's now or never!

00:18:08.542 --> 00:18:11.542 align:middle

the kids get away!

Hey! Are you okay?

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:32.333 align:middle
I think so!

00:18:32.417 --> 00:18:33.458 align:middle
Kill them no--

Vanishing Magic!

00:18:50.792 --> 00:18:53.125 align:middle
We need to fall back. Run!

They're back to normal!

My word.

[GREGORY grunts]

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.208 align:middle
I can't believe Dina got
caught up in this mess.

00:19:10.292 --> 00:19:12.583 align:middle
I should've been paying
closer attention.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:15.333 align:middle
What's most important
is you averted the danger.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle
[YUMEMI grunts]
Are you hurt?

00:19:17.583 --> 00:19:19.625 align:middle
No, precious,
I'm perfectly fine.

00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle
I can't help but wonder why
that Michelle woman retreated,

00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.875 align:middle
and where those
two wound up.

Hm?

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.792 align:middle
He got injured. No...

00:19:35.292 --> 00:19:39.042 align:middle
[MAKOTO] I didn't expect
to be taken this far.

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle
It all happened so fast.

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:44.167 align:middle
The adrenaline must've given me
an extra boost or something.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.375 align:middle
[MAKOTO] I have to find a
way to stop the bleeding

[gasps, yells]

00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.542 align:middle
[DINA] Care to explain
before I jump to another

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:09.667 align:middle
of my conclusions,
you degenerate?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.167 align:middle
I was just trying to
treat your injury!

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.542 align:middle
I had no idea that you
were really a girl.

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:17.792 align:middle
A girl? How dare you!
This... is baby fat.

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:19.375 align:middle
Okay. Sure.

00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:22.458 align:middle
No, I lied. I can't even pretend
to believe something like that.

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle
[MAKOTO] Dina. Why do
you dress like a boy?

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:32.167 align:middle
It was the only way that I
could become an apprentice.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.875 align:middle
Because boys have it easier.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.167 align:middle
Oh.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:39.083 align:middle
I despise you, y'know.

00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:42.458 align:middle
We have the same dream.
We're even the same age.

00:20:42.542 --> 00:20:45.417 align:middle
But our genders differ and
that puts us leagues apart.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle
And not only are you a boy,

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle
but you're a boy who got
accepted by my Master.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.417 align:middle
And that's why I hate you.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.208 align:middle
I feel nothing but anger and
envy when I look at you!

00:20:57.292 --> 00:20:58.917 align:middle
Sorry.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.958 align:middle
What are you apologizing for?

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle
Not like you're
doing it on purpose.

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle
It doesn't matter.

00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:09.792 align:middle
I may dress like a boy, but I'll
never be the equivalent of one.
