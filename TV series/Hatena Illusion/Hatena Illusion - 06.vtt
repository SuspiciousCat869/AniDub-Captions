00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:13.513 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] You have such
pretty dark hair, Kana.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
You're definitely your
father's daughter.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
It's not fair.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
Why can't I have bright
shiny hair like you?

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mama! Mama!

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
Oh, goodness. Did someone
have a nice nap?

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE chuckles]
There. Sweet girl.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
She's so lucky.
Her hair is nice like yours.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
I wish you wouldn't say
things like that, honey.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel so
sad when you do.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
Your sister would
be sad to hear you

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
like her hair more
than yours, too.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
She loves everything about you,
Kana, just like I do.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
[babbles]

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.725 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I know that.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:04.439 position:50% align:center
Not having my Mama's hair isn't
the worst thing. But still...

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:10.528 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Aww. Why so serious?

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.830 position:50% align:center
[KANA] So what's this super
special way you think

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
will get my mother to
come back home, Auntie?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
Hey now, we agreed to stop that!
I'm too young to be an "Auntie."

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll just call
you Mariah, then.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's much better.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
Hang on. That thing
has Mama's crest!

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
How perceptive.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
As I'm sure you've
pieced together,

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:11.066 position:50% align:center
this "thing" is an Artifact
she created, called Nagarjuna.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
I was sent to retrieve it,

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
and since Mother Morrigan is
the one who issued the command,

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
I intend to deliver.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
But...

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
Why get my hands dirty when
I have a thieving niece?

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50% align:center
So lemme get this straight.
You want me to steal it

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
even though you're capable
of doing it yourself?

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
Tominozawa's nothing
short of a royal pain.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
And unlike some people I know,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
I happen to be lacking in the
all-purpose Artifact department.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.390 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
I believe you called it "Muffy" 

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
during our encounter
at the docks.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.893 position:50% align:center
[KANA grunts]

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
With a tool as useful as that,
stealing from an art exhibit

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
should be like taking candy
from a baby, right?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Your mother wouldn't
have given it to you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
if she didn't want
you to use it.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
Mother Morrigan is bound
to be more amiable

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
once she has her
desired Artifact,

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
which means she'll be more
likely to let Maeve go.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
Especially when she learns how
Maeve's daughter played a part.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
It's that simple?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
One Artifact will be all it
takes to bring her back home?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Yes.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hope we didn't
keep you waiting!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
What's cookin', good-lookin'?

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.107 position:50% align:center
You a bank loan?
'Cause you have my interest!

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
[SAKAGAMI groans]

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
Do you kick everybody
who compliments you?

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I don't!

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to give
you a friendly reminder

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
that I'm the one calling
the shots today.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[SAKAGAMI]
Got it! You call the shots!

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
Though your definition of
friendly is confusing.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] I assume you
brought what I asked for?

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Nice and neat
like you requested!

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] The blueprints
for the art gallery.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
All right, boys. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
is to complete a thorough
sweep of the art gallery

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
and mark down every
single last spot you see

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
a security guard or camera.
And I mean all of them.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yes! Crystal clear, ma'am!

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Huh. There are
more people than I expected.

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
Price of admission
is pretty steep,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
so imagine the money
they're raking in.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
I bet I could pull off
something like this.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
Just look for Artifacts instead
of business schemes, thanks.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
Never mind! I found it!

00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
That's it? You sure?

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
Let's get closer and
I'll double check.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think?

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
[KANA] That is definitely
the real deal.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
Then there's no reason
to stick around.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
We have the intel,

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
so the next step is
to go for it, I guess.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
I dunno if that's the
best idea, though.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I agree.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
Just because we know
more about it now

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean we have to do
something about it now.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
It's a relief to hear
you say that.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
We'll tell your mom
everything we learned

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
as soon as she gets back.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
The person we're up against
this time is no joke.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry that I
got you involved in this.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
But I had to see it for myself.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
Oh, um. You don't
have to apologize.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
Truth be told,

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
I was actually a little bit
touched that you wanted my help.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA]
Hm...

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI gasps] Help me,
Makoto, you're my only hope!

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
Help you? What? Why?

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
Try as you might, this is one
obligation you cannot avoid!

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
What's the obligation, Ema?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
Bathing is essential for
obvious hygienic reasons,

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
but Lady Yumemi adamantly
refuses to partake.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
Why did you leave out
the part where you tried

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
to tear my clothes off?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
It was a misunderstanding

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
and I would much prefer
that we dropped it.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
I know bath time
isn't your favorite,

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
but it should still be
part of your routine.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI grunts]

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
So what do you say, my lady?
Did that change your tune?

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Hmph.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
Do you think you might
reconsider taking a bath

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
if I gave you some kind of
reward once you finished?

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.611 position:50% align:center
What'd ya have in mind?

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure. But maybe
you can think of something

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
and we'll go from there.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
I found a nearby temple
on the internet

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
that lets guests meditate.
Could we go there as my reward?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
Uh. We can, but why do
you want to meditate?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
It helps people to better
understand their own minds,

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
and that's something
I really need.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
Ah, because you don't want your
magic to keep going haywire.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm-hmm! If I can control it,

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
then I won't make any Artifacts
when I don't mean to.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
It's not a surefire plan,
but I think it'll work.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
It's worth a shot. So let's go!

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
You take your bath,

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
and I'll take you to meditate
at the temple tomorrow.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm! Guess it's bath time.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[EMA chuckles]

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
[EMA] I never thought
I'd live to see the day

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
where she took a bath
of her own volition.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.544 position:50% align:center
And to top it off,
she wants to go outside!

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy!

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Our little hermit crab is
coming out of her shell!

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.
You're an inspiration.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
I will dutifully scrub
her from head to toe!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
Oh, and then I can select
the perfect ensemble

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
for her outdoor adventure!

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] I'm sorry if I
kept you waiting long.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
He will have to wait a
bit longer, I'm afraid.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
Your current clothes are
unsuitable for your outing,

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
so you will need to
change into this.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
Nice, but people will be
able to see her underwear

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
when she sits to meditate.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
No they won't.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
[EMA, MAKOTO]
mm?

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
I'd have to wear 'em for people
to see 'em, and I'm not.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
Change out of that
dress right now!

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
[SAKAGAMI groans]

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
It sure didn't take much
for your legs to go numb.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
And you call yourself a man?

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
[SAKAGAMI]
Uh. I mean, I used to...

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
Surprise of the day
goes to Hayashida

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
for being part of the family
that runs this temple.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
My surprise of the day goes to
you and your young lady friend

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
for being interested enough

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
to even come here
in the first place.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Speaking of, what made
you two decide to stop by?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
I like to say
thank you in person

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
and these guys had one coming,
believe it or not.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
Hatena needed a favor, and they
both volunteered to help.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
Why didn't she ask me?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
What did she need?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh... She said
it was a secret.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
Just erase the last ten seconds
or so from your brain!

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know. Pretty please?

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
[HAYASHIDA, SAKAGAMI gasp]

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Wow, so cute!

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
She needed help scoping out
the Tominozawa Collection.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
Nothing major. In fact,
she seemed more fascinated

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
by the architecture
than the art.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
She had us investigate the
building's construction and

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
map out things like security
cameras and whatnot.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
And you agreed to this?

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. You stupid boys!

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
Just had to go and
open your mouths.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.470 position:50% align:center
I know what you're thinking,

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
but you have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
All she wanted was to
see it for herself

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
and make sure the
thing was real.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
And after that whole
bodyguard-turned-traitor ordeal,

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
I felt like I kinda
owed her one.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
I've got a bad feeling.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
Same. I say we tell Jeeves
and Ema what's going on.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
No! It's gone!

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA] You wouldn't happen
to be looking for this,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
by chance?

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Hand it over!
That doesn't belong to you!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Then explain
how it ended up in my hand.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
What claim do you possess?

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
This Artifact is as much
mine as that accessory

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center

your skinny neck should be!

Huh?

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Come forth, Tomi-Tomi Slime!

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
[KANA yelps]
What is this?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
It's my Artifact, obviously!
Isn't it to die for?

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]
Muffy, do something.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
Struggling is as
useless as you are.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Now then. Since it seems
you'll be sticking around,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
why don't we have
a nice tÃªte-Ã¡-tÃªte?

[MAKOTO, YUMEMI pant]

[EMA] Oh! That was a
fairly quick visit.

Is Hatena here?

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
No. The lady has been out and
about for quite some time.

[BOTH gasp]

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
I think you've got me
where you want me.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
So, now what?

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
I believe I told you.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
We're going to have a
little chat, you and I.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
I've got some choice words
for you, but they're not nice.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
Well you're a cheeky one.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
As expected of a
child sans parenting.

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
You should be disciplined.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
Right now! Go, Tomi-Tomi Slime!

You've gotta find a way
to break free, Muffy!

[MARIAH]
How very predictable.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
It's... you.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
Brilliant deduction, once again.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
But why? I thought that
she was your enemy.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA]
Interesting concept,

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
but people don't normally
strike deals with their enemies,

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
and that's precisely
what we did.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
Mariah promised me a chance
to claim Maeve's masterpiece

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:06.453 position:50% align:center
as my own, and here we are.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
She made a deal with me, too.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
Though I'm starting to wonder
if stealing that Artifact

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
for her would've brought my
mother any closer to home

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
than she already is.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
Nothing I said was a lie.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
But I guess you'll never know
for sure since you got caught.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Shame.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
Why, you!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
Besides, I never said I wouldn't
tell Tominozawa your plans.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:26.514 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center

Don't give me that look.

You have a contract with
my sister's masterpiece,

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center

capable of was failure.

for the both of you!

in a novice's hands.

to stay for your pity party,

seeing you like this,

P- <i>chan</i> .

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
Let's search all
known Artifacts.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
We're trying to locate Muffy.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
Bingo. And, of course,

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
where else would it be other
than the Tominozawa art exhibit?

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely picking
up Muffy, but it's weird...

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
There isn't a
corresponding location

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
in the gallery's blueprints.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.037 position:50% align:center
And it seems like Muffy
is standing still.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
I suspect that room is hidden.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.166 position:50% align:center
I also suspect Lady Kana
has been captured,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
thus Muffy is
remaining stationary.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
Seems the damsel is in
need of rescuing yet again.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
She truly is a
high-maintenance young lady.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
I don't mind going.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Same here.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
I think Ema and I should
be good by ourselves.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
You'd be better off here
using your Artifact computer

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
to provide backup.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
I'm going!

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
Gau, gau!

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous!

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.356 position:50% align:center
Hatena is essentially
someone's hostage now.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
And I'm well aware! I know
how dangerous this might be.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
But I have a sinking feeling...

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
...that I'm the reason
she's in trouble.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
She wanted to help me.

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
Lately that's all she's
been trying to accomplish.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
You can't blame yourself for
something that she chose to do.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
We don't see eye-to-eye.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
It's true. But staying home
is like shutting her out.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
I need to show her
that I love her!

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Right, Ema?

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
I suppose.

I would be delighted to
see you girls reconcile

as soon as possible.

If you choose to save her,

you might as well go about
it in style, my lady.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Huh?

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
Where, may I ask, did you
secure something like that?

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.994 position:50% align:center
I knew it was only a matter of
time before she partook

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
in these daring escapades,

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
so I stitched it
together last night.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
I would've thought you'd
put your foot down,

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
yet here you are
giving the go-ahead.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
Oh, I am still very much
against the idea of her going.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
Would you like to hear my honest
opinion regarding this matter,

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
Lady Yumemi?

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Mm-mm.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center
I suppose that
settles that, then.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
The car is ready so your
departure may be a swift one.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA]
You should be thanking me.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
You waltzed in here thinking
you were hot stuff,

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
and now, well, you are.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
Give me your Artifact
and I'll release you

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
with a snap of my
manicured fingers.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
You should take
me up on my offer

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
while I'm still being nice.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Not many people would overlook
an attempted theft like this,
