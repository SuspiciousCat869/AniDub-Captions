thank you in person

both volunteered to help.

it was a secret.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
She needed help scoping out
the Tominozawa Collection.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
Nothing major. In fact,
she seemed more fascinated

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
by the architecture
than the art.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
She had us investigate the
building's construction and

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
map out things like security
cameras and whatnot.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center

but you have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
All she wanted was to
see it for herself

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center

thing was real.

Interesting concept,

what we did.

where else would it be other
than the Tominozawa art exhibit?

I'm definitely picking
up Muffy, but it's weird...

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
There isn't a
corresponding location

in the gallery's blueprints.

And it seems like Muffy
is standing still.

I suspect that room is hidden.

I also suspect Lady Kana
has been captured,

remaining stationary.

be good by ourselves.

You'd be better off here
using your Artifact computer

how dangerous this might be.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center

Lately that's all she's
been trying to accomplish.

We don't see eye-to-eye.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
It's true. But staying home
is like shutting her out.

in these daring escapades,

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
so I stitched it
together last night.

I'm surprised.

put your foot down,

against the idea of her going.

Mm-mm.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.390 position:50% align:center

settles that, then.

You waltzed in here thinking
you were hot stuff,

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.869 position:50% align:center
Give me your Artifact

with a snap of my
manicured fingers.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
You should take
me up on my offer

while I'm still being nice.
