00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
[SAKAGAMI]
Not crazy!

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
This was a girls'
school till last year.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
Then it all changed,
and I decided to come be

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
the Poseidon in
this sea of ladies.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
The wait was brutal,
but now my time is finally here!

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I'm Tokichiro Sakagami.
What's your name?

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
I'm, uh, Makoto Shiranui.
It's a pleasure.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
You're the Makoto Shiranui
people have been going on about.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
I'm a topic of conversation?

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
Negative. You are not.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
This dude is Hayashida.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
He may seem like a Brainiac,
but really, it's an act.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
All of it.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
So I've learned not to take

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
the random things he
says too seriously.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
[MATSUO]
Mind if I join the little circle

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
you three have going on?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
The name's Matsuo.
Nice to meet you.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] These guys sure know
how to leave an impression.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Hatena!
We're in the same class again!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Oh, hey. Kokomi.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
I mean, Kikyouin.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Maybe you never
received the memo,

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
but Hatena isn't a
name I like to use.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
It very well should be!

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
Play it off all you want, but
the truth eventually comes out!

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[KANA chuckles]

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
Whoever could you mean?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to make a joke,

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
I'm just telling you
what your name is.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
"Ka"...

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
..."na"... is fine.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
But Hatena is your
name, isn't it?

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
You've been called Hatena
since you were in diapers

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
and you can't just
change it now!

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
If I can change my diapers,
I can change my name, too!

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] You're not nearly
as grown up as you think.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
[KANA grunts]

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO chuckles nervously]

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Why does Kokomi make
it her mission in life

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
to needlessly torment me
every single chance she gets?

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I could
start middle school off

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
on a more sophisticated foot.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
So this is where you've been.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
Just great.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
My plan to avoid you by killing
time here backfired, too.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
I had every intention of
going home without you,

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.796 position:50% align:center
then I bumped into Ema.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Lady Kana acts tough,
but it's merely a façade

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
to hide how susceptible
she is to loneliness.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
She's going to be
especially lonely today

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
since her parents could not
attend her entrance ceremony.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
That's why I'd appreciate it

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
if you accompanied the lady
home this afternoon.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
It may seem trivial, but it's
another part of being a butler.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Ema's just a busybody.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Listen. I won't force you
to walk home with me.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
We could sit and talk for
a minute if you want to.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
Fine, you win.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
But only for a little
while, understood?

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
So about those Artifacts

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
you mentioned last night.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
The magic and
master thief parts,

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
they don't seem real to me.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, you think it was a lie?
Prove 'im wrong, Muffy.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
This is Findabair.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
It's a special Artifact
my mother made for me.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
It even protects me
in her absence.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
My magical all-purpose
wings, slash babysitter.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
It's an amazing sight
to see, for sure.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
And Miss Maeve is really the
sole creator of this thing?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
My mother is an
incredible woman.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
She's so beautiful and kind.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
And she's my father's
partner, too.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
Being a master-thief-mage
is icing on the cake.

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
Kinda makes you stop and wonder
how I'm related to her.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Even as we speak,
she's somewhere out there

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
trying her absolute hardest in
hopes of recovering an Artifact.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Just curious,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
but do you have any memories
of my mother that stand out?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
Uh, I remember she's blonde
and extremely pretty.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
And, of course, the fact
that she works with Master.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:01.805 position:50% align:center
That's all ya got?

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It's not much.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
But I guess that's
common for memories

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
regarding the people I knew
when I was a little kid.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
Touché.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Oh, wow!

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
Muffy!

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
What was that?
That yellow thing.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Maybe she'll let us take
a closer look at it.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
Take a closer look?

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
Why, I don't know
what you mean. No clue.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
That was amazing. Really.

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
When did you have time to master
such a neat trick, Hatena?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
I, uh, well.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
She didn't. That was all me.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
So it was just a trick?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
Right, I'm learning magic

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
from the great Mamoru
Hoshisato, himself.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Hatena was helping me
practice a bit.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
That makes sense.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Forgot her dad
was a famous magician.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
The dots are
starting to connect.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
I'm an apprentice,
so I can't do too much,

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
but I could show
you a few things.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
That's so cool!

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
And ta-da!

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Wow!

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS chattering, laughing]

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
Hatena. I hope you
realize you owe me now.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
Do I?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
It's time.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
Well, if I'm gonna be a butler,
better be a good one!

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I can't think
of a single task

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
that would require your
help, young Master.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
There is still
quite a bit of time

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
before we start
preparing for dinner.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
And I imagine you're
probably worn out

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
from your first day of school.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
Why not take this
opportunity to rest?

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
I can't be a butler if
there's nothing to do.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
Could you c'mere a sec, Makoto?

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Hm?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
Sure, but where are we going?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center
So, it's cool if I come in?

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Oh.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty
cute stuffed animal.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
He's a bear, right?

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
Gaugau here was a special
gift from my mom.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
Pleasure to make your
acquaintance, little guy.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
Gaugau's not a "guy,"
she's a girl.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I see it now, though.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
What does that mark mean?

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Nothing major, it's
just my mom's symbol.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Your mom, huh?

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Do you have any idea

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
when she'll make
her way back home?

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
Um. Do we call them, or...?

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
--[KANA] Makoto!
--At your service!

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.547 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Listen!

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
Get out of this mansion,
and I mean right now!

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
What?! But I thought
we had a compromise?

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I don't have time
to argue with you!

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
I'm not arguing, but what's...

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I said we don't have time!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
Just pack the bare minimum
and get as far away as you can!

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
You're not moving!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
You need to calm
down, Lady Kana.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding! How can
I be calm in this situation?

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Huh? Ah!

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:12.203 position:50% align:center
Miss. Give us an explanation
and we'll assist you.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
Lady Kokomi Kikyouin has
requested an audience with you.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
Dang it! She's already here?

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
The lady informed me that
she arranged an appointment

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
with you earlier today.

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
She is presently waiting to
speak with you in the parlor.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.311 position:50% align:center
Man. I know she's gonna
figure out you live here.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.395 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Oh, so that's why

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
you were kicking
me to the curb.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
People are gonna start saying
things, like, we're "shacked up"

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
and my reputation
will go down the drain!

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] No worries.
I'll go lock myself in my room.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
I won't come out, I promise.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
You think that's good
enough? Get real!

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.576 position:50% align:center
Locked doors can't stop someone

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
who prowls around
as much as Kokomi!

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
This is why I didn't want
her coming over here!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure we'll be able
to clean this mess

00:15:58.958 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
in a timely manner.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Hatena! Where are you?

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
[KANA grunts]

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Sheesh.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
What's it take to receive a
proper greeting around here?

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.342 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.260 position:50% align:center
Too late! She's already
started snooping!

00:16:09.344 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
Use Guard Mode to keep
Makoto outta sight, Muffy!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO yelps]

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Could someone please
tell me what's going on?

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I activated Muffy's Guard Mode,

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
which changed it into
a protective sphere.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
It's airtight and super strong,

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
so I don't see Kokomi
getting through it.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] You said that
with such confidence,

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
but this thing is huge and
sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
She'd be crazy
if she passed it by!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's just some
giant yellow ball

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
in the middle of
the dining room.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Yes. Nothing conspicuous
about it whatsoever.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO groans]

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
Oh, Hatena! Good,
I finally found you.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Jeez. You ever heard
of something called knocking?

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
I told her not to barge in,
but she wouldn't listen.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.882 position:50% align:center
Forgive her. She's just
in a particular mood.

00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI growls]

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
What do we have here?

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
This thing?
It's a gift from my dad.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
Nothing you should be
concerned about.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.019 position:50% align:center
Kind of a weird addition to
the dining room, if you ask me.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
What are you supposed
to use it for, anyway?

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
It's mainly used for...

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
It's a balancing ball
used for exercise.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
That's right!
Father wants us to stay fit!

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! I've seen these
advertised on infomercials.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
Lemme try it out!

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
Holy crap! What the--?

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
It passes the bounce test!

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
What was that?

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
I think I just heard
someone scream.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I wish there was
a way I could see outside.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
I just hit something
with my tush,

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
so I think this one's defective.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
Please, Lady Kokomi.
Step away from the ball.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
Muffy!

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
I won't let any harm come
to you so long as I live!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
Relax! No one is
trying to hurt her!

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
Move.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
I see. I was wondering
where you were.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
Hello again, Makoto Shiranui!

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
What?! You already
knew everything?

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
If a support request
is made by a member

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
of the Hoshisato family,

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
then it has to come through
the Kikyouin conglomerate.

00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
Who do you think handled
the piles of paperwork

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
for Shiranui's enrollment?

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
Of course I knew.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
But I do find it surprising
that you're here

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
as part of the staff
and not as a guest.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
Do you? Well, it's a long story.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.975 position:50% align:center
That is some really
rotten luck you've got.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
You moved in hoping to
hone your magic skills,

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
but now you're a butler

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
and the only things
you'll be making disappear

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
are the stains on
Hatena's laundry!

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Like I'd let him
near my dirty clothes!

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
I'm kidding.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.284 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Well, shall we just
cut to the chase then?

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
What chase?

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] I helped you out
of quite a sticky situation,

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
and therefore,
you are in my debt.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
I knew it! Why else would
you bother to come here?

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
You knew what?

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
I'll let you fill him in.

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not waste time
that could be used

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
to look for my future Artifact!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
Give it up!

00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
And so the hunt
begins yet again.

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But would someone
please fill me in?

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
Of course, Master Makoto.

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
It began shortly after Lady
Kana received the Artifact,

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
Findabair.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
This made Lady Kokomi so envious
that she burst into tears.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
'Twas all very tragic,
I assure you.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Master Mamoru made
her a promise.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
He challenged the young miss to
search throughout the mansion

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
in order to identify and
activate her own Artifact.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
He then told her, should she
be successful in this endeavor,

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
the Artifact would be hers.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
These things are powerful.
You can't just give them away.

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
Ah, but Lady Kokomi must
first distinguish the Artifact

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
from the wide array
of items in the mansion.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Next, she has to guess
the Artifact's true name

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
and make a contract with it.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
If she cannot
accomplish that part,

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
simply having the Artifact
will be useless.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd say that's
pretty challenging.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
That was the Master's intent.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
Although I doubt
even he anticipated

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
just how tenacious the
young lady would be.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
If he thought she would
one day forget about it,

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
he was mistaken.

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
She now visits from time to
time to conduct her search

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
in a thorough manner.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
And the mess she leaves
is always atrocious.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
Sounds like she really wants

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
one of those Artifacts
to call her own.

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Those lucky enough
to possess an Artifact

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
have the power to
obtain miracles.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Better still, should an Artifact

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
match with one person
in particular,

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
their wildest dream
can come true.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
Seems like you know your stuff
when it comes to Artifacts.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
Backing up the Hoshisatos

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
is one of the Kikyouin
family's primary duties.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
So let's just say I've done my
share of homework on Artifacts

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
and leave it at that.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Abracadabra!

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
Eko Eko Azarak!

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Are you being serious?

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
The words you should be
saying are "I quit"!

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Hmm. What a suspicious bookend.

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
It's so pretty and... blue!

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
I've got it!

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
Blue End must be your true name!

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
It's not.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Blue End! I have found you,
so answer my call!

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
Guess this one's
just another dud.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Do us all a favor
and give it a rest!

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
Besides, a contract with an
Artifact requires a payment

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
that isn't necessarily the kind
of thing you want to sacrifice.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:09.060 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Hmm.

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
[KANA groans]

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
