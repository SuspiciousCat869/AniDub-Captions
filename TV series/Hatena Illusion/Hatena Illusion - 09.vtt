Time to revert back to your
true form, Nameless Lover.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
[EMA÷} Reminds me of when
I first met Lady Maeve.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
And her no-nonsense attitude.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Her girls are so much like her.
In so many ways.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
Just like that,

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
I'm a normal teenage girl again,
without any special powers.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
It's actually a pretty big
weight off my shoulders.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
Better to be safe than sorry.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely
why I made this.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA, GAUGAU grunting]

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.440 position:50% align:center
All three of you still
have much to learn.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.818 position:50% align:center
But it will have to
be at a later date.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Good call. Thanks, Jeeves.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
What's going on Ema?

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
I would like for you
to retake the test.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.371 position:50% align:center
You mean... what Mariah
put me through?

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
I do.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
It was an excellent chance
to prove your worth

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
as the one who wields Lady
Maeve's masterpiece.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
To prove you can protect
yourself from the many dangers

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
that come with living
in this mansion.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
And to prove beyond a shadow
of a doubt that you have

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
every right to call
yourself a master thief.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Lady Kana?
I think it's what's best.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
So much so that I personally
made a deal with Lady Mariah.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
What?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
This new test will be
very similar to the first.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50% align:center
Though you'll be pursuing
another Artifact.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
Your aunt's approval is
what you really want.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
Would Mariah's approval mean
we could stay in the mansion?

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
And she won't take Gaugau?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
Or my wand?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
And she'll acknowledge
me as a master thief?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Mm-hm. She's agreed
to all of those terms.

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
No way! That's fantastic!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
Too fantastic.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
Seems fishy.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
[KANA sighs]

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
You will be infiltrating
a mansion this time.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
And the Artifact you
must acquire is this.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Sounds simple enough.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
The catch is your opponent
has numerous Artifacts.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is safe to
assume this won't be easy.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
But I have faith in you!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Okay! Any chance to be a
master thief sounds good!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Then take this.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hm?

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Knowing how important
this caper would be,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
I felt inspired and
made it for you.

Thank you, Ema!

Copy. Observing radio silence.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
They know we're coming.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
Getting in undetected
is gonna be tough.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Which are perfect working
conditions for a master thief.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center

Is that it?

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Mm-hm.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
We've done a good job of not
tripping any sensors so far.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center

Whoa.

Is there anyone that you haven't
charmed yet? Just curious.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
And all of the Artifacts in the
world belong to me.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
No one knew this was her house?

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI]
I figured it out.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Why didn't you say anything?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Does it matter?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.654 position:50% align:center
[KANA, MAKOTO gasp]

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI whimpers]

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
Welcome home, pookie pies!

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
So you've returned.
Glad to see you're safe.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
Ignored again.
But it's just a phase.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
Puberty won't last forever.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on
a job well done!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
Thank you,

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
but how could you risk
something so special to you?

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Simple. It's just what
needed to be done.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
And seeing you fight in order to
reclaim something so dear to me

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
was worth the gamble.
My "maidcraft" paid off.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, the catchy,
manga-esque phrase

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
"maidcraft" came from the
depths of my own mind.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
Although we did get it back,

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
unfortunately, it still
involved sacrifice.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
We're sorry.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
It's fine. What's a risk
without any danger?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
I knew that something
like this might happen.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
Ema...

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
I need only ask and Lady Maeve
will repair it for me.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
Guess that's true. Once she
finally comes home, that is.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
[EMA] What's important
here is Lady Mariah

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
has no choice but to
acknowledge your success.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I have long awaited
to make this report.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
Allow me to handle it from here.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
Do you know what those things
are to her? Either of you.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
You know why she treasures them?

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
Sort of.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that Mama
gave her the brooch as a gift.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
It appears your test isn't
as finished as we'd thought.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Why would Ema negotiate
a silly retest for my sake

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
using her personal Artifact?

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
Doesn't make sense.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Master.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
Would figuring out Ema's motive
put an official end to our test?

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
My boy. Telling you
would be helping you,

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
and magicians don't get help
when they're up on stage.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
You should pass on your own.
And not just Mariah's challenge.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.573 position:50% align:center
I want you to overcome
all obstacles.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO grunts]
Fair enough.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] No harm in one
little hint, though!

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.038 position:50% align:center
You know how Jeeves
is not only an Artifact,

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
but also an essential part to
this entire mansion?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.668 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Mm-hm.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
Tell them, Jeeves.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
How many years have you
served as a butler here?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Give or take a few,
probably somewhere around 200.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
You're ancient!

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Maeve's Artifacts
were inevitably bound

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
to fall into the wrong
hands at some point.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
But the mansion could
serve as a fortress.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
We needed it in order
to protect her creations.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
So Maeve stole it
from Lároutir Village.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
On the day of this grand theft,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
I was easily captured
by Mother Morrigan.

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU] Once Maeve and her
mother were able to talk it out,

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
we finally managed to
relocate the mansion to Japan.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a complete
takeover, though.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
Even so, the ever eminent
Jeeves watched over us

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.805 position:50% align:center
as if we were the
exclusive owners.

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
I do what I can.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
He's a treasure
in every sense.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
And tons of people
are after him.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
what I'm getting at?

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
That us being here is
holding you back.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
No, Kana.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
Seems like both you and Makoto
have some thinking to do.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO, KANA sigh]

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Come in.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
The world around you was made

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
by one of my seven Artifacts.

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
It can create isolated
space on command.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Are you implying
that you have the power

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
to lock me up in here?

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like you pose a threat
to me without an Artifact.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
Have a seat.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but maids must stand.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Sit down.
There's no need to fill me in.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
Tominozawa already called and
sobbed through the whole story.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
[EMA] One less thing for
me to worry about, then.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
That's that. They passed.

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
The girls are free to
live in the mansion now.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
You believe I would
keep a promise like that?

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
Yes. Yes, indeed I do!

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
On your honor as Maeve's younger
sister, I think you will.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] I'm surprised you can
say "honor" and "Maeve" together

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
when she ran off and eloped
while I was away at school.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.924 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
[EMA] A scratch or two
is a small price to pay

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.220 position:50% align:center
for something like freedom.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH sighs] I wasn't
trying to deprive my nieces

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
of their freedom. I was trying
to keep them out of danger.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, Ema.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
Do you enjoy dragging those
children down the same path

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
I was forced to walk as a child,

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:04.070 position:50% align:center
or do you even realize
what you're doing?

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
How very kind of you.
Your concern is most endearing.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey! What I do is for
the village and nothing more!

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Ngh!

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
You're gonna go get
those Artifacts back?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
But you'll do it as a robber?

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
I prefer the term,
"master thief."

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
[EMA whimpers]

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
If you go, I'll be
all alone again.

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center
That kind of thinking
is very silly.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm being silly is...

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
So please... don't leave me!

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] You win. But that means
you'll have to come with me,

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
since I still have to go,
so I'll have to test you first.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
I wish I could somehow forget

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
the grueling trial
that followed.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
Jeeves should learn some
restraint when it comes pushing

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
nine-year-olds to
their breaking point.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
Thank you, Nameless Lover.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
[TOMINOZAWA giggles]

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
Because I invited her.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
Thanks for your service.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
Here's the payment
we agreed upon.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
Did my Tomi-Tomi Slime miss
Mommy as much as she missed you?

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
You're seriously
giving her that?

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
She is under contract to
donate her vast collection

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.700 position:50% align:center
to the village
upon her death.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.994 position:50% align:center
So actually, the Artifact is
being lent to Lady Tominozawa,

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
not given.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
And someone who is in such
good standing with the family

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
was the perfect opponent
for your test.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
Oh, Jeeves, apple of my eye.

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
Please see to it that
the damaged Artifact

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
is repaired soon.

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
Certainly. I'll ask
my sister to fix it.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
You will? If Mom
can fix Artifacts,

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
then that's news to me.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the smart one?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
All a practical magician has
to do is look at an Artifact's

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
crest and they'll have its true
name, toll, and creation method,

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
or so I'm told.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Whoa.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Mm!

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
It worked?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
With this power, Ema's Artifact
will be as good as new!

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
Hope you don't mind
that we dropped by!

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
I don't mind in the slightest

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
as long as you're not
here to apologize.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
We're here because
we have an idea!

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
We don't have to wait for Mother
to come fix your Artifact.

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
We can do it now!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
By using Yumemi's power
and the Lároutir crest!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
We'd at least like
to give it a try!

Mom's Artifact is
drawing it out.

Please don't overexert
yourself on my account.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Yeah, the kid was
straight up abandoned,

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
but I managed to raise
her right. He, he, he.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate
it if you all left.

You're the one it belongs to.

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I'm sorry I
didn't get here sooner.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Stop it. I don't know you.
And you don't know me.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I know that
maid uniform and brooch

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
are very dangerous items.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
Would you let me
keep them for you?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
[EMA]
No. Absolutely not.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
[EMA] These are all my
parents left behind.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
You can't have them.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Ah. Well, I guess....

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
I don't have much choice.
I'll have to steal you as well.

[EMA gasps]

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
[EMA] It appears that you bore
witness to a rather embarrassing

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
moment in my life.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
Ema. Was that?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
My parents helped me
escape a grim fate.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
That uniform was
their only remnant.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
Maeve knew exactly
how priceless it was

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
and turned it into an Artifact I
could wear whenever I wanted.

[KANA] My second chance
should not have cost you

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
something like that.

[EMA]
What's done is done, Lady Kana.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
I decided to call this
brooch "Nameless Lover."

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
I never received
a name from them,

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
but I know my
parents still loved me,

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
and this Artifact is a
testament of that love.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
There was no guarantee
we were gonna pass!

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
I was convinced failure
wasn't an option for you.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
And even if I had been wrong,

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
I don't think I would have
regretted what I did.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
Anyhoo, I am in dire
need of a hot bath!

00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
If you'll excuse me.

[EMA sobs]

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
I came here so I could be alone.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I know. But I never
gave you a proper apology

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
for breaking your Artifact.

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
[EMA] There is nothing
to apologize for.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
It broke because of
the bargain I made.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling
you would say that.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
Ema, listen.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
You may not want to hear it, but
I need to tell you I'm sorry.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
How can I become the
master thief of my dreams

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
when I'm a pro at
dishing sadness out,

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
but a novice at
stealing it away?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.339 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry for what
you had to endure.

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
And how sad it must've made you.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
My... What else can I say,
except for "thank you."

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
And don't worry. You're becoming
a fine master thief.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
The kind that snatches the
tears right from under

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
children's eyes and
makes them smile.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
Ema...

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[EMA] Just like your
mother did for me.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
Foul play! It's as childish
as it is rubbish!

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
[GREGORY]
What are you on about?

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're upset
because you can't do it,

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
then that would mean
Makoto passes.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
You call that passing?

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
Sawing someone in half
is bloody unoriginal!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
I hereby accept you
as my apprentice!

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
I knew if you only
opened your mind,

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
you could overcome anything.
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
Sure does!

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Uncle may accept him,
but I refuse.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
[DINA] Uncle may accept him,

Gau, gau.

Gau, gau... gau!
