I have a little something
for you, Kana. Here.

[KANA]
Huh?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.848 position:50% align:center
A precious,
one-of-a-kind treasure,

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
handed down through our

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
I now entrust it to you.

[MAKOTO] I've been here
for one whole month now.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
Promise you won't push
yourself too hard, dear.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.840 position:50% align:center
Just follow your dreams and
do what makes you happy.

called for a chauffeur, but no!

Right?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
You want me to join you?

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
I don't see a problem with that.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.224 position:50% align:center
You ladies are no different
from family in the Hoshisato

be treated as such.

[MAKOTO] I bet Hatena
will want a nice bath.

She has to be freezing
in those wet clothes.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center

Gotta make up for that!

anxious enough already.

Please release your captive.

[MAKOTO]
There! That oughta do it!

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] I think you forgot to
remove a rather prominent

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
piece of your wardrobe.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.

Does he want to bathe with us?

simply out of the question.

you smell reminds me of my mom.

You're getting way too worked up
over some silly accident.

won't stop happening!

wondering about something.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
It's clear you're not big
on boys, so why torment

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
Makoto by inviting him
here to live with you?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
Our research division was
kinda surprised by that, too.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Makoto may or may not have
looked slightly different

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
when we were little kids.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center

[KANA whimpers]

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Let me get this straight.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you thought
Makoto was a girl

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
all these years? For real?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
[KANA gasps]
He has such a pretty-boy face,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
how's it my fault
I got confused?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Girl, you need contacts.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Granted Makoto did
come off rather princely,

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
even when I thought
he was a she.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
But what's wrong with
a girl who acts cool

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
and wants to dress up
in boy clothes?

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Absolutely nothing!
So I figured, yeah...

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
You already know what I figured.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Wow. You don't see
too many instances

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
where a guy's good looks
work against him like this.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
[KANA] What do you think
I should do, Kokomi?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Hm. First off,
you need to sit down together

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
and have a nice, long chat.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
I apologize.
I'm far too careless

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
and as a result I keep
making all these mistakes.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
Fret not. Fortunately for you,
lechery is an indispensable

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
part of being the
leading man in any story.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
I wasn't that concerned
about it to begin with.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
I'm just sorry you had to see
me in such an indecent state.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
The only thing I'm sorry about
is that you didn't join us.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
Not funny, Yumemi! Not at all!
It's too soon to joke about it!

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
Calm down. It's not like
everyone else here is perfect.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
Surely you can recall an
incident where you made

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
a pretty big mistake. Now might
be the time to come clean.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
You know, while someone's
not in a position to be upset?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
Makoto? I, uh,
need you to listen.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
There's something kind of
important you should know.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
And there you have it.
I'm so sorry.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
Up until we reunited
about a month ago,

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
something in my mind had me
convinced that you were a girl.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
I see. That does explain why
I seem to always trigger you.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
On behalf of the entire
Hoshisato family,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
I offer you my most sincere
apologies, Master Makoto.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I should be
the one saying "sorry".

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
I didn't know why
you were so upset

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
and I never bothered to learn.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
I... I'll leave and rent
a room somewhere else.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
That's a fairly rash
decision to make.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Not when you stop and think
about it for a second.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
All of this could've been
avoided if I wasn't relying

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
on this family's hospitality.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
Hatena.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if I occasionally
came over to learn magic?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
Hatena.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
Why would you say something
like that and act as if

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
the promise we made to be
partners never happened?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
Please don't misunderstand.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
I was only trying to make
things better for you

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
since living with a boy
makes you uncomfortable.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
You're right. From the moment
you got here, I told you to go.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
You said, "Don't misunderstand,"
but that's all I've been doing.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
So really the only person
I have to blame is myself!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
I know what I've said,
and I know what I've done.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
But I've been waiting
for you all this time!

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Whatever! I don't care anymore!

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center

[door clatters]

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
Might be a good idea if Mariah
and I spent the night.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
I can sleep in Hatena's bedroom.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry
too much about her.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
You can talk tomorrow morning
when she's less grumpy.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
After the storm, comes the calm.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
She just got a lot
off her chest.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
She'll come around given
some time, wait 'n' see!

Ladies and gentlemen!

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to be
utterly amazed?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
For this trick,

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
I will need a volunteer
from the audience.

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
You there!

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Seems this young man
likes to play rough.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
How'd you hurt yourself?

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps,sobs]

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
Everything's okay.
Can you turn towards me?

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
Abra-cadabra.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
Your tears disappeared!

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Hold out your hands.
This is for you.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]
That's unbelievable!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot!

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
Hey, now! Save some
of that astonishment

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
for when I start
performing my tricks!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chatters]

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Mister! Please teach
me the ways of your magic!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
And what's spurred
this desire of yours?

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I got bullied today, sir.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
But as soon as you started
performing your tricks,

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
I forgot about the bullies
and how sad I was!

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
Making sadness go
away with magic

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
has to be the
coolest thing ever!

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
I wanna magically turn
peoples' frowns into smiles

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
the same way you do!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I think you might
just have the talent it takes,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
sweetheart.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing
that's okay to steal.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
It's the sadness of others.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
And you figured that out
all on your own, didn't you?

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
When you get older, I'd like
you to come find me again

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
and prove you're a man
who can keep a promise.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Once you do, I'll teach you
everything I know about magic.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
You're on!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO sighs] Making one
of my closest friends cry

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
means I've royally
failed as a magician.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Some partner I turned out to be.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
Why would you say something
like that and act as if

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
the promise we made to be
partners never happened?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
If we're sharing a stage,
then that'll make us partners,

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
won't it?

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's a promise!

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]
That's it!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
Hatena wasn't agreeing
to be my partner in magic!

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
She wanted a partner in
crime--er, I mean thievery!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
Yet another misunderstanding.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] But there could still
be a way to set this right.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
Thank you...
for staying with me.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
[KANA] It's not the end of
the world if I don't have

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
a master thief partner.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Then again,
can I really blame Makoto

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
for leaving after the
awful way I've treated him?

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
I have so many
mixed feelings that

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
what I want now.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Your chill pill taking effect?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You're awake?
So, um, about earlier.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Friends cut
each other some slack.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
No! But it was just there!

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
You know some people
are trying to sleep!

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you?

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
It's not here! It's gone!

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
What are you talking about?

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
You good, Sis?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
[KANA] No! I can't find the
family crest anywhere!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
[EMA] This is the only open
window in the whole house.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] If an intruder
attempted to enter from outside,

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
a defensive Artifact would
have surely responded.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
Then that means
they were inside?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to pry,
Lady Kokomi,

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
but where's your bodyguard?

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] I'm not sure.
I can't find her.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
she's the culprit?

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI grunts]

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
You okay, Yumemi?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI exhales]
This is my fault. Sorry Hatena.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
I allowed someone
I trusted to betray us.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
Please don't beat
yourself up about this.

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.407 position:50% align:center
We should do a quick
survey of the mansion

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
to ensure nothing
else is gone.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
I also think it'd be
best for Lady Kokomi

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
to inform her parents.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
Yumemi?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
I'm on it.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Mariah's distinguishing
features are blond hair

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
and big boobs. That's a
pretty rare combo in Japan,

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
so she should be easy to find.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Consider my mind blown.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Her PC is an Artifact.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
And she's the only one
who's able to access it.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
Target spotted.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] With the help of
security camera footage

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
and transit data,
I'm predicting her escape route.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Looks like you'll have
the highest probability

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
of finding her...
at... Tokyo Bay.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yumemi!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
I'm okay. Just sleepy is all.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
This is the toll to use
my Artifact. Your turn now.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
Get the crest.
It's up to you two.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Makoto. Look after my sister.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Mm?

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
That lady stole from
the wrong family!

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're not planning
on going alone, right?

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
Take Ema or Kokomi, too!

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I'm a master thief.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
Stuff like this is
part of the trade.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Plus, Mother entrusted that
crest specifically to me!

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
At least let me go with you!

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
[KANA] No way! If I involve
you in anything dangerous,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Mother and Father will give me
the scolding of the century!

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] You're scared of
getting yelled at but not this?

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Muffy.
Golden Wings, activate!

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
And lead the way!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
She's really gone.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[KANA yelps, grunts]

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
I'm already heating up.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
I'd better take care of
business as soon as possible,

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
before my body gives out.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
At least let me go with you!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the sentiment...

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
...but this particular promise
is between my mother and me.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] It appears
Lady Kana has dashed off

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
to handle matters by herself.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
This turn of events alarmed
Ema and Lady Kokomi,

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
thus they are now
preparing to retrieve her.

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Am I really so powerless
that all I can do is wait?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Power requires
some sort of sacrifice,

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
or toll, if you will.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
And that toll is often times not
equivalent to what is obtained.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Regardless, people still
seek out power

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
and whatever
else they desire.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
The real question isn't
what can you do,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
but what you want to do.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
You're asking me what I want?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
More than anything, I want to
see the people around me smile.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Your artifact is
currently in overdrive.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
It seems the conditions
to complete your contract

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
have been met.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Does this mean
what I think it means?

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
AirgetlÃ¡m is the true name
that belongs to your wand.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
You were unaware,
but it is an Artifact.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Knowing its true
name as well as giving it

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
a provisional name of
your own invention is what

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
secures a contract
with an Artifact.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
Go forth, Master Makoto,

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
and protect those
smiles you wish to see.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
Were Lady Kana here,
I have no doubt

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
she would feel the
precisely the same way.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
AirgetlÃ¡m.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Contract with me so we
can go help Hatena!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
Your name will be...

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Muffy. Do you sense
the crest anywhere?

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
That boat doesn't look
like it belongs.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Quite frankly,

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
with that top hat and frilly

Mariah!

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
I had my doubts,

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.959 position:50% align:center
but it looks like you
were the thief all along!

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Brilliant deduction.
Though the fact that

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
you're calling me a thief
is a bit hypocritical.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Give it back now!

[MARIAH grunts]

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Nice try.
But close doesn't cut it.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
Underestimating the daughter
of Maeve? Bad move.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Muffy! Sword mode activate!

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
All right, let's see what
you've got. Green Servants!

[MARIAH]
I was honestly trying to avoid

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
getting so rough with you.
Forgive me.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
And why would I?

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
Because I had no choice
but to reclaim the crest

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
since it's a key part in
creating new Artifacts.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.977 position:50% align:center
Although my sister is the
one who can use it best,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
there are still plenty
of people who would

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
do anything to get
their hands on it.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
If your sister can use
it best, then that means...

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
It may be late, but allow me
to introduce myself.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
I am the younger sister of your
mother and therefore your aunt.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
I'm only here because the elder
told me to get close to you

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
and take back the family crest.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
No. You're a liar!

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Now you know why I wanted

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
to settle this peacefully.

[GREEN SERVANTS growl]

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center

just never work out

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
the way you plan them to.

Go report this to Lady Mariah!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
It seems the element of
surprise wasn't on our side

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
after all.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
If we're going to stand
any chance of winning,

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
we're going to need
an unexpected hero

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
to save the day.

I hear you loud and clear.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH] Finally. I thought
you'd never settle down.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
I can't guarantee no
harm will come to you

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
should you make the
poor choice to resist.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
Sorry Muffy.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
It looks like the ship
is ready to set sail.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center

Wait!

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
Farewell, my adorable,
yet misguided niece.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
I'd say, "Till we meet again,"
but we won't.

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Tsk! Am I really not
strong enough to stop her?

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Mama,

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
but I don't think I can
keep the promise I made.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
I'm the magnificent
Makoto Shiranui!

I'll explain
everything later, okay?

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] I think it's time
you returned what you stole.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
I think not.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Besides, even if I did give them
back, this wouldn't be over.

There are lots of people
pursuing Artifacts,

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center

much grief, so I'll take it all!

There's only one thing
that's okay to steal.

It's the sadness of others.

not much different from mine!

the sadness, then I'll preserve

think other people

will go as easy
on you as I have.

That's as incredible as
being a master thief.

00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
So what do ya say, Hatena?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
Do you think I'll shape up
to be a decent partner?

No, I don't.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center

way more than decent.

Yeah?

you as my partner. Duh.

You kept your promise after
all this time. Thank you!

Sure.

I meant to say that
in a very strict
