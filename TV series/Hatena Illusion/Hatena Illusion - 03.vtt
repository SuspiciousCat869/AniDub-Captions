Ladies and gentlemen!

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to be
utterly amazed?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU]
For this trick,

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
I will need a volunteer
from the audience.

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
You there!

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Seems this young man
likes to play rough.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
How'd you hurt yourself?

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps,sobs]

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
Everything's okay.
Can you turn towards me?

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
Abra-cadabra.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
Your tears disappeared!

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.637 position:50% align:center
Hold out your hands.
This is for you.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]
That's unbelievable!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot!

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
Hey, now! Save some
of that astonishment

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
for when I start
performing my tricks!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chatters]

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] Mister! Please teach
me the ways of your magic!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
And what's spurred
this desire of yours?

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
I got bullied today, sir.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
But as soon as you started
performing your tricks,

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
I forgot about the bullies
and how sad I was!

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
Making sadness go
away with magic

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
has to be the
coolest thing ever!

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
I wanna magically turn
peoples' frowns into smiles

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
the same way you do!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
[MAEVE] I think you might
just have the talent it takes,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
sweetheart.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing
that's okay to steal.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
It's the sadness of others.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
And you figured that out
all on your own, didn't you?

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
When you get older, I'd like
you to come find me again

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
and prove you're a man
who can keep a promise.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Once you do, I'll teach you
everything I know about magic.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
You're on!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO sighs] Making one
of my closest friends cry

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
means I've royally
failed as a magician.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Some partner I turned out to be.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
Why would you say something
like that and act as if

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
the promise we made to be
partners never happened?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
If we're sharing a stage,
then that'll make us partners,

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
won't it?

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.758 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
That's a promise!

00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]
That's it!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
Hatena wasn't agreeing
to be my partner in magic!

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
She wanted a partner in
crime--er, I mean thievery!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
Yet another misunderstanding.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] But there could still
be a way to set this right.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
Thank you...
for staying with me.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
[KANA] It's not the end of
the world if I don't have

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
a master thief partner.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Then again,
can I really blame Makoto

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
for leaving after the
awful way I've treated him?

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
I have so many
mixed feelings that

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
I don't even know
what I want now.

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
Your chill pill taking effect?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[KANA] You're awake?
So, um, about earlier.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] Friends cut
each other some slack.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
No! But it was just there!

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.031 position:50% align:center
You know some people
are trying to sleep!

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.074 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you?

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
It's not here! It's gone!

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI]
What are you talking about?

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
You good, Sis?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
[KANA] No! I can't find the
family crest anywhere!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
[EMA] This is the only open
window in the whole house.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] If an intruder
attempted to enter from outside,

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
a defensive Artifact would
have surely responded.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
Then that means
they were inside?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to pry,
Lady Kokomi,

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
but where's your bodyguard?

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI] I'm not sure.
I can't find her.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
Are you saying
she's the culprit?

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI grunts]

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
You okay, Yumemi?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
[KOKOMI exhales]
This is my fault. Sorry Hatena.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
I allowed someone
I trusted to betray us.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.530 position:50% align:center
Please don't beat
yourself up about this.

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.407 position:50% align:center
We should do a quick
survey of the mansion

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
to ensure nothing
else is gone.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
I also think it'd be
best for Lady Kokomi

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
to inform her parents.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
Yumemi?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
I'm on it.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] Mariah's distinguishing
features are blond hair

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
and big boobs. That's a
pretty rare combo in Japan,

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
so she should be easy to find.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Consider my mind blown.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Her PC is an Artifact.

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
And she's the only one
who's able to access it.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
Target spotted.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
[YUMEMI] With the help of
security camera footage

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
and transit data,
I'm predicting her escape route.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Looks like you'll have
the highest probability

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:59.279 position:50% align:center
of finding her...
at... Tokyo Bay.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Yumemi!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
I'm okay. Just sleepy is all.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
This is the toll to use
my Artifact. Your turn now.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
Get the crest.
It's up to you two.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO gasps]

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Makoto. Look after my sister.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Mm?

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
That lady stole from
the wrong family!

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're not planning
on going alone, right?

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
Take Ema or Kokomi, too!

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I'm a master thief.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
Stuff like this is
part of the trade.

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Plus, Mother entrusted that
crest specifically to me!

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
At least let me go with you!

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
[KANA] No way! If I involve
you in anything dangerous,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Mother and Father will give me
the scolding of the century!

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO] You're scared of
getting yelled at but not this?

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:45.283 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Muffy.
Golden Wings, activate!

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
And lead the way!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
She's really gone.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[KANA yelps, grunts]

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
I'm already heating up.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
I'd better take care of
business as soon as possible,

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
before my body gives out.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
At least let me go with you!

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the sentiment...

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
...but this particular promise
is between my mother and me.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] It appears
Lady Kana has dashed off

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
to handle matters by herself.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
This turn of events alarmed
Ema and Lady Kokomi,

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
thus they are now
preparing to retrieve her.

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Am I really so powerless
that all I can do is wait?

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.163 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Power requires
some sort of sacrifice,

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
or toll, if you will.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
And that toll is often times not
equivalent to what is obtained.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Regardless, people still
seek out power

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
and whatever
else they desire.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
The real question isn't
what can you do,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
but what you want to do.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
You're asking me what I want?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
More than anything, I want to
see the people around me smile.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Your artifact is
currently in overdrive.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
It seems the conditions
to complete your contract

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
have been met.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Does this mean
what I think it means?

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
Airgetlám is the true name
that belongs to your wand.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
You were unaware,
but it is an Artifact.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[JEEVES] Knowing its true
name as well as giving it

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
a provisional name of
your own invention is what

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
secures a contract
with an Artifact.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
Go forth, Master Makoto,

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
and protect those
smiles you wish to see.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.095 position:50% align:center
Were Lady Kana here,
I have no doubt

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
she would feel the
precisely the same way.

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[MAKOTO]
Airgetlám.

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Contract with me so we
can go help Hatena!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
Your name will be...

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
[KANA] Muffy. Do you sense
the crest anywhere?

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
That boat doesn't look
like it belongs.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
[MARIAH]
Quite frankly,

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
with that top hat and frilly
