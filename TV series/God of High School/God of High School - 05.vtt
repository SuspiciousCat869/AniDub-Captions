TaeKwonDo user Mori Jin,

and Brazilian jujitsu
user Jaehee Byeun.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your finishing move
on Manseok Kang,

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:19.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
hate to break it to you,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
but those little kicks
won't work on me, Mori!

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:27.075 position:10% line:89% align:start

devastating strength!

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:51.699 position:13% line:83% align:start
The finals will feature
Mori Jin versus Daewi Han.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:54.602 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which one of them will win
the chance of a lifetime?

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
The right to participate

God of High School tournament!

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:04.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
They say I can probably
go home tomorrow.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.881 position:24% line:89% align:start
Pretty wild, huh?

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.951 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't know anything about
these so-called nanomachines,

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:14.122 position:7% line:83% align:start
but they yelled at me for
not coming here to be treated

00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:15.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
back when I got hurt.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, I didn't think injuries

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
sustained outside the
tournament would be treated too.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
Someone should have told me.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't get any dumb ideas.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.137 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's not someone you can beat

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you're gonna
overthink everything.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
Daewi beat me.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
I lost because I
was the weaker one.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.011 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's simple.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:39.446 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mori] But Mira, he hurt you.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.449 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mira] That's part of
what I'm talking about.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:45.418 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need to strive to
win no matter what,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I'm clearly still
not good enough yet.

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I just never thought
he'd be the type of guy

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.195 position:19% line:89% align:start
who'd fight like that.

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's unquestionably
a part of who he is.

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:58.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
The fists don't lie.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:00.835 position:41% line:89% align:start
We ...

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't know what
made him that way,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.072 position:5% line:89% align:start
or much about him at all really.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:10.611 position:30% line:89% align:start
His condition?

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:13.380 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, unfortunately it
hasn't changed much,

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.384 position:24% line:83% align:start
though he did wake
up for a minute

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
and he actually said he
really wanted to see you.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:47.248 position:7% line:83% align:start
At last, ladies and
gentlemen, the time has come.

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.348 position:19% line:89% align:start
The final round of the

(crowd cheering)

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:57.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
First to enter the
arena is Mori Jin.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.395 position:13% line:89% align:start
And now we have Daewi Han.

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.398 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:09.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is today the day the
tiger cub awakens?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fighters, take your positions.

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.473 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

00:06:13.975 --> 00:06:14.942 position:44% line:89% align:start

(Daewi grunting)

00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:42.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
What an incredible start!

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.537 position:13% line:89% align:start
The match has barely begun

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
and neither fighter
is yielding an inch.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:52.280 position:27% line:89% align:start

(Daewi groans)

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.316 position:30% line:89% align:start
An even match?

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:29.750 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:31.185 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's still a
slight difference

00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:32.787 position:13% line:89% align:start
in raw skill between them.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
If this drags out, the
disadvantage one will be,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.161 position:10% line:83% align:start
well, I'm sure he's well
aware of that fact himself.

Yeah, sorry,

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:15.656 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I've never thought
of you as my friends!

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:20.394 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori groans)

Secret Art: Form
of the Four Gods.

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:25.132 position:30% line:89% align:start
First Stance:

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:26.333 position:27% line:89% align:start
Black Tortoise!

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
I appreciate it,
Sumi, but you know,

00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:33.074 position:5% line:89% align:start
I could carry that stuff myself.

00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:33.874 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:35.276 position:7% line:89% align:start
You are not to lift a finger.

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:37.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll take care of you until
you're all better, okay?

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:39.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll go get your
discharge settled.

00:09:39.447 --> 00:09:41.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
You girls wait for
me in the lobby.

00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:42.249 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:43.451 position:27% line:89% align:start
This way, Mira.

00:09:43.484 --> 00:09:45.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) It's this
way, silly goose.

00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:46.787 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:48.557 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make sure you follow
really close behind me

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.424 position:10% line:89% align:start
so you don't get lost, okay?

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:51.625 position:33% line:89% align:start
You got it.

00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:53.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
This hospital is huge, you know.

00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:54.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
(wristband beeping)

00:09:54.495 --> 00:09:56.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want to get lost,

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:57.598 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mira Voiceover] Interesting.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:59.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
So there's someone
else in this hospital

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:02.203 position:19% line:83% align:start
who's undergoing
nanomachine treatment?

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:05.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sumi] so I know exactly
where the lobby is.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.307 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh.
-Mira?

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.308 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you behind me?

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.976 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa, careful there.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:09.977 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm, yep.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.813 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doors whirring)

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:19.120 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae's sister crying)

00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:20.654 position:30% line:89% align:start
Seungtae, no!

00:10:20.688 --> 00:10:22.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, please wake up!

00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:28.696 position:10% line:83% align:start
You still want to settle the
score with Daewi, don't you?

00:10:30.565 --> 00:10:31.632 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seungtae!

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:35.769 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae's sister crying)

00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:37.638 position:19% line:89% align:start
Form of the Four Gods.

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:38.873 position:30% line:89% align:start
First Stance:

00:10:41.543 --> 00:10:43.010 position:27% line:89% align:start
Black Tortoise!

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:46.013 position:30% line:89% align:start
Second Stance:

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:49.250 position:27% line:89% align:start
Vermilion Bird!

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:54.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mujin] I've heard
what your wish is.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:57.691 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you win the national God
of High School tournament,

00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:59.660 position:21% line:83% align:start
you want us to treat
your sick friend

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.129 position:19% line:83% align:start
using our nanomachine
technology.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:04.732 position:19% line:83% align:start
Except it'll be too
late for him by then.

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:08.669 position:30% line:89% align:start
Third Stance:

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:09.870 position:33% line:89% align:start
White Tiger!

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:15.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Daewi grunting)
-(Mori groaning)

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.578 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:18.112 position:16% line:89% align:start
We will make a contract.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're able to achieve
victory in tomorrow's semifinals

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.352 position:7% line:89% align:start
and the finals following that,

00:11:25.386 --> 00:11:29.023 position:7% line:83% align:start
which makes you the winner of
the Seoul preliminaries ...

00:11:29.056 --> 00:11:31.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Daewi grunting)

00:11:34.596 --> 00:11:37.431 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori groaning)

00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:42.937 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm still just warming up.

00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:45.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's all over for you now.

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:47.474 position:33% line:89% align:start
Last Stance:

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:54.782 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunting)

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:56.750 position:30% line:89% align:start
Azure Dragon!

00:12:00.655 --> 00:12:03.757 position:21% line:89% align:start
(explosion rumbling)

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.838 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori coughs)

00:12:22.977 --> 00:12:25.479 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Mori Jin is down!

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:27.616 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:30.451 position:5% line:89% align:start
10, nine, eight, seven, six ...

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.122 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just heard that your friend,

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:38.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seungtae Woo, has
taken his final breath.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:39.793 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Three, two ...

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:42.697 position:33% line:83% align:start
And he's up!
(crowd gasping)

00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:44.599 position:24% line:83% align:start
He managed to get
back to his feet

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:46.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
right before he was counted out.

00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:49.203 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori panting)

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:55.610 position:19% line:89% align:start
(indistinct murmuring)

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:56.745 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Student A] It's Daewi Han.

00:12:56.777 --> 00:12:58.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
I heard he beat the
shit out of the guys

00:12:58.713 --> 00:12:59.913 position:16% line:89% align:start
from West Middle again.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.917 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Student B] I heard he beat up
every one of their students.

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:04.985 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Student C] He's trouble, man.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.554 position:13% line:89% align:start
Better steer clear of him.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
Out of my way, dumbass!

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.860 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry, man, my bad.

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:17.364 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae sighs)

00:13:17.398 --> 00:13:19.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Daewi breathing heavily)

00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:20.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
Poor kid.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:22.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
All your little
buddies turned chicken

00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:24.805 position:13% line:83% align:start
and ran off with their
tails between their legs.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess that's the
best you can do.

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:28.876 position:13% line:89% align:start
Pretty sad if you ask me.

00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:31.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are you laughing?

00:13:31.746 --> 00:13:33.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll wipe that smile off your--

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.916 position:30% line:89% align:start
(punk groans)

00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:38.653 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi gasps)

00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:39.887 position:41% line:89% align:start
Y-you?

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:43.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
I heard a rumor that
you busted in here

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
all by yourself to
try and save your pal.

00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:48.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look at you being a
loyal friend and all.

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:51.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
You his buddy too?

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:53.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll knock the shit
out of both of you then!

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:54.703 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:57.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
(somber music)

00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.174 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ow. Geez, man.

00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:04.546 position:7% line:83% align:start
In the end we sent them all
crying home to their mommies.

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:06.847 position:7% line:89% align:start
When you go tell your buddies,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.550 position:7% line:89% align:start
they're not gonna believe it.

00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:11.385 position:16% line:89% align:start
They're not my buddies.

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:12.319 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah?

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:13.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon as things stopped
going their way,

00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:15.557 position:21% line:89% align:start
they're outta there.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
So honestly, I just use them

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:19.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
when it's convenient for me too.

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:20.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's all it is.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have some faith in them.

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:26.568 position:19% line:83% align:start
The more you trust and
believe in someone,

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:28.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
the more they'll trust you too.

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:30.404 position:38% line:89% align:start
Always.

00:14:33.474 --> 00:14:36.243 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Daewi groaning)

00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:42.717 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Daewi Han is down!

00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:47.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
10, nine, eight,
seven, six, five ...

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.728 position:7% line:89% align:start
Daewi Han's back to his feet.

00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:54.763 position:30% line:89% align:start
Resume match!

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:56.196 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunting)

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
After using his
greatest secret art,

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:01.669 position:21% line:83% align:start
Daewi Han's now
the one on defense.

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:04.739 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is he gonna be able to get
his head back in this fight?

00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:08.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Daewi and Mori grunting)

00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:11.011 position:24% line:89% align:start
Renewal TaeKwonDo:

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:12.946 position:33% line:89% align:start
Round Kick!

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:16.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mujin] His condition
was already touch and go

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.786 position:21% line:89% align:start
when we reached him.

00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:20.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
They had started his
nanomachine treatment,

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:21.656 position:21% line:89% align:start
but it was too late.

00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:25.827 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our contract is null and void.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now you can do things
however you please.

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:33.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
The match isn't even over yet.

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why of all times did
you tell him now?

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:39.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
When a man is at his lowest,

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
you then see who he is
and what he's made of.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is it me or is
Daewi not blocking?

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:47.615 position:19% line:83% align:start
If he's not gonna give
this thing his all

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:49.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
then he might as well just quit.

00:15:49.517 --> 00:15:52.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
Daewi Han, you hang
in there, okay?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.389 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunting)

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Daewi Voiceover] Yeah,
sorry, but I've never

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunts)

00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:08.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
