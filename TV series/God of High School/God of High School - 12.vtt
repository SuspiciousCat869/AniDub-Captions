Our great God, who was

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:43.645 position:10% line:83% align:start
Our omnipotent God and

[Jaesan] My grandson.

00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:25.385 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will avenge you.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.921 position:35% line:89% align:start
I promise.

00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:29.489 position:10% line:89% align:start

Jegal.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.470 position:10% line:83% align:start

(Jegal's mother

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:27.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, got it.

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:31.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
The deposit's been
made into the account.

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:35.083 position:16% line:83% align:start
Frankly, blood relations
are worth nothing.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only way I measure
someone's worth

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.486 position:13% line:83% align:start
is through their abilities
and their strength.

You have all the
qualifications to be my heir,

who will inherit
everything I've worked for.

Remember this well.

People like her are
what we call losers.

-Say you're sorry!

-(Ilpyo grunting)

-Calm down!
-Let me go!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Guard] I said calm down!

(Ilpyo yelling)

(Jegal groaning)

00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:09.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
Losers want to find
someone or some reason

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.219 position:13% line:89% align:start
to blame for their defeat.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.253 position:13% line:89% align:start
Winners do no such thing.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
From they beginning,
they believe in

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
and own their claim to
victory and make it happen.

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:23.231 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energy whooshing)

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.235 position:16% line:83% align:start
And winners do that, no
matter what it takes.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energy whooshing)

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I already know
all this, Father.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, I won't be a loser.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.546 position:16% line:83% align:start
The one who will claim
your power, your money,

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
and everything you've worked
your entire life to build

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.116 position:27% line:89% align:start
(loud thudding)

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.283 position:41% line:89% align:start

It's a shame, Assemblyman Park,

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:35.676 position:13% line:83% align:start
the US is not a nation

head to the bunker.

-(both gasping)
-What the...

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.485 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's happening here?

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.719 position:38% line:89% align:start

Can you hear me?

00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:30.798 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've confirmed that the

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:33.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
a massive number of

Ilpyo!

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:24.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where'd everyone go?

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
And what the heck is this place?

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:27.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Ilpyo!
-Oh?

-Ilpyo!
-Huh?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Hyeonbok] Then Jegal showed up

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.794 position:16% line:83% align:start
and all of us got
caught up in his attack.

00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:36.531 position:19% line:89% align:start
And Ilpyo was, well...

00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:37.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is Ilpyo...

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.401 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is he gonna be okay?

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think everyone
might've been sent here,

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:45.206 position:16% line:89% align:start
but I'm really not sure.

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:48.709 position:24% line:83% align:start

That water's imbued

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
It should hold out
for at least a bit.

Whoa, that's your Charyeok?

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:09.230 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I was planning
to keep it a secret

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:11.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
until I'd fully
mastered it, but...

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:15.670 position:10% line:89% align:start
So how long does a bit mean?

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] To be honest,
I don't know exactly.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.575 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to find Mori
and the rest 'em

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.843 position:10% line:89% align:start
then get out of here, fast!

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:24.378 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mira] You're right.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
If everyone was sent here,
then of course that means-

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:29.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] Jegal must be here too.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:30.851 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Jegal chuckling)

00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.286 position:10% line:89% align:start

Central Treasury, Sea of Blood,
Upper Venter, Cloud Gate.

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:40.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, that should at
least stop the bleeding.

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.897 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Did Jegal do all this?
-(Ilpyo groaning)

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:47.268 position:21% line:83% align:start
To Ilpyo and his
teammates, and you?

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:48.869 position:19% line:89% align:start
He is very dangerous.

00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:51.405 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ilpyo's been keeping
an eye on him.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:53.608 position:19% line:89% align:start
(grunting) And on you.

00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:54.609 position:41% line:89% align:start
On me?

00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:55.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Seungyeon] He
said he wanted you

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:57.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
to get strong enough
to beat Jegal.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:01.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pretty good, but it'll
take more than that!

-(blows thudding)

(Mori gasping)

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:07.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ilpyo] You promised
to keep that secret.

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:10.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gasping) Ilpyo!

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:11.626 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Are you okay?

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.627 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ilpyo grunting)

Where is it?

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:21.135 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know what that thing is

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:23.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
or why it might've
been inside of me.

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:27.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
All I know is I sense an

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:30.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
I want you to have it.

If he gets his

-There's no way

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
we can shelter any more people!

what you're talkin' about!

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.539 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mari] You know,
if you want people

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:07.007 position:10% line:83% align:start
to answer your questions,
you should try treating them

with a little more respect!

00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:10.010 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll ask you one more time.

Where are you hiding the Key?

this Key that thing

of Ilpyo earlier?

kill him for sure!

you've done any of this!
