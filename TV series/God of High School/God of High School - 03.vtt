Sir, Gamdo Go is
physically and mentally

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
drained from the match.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.457 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've determined that further
participation is impossible

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
and eliminated him
from the tournament.

won't be fighting anymore.

Two fighters down for

(Mori grunting)

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
Participant Mori Jin's
interference in the fight

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.854 position:10% line:89% align:start
clearly violated the rules.

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:08.488 position:10% line:89% align:start
Per tournament regulations,

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:11.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
he should be disqualified
for that act.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.061 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you think?

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.300 position:16% line:89% align:start

the eye of the beholder,

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:43.858 position:19% line:77% align:start

Show her what's what, Mira!

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.496 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just a friendly tip,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
you should probably switch
to a different weapon.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hate to break it to you,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
but a wooden sword
won't work on me.

Yeah, that's right.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.118 position:7% line:89% align:start
I heard through the grapevine

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:45.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I could have
any wish I want

if I won this little tournament.

So I came all the way
from America for this,

wish for when I win

would be all the best men.

00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.258 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:06.193 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's like crazy strong!

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:09.630 position:7% line:83% align:start
(laughs) Hot damn, now I can't
wait to fight her myself!

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:10.430 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sorry about the wait.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your punishment has
been decided, Mori Jin.

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:19.941 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you can defeat this
man in hand to hand combat

00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:22.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll be reinstated
in the tournament.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.144 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dammit, this sucks.

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:24.545 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why me?

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:27.515 position:7% line:83% align:start
Actually, I'd rather fight
blondie there than four eyes.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.288 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't fight
anyone but blondie!

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:35.556 position:13% line:89% align:start
I won't, I won't, I won't!

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.325 position:7% line:89% align:start
I want blondie, not four eyes!

00:07:37.358 --> 00:07:38.458 position:19% line:89% align:start
Give me blondie, bro!

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.261 position:13% line:89% align:start
Blondie, blondie, blondie!

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.562 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, listen kid.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.397 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's get one thing straight.

00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:45.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
I happen to be way
stronger than he is.

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.035 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:51.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we're gonna fight,
lose the specs.

00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:52.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't wanna put your eye out.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:53.441 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.442 position:35% line:89% align:start
(Q grunts)

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.177 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori cries out)

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't be a commissioner

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:59.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I was weaker than
the participants.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:01.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on, do it again
green four eyes!

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:05.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everything is already
in place for your match.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:12.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
It happens tomorrow
and takes place there.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, so what do you
think happened to Mori?

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:23.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
They did mention punishing him.

00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:24.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
I hope he didn't
get disqualified

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
or something like that.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.443 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, he's so damn
reckless and impulsive,

00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:31.178 position:19% line:83% align:start
who the hell would be
dumb enough to butt in

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:32.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
on someone else's fight?

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:35.549 position:41% line:89% align:start
Also,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
his strength was
nowhere close to normal.

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:48.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well, he's as simple
minded as he is strong.

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:50.831 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey now, who you
calling simple minded?

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:51.632 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mira gasps)

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:52.633 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where you just ...?

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.535 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yo, want some?

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:57.238 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-mm.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.472 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on, don't be shy.

00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.074 position:16% line:89% align:start
I just got 'em for free.

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:04.879 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] These are for you.

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:05.880 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hm? Oh!

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:06.847 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bag rustling)

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:09.450 position:21% line:83% align:start
Fruit will help you
restore your energy.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:13.020 position:7% line:83% align:start
Enjoy them, they'll help your
strength for tomorrow's match.

00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:14.021 position:35% line:89% align:start
For real?

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.022 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can have these?

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:16.223 position:19% line:89% align:start
(laughs) Thanks, man!

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.226 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, yeah.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.428 position:21% line:89% align:start
What match tomorrow?

00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:23.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, tomorrow I'll be
fighting a commissioner.

00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:24.565 position:13% line:89% align:start
They promised me if I win

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:26.500 position:16% line:83% align:start
they're gonna let me
back in the tournament.

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:27.502 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah?

00:09:27.536 --> 00:09:28.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good for you.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:29.703 position:38% line:89% align:start
Woo-hoo!

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:32.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, uh, aren't the
commissioners strong?

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.408 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, they're crazy strong.

00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:37.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still, I'm totally
gonna kick his ass.

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:39.680 position:21% line:89% align:start
Chill Mr. Optimism.

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
This happened
because you jumped in

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:42.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
without thinking of
the consequences.

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:44.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
You were so reckless out there!

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:47.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should be more careful
this time around, okay?

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.056 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, my family
has a saying.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.458 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-Huh?

00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:51.859 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Do what you want."

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.595 position:13% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) That's what my
grandpa always told me.

00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.432 position:33% line:89% align:start
Did you ...

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:01.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you really break those out?

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:04.573 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even Elder Bongchim said
it was too soon for those.

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:06.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why they were locked up.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
If those are eaten
by an ordinary human

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:13.714 position:10% line:89% align:start
who knows what will happen.

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.622 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori humming)

00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:23.958 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:28.028 position:33% line:89% align:start
Looks tasty.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.298 position:21% line:89% align:start
I did it to find out

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:35.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
whether he's actually
the real deal or not.

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:40.007 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori humming)

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.710 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori chokes)

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:51.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori wheezing)

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:53.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:01.695 position:24% line:89% align:start
(electronic music)

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:06.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:13.542 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] Hey, shouldn't
you be resting?

00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:15.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm feeling pretty
good this morning.

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:18.647 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Daewi chuckles)

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.080 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nice view from here.

00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:23.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
How's the treatment going?

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:27.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
The doctors are trying
out new meds on me.

00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:29.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
They said it should
be more effective

00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:31.526 position:16% line:89% align:start
than the stuff I was on,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.361 position:16% line:83% align:start
but of course that means
it also costs more.

00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:38.866 position:10% line:89% align:start
My sister took another job,

00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:41.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
and she was already
cutting back on her sleep

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
so she could work more.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.507 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae sighs)

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.274 position:21% line:83% align:start
You took another
job too, didn't you?

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
One of the guys
from school told me.

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:53.881 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please Daewi, I'm begging you.

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:55.517 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, you dork.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not like I'm
working that hard,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.019 position:19% line:89% align:start
so you can calm down.

00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:01.722 position:13% line:83% align:start
Quit worrying so much and
just get better already.

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:05.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
By the way, I met this
weird guy recently.

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:07.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
In some ways he
reminds me of you.

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:08.896 position:21% line:89% align:start
What the hell, man?

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.998 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what exactly are
you trying to say,

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:13.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
that this guy's a
weirdo and so am I?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.536 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:15.537 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.605 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae grunting)

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:17.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't go talking
about me like that!

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Daewi and Seungtae laughing)

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:26.247 position:27% line:89% align:start
(trash rustling)

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.350 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, well, if it
isn't Daewi Han.

00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:34.421 position:7% line:83% align:start
Never thought I'd see you
working in a place like this.

00:12:34.455 --> 00:12:35.724 position:21% line:89% align:start
Know what we heard?

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
A little birdie told us Seungtae

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:38.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
is knocking on death's door.

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:40.427 position:19% line:89% align:start
Man, serves him right.

00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:43.931 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, to be honest, I
never really liked the guy.

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:47.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Always acting like he thinks
he's some hero of justice.

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:49.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's with the
death glare big guy?

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, please, it's not
like you can do shit

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:53.575 position:10% line:89% align:start
without him to back you up.

00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:58.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(punk grunts)
-(can clatters)

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:03.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry sir, I'll dispose
of this for you.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not even gonna fight back, huh?

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:11.091 position:27% line:89% align:start
(punks laughing)

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] It's time
for Group A's 12th match

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.995 position:5% line:89% align:start
in this preliminary tournament.

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:20.502 position:13% line:83% align:start
This match features Daewi
Han versus Seungchul Baek.

(crowd cheering)

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:29.644 position:33% line:89% align:start
Karate, huh?

00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:32.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
And pretty well
trained in it too.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:34.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
Those conditioned knuckles.

00:13:35.784 --> 00:13:36.984 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm right, aren't I?

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:39.621 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't be so surprised.

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:42.890 position:10% line:83% align:start
This book contains all
kinds of useful information.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:45.560 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like how to beat you.

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
All set, fighters?

00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:51.031 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:51.865 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:56.403 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi grunts)

00:13:57.871 --> 00:14:00.508 position:10% line:89% align:start
Temple, left shoulder, feat!

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:01.810 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're done.

00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:04.779 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunting)

00:14:04.813 --> 00:14:06.681 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:09.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can predict how
I'm gonna move, huh?

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:12.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
I studied all the karate attack
patterns three years ago.

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:14.388 position:24% line:89% align:start
It came in handy.

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:15.956 position:16% line:89% align:start
To become undefeatable,

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:18.959 position:10% line:83% align:start
one needs a mastery of both
violence and knowledge.

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:22.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or at least, that's the
hypothesis I came up with.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.499 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I entered this tournament
simply as an experiment

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:28.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
to prove that my theory
on all this is correct.

00:14:31.506 --> 00:14:33.941 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're pretty interesting,
you know that?

00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:39.380 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Seungchul grunting)

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:41.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Q] This is
completely one sided.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
Might as well call it now.

00:14:43.718 --> 00:14:44.918 position:38% line:89% align:start
[O] No.

00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:51.559 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi grunts)

00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.398 position:21% line:83% align:start
What was that,
some kind of fluke?

00:14:57.431 --> 00:15:00.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's 'cause I've learned
your timing within my body.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.436 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a hassle.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:04.104 position:13% line:89% align:start
I better finish this now!

00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:09.410 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Seungchul gasps)

00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:14.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you all right?

00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:15.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why did you ...?

00:15:15.817 --> 00:15:16.785 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:18.952 position:19% line:89% align:start
You slipped and fell.

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
What kind of guy would
attack someone right then?

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.489 position:21% line:89% align:start
That'd be cowardly.

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:24.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Seungchul chuckles)

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.895 position:30% line:89% align:start
(hand smacks)

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:30.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're an interesting
one, and so strange.

00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:32.099 position:10% line:89% align:start
Fine, let's see just how far

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
you think you're gonna
get in this fight

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:35.936 position:21% line:89% align:start
with that mentality.

00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:36.937 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here I come.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.007 position:35% line:89% align:start
12 Spears!

(Mira gasps)

00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:47.682 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Daewi cries out)

00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:52.252 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's no use.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.889 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've been stabbed in
12 places simultaneously.

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:57.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
The impact has traveled
beyond muscle and bone

00:15:57.692 --> 00:15:59.293 position:10% line:89% align:start
all the way to your organs.

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:02.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no way you
can possibly stand.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.531 position:41% line:89% align:start
I win.

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:05.299 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi groans)

00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:10.471 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Seungtae retching)

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't you
ever want to quit?

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:22.282 position:19% line:83% align:start
The way I see it, all
of life's a battle.

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:25.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you wanna live, then
you gotta keep on fighting.

(Daewi groans)

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:28.623 position:41% line:89% align:start
I ...

00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:29.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
(crowd gasps)

00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:31.291 position:41% line:89% align:start
I ...

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.994 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can't afford to lose today.

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:35.830 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very well then.

00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:37.397 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's play.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.668 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here then, have some!

00:16:40.702 --> 00:16:42.436 position:35% line:89% align:start
72 Spears!

(blows smacking)

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:56.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
How dare you shatter my theory,

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:59.047 position:13% line:89% align:start
my body, and my strategy?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.281 position:13% line:89% align:start
Finally, fourth stance ...

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:06.054 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, this is infuriating.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.790 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Seungchul thuds)

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.758 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Baek is down!

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:12.627 position:24% line:89% align:start
Winner: Daewi Han.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, not bad.

00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:16.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
He managed to cancel out
his opponent's attack

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.732 position:19% line:89% align:start
with that first move,

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:20.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
then he knocked him off
balance with the second,

00:18:20.735 --> 00:18:23.270 position:13% line:83% align:start
and blew his defense
wide open with the third.

00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:26.206 position:21% line:83% align:start
[O] After all
those hits he took,

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
his body has to be under
a lot of stress right now.

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:31.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
this concludes all of
today's planned matches,

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:36.918 position:19% line:83% align:start
but now we'll see the
result of the verdict

00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:38.452 position:13% line:89% align:start
handed down for Mori Jin,

00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:40.454 position:27% line:83% align:start
who violated the
rules yesterday.

00:18:50.698 --> 00:18:53.668 position:24% line:89% align:start
(creature roaring)

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:56.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mori gasps)

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:59.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, the start time for this
match has already passed.

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:02.777 position:10% line:83% align:start
In a surprising twist,
Mori Jin has yet to arrive.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:03.811 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where could he be?

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:07.682 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is he doing?

00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:08.716 position:38% line:89% align:start
So dumb.

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:18.626 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
It appears Mori Jin
has finally arrived.

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:23.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm curious what the holdup was.

00:19:23.998 --> 00:19:26.034 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori panting)

00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:28.636 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunts)

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.937 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know you're late.

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.974 position:7% line:83% align:start
Were you hiding in the
bathroom crapping your pants?

(Mori panting)

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:38.445 position:7% line:89% align:start
I will now explain the rules.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:40.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
We will conduct this
as a handicap match.

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:43.985 position:10% line:83% align:start
If Mori Jin can knock the
commissioner down just once

00:19:44.018 --> 00:19:45.653 position:13% line:89% align:start
he wins and is reinstated.

00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:47.555 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are our competitors set?

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:48.723 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fighters ready?

00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:49.757 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:19:51.224 --> 00:19:52.359 position:24% line:89% align:start
Better lose these.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.594 position:24% line:89% align:start
They could break.

00:19:55.697 --> 00:19:57.865 position:35% line:89% align:start
(Q gasps)

00:20:00.702 --> 00:20:01.703 position:38% line:89% align:start
Th-- ...

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:05.773 position:13% line:89% align:start
That concludes the match!

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:08.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
Were you just screwing
around with us?

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:12.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, be more serious
or we're going home!

00:20:13.748 --> 00:20:14.749 position:27% line:89% align:start
Little shit bag!

[Mori Voiceover] I feel hot.

(Q laughs)

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
You finally pissed me off.

(high pitch beep)

00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:45.646 position:38% line:89% align:start
GP 2500?

00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:49.817 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?
