And it's random, so anyone
has a chance at it, even us.

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.656 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah but I don't need that.

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna borrow
someone else's power.

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:42.730 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no point unless the
strength comes from within.

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:47.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay, that may be fine
and dandy for you but...

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:48.302 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm going this way.

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:49.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
See you when it's
our turn to fight.

00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:50.738 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:59.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
Something has definitely
happened with him.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.817 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] Yeah, probably when
he was called out yesterday.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
-As I'm sure
-(dramatic music)

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:07.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're well aware,there are
quite a lot of people out there

00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:09.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
who want a piece of Taejin Jin.

00:08:09.824 --> 00:08:11.459 position:7% line:89% align:start
We've been searching for him,

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
to bring him in for safekeeping.

00:08:15.363 --> 00:08:16.864 position:16% line:89% align:start
So in the past few days,

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there a chance you've had
any contact with Taejin Jin

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
or anyone who might
be looking for him?

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.137 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not lately.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why don't you ask?

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:25.239 position:41% line:89% align:start
(beep)

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:27.341 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:30.411 position:7% line:83% align:start
Two days ago, there was a
massive explosion in Gangwon.

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.412 position:41% line:89% align:start
(beep)

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:32.613 position:10% line:89% align:start
The media's been calling it

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.949 position:16% line:83% align:start
an attack from the
North Korean government.

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:37.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it was actually
caused by charyeok.

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:38.819 position:41% line:89% align:start
(beep)

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:40.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
And our investigation
unfortunately confirmed

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
that these bloodstains are from
none other than Taejin Jin.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
And ever since then,
he's been missing.

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:49.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
Judging by the amount
of blood there,

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:53.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
the odds of him being
alive are extremely slim.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:56.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold on, do you even
know my grandpa?

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:58.639 position:7% line:89% align:start
If my grandpa was in a fight,

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd be worried
about the other guy.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.083 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no way
grandpa could die.

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:12.653 position:16% line:83% align:start
If only I was stronger, I
could go to him right now.

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:15.823 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're Mori Jin, aren't you?

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're the guy from...

00:09:19.427 --> 00:09:20.394 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm a big fan.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:22.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
Could I please shake your hand?

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:26.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, I mean sure, if you want.

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:28.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, I'm so happy.

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:31.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:32.907 position:35% line:89% align:start
Whoa, hey!

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:38.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been watching you ever
since the Seoul preliminaries.

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:39.680 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:44.051 position:33% line:89% align:start
(kick thuds)

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:48.122 position:33% line:89% align:start
(body slams)

00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:49.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's up, man?

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why not end it?

00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:52.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right back at you.

00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:00.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should probably
introduce myself.

00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:01.936 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name's Ilpyo Park.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sorry about that, I just
couldn't resist the chance

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
to test out your skills.

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:08.976 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's cool.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:12.246 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides I wanted to ask
you, what's the tiger thing?

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:17.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, it's my way of showing my
deep respect for Taejin Jin.

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.019 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.359 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:35.970 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.809 position:27% line:89% align:start
(child vrooming)

00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:45.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
The first memory I have
is of my father's funeral.

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:51.986 position:16% line:83% align:start
Be a good boy and do as
your uncle says, okay?

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.957 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Mommy, where are you going?
-My next memory

00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:00.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
-is of my mother walking away
-Mommy no! Come back!

00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:02.263 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mommy! (toy crashes)

00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:07.268 position:19% line:89% align:start
A place I didn't know.

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:11.205 position:27% line:89% align:start
(child sobbing)

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.675 position:16% line:89% align:start
An unfamiliar atmosphere

00:11:18.613 --> 00:11:20.347 position:10% line:89% align:start
and a lot of strange faces.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
(child grunts)

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.190 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is that the best you can do?

00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:31.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I can see why
your grandfather Iltae

00:11:31.593 --> 00:11:33.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
was so disappointed.

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:45.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
(leaves shuffle)

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:47.441 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Taejin Jin] You're Iltae
Park's grandson, right?

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.610 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:48.643 --> 00:11:52.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
Consider me an old buddy
of your grandfather's.

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
You knew my grandpa?

00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:56.217 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wanted to be here sooner

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I had to teach
some bad guys a lesson

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:00.354 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it just couldn't wait.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:05.459 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was actually asked to
give this to your dad.

00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:07.127 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sorry I was too late.

00:12:10.164 --> 00:12:14.335 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is a, well, let's call
it a book of taekkyon secrets.

00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.574 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right up until the day he died,

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
your grandpa studied taekkyon

00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:23.744 position:5% line:89% align:start
and came up with new techniques

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
which he recorded in this book.

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:32.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your grandpa was
amazingly strong.

00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:34.255 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, not as strong
as me of course.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
He died saving the world with me

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:45.232 position:16% line:83% align:start
and that pride of his
lives on in your blood.

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:46.735 position:16% line:89% align:start
So grow up fast, kiddo.

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:49.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
Become a great man just
like your grandpa was.

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:54.375 position:10% line:83% align:start
And little did I know it
but that moment would become

00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:58.912 position:13% line:89% align:start
my precious third memory.

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:02.816 position:33% line:89% align:start
My grandpa?

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.251 position:19% line:89% align:start
I owe him everything.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
So how's Taejin Jin
doin' these days?

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:10.157 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, he's, well...

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.958 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blood gushing)

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.061 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energetic music)

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't care if you hate me.

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:25.707 position:13% line:89% align:start
Say you're sorry, say it.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.542 position:24% line:89% align:start
Say you're sorry.

00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:28.809 position:16% line:89% align:start
You need to leave people

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.546 position:13% line:83% align:start
who have nothing to do
with you and me out of it!

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.449 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.853 position:19% line:89% align:start
That man is dangerous.

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:42.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
You should be careful.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.559 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd say you're pretty
dangerous yourself.

00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:45.794 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is your hand okay?

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:46.795 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about me.

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.663 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm glad I got to talk to you.

00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:50.064 position:19% line:89% align:start
See you at the arena.

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks, man.

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:55.537 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next time we fight, I
won't stop or hold back.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.571 position:41% line:89% align:start
Same.

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:02.042 position:19% line:89% align:start
I couldn't even move.

00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:06.581 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've got to get stronger.

00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:10.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
-No, wait!
-(suspenseful music)

00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:12.587 position:16% line:89% align:start
Q please, listen to me!

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.590 position:19% line:89% align:start
(explosive demolition)

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.992 position:30% line:89% align:start
(blade hisses)

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:22.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mujin Park, what the
hell were you doing?

00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:24.965 position:30% line:89% align:start
How could you?

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.702 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why'd you let them kill
Bongsa Sim's wife and kid?!

00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:30.839 position:21% line:89% align:start
(crashes and groans)

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.874 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really, who do you
think you're talking to?

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:37.010 position:24% line:89% align:start
(gurgling in pain)

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.019 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is how much it'll cost

00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
to repair the building
you busted up.

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:50.592 position:24% line:83% align:start
You will personally
take responsibility

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.359 position:13% line:89% align:start
for the damage you caused.

00:14:58.767 --> 00:14:59.933 position:27% line:89% align:start
So did you know?

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:01.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
That his wife and
kid weren't dead?

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:03.170 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's why I asked you

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
to stop and listen
to me back there.

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:06.206 position:27% line:89% align:start
(mystical music)

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
What Nox killed was a
virtually identical fake

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:10.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
that I made with my Marionette.

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
His real wife and
child were moved

00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:15.817 position:13% line:83% align:start
to a safe location as soon
as Bongsa Sim was killed.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.184 position:30% line:89% align:start
(deep exhale)

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:19.153 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, there's a silver lining.

00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:22.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I have a message from Mujin

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:24.291 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't need an apology.

00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:28.228 position:7% line:83% align:start
Adding today's property damage
to your previous incidents,

00:15:28.262 --> 00:15:31.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're now up to nine
months without pay.

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:32.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
So uh, P...

00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:34.301 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm not lending you money.

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.437 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.573 position:35% line:89% align:start

(coin jingles)

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.278 position:35% line:89% align:start
Haha, Oh.

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
What're you doing, huh?

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:52.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(soft guitar music)
-Stronger,

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.688 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have to get stronger.

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:57.191 position:7% line:89% align:start
So you wanna obtain charyeok?

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, If you agree to train me,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
then I'll make dinner
for you every day.

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:05.700 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's cheaper, or cheaper
than eating here.

00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:08.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why do you want it?

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.004 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it just so you
can win at GOH?

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's part of it.

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:14.509 position:16% line:89% align:start
But if I'm being honest,

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:17.110 position:21% line:83% align:start
losing all the time
really bothers me.

00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:20.414 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mori Jin, huh?

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:23.417 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanna catch up and
beat him one day.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
Also, something is
bothering him right now

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:30.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
but he won't tell me what it is.

00:16:30.859 --> 00:16:31.992 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I think...
-You think

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:34.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's because you're not
a dependable fighter.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.034 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's no question.

00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:43.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they'll
attempt to ruin GOH.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We've run out of time.
-(dramatic music)

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:50.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes, every moment counts.

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:52.045 position:5% line:89% align:start
People who have lost their way,

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:55.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
forgotten God's greatness
and corrupted our world

00:16:55.449 --> 00:17:00.120 position:7% line:83% align:start
are attempting to attain
power that rivals God Himself.

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:03.323 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can no longer afford
to let them run free.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.059 position:19% line:83% align:start
Commissioners, You can
remove your limiters.

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:09.029 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you find Nox,
strike with full force.

00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:11.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then when you uncover
the traitor among us...

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop the heathens
and do what you must

00:17:14.602 --> 00:17:18.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
to destroy the key
that threatens God.

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:21.441 position:13% line:83% align:start
Get the key that'll bring
down God at any cost.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.579 position:24% line:89% align:start
[All] This is war!

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:31.485 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-(wooden sword whooshing)

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:34.087 position:21% line:83% align:start
Charyeok, I haven't
even mastered

00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:36.691 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Moonlight sword style yet.

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:38.660 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't need that.

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:42.095 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's up with him, that jerk.

00:17:42.129 --> 00:17:44.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
Any other time he won't shut up.

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.967 position:38% line:89% align:start
(beeps)

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
(beeps)

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:51.405 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:56.678 --> 00:17:59.346 position:30% line:89% align:start
(heavy exhale)

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:05.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have to get stronger so
grandpa can finally come home.

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:08.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why can't you come
home? (whines)

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:10.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey now, I wanna
stay with you too.

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:13.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if I do that, all the
bad guys who're after me

00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:15.697 position:27% line:89% align:start
will come here.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't care, I'll beat them up.

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm strong enough to.

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:21.101 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know you are.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:24.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you grow up, let's
beat them up together.

00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:26.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm grown up, I just
turned six today.

00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:29.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
But you're still a child.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:32.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry, I hate
to leave you all alone

00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:33.146 position:24% line:89% align:start
on your birthday.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I'm sure your
new friends at school

00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:37.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
will celebrate the
next one with you.

00:18:37.552 --> 00:18:40.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't need any
friends Grandpa.

00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:41.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, There's nothing better

00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:43.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
than having friends
by your side.

00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:46.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're not, I'd rather
have you. (whimpers)

00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:49.964 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please Mori, don't
make this harder on me.

00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:52.700 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know, I'll give you a present.

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:53.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
What would you like?

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:56.971 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:18:57.005 --> 00:18:59.574 position:10% line:89% align:start
Big smiles now, say cheese!

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.548 position:5% line:89% align:start

birthday Mori. Surprise!

(soft music)

00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:23.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
I dunno, we both just
randomly got this message

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.364 position:27% line:89% align:start
out of nowhere.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:28.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
(device beeping)

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.043 position:16% line:83% align:start
So you came all the way
out here just for that?

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:37.912 position:21% line:83% align:start
And, we weren't
coming empty-handed.

00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.582 position:30% line:89% align:start
So cool. Huh?

00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:49.524 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is all this? (chuckles)

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:50.758 position:27% line:89% align:start
Daewi, You cook?

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.827 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well its the flavor that
counts not the presentation.

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:56.430 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I guess.

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:57.832 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm digging in.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:01.703 position:27% line:89% align:start
Its really good.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:02.704 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:05.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, the seasoning's
a little too strong.

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.176 position:7% line:89% align:start
You used yakiniku sauce here.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.577 position:10% line:89% align:start
For Bulgogi to taste right,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
it should always be
very well-seasoned

00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:14.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
with soy sauce, sesame
oil, mirin, garlic,

00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:16.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
ginger and green onions.

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:18.920 position:16% line:83% align:start
And for norimaki, you
should use tougher rice

00:20:18.953 --> 00:20:20.253 position:21% line:89% align:start
and less sesame oil.

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
Eat a little slower,
what'd you expect?

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:24.959 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't eat another
bite. (groans)

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:26.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
Aren't you having any?

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:29.329 position:10% line:89% align:start

Hey Mori, was there something...

00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:07.702 position:13% line:83% align:start
Forget it. Next time you
and I fight I'm gonna win.

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:08.803 position:21% line:89% align:start

you again too, and you.

us in the next match.

Sorry, win it for me.
