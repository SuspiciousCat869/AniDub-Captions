(Owl Hooting)

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.320 position:10% line:89% align:start
Think you could hurry it up?

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm a lot of things,
but I ain't patient.

(clothes flapping)

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:32.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
Might I convince you to
reconsider, Taejin Jin?

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.904 position:19% line:83% align:start
There is a certain way
for those with power

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:37.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
to conduct their lives.

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
You might even call it destiny.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.144 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your fate is to come join us.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.715 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fulfill the sacred role the
heavens bestowed upon you.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.149 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a little something I
always said to my grandson.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:57.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
I told him, "Do what you want."

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
How charming.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.229 position:30% line:89% align:start
In that case--

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.398 position:21% line:89% align:start
May God be with you.

-(exploding)
-Are you ready?

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's GOH's official
channel, Big Bang!

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:09.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm your classy
nurse lady, Heal!

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm your sexy
bomber nurse, Sai!

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:13.193 position:19% line:89% align:start
And you won't believe

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
what Big Bang's
bringing you tonight!

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.731 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a pre-nationals special!

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:18.298 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're in for a real treat

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
since we have both Commissioners
Q and O here as our guests!

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.838 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks for having us.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:24.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, hi.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, we're on the air!

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:27.675 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.210 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look, I don't get paid
enough to act professional--

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.546 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(punching)
-(giggling)

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, how about those regional
preliminary tournaments.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:36.517 position:16% line:89% align:start
They're over now, right?

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.350 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.252 position:10% line:89% align:start
The big national tournament

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:40.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
takes place in just
two weeks' time.

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:44.324 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then, the God of High
School will have its winner.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
Speaking of fighters,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
what kinds will be
competing at nationals?

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm so excited, I
just can't wait!

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:52.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, I just got a message
from the higher ups.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:56.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
The top three fighters from
each regional preliminary

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:58.573 position:5% line:89% align:start
will all be paired up together.

00:03:58.606 --> 00:03:59.674 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, basically,

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:03.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
the tournament will be
conducted as a team competition.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Oh, wow, you don't say.
-(giggling)

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now we're
getting a live feed.

00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:10.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
Announcer T, live
from the KORG Arena!

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:13.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seriously, you think it's
okay to smoke on live TV?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.254 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer T] Let me tell you,

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
things are heating
up here at KORG,

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:17.191 position:21% line:89% align:start
as we find ourselves

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:19.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the middle of a
neck-and-neck battle

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.129 position:16% line:83% align:start
to decide the
third-place participant

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.462 position:19% line:89% align:start
fighting at nationals!

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
Brazilian jiu-jitsu
user, Jaehee Byeon.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.569 position:16% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword Style's
successor, Mira Yoo!

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:29.570 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:32.206 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't go easy on you
'cause you're a girl!

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll be the third contestant

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:35.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
that'll be representing
Seoul in the--

(thumping)

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:42.950 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, man.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.619 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not this again.

00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:46.754 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Announcer T] The match is over!

00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:49.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
The winner, Mira Yoo!

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(audience cheering)
-Way to go, Mira!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(chuckles)
-Mira Yoo, Mira Yoo!

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:56.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, you're gonna
be at nationals

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:57.799 position:10% line:89% align:start
and fight on our team, too.

00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:58.733 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
The three of us are
gonna win together!

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:03.237 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yo, Daewi, why are you
lookin' away from me?

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:04.304 position:21% line:89% align:start
Cheer with me, man!

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.673 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hip hip, hooray!

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.242 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, careful!

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:10.278 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.979 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Yay!
-What an idiot.

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.583 position:10% line:89% align:start
We have a detailed analysis

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:17.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
for all the matches
conducted thus far.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:21.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no doubt in my mind
that one of our fighters

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
very well may possess
the qualities of the Key.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay, that explains
the sudden rule change.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:31.299 position:10% line:89% align:start
Three-on-three team matches.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sir, this is gonna be
a logistical nightmare.

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:35.503 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know that, right?

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:39.574 position:19% line:83% align:start
There were more tiger
cubs than I expected.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.513 position:16% line:83% align:start
To grow, one must apply
themselves diligently.

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:49.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
Especially for people
at that stage of life.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whether it's trust,
bonds and rivalry,

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.224 position:5% line:89% align:start
or jealousy, anger and despair.

00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:58.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
When they harness
their strongest emotion

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
as the power driving
them forward,

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
only then will The Key awaken.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.134 position:30% line:89% align:start
On that note,

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:11.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
regarding the matter of Seongjin
Oh's contact with Mira Yoo,

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:14.642 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid they orchestrated
that right under our noses.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:17.311 position:24% line:83% align:start
Similar activity's
been confirmed

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:19.914 position:16% line:89% align:start
around Gangwon and Jeju.

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:21.048 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's Nox.

00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:23.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I bet they'll
definitely be even bolder

00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:25.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
once the national
tournament begins.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:29.557 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're after the same
thing as us, so be on guard.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:34.427 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] I've summoned The Six.

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:37.565 position:24% line:89% align:start
(cars zooming by)

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.736 position:27% line:89% align:start
(drink pouring)

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.905 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sipping)

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.343 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is so awesome, Mira!

00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:50.678 position:30% line:89% align:start
Best day ever!

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, you can stay
in the tournament

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
and keep fighting with
your two best buddies!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
But, why is it a
team tournament?

00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:01.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
And why do I have to
be stuck with you two?

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:02.556 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, don't you know
it's rude to point?

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:05.693 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:08.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on, dudes, let's
go win this thing!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.231 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, the three of us together.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:14.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I can't fight you if
we're all on the same team!

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:15.703 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's no fair!

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.772 position:7% line:89% align:start
Not fair, I wanna fight Mira!

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I wanna fight
Daewi again, too!

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.075 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stop whining!

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.544 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you wanna
fight us so bad?

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.546 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mori] Well, if I
fight strong people,

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.448 position:7% line:83% align:start
-it'll make me even stronger.
-That's all it is?

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's another reason?

00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:33.453 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.689 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.626 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mira] What'll you do
if you do get stronger?

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.928 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have the goal of reviving
the Moon Light Sword.

00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:41.796 position:38% line:89% align:start
But you?

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:43.731 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] So, do you wanna win

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
just so you can have
your wish granted?

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:47.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mori] Oh, yeah, I guess
that's a thing, too.

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if I want something,
I get it for myself.

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.173 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mira] So why, then?

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.411 position:7% line:89% align:start
Being stronger is just cooler!

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:58.646 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Mm.

00:07:59.447 --> 00:08:00.414 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:01.782 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did I say something weird?

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:02.817 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait up!

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:06.654 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:07.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.358 position:24% line:89% align:start
(cars zooming by)

00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:13.127 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Mori, what are you doing?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.130 position:30% line:89% align:start
(car honking)

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Sorry about that.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.533 position:7% line:89% align:start
Jeez, you're so embarrassing.

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:22.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori giggling)

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:27.675 position:24% line:89% align:start
(cars zooming by)

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:33.948 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Bongchim] You called
me here for this?

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm a busy man, you know.

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:52.700 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(punching)
-(grunting)

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:57.204 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:08:57.238 --> 00:08:58.406 position:38% line:89% align:start
(scoffs)

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:00.509 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've grown quite
senile, old man.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You've lost your touch.
-(scoffs)

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can't even tell I went
easy on you, can you?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
Useless pupil!

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:10.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
I met Taejin's grandson.

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:11.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] And?

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:13.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
And let's just say it
looks like your little game

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:16.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
is about to get
somewhat interesting.

00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:20.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even after eating the Sage
Fruit, he's as fit as a fiddle.

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll take him as my pupil.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:29.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
I look forward to seeing how
Taejin will react to that.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:31.338 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's why I'm here.

00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:34.608 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've gotten word that Nox tried
to get in touch with Taejin.

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.010 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Bongchim chuckles)

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:38.579 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Bongchim] The bastards
must've lost their minds.

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:40.281 position:24% line:89% align:start
Either that, or--

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:43.918 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sizzling)

00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:44.752 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:47.588 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is why I hate those guys.

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:51.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look what they made me do
to the beauty of nature.

00:09:52.827 --> 00:09:53.928 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:57.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
The hammer of judgment
will soon end this world.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:01.602 position:7% line:83% align:start
Smiting down and obliterating
this tainted age.

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:05.574 position:13% line:89% align:start
And our God will descend.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:09.076 position:21% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.278 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shooting)

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:16.650 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:33.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:41.008 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crashing)

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:44.345 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:51.785 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(soft music)
-(record scratching)

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:54.288 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.091 position:27% line:89% align:start
(shower running)

00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:02.997 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Team matches.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
I did manage to stay in
the tournament, but--

00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:08.669 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:11.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right now, I'm like a
third wheel for them.

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:17.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Mommy, can I get this one?

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:22.082 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mira] I guess I'll
make curry tonight.

00:11:23.184 --> 00:11:24.185 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:26.687 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mira Yoo?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
(baby cooing)

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.990 position:24% line:89% align:start
(can popping open)

00:11:30.024 --> 00:11:33.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Here you are, Mira.
-Thank you very much!

00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:36.330 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're the announcer.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.633 position:21% line:89% align:start
Call me Bongsa Sim.

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:40.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mira] He's blind?

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.571 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer T] Congratulations

00:11:42.604 --> 00:11:43.904 position:5% line:89% align:start
on getting through the prelims.

00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:45.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know you've been through a lot

00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:48.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the real fight
has yet to begin.

00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:49.511 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Thank you,

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:54.415 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I kinda feel like I was
just saved by a rule change.

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:56.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
You made it into the
national tournament

00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:59.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
because of the great
skill you displayed.

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:01.088 position:27% line:89% align:start
No shame there.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:05.694 position:10% line:83% align:start
That said, you haven't yet
drawn out the true strength

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:06.961 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the Moon Light Sword.

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:12.166 position:10% line:83% align:start
Having taken second place
in the Seoul Preliminaries,

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:14.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
you can now battle once
again to come out on top

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:17.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the God of High School
national tournament.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.707 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you no longer have
a motive to fight.

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.177 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you still wish to continue?

00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:26.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I racked up
a pretty huge debt.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.949 position:10% line:89% align:start
I feel I should pay it back.

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your friend requested
I give this to you.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.922 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no beating
you idiots, is there?

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.225 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I don't, I know a guy
who'll come back from the dead

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:39.893 position:21% line:89% align:start
just to kick my ass.

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:44.699 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I need to let him
rest in peace, so yeah.

00:12:44.733 --> 00:12:46.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think I'll keep going.

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.037 position:7% line:89% align:start
He has the eyes of a man now.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.241 position:7% line:83% align:start
As long as our fighters are
highly motivated, we're happy.

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're done here.

00:12:56.678 --> 00:12:59.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] There's one
thing I wanted to ask.

00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:00.948 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] What?

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.218 position:13% line:89% align:start
I sense some strange power

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:07.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
is at work behind
the scenes here.

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:10.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanna know what that power is.

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.761 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whooshing)

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:15.796 position:21% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.034 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's Charyeok.

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:26.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
Two more weeks until
the national tournament.

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:27.676 position:35% line:89% align:start
(huffing)

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.678 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just wait until Daewi and Mira

00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:31.780 position:21% line:83% align:start
see how much bigger
I am by then.

00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:33.147 position:35% line:89% align:start
(huffing)

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.148 position:35% line:89% align:start
Training.

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:35.816 position:24% line:83% align:start
Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow!

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:37.017 position:35% line:89% align:start
Training.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:37.818 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yoga.

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:39.820 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Training.
-(chuckling)

00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:41.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
Training!

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.459 position:19% line:89% align:start
What am I even doing?

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Uh-oh!
-Huh?

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.228 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, kids!

00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:52.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll make sure to get
this balloon back to you.

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
The one your sick
grandmother gave you

00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:56.103 position:10% line:89% align:start
with her last dying breath.

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:59.139 position:10% line:89% align:start
Actually my grandma is fine.

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:02.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(branch cracking)
-Ah!

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.845 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Whoa!
-Wow, so cool!

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(chuckling)
-Here you go, guys!

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:08.248 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Thanks!

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:11.720 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:14:11.753 --> 00:14:12.953 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:14.988 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.725 position:21% line:89% align:start
Might've twisted it.

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:18.793 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:14:18.827 --> 00:14:19.993 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
What was that for?

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:25.199 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was only a minor sprain.

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:27.868 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.571 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoa, it doesn't hurt.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.973 position:19% line:83% align:start
People with
unimaginable strength

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:35.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
will be taking part in
the upcoming tournament.

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:39.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
Right now, you're trying
to take on everything

00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.048 position:21% line:89% align:start
with strength alone.

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:44.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, you'll
want to get stronger.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:47.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if that's all you focus on,

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:50.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
then, when you run into
even greater strength,

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:52.192 position:27% line:89% align:start
(twig breaking)

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:55.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
put your feelings
into your sword.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
My feelings?

00:14:56.731 --> 00:14:59.333 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Announcer T] Evade gracefully
when it's appropriate.

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:02.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
And when it's time to
strike, don't hesitate.

00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:05.573 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gust blowing)

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:10.244 position:24% line:89% align:start
But, why are you--

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:15.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was the Moon Light Sword
that took my sight from me.

00:15:18.986 --> 00:15:21.422 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mira] Put my feelings
into my sword.

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:25.926 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, look at Mommy.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's looks more
like you every day--

00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:29.096 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
Take her and wait for
me in the car, okay?

00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:32.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:36.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Mm-hm.
-(baby cooing)

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:40.107 position:21% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:44.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
I knew something
smelled rotten here.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:46.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
An assassin from Nox?

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:49.349 position:33% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:52.953 position:27% line:89% align:start
(fire whooshing)

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:56.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
The world has already
begun to move.

00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:59.828 position:7% line:83% align:start
Essentially everyone you face
at the national tournament

00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:01.663 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be people like that.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:06.433 position:13% line:89% align:start
Savage gods, evil beasts,

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
messengers from heaven,

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:10.905 position:7% line:89% align:start
heroes who changed the world.

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:13.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your opponents
will borrow powers

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
from beings that transcend
human understanding.

00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:19.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
The levels and numbers
displayed there

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:23.083 position:13% line:83% align:start
show the latent potential
of those who use charyeok.

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:27.655 position:10% line:83% align:start
Drawing forth the gods'
powers and integrating them,

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:29.323 position:19% line:89% align:start
making them one's own.

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:30.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
That philosophy

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
is what God of High
School is about.

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:38.165 position:19% line:83% align:start
How will you and
your teammates fight?

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:45.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Long time no see--
-(wind whooshing)

00:16:46.574 --> 00:16:48.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
Too bad, I win.

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:49.309 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.980 position:10% line:89% align:start
How'd you guys get in here?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
This area's off-limits, you two.

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.183 position:19% line:89% align:start
C'mon, get a move on.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
(roaring)

00:16:58.987 --> 00:17:02.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(fire whooshing)
-(exploding)

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.191 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:05.025 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:05.994 --> 00:17:08.997 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:13.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Alright, guess you won
that time, Taek Jegal.

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:14.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:17.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
The next time around,
I'll crush you.

00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:24.012 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're gonna come
out on top for sure!

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no one who stands
a chance against you,

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:28.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
you know what I'm sayin'?

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.985 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm the best in
the geezer division.

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:32.687 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jangmi] There you go again.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.721 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:37.057 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Pum] Jangmi.

00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:41.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm going now, Grandfather.

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:49.069 position:10% line:83% align:start
On our family's name and
upholding your mighty honor,

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
I swear I will win
this tournament.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:55.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you worry about me
or upholding my honor.

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
See it as an opportunity

00:17:57.579 --> 00:18:00.080 position:21% line:83% align:start
to put your strength
to the test.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:01.381 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jugok] I will.

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:02.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hyangdan.

00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:05.185 position:16% line:89% align:start
Give Jugok your support.

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:07.254 position:24% line:89% align:start
I understand, sir.

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:13.528 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jaesan] I'd hoped this would
be an honest competition

00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
for young people
to test the future

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:17.532 position:10% line:89% align:start
that lies in store for them.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:23.771 position:30% line:5% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:36.784 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(punching)
-(grunting)

00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:41.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:55.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
(knocking on door)

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.107 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.273 position:24% line:89% align:start
(door creaks open)

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:02.076 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Look at that!

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.112 position:13% line:89% align:start
I told you he'd be asleep!

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.379 position:41% line:89% align:start
Geez!

00:19:05.412 --> 00:19:07.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why do you always oversleep
at the worst times?

00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:10.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mori] How'd you find
out where I live?

00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:12.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
We asked the administration.

00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.256 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] You live alone?

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:18.158 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, when I was younger,

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:20.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
I used to live in the
mountains with my grandpa.

00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:23.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
But he said I had to
go to school, so yeah.

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:27.035 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Are these your parents?

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:29.037 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Definitely not.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.605 position:10% line:89% align:start
Grandpa said kids are mean,

00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:33.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
and a kid like me, living
alone, would get a lot of shit.

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:36.711 position:13% line:83% align:start
He just hired them to
take that picture with me.

00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:38.345 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(grunts)
-Mm.

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:41.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's pretty smart, your grandpa.

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.282 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:44.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
My grandpa's the absolute best!

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:46.120 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mira, your shoulder okay?

00:19:46.154 --> 00:19:49.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm just a little sore
from training too hard.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:53.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
-(Mira groaning)
-There, there, and there.

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:55.663 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hurt now?

00:19:55.697 --> 00:19:57.131 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait, how?

00:19:57.165 --> 00:19:58.666 position:27% line:89% align:start
(car zooming by)

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.201 position:30% line:89% align:start
Charyeok, huh?

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:02.603 position:24% line:89% align:start
I mean, honestly,

00:20:02.637 --> 00:20:06.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't know about gods and
all that magic kinda stuff.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.209 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you did see it,
though, with your own eyes.

00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:12.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's right, and
it wasn't natural.

00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:14.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's best to assume
that in this tournament,

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:18.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
most of our opponents will
have powers like that.

00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:21.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
Doesn't matter what
powers they have.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
The stronger our opponents are,

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
the more fun
they'll be to fight.

00:20:25.193 --> 00:20:26.160 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:20:26.194 --> 00:20:27.628 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're gonna win this thing!

00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:28.629 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:20:28.663 --> 00:20:29.530 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, baby!

00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:31.264 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Woo!
-He's kinda got a point.

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:34.168 position:10% line:83% align:start
No matter what, there's only
one thing we have to do.

00:20:34.202 --> 00:20:35.703 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true.

00:20:35.737 --> 00:20:36.904 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Damn it!
