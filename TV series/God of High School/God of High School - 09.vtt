00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:17.805 position:7% line:89% align:start
all the possibilities of what

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:19.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
this sword's owner
might be like.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.576 position:10% line:89% align:start
Young or old, man or woman.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
It seems you've
truly used it well.

00:07:25.713 --> 00:07:27.815 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must have trained
every single day.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.556 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mira grunts)

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:38.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:42.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
But all that training
was for nothing

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:45.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
because you're
still so oblivious.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
So completely unaware of
this sword's true power.

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:54.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Daewi panting)

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:56.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Daewi Voiceover] Mori,
What the hell are you doing?

00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:00.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know this means as much
to you as it does to us.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.917 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi gasps)

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.252 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you okay?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.457 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
You look good.

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:15.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is the true
form of this sword,

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:18.866 position:19% line:83% align:start
a weapon that houses
the power of the gods.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
The National Treasure, Fengxian.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
How in the world did
you not realize this?

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:30.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was in your hands and
you never once felt it.

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even as you trained so
hard every single day

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:35.049 position:16% line:89% align:start
wasting your young life,

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:37.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
how could you not
realize what you had?

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:38.786 position:13% line:89% align:start
You wanted to be stronger,

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:40.354 position:7% line:89% align:start
and the means to get stronger

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:42.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
was right in your
hands the whole time.

00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.358 position:33% line:89% align:start
Explain it.

00:08:44.392 --> 00:08:45.860 position:19% line:89% align:start
How could you not see?

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:50.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword Style,
Number 5: Swordless!

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:54.635 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wind Willow!

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:57.304 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Marin groans)

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:02.276 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, Moon Light Sword
Style, Number 1: Deva!

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:06.614 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Marin screams)

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:11.018 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:14.422 position:33% line:89% align:start
My sword ...

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:15.423 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mira gasps)

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:17.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
(audience gasps)

00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:21.162 position:7% line:83% align:start
It returns to the hand of who
it recognizes as its owner.

00:09:22.096 --> 00:09:24.899 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's the power of
a National Treasure.

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a shame.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.435 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:31.540 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, such a shame
indeed, little Mira Yoo.

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:35.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's clear to see you're
not it's true owner.

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:36.811 position:35% line:89% align:start
Grandpa!

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:39.013 position:13% line:89% align:start
Come on, get it together!

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
Grandpa!

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.551 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna get you free, okay?

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:43.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just hang tight.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dammit, I need something
to cut him loose.

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:52.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Taejin laughing)

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:56.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was so easy I
can't help but laugh.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Taejin laughing)

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04.105 position:21% line:89% align:start
(explosion rumbling)

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:14.081 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.858 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, that takes care of that.

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
One more small fry team's
out of the picture.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:44.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:46.180 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't hold this against me.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
We need all the small
fries out of the way

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:51.385 position:10% line:83% align:start
to accelerate the awakening
of the Key, apparently.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.225 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Mori groans) Who?

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.727 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:02.796 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.132 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't you just shut up and die?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.502 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Paylong chuckles)

00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:09.870 position:30% line:89% align:start
Doppelganger.

00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:16.277 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori groaning)

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
We had so many high
expectations for you,

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.317 position:7% line:89% align:start
Moon Light Sword's successor.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
We hoped you'd be the
one who awaken the sword

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:28.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
and grasp the true power of God.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.927 position:7% line:89% align:start
You must obtain the holy sword

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.062 position:13% line:89% align:start
that can rule God himself,

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:38.165 position:10% line:83% align:start
as well as the one hand that
can draw out that power.

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
But after all that,
as it turned out,

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:46.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Marin grunts)

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.309 position:10% line:89% align:start
you don't have power at all.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.477 position:19% line:89% align:start
It really is a shame.

00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:54.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Marin grunts)

00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:56.450 position:27% line:89% align:start
(audience gasps)

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:59.554 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's my sword.

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:01.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's mine.

00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:06.327 position:27% line:89% align:start

from South Gyeongsang's team?

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:17.071 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh baby, you're so cool.

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:19.340 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's play some more.

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:22.109 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm just so bored it hurts!

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:25.346 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:30.084 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I don't have
time to play around.

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.453 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:33.487 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] You okay?

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:35.590 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm fine.

00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:38.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't your team's
match still going on?

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:39.594 position:16% line:89% align:start
You should be out there.

00:12:39.628 --> 00:12:41.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry about me.
-It's fine.

(Pum Kwang groaning)

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:47.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
You really are cool!

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't believe I just did that!

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:55.409 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, bye-bye.

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.748 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Taek] What the
hell are you doing?

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.981 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Taek!

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:03.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh great, you again.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.155 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, they're
pretty much done.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:13.227 position:16% line:83% align:start
You always turn up in
the most random places.

(Taek chuckles)

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:16.631 position:24% line:83% align:start

take off like that.

Our final weapon in the

who became a hero

their death squad's
Northern-style TaeKwonDo.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
The man who defeated
every member of The Six.

00:13:57.838 --> 00:13:59.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that was a long time ago.

Senile fools like you

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:05.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
need to keep being useful
to us till the end.

Ah, you spotted them.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.382 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's right.

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:45.085 position:7% line:83% align:start
Lying before you are the real
members of the Jeju team.

00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:51.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Did you ...

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:53.394 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you do this?

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:58.132 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now that you've seen them,

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't allow you
to leave here alive.

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:02.469 position:24% line:89% align:start
I take that back.

00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:04.338 position:24% line:89% align:start
I never planned to.

00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:10.177 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't do this.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.180 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, you already took
the brunt of that explosion.

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:16.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your whole body must be
screaming in pain, right?

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:24.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, for the next hour
I won't feel anything.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd say I owe it to him
to tell you the truth

00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:31.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
since no one else will.

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:34.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
You are powerless.

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:36.270 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have no right
to do anything.

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.272 position:19% line:89% align:start
