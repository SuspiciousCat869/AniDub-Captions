(people murmuring in surprise)

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.859 position:10% line:89% align:start
Someone explain this to me.

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.961 position:5% line:89% align:start
Does King Kong really exist now

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.596 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I just missed the memo?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.967 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't want to believe it.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.036 position:21% line:89% align:start
It must be charyeok.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:39.306 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.609 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chief] Mr. President,
we have to evacuate.

00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:43.845 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:46.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
Confirm it ASAP and let me know.

Who is he?

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.257 position:33% line:89% align:start
I said stop!

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:01.161 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's weird,
Mujin's not back yet?

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
He called to say that
he's finishing up

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.320 position:7% line:89% align:start
and that he's on his way now.

Before the next

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
To be fair, for a
minute back there

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.171 position:19% line:83% align:start
I got to see something
more interesting

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.472 position:16% line:89% align:start
than some overseas trip.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:27.909 position:24% line:83% align:start

how this unfolds.

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.585 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mori] What's wrong?

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.486 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't you take a wild guess?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
Knock it off and
just leave me alone.

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:44.324 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't ask for our houses
to be on the same route,

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.194 position:21% line:77% align:start
so you really gotta
stop lurking,

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
and lurking, and lurking,

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
and staring, and
staring, and staring.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.933 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's creeping me out.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.636 position:44% line:89% align:start
You.

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:57.939 position:30% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

(Mori gasps)

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.240 position:19% line:83% align:start
Give me back my sword!

You're not secretly
a gorilla, are you?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.178 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Gah!
-Who's a gorilla

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:05.613 position:21% line:89% align:start
you big dumb baboon?

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.216 position:30% line:89% align:start
Gah, gah, gah!

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.184 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you, what's with
you following me

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:11.451 position:10% line:89% align:start
all the way from the arena?

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.087 position:21% line:89% align:start
You damned stalker!

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
'Cause my house is this way too.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mira growls)

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.627 position:41% line:83% align:start
Fine!
Whatever!

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:21.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just got it fixed.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you have to
go break it again?

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.198 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not cool.

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:25.900 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Not my problem.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why'd you attack me?

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:29.537 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was just trying to give back
your stupid wooden sword.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.805 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, if I'd had my glasses

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:32.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
I could have seen you
weren't that slipper jerk.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] The nanomachines
they injected us with,

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
they really can heal us.

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:48.556 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey guys!

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.423 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, what inspired
you to take part

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.827 position:21% line:83% align:start
in this whole God of
High School thing?

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.828 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.862 position:13% line:89% align:start
Where did that come from?

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
So like for me,

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to fight
all kinds of guys

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
and get way stronger every time!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
(chuckles) And you, Daewi?

00:05:08.543 --> 00:05:09.944 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:10.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah ...

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.285 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want money.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
Man, I wish it were
that simple for me.

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:20.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are fighting for?

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:29.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
I signed up to bring my family's
sword dojo back to life.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.298 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, cool.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your family runs a dojo?

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:33.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, kind of.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Then why'd you let people

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:36.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
snatch your sword so easily?

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
I told you, it's 'cause
I didn't have my glasses.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.541 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you listen?

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:41.275 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:42.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
No kidding.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
This thing's seen
a lot of action.

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:45.813 position:19% line:89% align:start

I need you to leave.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.094 position:24% line:89% align:start
I won't ask again.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:04.397 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

I've devoted everything to it,

to finding a strong successor.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.159 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's the only thing I want,

00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:07.828 position:21% line:89% align:start

Do whatever you want.

00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:25.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
(groans) I was sure it
fell somewhere around here.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.916 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mira] I'm sorry about before.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
For slapping you.

00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:32.620 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's more than a sword,

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.188 position:10% line:89% align:start
a gift from my late father.

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:38.592 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:42.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
In that case, we won't
stop until we find it.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.499 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:49.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(light clicking)
-(Mira gasps)

00:07:53.174 --> 00:07:54.141 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:55.643 position:13% line:89% align:start
I borrowed it from my job.

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:58.846 position:13% line:89% align:start
You really are a busybody.

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:09.890 position:7% line:83% align:start
-(people talking indistinctly)
-(energetic electronic music)

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:17.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.908 position:30% line:5% align:start
Good evening.

00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:29.944 position:7% line:5% align:start
We're live at the God of High
School Seoul Preliminaries

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:32.613 position:10% line:5% align:start
tournament arena, and we've
got an exciting lineup

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:33.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
for you tonight.

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:36.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoever makes it
all the way through

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.651 position:10% line:89% align:start
to the end of today's event

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.186 position:10% line:89% align:start
will qualify to participate

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the National God of
High School Tournament,

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:45.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
featuring our strongest fighters
from across the country.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.228 position:10% line:89% align:start
Who will seize victory here

00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:48.629 position:24% line:83% align:start
and take the first
step to having

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:50.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
their ultimate wish granted?

00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:54.635 position:13% line:83% align:start
Without further ado, let's
introduce our fighters.

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:57.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
First up, practitioner
of tai chi, Gamdo Go!

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:04.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering in the distance)

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:13.621 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori snoring)

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:17.625 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should know, I'm about
to kick your ass, kid.

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:26.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori snoring)

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:26.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
Humph.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.669 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gamdo] I suggest
you leave him alone.

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're not in the
ring at the moment--

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.576 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Daewi and Mari gasp)

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.247 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:41.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
Never let your guard down, man.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.320 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Manseok chuckles)

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
Attention participants.

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:51.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are we ready for
the games to begin?

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:56.163 position:10% line:89% align:start
(energetic electronic music)

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:05.272 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:09.544 position:16% line:5% align:start
Group A, match one, Mira
Yoo versus Daechul Han.

00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:12.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Daechul grunting)

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.784 position:24% line:89% align:start
Winner, Mira Yoo!

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:20.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
Group B, match one, Mori
Jin versus The Beast.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:23.457 position:10% line:89% align:start
(The Beast groaning in pain)

00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.460 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunting)

00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:28.329 position:24% line:89% align:start
Winner, Mori Jin!

00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:30.431 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Manseok] The form's different,

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
but he used TaeKwonDo
with punches too.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Group A, match two,

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:40.174 position:10% line:89% align:start
Miseon Ma versus Jongjin Wu.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.144 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Jongjin grunting)

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:46.413 position:24% line:89% align:start
Winner, Miseon Ma!

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:51.719 position:5% line:83% align:start
Group A, match seven, Seungchul
Baek versus Sangmin Yoo.

00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:57.592 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Sangmin groaning in pain)

00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:59.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
Winner, Seungchul Baek!

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.330 position:13% line:83% align:start
Group A, match eight,
Daewi Han versus Yes Man.

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Yes Man grunts)

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:09.870 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Daewi grunts)

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:10.671 position:41% line:89% align:start
K.O.!

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
Winner Daewi Han!

00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:16.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dude, I want to fight
Mira and Daewi so bad!

00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:18.012 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, come to think of it,

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:20.615 position:24% line:83% align:start
where's that jerk
with the slippers?

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:23.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess first he's
up against Gamdo Go.

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:25.719 position:13% line:83% align:start
So if we meet up, it will
be in the semifinals.

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:27.855 position:21% line:89% align:start
Most admirable Mori!

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:33.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
I appreciate what
you just did for me.

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.996 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's no biggy, really.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
Right time, right
place, that's all.

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:41.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
I completely underestimated
my opponent like an amateur.

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:44.673 position:10% line:83% align:start
If not for you, I don't know
what might have happened.

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.273 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please accept my thanks.

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:49.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Group
B, match eight,

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:52.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
between Manseok Kang and
Gamdo Go will begin shortly.

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.181 position:21% line:89% align:start
I must be on my way.

00:11:54.215 --> 00:11:55.216 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:11:56.551 --> 00:11:57.718 position:24% line:89% align:start
Be careful, okay?

00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:00.054 position:16% line:89% align:start
That guy's a tough one.

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:03.924 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm aware of that,
yet I don't fear him.

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:07.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is not overconfidence.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:09.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
The outcome I fear
the most would be

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
to lose the battle of
wills to a martial artist

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.735 position:19% line:83% align:start
I deem unworthy of
the name and practice.

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:19.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Gamdo chuckles)

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.111 position:19% line:89% align:start
The match will not end

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:27.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
until one participant is
either knocks out or gives up.

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:30.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
Also, if you're
knocked out of the ring

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:33.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
and stay out for 20 seconds
you're disqualified.

00:12:33.722 --> 00:12:35.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wounds sustained
during the battle

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.592 position:27% line:83% align:start
will be repaired
by nanomachines,

00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.193 position:21% line:89% align:start
so don't hold back.

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
You are certainly
a strong opponent,

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:42.564 position:13% line:89% align:start
but you have strayed from

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.498 position:21% line:83% align:start
the martial artist's
path and values.

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:47.368 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will give this all I have.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:49.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you don't release
your arm restraints,

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:53.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
I assure you, you'll regret it.

00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:55.009 position:10% line:89% align:start
Fighters, take your places.

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:57.478 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ready, go!

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Manseok chuckles)
Huh?

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.953 position:7% line:89% align:start
Rabbit's Step, Dragon Strike!

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:09.823 position:10% line:89% align:start
Dragon Horn's Divine Weight!

00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:14.795 position:10% line:89% align:start
Flaming 10,000 Horse Strike!

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:17.831 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blows thudding)

00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:22.202 position:10% line:89% align:start
Steel Ogre Mountain strike!

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:24.773 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd gasping)

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:26.273 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice move, man!

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:27.308 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no way.

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:33.147 position:27% line:89% align:start
20, 19, 18, 17,

00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:37.686 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get me up.

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:38.952 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:40.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:44.358 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Nine,
eight, seven, six,

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.259 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not bad.

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now let's make
things interesting.

00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:48.495 position:24% line:89% align:start
Four, three, two,

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:54.569 position:33% line:89% align:start
he made it!

00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:59.907 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Gamdo grunts)

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the exact moment
Gamdo's heel came down

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:12.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
he removed his right arm
from its restraint to block.

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, you're
actually pretty good.

00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:17.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
Guess I can't handle you
with kicks alone, can I?

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.694 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Gamdo grunts)

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:20.829 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Manseok chuckles)

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.964 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Manseok grunts)

00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:28.235 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Manseok laughing)

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:34.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Gamdo screams)

00:14:37.746 --> 00:14:38.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.147 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that even TaeKwonDo?

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've never seen anyone
fight like that before.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.052 position:13% line:89% align:start
Northern style TaeKwonDo?

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:46.186 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.888 position:7% line:89% align:start
Eye gouges, piercing strikes,

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:50.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
hits below the
belt, anything goes.

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:51.860 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was a martial art devised

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:53.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the aim of
survival in the war.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:56.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Q] Now where the
hell do you think

00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:58.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
