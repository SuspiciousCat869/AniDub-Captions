The god that descended
over the arena

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.778 position:21% line:83% align:start
appears to have been
blown out of the sky

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
by Jaesan Jeon's attack.

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:54.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Any response from Jaesan?

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:57.317 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not yet.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.485 position:7% line:89% align:start
And none from Mandeok, either.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you're really
saying the kids

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:02.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
who were sent to the holy realm

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:02.890 position:33% line:83% align:start
are the only
defense we got left?

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
To consume all and then
return to nothingness.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is to be my destiny.

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:15.870 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the power
of that Key thing

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.740 position:5% line:89% align:start
they've been hunting for?

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:20.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is insane.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
What does he think he is?

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:22.910 position:41% line:89% align:start
A god?

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.982 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori!

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:28.983 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori!

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:30.417 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori!

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you spacing out?

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know Seungah and the
others are in trouble.

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:36.691 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right now...

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:38.458 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mori Jin] Daewi!

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've gotta be at
their limit by now.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:40.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
That charyeok has been
protecting them this whole time.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.899 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, really?

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:47.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
We should pull back now.

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:47.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should join up
with Ilpyo and...

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:48.803 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:03.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword
Style, Number 7!

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.820 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will reduce everything
to nothingness.

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:08.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pained grunt)

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:10.525 position:33% line:89% align:start
(battle cry)

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.631 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this!

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:18.166 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pained grunt)

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
There is no point.

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:20.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that awaits those who
defy God is a painful death.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.174 position:19% line:89% align:start
You'd choose this path

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:26.841 position:21% line:83% align:start
just to satisfy your
pathetic ego and your pride?

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.745 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:32.245 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna make you
pay for what you did!

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
To Ilpyo, to Seungah
and her sister,

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:38.886 position:24% line:89% align:start
to Daewi, to Mira,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'd better apologize to my
friends and everyone you hurt!

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:49.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
My acupuncture is
a potent technique

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
that can draw forth
infinite power.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
But one can't withstand using it

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.804 position:7% line:89% align:start
on many points simultaneously.

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:57.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
To seek both strength and
speed, one must be willing to...

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
Too late for that.

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've already gone
way past my limit!

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:05.646 position:33% line:89% align:start
(battle cry)

00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's bring
him down quick!

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:24.264 position:33% line:89% align:start
(battle cry)

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.539 position:19% line:89% align:start
Twin Blue Dragon Kick!

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:41.115 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:42.049 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can someone
be this powerful?

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:46.020 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori!

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.861 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.064 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mori, you gotta hang in there!

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.535 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh and don't expect your
death to be painless.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:06.808 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get outta here.

00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:22.790 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your Majesty!

00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:23.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your Majesty!

00:05:25.827 --> 00:05:29.230 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our attack preparations.

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:30.998 position:7% line:89% align:start
We are ready and standing by.

00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:33.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Soldiers] On
your command!

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:34.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
There is no need for
you men to go anywhere.

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:45.613 position:35% line:89% align:start
Grow now.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.514 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nyoibo!

00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:04.799 position:41% line:89% align:start
It...

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:06.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
It can't...

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:07.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why even the Key's
guardian couldn't...

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:10.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
That child is...

00:06:16.978 --> 00:06:20.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
Seiten Taisei?

00:06:20.314 --> 00:06:22.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:22.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember, this is my...

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:28.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
My goodness.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
What on earth is this
creature Taejin Jin took in

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
and raised as his own?

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:32.894 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori?

00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:34.795 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:37.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
And what is this power?

00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:38.566 position:21% line:89% align:start
Grow small, Nyoibo.

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.173 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, show me what you've got.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:48.976 position:27% line:89% align:start
(battle efforts)

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:05.619 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it?

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.555 position:5% line:83% align:start
All powers are
at my mercy!

00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:08.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
My nothingness will
consume them and you as well!

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:11.258 position:24% line:89% align:start
I told you before,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.396 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna make you pay!

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:16.163 position:30% line:89% align:start
Grow, Nyoibo!

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.066 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:31.278 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is for Daewi!

00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:40.254 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is for Mira!

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:41.022 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:44.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
For Seungah
and her sister!

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:49.030 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pained grunt)

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:54.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
And this one's for Ilpyo!

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.103 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.311 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.420 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're wrong.

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:14.288 position:24% line:89% align:start
Say you're sorry!

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:15.423 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:16.991 position:24% line:89% align:start
Say you're sorry!

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.125 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.061 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:20.327 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am not a loser!

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.131 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.735 position:38% line:89% align:start
Gather!

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.904 position:35% line:89% align:start
Kinto-un!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.085 position:35% line:89% align:start
Rain down!

(screaming)

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:54.361 position:41% line:89% align:start
Again!

00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:56.030 position:41% line:89% align:start
Again!

00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.598 position:41% line:89% align:start
Again!

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.099 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gasps and murmurs)

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:03.137 position:33% line:89% align:start
But this...

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.441 position:24% line:89% align:start
This couldn't be.

00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:09.343 position:16% line:89% align:start
Unlike us mere mortals.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mori's power isn't
borrowed at all.

00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:13.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
He has become a
god in the flesh.

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:30.331 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, he can't.

00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:31.398 position:7% line:89% align:start
Lord Mandeok, we must go now.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:37.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mori, are you...

00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:39.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you even are Mori.

00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:40.674 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.709 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Both] Mori!

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:43.210 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang in there!

00:10:43.244 --> 00:10:44.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you hurt?

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:44.812 position:24% line:89% align:start
(stomach rumbling)

00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:48.249 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so hungry.

00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:49.416 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, he's Mori.

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:52.953 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's him.

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
My memories are still
kind of mixed up.

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:57.725 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't really
know what happened,

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
but then again I
think I kind of do?

00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:01.395 position:33% line:89% align:start
Which is it?

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:02.163 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.065 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.735 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Both] Mori!

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:08.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
(pained struggle efforts)

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.938 position:35% line:89% align:start
Give me...

00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.072 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:13.542 position:33% line:89% align:start
That power.

00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:15.176 position:24% line:83% align:start
I demand you hand
over that power.

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:17.678 position:35% line:89% align:start
(growling)

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's one hell of a
grudge right there.

00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:36.463 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously!

00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:37.031 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give us a break!

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:38.432 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:49.977 position:35% line:83% align:start
Kinto-un!
Nyoibo!

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.445 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come here.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.547 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just one more time!

00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:52.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
Damn it! Can't
you hear me?

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:57.484 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pained grunt)

00:12:10.565 --> 00:12:14.101 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.503 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should rely on your friends.

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:17.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
Have more faith.

00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:19.039 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ilpyo?

00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:20.709 position:41% line:89% align:start
Idiot!

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't be up
moving around yet!

00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:23.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Daewi Han] We sure are idiots.

00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:24.512 position:16% line:83% align:start
And this kind of idiocy
can only be cured by death.

00:12:28.717 --> 00:12:29.750 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:32.520 position:7% line:89% align:start
Idiot brigade, let's do this!

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:36.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
(kicking effort)

00:12:39.827 --> 00:12:43.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
(punching effort)

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:44.532 position:27% line:89% align:start
(attack effort)

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:55.376 position:38% line:89% align:start
(smirks)

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lu Bu Fengxian!

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
Night Parade
of 100 Demons!

00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:14.562 position:41% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:21.302 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mori!

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:22.303 position:41% line:89% align:start
Get...

00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:22.970 position:41% line:89% align:start
Going!

00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:28.976 position:24% line:89% align:start
Time to end this!

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:29.577 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mori Jin Original:

00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:32.580 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Imperial Divine Dragon Fang!

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:44.592 position:24% line:89% align:start
That didn't work?

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:45.459 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:54.602 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:06.447 position:30% line:89% align:start
One more shot!

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:19.426 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mommy, Mommy look.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.362 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's some dragons.

00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:22.530 position:24% line:89% align:start
(gasps murmuring)

00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:26.200 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Taek's Mom]
I want you to go

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:29.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
and live a good life
for Mommy, okay?

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:36.009 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:45.219 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:52.960 position:33% line:89% align:start
(weak grunt)

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:56.196 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let go of me, trash.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, just try to
live a good life, now.

00:15:02.537 --> 00:15:03.470 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:16.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] Were those
fragments of the Key?

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.787 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does that mean it was
freed from Taek's grasp?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.222 position:24% line:89% align:start
I guess it's over.

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:23.991 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.127 position:38% line:89% align:start
Anyone?

00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.462 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello.

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:29.631 position:21% line:89% align:start
Can anyone hear me?

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:30.899 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the heck's going on here?

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.266 position:10% line:89% align:start
Aww man I'm so totally lost.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.702 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:40.875 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:41.876 position:30% line:89% align:start
(loud banging)

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.612 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:45.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you sure you're okay, Ilpyo?

00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:47.181 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm fine, you two.

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:47.882 position:19% line:89% align:start
Totally fine I swear!

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.116 position:38% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:51.753 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you hadn't saved
us, we'd probably be--

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:54.988 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nah.

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:56.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
All I did was a little
first aid you know?

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:58.258 position:19% line:83% align:start
Damn it, what the hell
has been going on here?

00:15:58.292 --> 00:15:59.193 position:10% line:83% align:start
This stupid little girl woke
me up a whole two weeks early

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:03.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I don't appreciate it.

00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:04.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm real sorry!

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:05.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not to mention the fact

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:07.669 position:19% line:83% align:start
the holy realm's been
completely destroyed!

00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:10.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
Damn that Mujin.

00:16:10.772 --> 00:16:12.941 position:16% line:83% align:start
I told him over and over
again to be careful, but no.

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:13.708 position:33% line:89% align:start
And you're?

00:16:17.044 --> 00:16:18.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's not how you greet
someone, you dumb ape!

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:20.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you try
learning something

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:21.783 position:5% line:89% align:start
for once in your miserable life?

00:16:21.816 --> 00:16:24.017 position:24% line:89% align:start
Does he know her?

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.653 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who knows?

00:16:25.687 --> 00:16:26.855 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe his other version did.

00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:28.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't even know you!

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:29.858 position:27% line:83% align:start
And who the hell
you calling an ape?

00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:31.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better show
a little respect!

00:16:31.793 --> 00:16:34.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
Trust me, I'm a lot older

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:35.996 position:5% line:83% align:start
and far more important
than you are, monkey man.

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:37.498 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm not clear
on all the details.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.134 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it looks like
the original goal

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:42.670 position:5% line:83% align:start
of the God of High School
has been fulfilled.

00:16:42.704 --> 00:16:45.105 position:5% line:89% align:start
And you three are the only ones

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.841 position:30% line:83% align:start
who are still
standing at the end.

00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:48.008 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which makes you
the final winners.

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:50.545 position:35% line:89% align:start
But who...

00:16:50.578 --> 00:16:50.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
My name is Ungnyeo Kim.

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.681 position:5% line:89% align:start
The forebearer of the human race

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:54.649 position:10% line:89% align:start
and proud member of The Six!

00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:56.383 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cooing)

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:58.218 position:35% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:00.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are they some kind of
idol or comedy group?So lame.

00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:02.022 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mujin, you idiot.

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:03.591 position:5% line:83% align:start
You could've at least
explained things to them.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.092 position:10% line:89% align:start
Basically, I, the strongest,

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:08.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
most important person
involved in this tournament,

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
am standing before
you here and now

00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:12.800 position:19% line:83% align:start
to grant any one wish
to the lucky winners.

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.335 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wish?

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.840 position:35% line:89% align:start
Any wish?

00:17:18.873 --> 00:17:20.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then I want my grandpa back.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.341 position:21% line:89% align:start
I want him back now.

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:22.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:30.952 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ungnyeo Kim] I
will grant any wish.

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:32.887 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only thing
outside my abilities

00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:34.923 position:27% line:83% align:start
is bringing the
dead back to life.

00:17:34.956 --> 00:17:35.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
But any wish other
than that is fair game.

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:40.728 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't need to make a wish.

00:17:40.762 --> 00:17:41.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've decided to revive the
Moon Light Sword myself,

00:17:41.963 --> 00:17:44.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
so that's what I'll do.

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:46.199 position:35% line:89% align:start
Same here.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:46.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wish for whatever
you want, alright.

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.068 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:51.873 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:52.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then heal everyone
hurt in this battle!

00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:55.910 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make them all good as new.

00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:56.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
Exactly the way
they were before!

00:17:56.678 --> 00:17:58.345 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:18:07.822 --> 00:18:10.692 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:25.506 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ilpyo.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness!

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:31.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
Seungah, I'm glad
you're in one piece!

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.214 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.350 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.120 position:33% line:89% align:start
She did it.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.223 position:27% line:89% align:start
She healed them.

00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:55.003 position:21% line:89% align:start
What did I tell you?

00:18:55.036 --> 00:18:55.903 position:33% line:83% align:start
My power has
certain limitations.

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
It can only work on the living.

00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:59.540 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

00:18:59.574 --> 00:19:00.975 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're tiny now!

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:01.776 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're tiny now!
-Well yeah duh,

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:03.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
I ran out of power because

00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:04.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
someone woke me up two
whole weeks early.

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.547 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ooh!

00:19:06.581 --> 00:19:07.682 position:33% line:89% align:start
She shrank!

00:19:07.715 --> 00:19:07.915 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right, I shrank!

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.152 position:33% line:89% align:start
What of it?

00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:12.720 position:7% line:89% align:start
You got something else to say?

00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:16.223 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:18.392 position:7% line:77% align:start
So you've grown from a little
dumb ape to a big one. I keep
telling you, I'm not an ape!

00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:20.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
What is your deal lady?

00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:21.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
Taejin Jin is alive.

00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:22.797 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's weak but I still sense
his presence among the living.

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:28.636 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.369 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:31.939 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Both] Mori!

00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:36.711 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about him.

00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:37.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's exhausted all his
strength, so he konked out.

00:19:37.612 --> 00:19:39.914 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:40.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:19:53.427 --> 00:19:56.764 position:5% line:89% align:start
A bastard like you had the honor

00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:59.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
of a glorious death but...

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:00.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
You cheated me out
of my chance at one!

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:03.771 position:19% line:89% align:start
Grow up, Big Brother.

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look at you, getting all
sentimental in your old age.

00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:10.545 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, I heard Ungnyeo awakened?

00:20:12.914 --> 00:20:16.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Bongchim Nah] Yeah, what of it?

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:17.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, have you sorted
out your feelings yet?

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:20.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
I heard you cried
three days and nights

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:21.956 position:19% line:89% align:start
when she rejected you.

00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:22.890 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, sorry!

00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:25.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Shut your mouth!
-Low blow!

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.294 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, stop!

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:29.362 position:27% line:11% align:start
The recovery is
proceeding smoothly

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.264 position:16% line:11% align:start
but it'll take time for
the public anxiety to dissipate.

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:34.702 position:27% line:11% align:start
We have a unique
opportunity

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.871 position:30% line:11% align:start
to seize this
country, take control,

00:20:36.904 --> 00:20:38.639 position:30% line:11% align:start
by winning the
next election

00:20:40.373 --> 00:20:42.143 position:30% line:11% align:start
with one of us
as president.

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:43.243 position:7% line:89% align:start
The world is about to change.

00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:46.748 position:38% line:89% align:start
(smirks)

00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:50.017 position:33% line:89% align:start
(applauding)

00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:57.324 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:20:57.357 --> 00:20:58.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
♪ La la la la
la la la la ♪

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:01.796 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:02.764 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.299 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffing)

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:11.271 position:33% line:83% align:start
What is that
mouth-watering smell

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:12.540 position:7% line:89% align:start
wafting straight from heaven!

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:13.674 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:14.776 position:33% line:89% align:start
Daewi? Mira?

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:15.943 position:24% line:89% align:start
He woke up today.

00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.478 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:19.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
Exactly like Ungnyeo
predicted he would.

00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:21.314 position:21% line:11% align:start
You were asleep for
three months, you know.

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:23.350 position:24% line:11% align:start
(stomach rumbling)

00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:25.153 position:30% line:11% align:start
I'm starving.

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:25.820 position:21% line:11% align:start
Ohh-oh, looks tasty!

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.423 position:5% line:11% align:start
Welp, don't mind if I do!

00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:35.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did Ilpyo and everybody
else leave already?

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:38.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ungnyeo Kim] So then,
you're the Key's guardian?

00:21:41.035 --> 00:21:43.171 position:35% line:11% align:start
Uh, yeah.

00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:45.372 position:27% line:11% align:start
Or I guess I am.

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:47.575 position:21% line:11% align:start
Fragments of the Key

00:21:47.608 --> 00:21:48.576 position:24% line:11% align:start
have scattered to
locations around the world.

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:49.877 position:27% line:11% align:start
Which means that
as its guardian,

00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:53.014 position:21% line:11% align:start
you must gather them
and reunite the pieces.

00:21:53.047 --> 00:21:55.850 position:27% line:11% align:start
What is the Key?

00:21:55.883 --> 00:21:57.185 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't really know.

00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.486 position:27% line:11% align:start
A fearsome power
bestowed upon humans

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.888 position:21% line:11% align:start
that allows them to
break the divine taboo.

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:02.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
Humans cannot kill gods.

00:22:04.725 --> 00:22:06.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
That is the restriction
imposed by the deities

00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:09.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
who feared the potential
of the humans' power.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
But when the Key's
power is unleashed,

00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:14.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
that taboo is destroyed.

00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:14.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
It makes a mere human
capable of pulling gods

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:19.472 position:19% line:83% align:start
out of the holy realm
and easily killing them.

00:22:19.507 --> 00:22:20.675 position:13% line:11% align:start
Does Mori, I mean, Seiten
Taisei have that power, too?

00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:24.579 position:7% line:89% align:start
I dunno why you're asking me.

00:22:28.082 --> 00:22:28.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
Like I told you, my
memories are still super fuzzy.

00:22:28.883 --> 00:22:31.819 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ooh, my eye!

00:22:31.853 --> 00:22:33.221 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:34.222 position:19% line:89% align:start
I kinda figured that.

00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:36.389 position:19% line:89% align:start
According to Ungnyeo,

00:22:36.423 --> 00:22:37.258 position:16% line:11% align:start
your memories have been
sealed away from you.

00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:40.695 position:21% line:11% align:start
And to unseal them,

00:22:40.728 --> 00:22:41.629 position:5% line:11% align:start
you gotta travel to
Seiten Taisei's homeland.

00:22:41.662 --> 00:22:43.798 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:44.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
His homeland?

00:22:44.966 --> 00:22:45.365 position:19% line:89% align:start
That sounds like fun!

00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:49.637 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's do it!

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
You always just dive
right in without thinking!

00:22:50.738 --> 00:22:52.640 position:30% line:89% align:start
But you know.

00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:53.107 position:5% line:11% align:start
I'm kinda interested, too.

00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:56.577 position:27% line:11% align:start
Seems like it'd
be great training.

00:22:56.611 --> 00:22:58.312 position:5% line:11% align:start
I dunno what do you think?

00:22:58.346 --> 00:23:00.948 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jeez!

00:23:00.982 --> 00:23:02.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is exactly why you
two are hopeless without me.

00:23:02.083 --> 00:23:04.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
You never think things through!

00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:06.020 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:10.024 position:13% line:83% align:start
Man, the three of us will
get even stronger together!

00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:11.792 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just wait, Grandpa!

00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:24.872 position:21% line:11% align:start
I promise I'll find
you, no matter what!

00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:28.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see that he's
finally quieted down.

00:23:28.376 --> 00:23:31.779 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's a precious sacrifice.

00:23:31.812 --> 00:23:32.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'll be the one to
bring us a new God.

00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.082 position:35% line:89% align:start
(exhales)

00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:39.320 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mori...

00:23:39.353 --> 00:23:40.521 position:27% line:89% align:start
You are strong.

00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:42.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you can win.

00:23:42.623 --> 00:23:44.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
Against the gods, against fate.

00:23:44.692 --> 00:23:47.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
Most of all, against me.
