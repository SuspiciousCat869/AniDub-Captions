(phone ringing)

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:27.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, yes.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hello, Mr. Park,
I'm calling today

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.001 position:13% line:83% align:start
in regards to that
little bill you submitted

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.302 position:13% line:89% align:start
to the National Assembly.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.305 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're putting me in
a tricky situation.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:42.010 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, we're in a pickle. If
you understand my meaning.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.878 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] How much do you want?

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:47.782 position:10% line:89% align:start
(laughing) Oh, come on now.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.385 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't play naive. You know
we're well past all that by now.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
You and I are going
to have a nice, long,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
heart to heart soon in
the prosecutor's office.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.395 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'll put
that funding to good use.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.031 position:30% line:89% align:start
Scout's honor.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.498 position:33% line:89% align:start
Buh-bye now.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.801 position:16% line:83% align:start

next week's front page.

Ruling party leader Mujin
Park's dark side exposed.

His hopes to be prime
minister crash back to earth.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.445 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sound good?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.381 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's gotten too big for his
britches. That's for sure.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whether you like it
or not Mujin Park,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:28.188 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're about to find out who
really runs this country.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I figured
his luck's run out

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
now that he's picked
a fight with you, sir.

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:34.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Man] Idiot didn't
stand a chance.

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.130 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Man] (laughing) You said it.

(wind gusting)

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'll take
care of- (bellows)

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.146 position:27% line:89% align:start
What the hell?!

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:55.449 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.737 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] What's our progress?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.906 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sir, negotiations with
all agencies are complete.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.776 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll release the information
to the press in two hours.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.310 position:7% line:89% align:start
Everything's going as planned.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.347 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then let's begin.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.952 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.320 position:7% line:89% align:start

How in the world they
managed to pull that off?

I mean, seeing it
streaming is fine and all,

We worked so hard.
It makes no sense.

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:49.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you got to wonder just
how they pick the finalists.

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.739 position:19% line:83% align:start

Excuse me.

I'm sorry. But well, I
appear to be quite lost?

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:04.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you think maybe you could
direct me to the arena?

[Judo Captain] The
arena's that way, right?

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:12.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, you have to

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:34.181 position:16% line:89% align:start
And once you're there...

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.618 position:19% line:5% align:start
The arena's gotta have
food stalls, right?

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:40.554 position:19% line:5% align:start
Bananas, rice balls or
mouthwatering noodles.

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:45.793 position:13% line:89% align:start
(shrieking and bellowing)

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:47.528 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch where you're going!

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.498 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:53.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Stop him. Give that back.

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.470 position:35% line:89% align:start
(squeals)

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.472 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can buy clothes
for that grandkids.

00:08:58.507 --> 00:08:59.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
Would you like a sushi roll?

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your grandson has a brain tumor.

00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:04.578 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Mori] That poor old lady.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Robber] (laughing)
That was too easy.

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:10.184 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey! Stop!

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:12.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get your butt back here, thief!

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:14.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
Give that old lady
back her purse

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
so she can pay for the surgery!

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:17.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
Little Timmy needs
it or he'll die.

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:19.226 position:10% line:89% align:start
You want that on your head?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.661 position:13% line:89% align:start

is interested in martial arts.

the hell happened?

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.052 position:33% line:89% align:start
I missed it.

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:06.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Woman] Can't believe I

Here the only thing on
the line is your pride.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only thing you can

pay me back later.

[Mori] Huh?

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
For my glasses.

00:14:17.826 --> 00:14:19.293 position:19% line:89% align:start
If anyone's to blame,

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:21.796 position:19% line:83% align:start
it'd be the purse
snatcher, wouldn't it?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.798 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you send
the bill to him?

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:26.835 position:24% line:83% align:start
Geez, it's a big
opening ceremony,

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.035 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I can't see a thing.

Huh?

00:14:44.552 --> 00:14:45.919 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you looking at?

00:14:47.856 --> 00:14:49.356 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Mira.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.391 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mira Yoo.

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:54.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
Excuse me, participants,
you're all on deck,

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:55.630 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need you to stand by.

00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:58.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here in this arena, we've
gathered brave martial artists,

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
each one judiciously
handpicked and recruited

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.872 position:24% line:83% align:start
by our tournament
administrators.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:06.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is an all style
martial arts tournament

00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:10.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
in which any school of fighting
or practice will be allowed.

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
Furthermore, there is no timer,

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
nor any limitations
on weapons used.

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only way to win is to
knock out your opponent

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.522 position:13% line:89% align:start
or get them to surrender.

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:22.657 position:13% line:83% align:start
Regional preliminaries
are currently in progress

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
all over this great nation
to select our participants

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:28.596 position:13% line:83% align:start
for the tournament taking
place in one month's time.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.966 position:13% line:83% align:start
But enough chatter, let's
bring in our fighters!

00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:37.938 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:43.444 position:7% line:89% align:start
(overlapping chatter in crowd)

00:15:52.787 --> 00:15:55.989 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anyone got a granola bar in
their purse or something?

00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.160 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:06.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ha, we'll be using
these fancy bracelets

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.169 position:7% line:83% align:start
to monitor all the
contestants during the battle.

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:13.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nanomachines injected into them
when they entered the arena

00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:17.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
will allow us to monitor
their vitals in real time

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:20.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
and heal any injury
instantaneously.

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:23.350 position:13% line:83% align:start
So don't hold back, give
it everything you've got.

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:25.920 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whoever makes it
through the preliminary

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
and goes on to
win the tournament

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
will have any wish
their heart desires

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:33.093 position:13% line:83% align:start
granted by our tournament
administrators.

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you're not here
for explanations,

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:37.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
so what I'd let you do
what you came here for

00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:39.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
and get the fighting underway.

00:16:39.968 --> 00:16:42.369 position:33% line:89% align:start
So... Begin.

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:45.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Man] I'm kind of confused.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.942 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're going to fight? Already?

00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:49.276 position:10% line:89% align:start
So there aren't any pairings

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:51.613 position:19% line:83% align:start
or tournament
brackets or anything?

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:54.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're starting with
last man standing, huh?

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Woman] What's going on.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:16:59.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is the tournament starting now?

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:01.523 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Man] It's a battle royale!

00:17:01.556 --> 00:17:02.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
A battle royale?

00:17:02.991 --> 00:17:04.491 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you looking at?

00:17:04.526 --> 00:17:05.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right back at ya!

00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:06.995 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
I never liked looking
at your ugly mug anyway.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.298 position:7% line:89% align:start
You wanna say that again, pal?

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ha, his level's lower than mine.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.541 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:22.010 position:30% line:5% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.377 position:35% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.380 position:5% line:83% align:start
If I go after all the guys
with a lower level than mine...

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
(indistinct chatter
and groaning)

00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:42.229 position:13% line:89% align:start
Though hesitant at first,

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:44.164 position:7% line:83% align:start
our fighters are really
starting to show their skills

00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:45.867 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the arena.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.069 position:19% line:89% align:start
(whimpering, grunting)

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:57.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
(crowd screaming, gasping)

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:01.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, you have to win here
or you won't survive.

00:18:03.051 --> 00:18:08.255 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(grunting and groaning)
-(action music)

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:38.620 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Contestant] He looks
weak! Let's get him first!

00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:44.224 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ha, you wanna fight?

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.629 position:16% line:89% align:start
(grunting and groaning)

00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:04.579 position:7% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering and screaming)

00:19:04.612 --> 00:19:07.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, I heard a
commissioner was injured

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:10.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
by one of the very participants
he recruited, right?

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.089 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, once I
beat these guys down,

00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:17.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
I get a rematch with
blondie up there.

00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:20.595 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's going more or
less as predicted.

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:23.230 position:16% line:83% align:start
Naturally the strongest
among them will win.

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:26.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Q] The real spectacle
is yet to come.

00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:30.203 position:10% line:83% align:start
And some haven't even begun
to show their true colors.

00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:35.109 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:19:35.143 --> 00:19:37.845 position:16% line:83% align:start
I understand, then I'll
put them in immediately.

00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:42.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it appears that
it went through finally,

00:19:42.984 --> 00:19:45.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
our special arrangement
with the Seoul Reformatory.

00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:48.122 position:24% line:89% align:start
[T] Hang on a sec.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.289 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:51.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, we have ourselves
a latecomer.

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.128 position:13% line:89% align:start
Given this man's history,

00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:56.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
odds are good he's going
to be the one to beat.

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:01.468 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gate opening)

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:03.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
[T] Mansoek Kang will
have an HP handicap

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:07.307 position:10% line:83% align:start
based on 20% of the
average HP consumption rate

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.242 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the remaining participants.

00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:12.513 position:33% line:89% align:start
(rock music)

00:20:12.547 --> 00:20:15.016 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Mansoek laughs maniacally)

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:17.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
(grunting and groaning)

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:18.251 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] He's fast.

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:21.723 position:16% line:89% align:start
(grunting and groaning)

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.490 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mansoek] Too slow.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:25.860 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you people?

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:27.829 position:16% line:89% align:start
You a field of tomatoes?

00:20:27.862 --> 00:20:30.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
I would have more fun
taking a nap in my cell.

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
(laughing lowly)

00:20:33.201 --> 00:20:36.204 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Knock it off!
-Huh? (gasps)

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.206 position:16% line:89% align:start
(grunting and screaming)

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.308 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Mansoek laughing)

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:47.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
What a nice surprise?
Aint you a cutie pie?

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.585 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what's this sad old
thing, some girly toy?

00:20:51.753 --> 00:20:54.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword Style,
Number one! Deva!

00:20:57.925 --> 00:21:00.595 position:27% line:89% align:start
(groans loudly)

00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
(laughs) I like you.

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:10.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you say, pretty
lady, how about a date?

00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:13.373 position:7% line:89% align:start
Gross! No way, you big creep.

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:15.375 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Judo Captain]
(growling) That bastard.

00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:16.376 position:27% line:89% align:start
(chuckles) Huh?

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Excuse me.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.281 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, you like cute things, do ya?

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:24.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
Personally, you seem more
like a briefs man to me.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mansoek] Well, since
you're so obsessed

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:28.089 position:7% line:89% align:start
with the packaging, wanna see?

00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:31.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Nah. His pants are heavy.

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:35.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
Buddy, you might want to
fight someone who... (bellows)

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:42.570 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:21:42.603 --> 00:21:46.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, kid, who the hell are you?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.476 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] In that
split second, he...

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:52.914 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, not too shabby.

00:21:52.947 --> 00:21:55.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're going to go all
out then so will I!

00:21:56.784 --> 00:21:59.654 position:24% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) Yeah,
baby. Bring it on!

00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:07.327 position:10% line:89% align:start
