[Narrator] In ancient times,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
there resided in Heaven
a nine-tailed fox spirit

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.052 position:21% line:77% align:start
that after centuries
of training,

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.556 position:16% line:89% align:start
attained immense power.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
Appointed the guardian of
the God who ruled Heaven,

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:28.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
this fox spirit repelled
countless crises.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:32.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
But even God himself, slowly
began to fear this spirit.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:36.671 position:5% line:89% align:start
Until, he ordered its execution.

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:40.173 position:13% line:89% align:start
Outraged at this betrayal,

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fox spirit used
its fearsome power

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:47.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
to destroy half of Heaven
then descended to Earth.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
Once it had exhausted
all of its power,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fox spirit swore
revenge on God.

00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.192 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then fell into a long sleep.

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:37.118 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the heck is that?

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:38.285 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is everything okay?

00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:43.891 position:27% line:89% align:start
(thunder roars)

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.770 position:19% line:89% align:start

Winner, Mori Jin.

(crowd cheers)

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:17.384 position:27% line:89% align:start
Great job, Mori.

(Mira laughs)

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.620 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:20.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
Congrats.

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:22.389 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:24.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm complimenting you.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.392 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what was that?

00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:26.627 position:35% line:89% align:start
Charyeok?

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.764 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what the heck was that?

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ilpyo, Ilpyo.

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.736 position:30% line:89% align:start
Say something.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:39.039 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ilpyo groans)

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:41.408 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
Did I...

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:49.650 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nine-Tails lost, but how?

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
That energy we felt,
what could that've been?

(Sang sighs)

00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:03.030 position:13% line:83% align:start

be wise to exercise caution.

(girl grunts)

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:06.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shit.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.905 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mujin thuds)

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sang] I'll be
taking my leave now.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:18.012 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:19.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:22.449 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mujin smirks)

00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:26.287 position:30% line:89% align:start
(phone rings)

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.288 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Man] Hello?

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:28.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it done?

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:29.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Man] Yes.

00:11:29.723 --> 00:11:33.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
Good, then secure
the Key at once.

00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:35.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Man] He needs a medical
exam and treatment first,

00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:38.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
so we're taking him to the
hospital and assigning security.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mujin smirks)

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.368 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.807 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd cheering)

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.246 position:13% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music continues)

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like everything's
about taken care of,

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
so we can get moving soon.

00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:04.858 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have them wait at
the chosen location.

00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:07.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm concerned Mandeok's
still planning something.

(crowd chattering)

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:26.146 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Both] Thank you.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
(doors slams)

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.119 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Hyeonbok laughs)

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:33.220 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sorry I lost.

00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:34.355 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both gasp)

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:36.490 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess my strength wasn't enough.

00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:37.659 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not true.

00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:38.759 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:39.760 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding me?

00:12:39.793 --> 00:12:41.028 position:13% line:89% align:start
You did more than enough.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.797 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dude, that was charyeok, right?

00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:45.132 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'd say so.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:47.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty surprised too.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.438 position:19% line:83% align:start
So then, were you able
to keep your promise?

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:56.410 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, or at least part of it.

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:57.512 position:24% line:89% align:start
The promise I made,

00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:00.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
isn't one that can be
fulfilled right away, you know?

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:04.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
I realized that
during the fight.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.021 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:13:10.558 --> 00:13:12.426 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ilpyo gasps)

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.427 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the...

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.529 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:15.664 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yo.

00:13:15.697 --> 00:13:16.665 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:13:16.698 --> 00:13:17.898 position:30% line:89% align:start
How you doing?

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:19.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you know?

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well speak of the
devil, I guess.

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:23.672 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's a tough guy isn't he?

00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:26.140 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ilpyo smirks)

00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:26.940 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori laughs)

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.677 position:19% line:89% align:start
So how're you feeling?

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.679 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm doing fine, thanks.

00:13:30.712 --> 00:13:32.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
You?

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:35.082 position:10% line:83% align:start
A whole heck of a lot better
than you, as you can see.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nah man, I'm just laying low,

00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:38.986 position:7% line:89% align:start
doing what the nurses told me.

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:41.690 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm actually way healthier
than you any day of the week.

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:42.890 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't try too hard, man.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:44.992 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think you're the one
who's trying too hard.

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:46.260 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whatever, I'm super healthy.

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:48.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, you still
need to be careful.

00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:49.296 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, knock it off.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.297 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, you.

00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:51.498 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:53.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
So Mori Jin, was that charyeok
you used during the match?

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:54.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh, you know what?

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:56.437 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure actually.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.838 position:21% line:89% align:start
It surprised me too.

00:13:57.871 --> 00:14:00.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, that's exactly
what Ilpyo said.

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:02.843 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Seungah sighs)

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.011 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you grow up?

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll never get better
if you act like this.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Both] Sorry.

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.317 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's as scary as Mira.

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:11.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can hear you.

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:12.319 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori chokes)

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:14.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, Seungah's
right, though.

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:16.725 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should be
resting up as well.

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:17.858 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ilpyo sighs)

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:20.327 position:16% line:83% align:start
You used up a lot of
your strength out there.

00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:22.329 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori groans)

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:23.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Seungah gasps)

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:24.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, maybe.

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:26.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
Guess I'll start heading back.

00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:29.069 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, wait hang on a sec.

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:30.270 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:33.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well since you're already
here, wanna do me a favor?

00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:36.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
Could you guys go pick up
some snacks to go with this?

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.211 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, sure.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:39.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can go take care
of that myself.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.881 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way, I'll go with you.

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh, really, I got this.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.017 position:19% line:83% align:start
No debate, I'm going.
Now move.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.186 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait but Seungah, shouldn't
you follow your own advice?

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.488 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Seungah] Yeah, yeah come on.

00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:49.624 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Hyeonbok] I'm just saying,
you're the one who said-

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:51.191 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Seungah] Move, seriously.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:54.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
So hey, did you wanna
talk about something?

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:55.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:14:56.698 --> 00:14:58.065 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:59.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm here about my grandpa.

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.436 position:24% line:89% align:start
About Taejin Jin?

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:07.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
So Taejin Jin is still missing.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:10.177 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't know where he is.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.681 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which is why I have to win at
all costs and get that intel.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:15.916 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have to save my grandpa.

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.085 position:7% line:89% align:start
So that's what's driving you.

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.821 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your opponent in the finals,

00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:21.689 position:21% line:83% align:start
Taek Jegal is gonna
be real tough.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.058 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sad music)

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:33.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you can beat him, I know it.

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.935 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you keep making that face,

00:15:34.968 --> 00:15:37.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
Taejin's gonna be
the one saving you.

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:39.841 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:41.408 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cries)

00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:42.577 position:30% line:89% align:start

(Ilpyo laughs)

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:51.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ilpyo, I wanna fight you
again after GOH is over.

00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:53.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
Big Brother Ilpyo.

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:54.988 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:56.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
Technically I'm older than you,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I think you should
call me Big Brother Ilpyo.

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:00.327 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you agree?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.996 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mori grunts)

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.732 position:24% line:89% align:start
Big Brother Ilpyo?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.568 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:08.202 position:19% line:89% align:start
We should fight again.

00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:13.207 position:24% line:89% align:start
(computer buzzes)

00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.711 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Hyangdan breathes)

00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:18.479 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, Master.

00:16:18.513 --> 00:16:21.850 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Jugok groans)

00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:24.318 position:24% line:89% align:start

(Jugok groans)

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.120 position:35% line:89% align:start
lost yet.

00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:30.625 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:34.027 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's energy seems
to have hit him.

00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:36.898 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Jugok groans)

00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.999 position:27% line:89% align:start
I will not lose.

00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:40.768 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do, re, mi, fa...

(Jugok groans)

00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:57.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just don't have time to
waste on losers like you.

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:59.654 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:41.696 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Master.

00:17:42.564 --> 00:17:46.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hyangdan become my,

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:48.836 position:35% line:89% align:start
strength.

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:54.074 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess we bought
a little too much.

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:55.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
