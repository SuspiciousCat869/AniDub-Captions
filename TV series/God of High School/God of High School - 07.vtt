00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.223 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] It begins at last!

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.960 position:16% line:83% align:start
The National God of
High School Tournament!

00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:07.461 position:13% line:89% align:start
The first match in Group A

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
is between the teams from
North Chungcheong and Seoul!

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
Due to a recent rule change,
instead of individual winners,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.303 position:13% line:83% align:start
this match will be fought
as a team tournament

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.238 position:27% line:83% align:start
and will consist
of three rounds.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
The first team that manages
to score two victories wins!

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right then!

00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:25.013 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll handle the first fight.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:26.480 position:19% line:89% align:start
Be careful out there.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.316 position:10% line:83% align:start
They might use that charyeok
stuff he told us about.

00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:31.485 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not a problem.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've got a new weapon of my own.

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:36.758 position:13% line:89% align:start
The wait is finally over!

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:40.962 position:7% line:83% align:start
The first round will be fought
by Mori Jin and Gidong Nah!

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.797 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ready, go!

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
It sucks for you, getting
matched up with me.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.136 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll clean the floor
with you in a second.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.170 position:13% line:89% align:start
But not before I show you

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.273 position:24% line:89% align:start
my brand new move!

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:57.879 position:19% line:83% align:start
These pressure points
boost my power.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.615 position:19% line:89% align:start
So that sucks for you

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:03.183 position:19% line:83% align:start
'cause now my attacks
will be way stronger!

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
He can thank me for
that little secret.

00:03:08.823 --> 00:03:12.160 position:10% line:83% align:start
And Taejin's TaeKwonDo will
become a thing of the past.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.562 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, let's do this!

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.602 position:13% line:83% align:start
I, I can't move, I hit
the wrong pressure points.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.005 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Mori Jin screaming)

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:28.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(kicks thudding)
-(both grunting)

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Winner: Gidong Nah!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.247 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I knew I'd win!

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.386 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should've stuck with
TaeKwonDo instead.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gidong] Did you
see what I did, bro?

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:42.322 position:27% line:89% align:start
You see me win?

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, job well done.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.493 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was one win, don't get cocky.

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.329 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Now, let's move
on to the second round.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we mess this one
up too, we're out.

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
You better win this round.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.904 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you lose like that
idiot, I'll kick your ass.

00:03:58.072 --> 00:03:59.073 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Now
the second round:

00:03:59.107 --> 00:04:01.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
Daewi Han versus Pum Kwang Jin!

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
At age 38, Pum Kwang Jin
happens to be the oldest fighter

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:07.048 position:7% line:89% align:start
competing in this tournament.

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.248 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait, that guy's 38 and
still in high school?

00:04:10.218 --> 00:04:11.185 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no way.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:12.419 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, what can I say?

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.590 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're never too
old to learn, right?

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.894 position:7% line:89% align:start
(laughs maniacally) Fantastic.

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:23.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
The great Q laying at
my feet like a ragdoll.

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:27.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's so pathetic, I
can't help but laugh.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
That pointy little
sunglasses-wearing bastard

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:30.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
met a hell of an end too.

00:04:30.772 --> 00:04:35.275 position:10% line:83% align:start
He came crawling, begging me
to spare his miserable life.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:36.778 position:13% line:89% align:start
And since I'm a nice guy,

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
I gave him a quick
and merciful death.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
And his wife and kid, so
they could be together.

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:47.822 position:21% line:89% align:start
(laughs maniacally)

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.029 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, man,

00:05:06.808 --> 00:05:09.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
let me know when you're
done monologuing.

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:15.983 position:30% line:89% align:start
(blows softly)

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.486 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm real sick of
hearing your voice.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
So die.

00:05:25.293 --> 00:05:26.493 position:30% line:89% align:start
(device beeps)

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:31.532 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:51.752 position:27% line:89% align:start

Bro, you good?

00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:03.197 position:30% line:89% align:start
It'll be fine.

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.364 position:21% line:89% align:start
He won't lose here.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:06.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's just who he is.

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
He never gives up
no matter what.

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:11.706 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, even back then.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.245 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Girl 1] I heard
that guy's planning

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:19.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
to take a high
school entrance exam.

00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:21.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Girl 2] Really? At his age?

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:22.516 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.585 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not only that, but he's
already failed three times.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:26.386 position:5% line:89% align:start
I dunno what the dude's thinking

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.689 position:21% line:83% align:start
but damn, like,
talk about pathetic.

00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:29.924 position:38% line:89% align:start
Totally.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:31.559 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all giggling)

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, aren't you girls
still in school?

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
Haven't you heard? Smoking
makes you die young.

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.399 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ugh, what a jerk.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.074 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Gidong] Hey, bro.

00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:50.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
Got the reference
materials you asked for.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.478 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Pum Kwang] Oh, thanks.

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:56.550 position:21% line:89% align:start
If not for you dude,

00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:58.052 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd still be wasting my life

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:00.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
and getting into pointless
fights every day.

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:02.390 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Girl 1] Thinking
he's better than us.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.691 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Girl 2] Yeah, what an ass.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jangmi] I guess
that's what it means

00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:06.761 position:16% line:89% align:start
to be a failure at life.

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:09.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm never going to be like that.

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:10.932 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ever.

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Girl 1] Weren't these same
two in the finals last year?

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Girl 2] Oh, well I know
they've faced each other

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:20.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
tons of times.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.143 position:10% line:89% align:start
But the winner is always...

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:23.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jangmi] I can do this!

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:27.381 position:16% line:89% align:start
The winner: Nayeon Kim!

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:28.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
(audience applauding)

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.284 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yes!
-You did it!

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:33.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(all laughing)
-Way to go!

00:07:35.323 --> 00:07:39.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(rain pattering)
-(soft music)

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Jangmi Jang screams)

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:50.538 position:19% line:89% align:start
Aw, look what you did.

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.407 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, you okay?

00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:56.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
My name's Pum Kwang, by the way.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.778 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm aware.

00:07:57.812 --> 00:07:59.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
The girls talk about you.

00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:04.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
(laughs) Bet they're
not saying good things!

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:05.553 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:09.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't see how you
can just laugh it off.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.425 position:24% line:83% align:start
You keep failing
the entrance exam.

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:14.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
They make fun of you
saying you'll never pass.

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:15.463 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why not give up?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because I won't
give up on myself.

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:21.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look, I'm not very
good at studying,

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:23.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
I actually went to high
school once before,

00:08:23.371 --> 00:08:24.805 position:16% line:89% align:start
but then I dropped out.

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:26.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've tried a lot of
different things since then

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:29.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
but none of them
seemed to really stick.

00:08:29.043 --> 00:08:30.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
And the reason's simple,

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
basically, I'd pretty
much given up on myself.

00:08:35.016 --> 00:08:37.852 position:13% line:83% align:start
My thinking was, there
was no way I could do it.

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:41.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then I decided I'm
seeing this through

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:44.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I'm never gonna
give up on myself again.

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.262 position:7% line:89% align:start
You shouldn't give up either.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.632 position:10% line:83% align:start
As long as you don't, you'll
wind up where you wanna be.

00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:07.048 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Jangmi] What a fool.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:13.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, the truly
foolish one was...

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:17.892 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat rock music)

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:21.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
The answer to that
one is k equals 1/2.

00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:24.533 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, are you?

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
This isn't even a hard one.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.336 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you sure something
isn't wrong with your head?

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have exams coming up too,
so why don't I help you out?

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.375 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, really?

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:35.810 position:19% line:89% align:start
That'd be a huge help!

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:42.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jangmi] There's no
way he'll ever lose.

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:49.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Charyeok?

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:50.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
(Mori Jin whistles)

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.959 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh damn!

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:57.765 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:00.401 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have a dream in my heart.

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.538 position:7% line:83% align:start
I want to do work that helps
people who wanna go to school,

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:05.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
but for whatever reason, can't.

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.944 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll use this tournament to
make that dream come true.

00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
I want to get stronger.

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:19.186 position:19% line:89% align:start
If I can get past you,

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.189 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll be that much closer.

00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:24.725 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay, then.

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:30.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
Crush him, Thor's Hammer!

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
(hammer thuds)

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:39.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Daewi, hang in there!
-I can't afford to lose!

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.742 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Daewi!
-Not in front of my friends.

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.979 position:13% line:89% align:start
Last stance: Azure Dragon!

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:51.018 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rocks crashing)

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:00.494 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Winner: Daewi Han!

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:05.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right! (laughs)

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:07.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Drake panting)

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.671 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword clashing)

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:26.053 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Drake laughs maniacally)

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
It won't work.

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:30.324 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since we're doing show and
tell, here's my charyeok!

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:34.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
As long as I have this,
I can keep regenerating!

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
No matter what you do,
it won't work on me!

00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:38.999 position:30% line:89% align:start
(blows softly)

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:40.034 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who cares?

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:47.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Drake screaming)

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:50.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword clashing)

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:53.113 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:02.389 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who are you two?

00:12:08.697 --> 00:12:11.465 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.903 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's with all of you?

00:12:17.706 --> 00:12:19.406 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't walk into a house

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.844 position:13% line:89% align:start
with your shoes still on.

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:27.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Drake] Priest Exly!
Priest Saturn, I-

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:29.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
Would you care to explain
what you're doing here, Drake?

00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:31.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
We were the ones ordered
to kill the commissioner.

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:33.588 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or did you forget?

00:12:33.622 --> 00:12:36.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah well, I'm a
member of Nox, too.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.694 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm just as good at carrying
out orders as you two-

00:12:39.728 --> 00:12:41.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you wanna talk,
do it in hell!

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:45.099 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're very impatient.

00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
National Treasure: Durendal!

00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:03.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
(weapons whooshing)

00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:14.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
Accept God's judgment!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.802 position:24% line:83% align:start
I noticed your
limiter wasn't on,

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.772 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I came to check on you.

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like things got
pretty lively here.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
Touching, but I can
handle this on my own.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.245 position:30% line:89% align:start
(blows softly)

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
Removing your limiter
without permission

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
will cost you three months' pay.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
Adding that to your
previous penalty,

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.320 position:13% line:89% align:start
that's half a year's pay!

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.855 position:33% line:89% align:start
Half a year?

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
The final round will now begin!

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our fighters are Mira
Yoo and Jangmi Jang!

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:49.963 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.533 position:10% line:89% align:start
These teams are one-and-one.

00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:52.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
The team that wins this match

00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:55.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
will get to advance
to the second round.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.539 position:38% line:89% align:start
Places!

00:13:57.572 --> 00:13:59.406 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ready, go!

00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
(both grunting)

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:32.707 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jangmi] I knew from the
start that my sword skills

00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:34.341 position:16% line:89% align:start
were no match for hers.

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:35.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
Jangmi!

00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:37.512 position:27% line:83% align:start
-But...
-C'mon, Jangmi!

00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:41.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is one fight I can't lose!

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:45.386 position:27% line:89% align:start
(both grunting)

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now you'll witness my charyeok!

00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:57.565 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bastard!

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:03.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(upbeat music)
-(laser gushes)

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:08.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bears squeaking)

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:15.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
(powers clashing)

00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.760 position:27% line:89% align:start
(glass shatters)

00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:29.196 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monsters growls)

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:32.032 position:7% line:89% align:start
Chew your food well, Changsik.

00:15:37.906 --> 00:15:40.542 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who the (beep) do you
think you are, maggot!

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:43.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna rip off your (beep)
and shove 'em up your (beep),

00:15:43.678 --> 00:15:44.913 position:38% line:89% align:start
got it?

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.046 position:30% line:89% align:start
You don't say.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.015 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've got quite
the mouth on you.

00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.287 position:24% line:89% align:start
(swords clashing)

00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:58.058 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Q] Now the finale!

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:15.476 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:18.011 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh man, this is so good!

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:20.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Daewi] Don't just take my
lunch and start eating it!

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:21.950 position:27% line:89% align:start
Really, you two?

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:23.818 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't look concerned
about your teammate.

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nah, she's got this.

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:27.087 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can see it in her eyes.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.990 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we worry about her, we
won't hear the end of it.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:37.030 position:7% line:89% align:start
Naturally, and in my own way,

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:43.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will win and keep
moving forward.

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:47.174 position:7% line:89% align:start
My sword channels that desire.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword Style,
Number 23: Wind Willow!

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:04.091 position:16% line:89% align:start
Mira Yoo wins the match!

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:09.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.469 position:24% line:89% align:start
You mother (beep)!

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:20.708 position:21% line:83% align:start
Take your (beep) and
go (beep) yourself!

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:25.245 position:27% line:89% align:start
(both screaming)

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:29.082 position:24% line:89% align:start
(swords clashing)

00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:38.091 position:13% line:83% align:start
And last but not least,
this one's for Bongsa Sim!

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:39.727 position:44% line:89% align:start
Die!

00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:56.476 position:27% line:89% align:start
(glass shatters)

00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.314 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn it all. They got away.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Drake laughs)

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:05.419 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, don't ignore me.

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:09.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
The one who's gonna
kill you is me!

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:12.326 position:21% line:89% align:start
(laughs maniacally)

00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:16.096 position:24% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.809 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:29.611 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mira Yoo! Mira Yoo!

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.112 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mira] Stop it. You're
embarrassing me.

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.414 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Daewi] As we are now,

00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:35.984 position:7% line:89% align:start
I doubt that'll happen again.

00:18:36.017 --> 00:18:37.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mori] Why're you
squeezing my face?

00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:40.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm just cheering
for you. Come on!

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.525 position:27% line:89% align:start
You awake there?

00:18:48.663 --> 00:18:49.664 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:18:49.697 --> 00:18:51.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
I let both of you down.

00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:53.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not over yet.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.170 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you don't give up, you can
keep trying again and again.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:02.577 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Are you ever gonna stop?

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
Haven't you punished
my face long enough?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(people chattering)
-(sirens wailing)

00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:14.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
It now appears that
they're truly on the move.

00:19:15.823 --> 00:19:17.558 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nox won't stop.

00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:22.329 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've been contacted by O.

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.832 position:27% line:83% align:start
It appears Q was
attacked by Nox.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
The commissioners'
home addresses

00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:29.003 position:10% line:89% align:start
were supposedly top secret.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:31.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
Few had access to them.

00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:33.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
We have a traitor among us.

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:36.811 position:16% line:83% align:start
A filthy parasite living
in the tiger's belly.

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:39.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
Also, take a look at this.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
Upon closer inspection,

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:45.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
we've determined that this
belonged to Taejin Jin.

00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:48.488 position:24% line:83% align:start
We suspect he may
have been abducted

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:52.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
and taken to an
undisclosed location.

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:54.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Announcer] Next up is the
first match for Group B:

00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:57.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
team South Gyeongsang
versus team North Jeolla!

00:19:57.899 --> 00:20:01.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
The first round is between
Taek Jegal and Jugok Jeon!

00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:02.136 position:21% line:89% align:start
(audience cheering)

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.706 position:10% line:89% align:start
I saw him in some magazine.

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:06.808 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't he the Sixsung
Corporation's-

00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:10.845 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Guy] Yeah, he's the heir
to a major business empire.

00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:13.480 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Announcer] Ready, go!

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:15.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't care what
you think about me.

00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:20.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will do what I
must to defeat you.

00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:25.560 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do re mi fa, fireball-

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
(flesh gushes)

00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:30.164 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:32.967 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster roars)

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
How dare you!

00:20:49.217 --> 00:20:52.252 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Hyangdan groans)

00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:00.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is no place for a woman.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:05.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
(tense dramatic music)

00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:08.268 position:41% line:89% align:start
Don't!

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:11.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you interfere again,
you'll be disqualified.

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:14.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't lose sight of
your plan. Got it?

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:15.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well why does he get to?

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:22.349 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it.

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:25.686 position:19% line:89% align:start
(laughs) Interesting.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:30.390 position:21% line:89% align:start
Stop, that's enough!

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:32.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
Further action from
you will be penalized.

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.832 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lightning Bolt.

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:47.440 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm here with the expectations

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.111 position:10% line:89% align:start
of my grandfather and family

00:21:50.144 --> 00:21:52.479 position:10% line:89% align:start
all riding on my shoulders.

00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:54.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't lose to
the likes of you!

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:04.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, your family
won't like this.

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:09.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
