00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kinda dress
are you gonna get?

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:48.863 position:38% line:89% align:start
I dunno.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.064 position:27% line:89% align:start
White, I guess?

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:51.199 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aww.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.700 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:54.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
Pink's super cute, see?

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who's invited to the reception?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.173 position:13% line:89% align:start
It won't be a fancy event.

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:00.174 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm still in school.

And what about the honeymoon?

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:05.913 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well I, uh...

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.083 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's like a dream!

00:04:09.117 --> 00:04:10.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're crazy lucky.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:13.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you're
marrying the Seongjin!

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:16.256 position:10% line:83% align:start
The strongest, most gorgeous
martial artist there is.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
The businessman who's
the handsome face

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:22.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
of this country's sports
entertainment scene!

00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:23.731 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sigh)

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:24.932 position:38% line:89% align:start
And bam!

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.902 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just like that, he fell in
love with you at first sight!

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:32.840 position:7% line:83% align:start
Miss Mira Yoo, I ask you once
again to accept my proposal.

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:38.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
You are a true
diamond in the rough.

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:40.114 position:13% line:89% align:start
So strong, and beautiful.

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.550 position:7% line:89% align:start
Possessing infinite potential.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can think of no one else
better suited to be my partner.

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:47.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on.

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just an ordinary schoolgirl.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:50.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
No problem!

00:04:50.992 --> 00:04:53.161 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been studying the
Moon Light Sword Style

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:54.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to learn
more about you.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.429 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's so marvelous!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why has such a
fantastic sword style

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
been buried in
obscurity all this time?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.738 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't let it remain
buried any longer!

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:05.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can give you and
the Moon Light Sword

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
the shine you so deserve!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:10.645 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can do this.

00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:15.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll help you take
hold of your future.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.584 position:33% line:89% align:start
You and me.

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's take flight
into the world!

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.156 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look, look!

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
This one's incredible!

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Mira] Take hold of the future.

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:30.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what he gets for clinging

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
to an antiquated sword style.

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:35.468 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Moon Light Sword
Style is done for.

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:38.840 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Guy] Especially with only
a little girl to inherit it.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:42.310 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mira.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna live
with me from now on.

00:05:44.312 --> 00:05:46.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll protect my brother's
Moon Light Sword.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.682 position:30% line:89% align:start
I promise you.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.420 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cooing)

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.168 position:24% line:83% align:start
From now on, I'll
be your teacher.

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.936 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Students] Thank you, teacher!

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:11.371 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:15.076 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Student] Me next!

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:17.945 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.086 position:19% line:89% align:start
Jeez, he's super weak.

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:26.087 position:35% line:89% align:start
He stinks.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.420 position:30% line:83% align:start
-He's useless.
-Ahh!

00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:32.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Student] He's nothing
like our other teacher.

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:34.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dejected sigh)

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:40.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who has to secure
the Moon Light Sword's future.

00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:42.469 position:7% line:89% align:start
After all, I'm its successor.

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:48.743 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why would an accomplished man
like you want to marry Mira?

00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:50.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, she's
still just a child.

00:06:52.947 --> 00:06:55.415 position:24% line:83% align:start
I sense something
shining in her.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.786 position:13% line:83% align:start
An authentic one-of-a-kind
potential for purity.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:06:59.754 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:02.089 position:7% line:89% align:start
She's my diamond in the rough.

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:03.858 position:13% line:89% align:start
So's the Moon Light Sword.

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.060 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've actually already
come up with a plan

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.128 position:13% line:89% align:start
to shine a spotlight on it

00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:09.897 position:13% line:83% align:start
and transform it into the
preeminent sword style

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:10.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
around the globe.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:13.433 position:24% line:89% align:start
Within five years,

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
it'll have as many practitioners
as karate and judo.

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:18.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
It could even be
an Olympic event!

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.607 position:24% line:89% align:start
If you'll let me,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.875 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can manifest the dream

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you and your
brother never could.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.577 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:26.047 position:16% line:83% align:start
I promise you sir, I'll
make Mira very happy.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, I swear I'll
make you all happy.

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do I want the double
bulgogi burger?

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:36.390 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh man, the dak galbi
special sounds amazing, too.

00:07:36.424 --> 00:07:38.793 position:24% line:89% align:start
(nervous laughter)

00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:41.228 position:10% line:83% align:start
I legit dream about the
sauce on the double bulgogi,

00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:44.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
but the spiciness of the
dak galbi's irresistible.

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:46.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
What to do?

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.435 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Teen Girl 1 ] Seriously,

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't believe Seongjin's
getting married!

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:50.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Teen Girl 2] And
he's marrying a girl

00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:52.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
who's in highschool,
just like us!

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.541 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's so wrong!

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:56.410 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Teen Girl 1] That
girl from GOH, Mira Yoo?

00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:57.645 position:35% line:89% align:start
Lemme see!

00:08:00.014 --> 00:08:03.451 position:10% line:83% align:start
These rumors about you
getting married, they true?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.186 position:13% line:89% align:start
Where's this coming from?

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.322 position:13% line:83% align:start
Also, just how'd you
figure out where I lived?

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:09.457 position:35% line:89% align:start
Asked HQ.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
But what about the tournament?

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:13.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's almost time
for the semifinals!

00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:14.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you wanna go
to the national level

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:16.831 position:10% line:83% align:start
and have a stab at fighting
the best of the best?

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
What I want's none
of your business!

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is this guy more important
to you than all of that?

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you throwing away the
Moon Light Sword Style?

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.772 position:7% line:89% align:start
I never said I was doing that!

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.173 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't you tell the
administrators

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:27.141 position:19% line:89% align:start
you were dropping out,

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.442 position:24% line:89% align:start
to go get married?

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:30.144 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then you are throwing it away!

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm getting married to
save the Moon Light Sword!

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.281 position:13% line:89% align:start
What? That makes no sense!

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:36.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not marrying him because
you actually love the guy?

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's none of
your business, too.

00:08:38.486 --> 00:08:39.687 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get out of here!

00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:44.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sigh)

00:08:44.492 --> 00:08:45.693 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Sumi] Mira.

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:46.460 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.362 position:30% line:89% align:start
Who was that?

00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:49.997 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, he's no one.

00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:51.065 position:24% line:89% align:start
Everything's fine.

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:57.405 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Wait up!
-Come on!

00:08:57.438 --> 00:08:58.372 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm on a delivery right now.

00:08:58.406 --> 00:08:59.373 position:33% line:89% align:start
Can it wait?

00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:01.042 position:19% line:89% align:start
But Mira's in trouble!

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:03.878 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's the only reason she'd
suddenly getting married!

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:04.912 position:35% line:89% align:start
I know it!

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:08.015 position:13% line:89% align:start
My noodles will get soggy.

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:09.016 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Mori Jin] Whatever.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll eat 'em for you.

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:11.520 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen, man.

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:14.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just stop butting into
other people's business.

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:15.856 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mori Jin] Maybe
Mira's being tricked.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.191 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe he's gonna sell her
off to some foreign country!

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or maybe this guys
got a bunch of girls

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.197 position:13% line:89% align:start
locked up in his basement,

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.535 position:7% line:83% align:start
and he has all kinds of creepy
torture devices down there.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:27.902 position:16% line:89% align:start
You saw that in a movie.

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:29.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mori Jin] Grandpa
said everyone on TV's

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.073 position:24% line:83% align:start
into weird shit
behind the scenes!

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:35.109 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's just rude.

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:35.910 position:41% line:89% align:start
Look.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.079 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mira didn't look happy about it.

00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:39.113 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:47.221 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's just wrong.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.457 position:10% line:89% align:start
Something about her lately.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
It just doesn't
feel right you know?

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:53.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
She seems different
than she used to.

00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:55.596 position:19% line:89% align:start
Even if you're right,

00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:58.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
we're outsiders, and we
have no right to butt in.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:09:59.433 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's Mira's life.

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:00.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mira's choices.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.671 position:30% line:89% align:start
(hangs phone)

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:09.777 position:10% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:15.282 position:10% line:89% align:start
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:33.568 position:30% line:89% align:start
(dreamy sigh)

00:10:33.602 --> 00:10:35.269 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hair and makeup.

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.270 position:38% line:89% align:start
Jewelry.

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:37.606 position:10% line:89% align:start
The husband of your dreams.

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:38.906 position:33% line:89% align:start
Check, girl!

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess now you have
everything you wanted!

00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:50.451 position:7% line:83% align:start
You could at least go have fun
on your days off, you know.

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:51.520 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I will.

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right after I finish this.

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:54.989 position:27% line:89% align:start
(girls giggling)

00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:56.625 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's go check
out that new shop.

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:57.626 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Girl] I'm in!

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.026 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need some new clothes!

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.494 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:02.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, do you want me to go buy you

00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:04.198 position:21% line:83% align:start
some clothes like
that sometime, Mira?

00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:06.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't need that.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.768 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not my thing.

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.139 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Sumi.

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:14.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's almost time, so you
should get ready, too.

00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:15.709 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Sumi] Okay!

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:21.248 position:16% line:89% align:start
(murmured conversation)

00:11:24.218 --> 00:11:25.719 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry but,

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:28.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to ask you to
call off this wedding.

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:29.256 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.226 position:16% line:77% align:start
She thinks she made this
decision for herself,

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:33.528 position:33% line:89% align:start
as an adult.

00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:35.162 position:7% line:89% align:start
At first I tried to stand by,

00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:37.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
wanting to respect
her decision but I...

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
She can't consent to
this, she is just a child!

00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.402 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't worry, Uncle.

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:44.705 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Uncle Deukchun] Mira.

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:46.508 position:21% line:89% align:start
Honestly, I'm happy.

00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:48.209 position:10% line:89% align:start
My dream's gonna come true.

00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:52.514 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your name and your power
can change the future.

00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:54.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
They can save the
Moon Light Sword.

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.985 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's why I'm choosing you.

00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:00.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, use me as
blatantly as you wish.

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:03.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
We both know that's the one
way to become a real winner.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:05.694 position:7% line:89% align:start
So the Moon Light Sword Style

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:07.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
will become known
throughout the world?

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:08.729 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why, of course!

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:11.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll deliver every dream
you've ever given up on,

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:12.733 position:30% line:89% align:start
and then some.

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:14.969 position:7% line:89% align:start
Take hold of the world, Mira.

00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:17.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.775 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:23.744 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mira.

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.079 position:19% line:89% align:start
This just isn't right.

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:31.720 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was so stupid.

00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:34.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of it just
went over my head.

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
After we've lived
together all this time.

00:12:36.658 --> 00:12:37.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
I knew there was some
weird-ass shit going on.

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.097 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:46.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now I get it.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.102 position:7% line:89% align:start
So that's why Mira's doing it.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:50.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
Honestly, at the end of the day

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
I only want Mira to
be happy, you know?

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:53.774 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, kid.

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.009 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel you there.

00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:58.747 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.881 position:16% line:83% align:start

(chuckle)

00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:04.753 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm Mira's friend.

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.021 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just gotta talk to her
real quick, so I'll...

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
No one's authorized
beyond this point

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
without an official invitation.

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:15.829 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay, fine.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.800 position:16% line:89% align:start
My friend's in trouble!

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:22.403 position:24% line:89% align:start
Move outta my way!

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you refuse to leave the
area of your own accord,

00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:27.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
you will be removed
by physical force.

00:13:28.643 --> 00:13:32.547 position:7% line:89% align:start
(melodious instrumental music)

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:45.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
You must obtain

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:48.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
the holy sword that
can rule God himself.

00:13:48.362 --> 00:13:51.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
As well as the one hand that
can draw out that power.

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:58.205 position:19% line:83% align:start
The holy sword that
can rule God himself.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the hand that can
draw out that power.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.880 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.150 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:12.721 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't use my
taekwondo on these guys!

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:14.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look out, sir!

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.960 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.495 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:22.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad you came!

00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:24.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
And who the hell are you?

00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.672 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:32.406 position:30% line:89% align:start
Barely a push.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.441 position:19% line:89% align:start
I need some help here!

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.313 position:19% line:89% align:start
(surprised reactions)

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:42.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, what the heck
are you doing, Mira?

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:45.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
No offense, but that
dress isn't your style.

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:46.987 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you all doing here?

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.889 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't appreciate
you interrupting mine

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.592 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Mira's special day.

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
Security will be here any mom...

00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:55.864 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm guessing, you two did that?

00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.398 position:19% line:89% align:start
We barely pushed 'em.

00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:00.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, no!

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:02.670 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those security guards
are just useless.

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:05.774 position:13% line:83% align:start
They couldn't even swat
away these annoying flies?

00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:06.940 position:24% line:89% align:start
Shut it, jerkwad!

00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:09.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
We know you're trying to
pull one over on Mira!

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:11.912 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop buzzing in my
ears, little flies.

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
It appears, I'll have
to swat you away myself.

00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:19.987 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ha!

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.726 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:25.727 position:38% line:89% align:start
All you.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks, man.

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:30.230 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't remember sending
you guys an invitation.

00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:32.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you seriously wanna
get married, Mira?

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:33.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
C'mon!

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.301 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why now?

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've come so far
in the tournament

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:37.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I know you were looking
forward to the rest of it,

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:39.874 position:21% line:83% align:start
like fighting Daewi
in the semifinals!

00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:41.776 position:7% line:89% align:start
None of this is your business.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.076 position:21% line:89% align:start
BS! I don't buy it!

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.546 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is this what you wanted to do?

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:46.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
Does the Moon Light
Sword and its legacy

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.048 position:19% line:89% align:start
mean so little to you!

00:15:51.586 --> 00:15:53.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Female Classmate] You
know that new nail salon?

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.559 position:19% line:89% align:start
A dream means nothing,

00:15:57.592 --> 00:16:00.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you don't reach out and grab
it with your own two hands!

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:03.997 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please go out with me!

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.938 position:7% line:83% align:start
Only a strong man can
inherit the Moon Light Sword.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.306 position:33% line:89% align:start
(surprised)

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:16.043 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've worked so hard
to come this far!

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
You'd throw all that away?

00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:26.654 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't know what I want!

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.092 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would you look at that.

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:33.393 position:27% line:89% align:start
You are strong.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're this strong, the
Moon Light Sword must be--

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.502 position:21% line:89% align:start
You need to shut up!

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.071 position:7% line:89% align:start
You don't understand anything!

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.514 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can stop this now, Mira.

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:56.250 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know my brother would never
have wanted this for you.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.620 position:27% line:89% align:start
My Dad's right!

00:16:58.653 --> 00:17:01.488 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want you to find happiness
but I want it to be with

00:17:01.523 --> 00:17:03.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
someone you truly love.

00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:07.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
But I, I have to.

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.396 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's really not that hard!

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Look, just do what you want.

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:22.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
(amazed)

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:25.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Developing your technique means

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:27.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
your life's always
in your own hands.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:28.983 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is our sword style.

00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:30.217 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't forget.

00:17:49.571 --> 00:17:51.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't go through
with this marriage.

00:17:51.806 --> 00:17:52.807 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:56.978 position:44% line:89% align:start
I...

00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:59.647 position:7% line:83% align:start
I will protect the Moon Light
Sword, in whatever way I can.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.784 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:18:02.817 --> 00:18:06.186 position:19% line:89% align:start
(hysterical laughter)

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stop fooling yourself,
you stupid little girl!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
All I want is to possess
the Moon Light Sword

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:16.064 position:24% line:89% align:start
and its successor!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.097 position:33% line:89% align:start
This power.

00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:20.768 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

00:18:20.802 --> 00:18:22.637 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is that thing?

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:26.206 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get out of here!

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.343 position:24% line:89% align:start
(people screaming)

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:32.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:39.520 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:50.632 position:24% line:83% align:start
Moon Light Sword
Style, Number Six:

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.800 position:33% line:89% align:start
Monkey Arm!

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.140 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:04.478 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:07.414 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:10.118 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, that escalated quickly.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.119 position:33% line:89% align:start
That it did.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.121 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey uh, you guys?

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:18.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want to um, well, uh, I
just, what I want to say.

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.159 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.260 position:24% line:89% align:start
We saved your ass.

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:21.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why is it so hard to
simply say thanks?

00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:24.632 position:7% line:83% align:start
No one asked you to come here.
You were being nosy!

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:25.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
(car horn honking)

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll be taking this as a
lovely wedding present!

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.004 position:44% line:89% align:start
Bye!

00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:31.171 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, that bastard!

00:19:31.204 --> 00:19:32.874 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine.

00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:33.908 position:27% line:89% align:start
He can have it.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
I realized my dad's
spirit lives on within me.

00:19:41.082 --> 00:19:42.150 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look at Mira.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's finally smiling.

00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:45.285 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Uncle Deukchun] Yeah.

00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:50.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(joyful laugh)
-(annoyed)

00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.665 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Doctor] Get the AED in here!

00:19:57.699 --> 00:19:58.800 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:00.134 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Doctor] We need adrenaline
and a blood draw, stat!

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Staff] Hurry up with that AED!

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:04.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
Doctor, should I get the
hANP, too, just in case?

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:06.174 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Doctor] Yes, please!

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.041 position:27% line:89% align:start
Still no pulse!

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
Try it again!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.476 position:13% line:89% align:start
The X-ray machine's here!

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Doctor] Have them
wait a minute!

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.780 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Daewi Han] Wake up, damn it.

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:22.489 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's this now?

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:25.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
All this working's sure
got you up awfully late.

00:20:25.693 --> 00:20:28.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
Putting in the hours
for your sick buddy?

00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:29.362 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your friendship's
so heartwarming,

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.066 position:13% line:83% align:start
it makes me wanna just
break right down and cry.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.668 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Punk] Sucks for you.

00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:35.770 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only buddy he's gonna
be meeting any time soon
