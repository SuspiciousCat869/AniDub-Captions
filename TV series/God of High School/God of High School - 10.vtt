00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.616 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Seungyeon] So, what is
it you're fighting for?

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Ilpyo] Seungyeon.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why go through all this
just to get stronger?

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Ilpyo] Long ago, I made
a promise to someone.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.263 position:27% line:89% align:start
Made a promise?

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:33.768 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ilpyo] I'm fighting to make
sure I keep that promise.

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:36.571 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:39.774 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then, you can't
afford to lose, huh?

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.013 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Referee] The match is over!

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Winner: Taek Jegal!
-Seungyeon!

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
(groans) I can...
keep fighting.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:58.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
(scoffs) Such impudent
eyes aren't for a woman.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.262 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Ilpyo] No, don't do it!

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:06.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
(stomp)

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
(screams) Stop!

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.440 position:7% line:83% align:start
With some rehabilitation,
you'll be able to walk again.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.844 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, that's for your
martial arts future.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.313 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seungyeon.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
(slow, melancholic piano)

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Say you're sorry.
-(punches thud)

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.492 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Say you're sorry!
-(punches thud)

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:34.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Say you're sorry.
-(punches thud)

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:37.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Say it, say you're sorry!
-(punches thud)

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's going on here?

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:42.937 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tell Seungyeon you're sorry!

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:45.472 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:51.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
God of High School?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.615 position:24% line:89% align:start
Any wish granted?

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.518 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Ilpyo?
-Huh?

00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:00.655 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, I was just thinking about
how to win tomorrow's match.

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:02.857 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, we're up
against Seoul's team.

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.360 position:7% line:89% align:start
We can't afford to lose this.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:11.398 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have to win no matter
what, whatever it takes.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.735 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Seung-Ah] Is that
really what you want?

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.104 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mori Jin.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.107 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've been excited
about your match with him

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.340 position:27% line:89% align:start
for a long time.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's important
now is that I win

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
and fix Seungyeon's leg.

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:28.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
My personal feelings
don't really matter.

[Mujin] All the Jeju team
members that you fought

00:04:13.054 --> 00:04:16.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
were completely unrelated
people disguised as them.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.625 position:24% line:89% align:start
Regardless of that,

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:19.627 position:19% line:83% align:start
it doesn't change the
results of the match,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
so your team will still
proceed to the semi-finals.

[Jegal] The Key will be mine.

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Referee] We'll soon
begin our first match,

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:05.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
the Group A semi-finals,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Seoul team versus

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.312 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like I told you yesterday,

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:15.016 position:13% line:83% align:start
the first strike you land
will decide the match.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.651 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Understand?
-Yeah.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:19.153 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your suspension's been lifted,

00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:21.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
and my sword was
given back to me.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now we can fight
without holding back.

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:27.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
(gasp) What happened
to your face?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.830 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just some secret training.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.101 position:27% line:89% align:start
I guess I'm up.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.704 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Referee] The first round:

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:38.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Daewi Han versus Seung-Ah Park.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.941 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:43.476 position:16% line:89% align:start

[Ilpyo] There it is.

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:11.005 position:19% line:83% align:start
The first strike isn't
intended to do damage.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
A hard thrust with
the heel of the hand

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:17.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
will throw the ear's

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.929 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nox?

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.531 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Mujin] They're a group that
believes in a certain god

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.101 position:13% line:83% align:start
and they don't accept the
existence of any others

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.769 position:30% line:89% align:start
but their own.

00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:45.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
Their main intention is to
eliminate all other gods

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:48.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
and individuals who borrow
their power from the divine.

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:51.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Charyeok?
-[Mujin] Exactly.

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.247 position:21% line:83% align:start
They don't tolerate
the existence

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
of other charyeok users,

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
which is why they're so
focused on ruining GOH,

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.721 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:03.524 position:24% line:89% align:start
They kidnapped him.

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:06.160 position:16% line:83% align:start

Jin's immense power

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
for themselves.

I'm gonna save him.

Don't bother trying.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.301 position:24% line:89% align:start
You three are weak.

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:14.669 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you make any foolish moves,

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:17.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
we're the ones who will suffer.

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:18.906 position:7% line:89% align:start
You have to say it like that?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
That said, if you're
able to win GOH,

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:25.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
there's a real chance
I'd be willing to impart

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:26.981 position:10% line:89% align:start
some pertinent information.

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:30.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mori] So we just
have to win then.

00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:31.786 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then we'll win for sure.

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(grunts with exertion)
-Whoa, is that...?

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:45.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(grip steaming)
-(grunts of exertion)

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.538 position:33% line:89% align:start
(battle cry)

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:56.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Referee] Seung-Ah Park is down!

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.611 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's enough, Seung-Ah.

00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:01.215 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since your first strike
wasn't effective, it's done.

00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:02.583 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can't beat him.

00:08:02.616 --> 00:08:04.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have to withdraw
from the fight.

00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:06.721 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seung-Ah!

00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:10.691 position:7% line:83% align:start
Are you worried that I'm going
to end up like Seungyeon?

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:14.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
My decision to fight
is my own to make.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
And now that I've
made up my mind,

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
whatever happens, I
won't regret anything.

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:24.572 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know in my heart,
Seungyeon feels the same way.

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.942 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm... I'm...

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.343 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Man] And fight!

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:30.878 position:19% line:89% align:start
I am a martial artist!

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:33.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll keep fighting 'til the end!

00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:41.722 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(battle cries building)
-(punches colliding)

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:51.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
(Seung-Ah thudding
on the ground)

00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:55.102 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[Referee] Winner: Daewi Han!
-(crowd cheering)

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.103 position:41% line:89% align:start
Daewi?

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:57.238 position:33% line:89% align:start
Was that...?

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.773 position:24% line:89% align:start
Were you watching?

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:01.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll say one thing,
you don't have to win.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:03.644 position:27% line:89% align:start
WE have to win.

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
As in all three of us.

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
Daewi...

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:09.817 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's right, we're a team.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
So win or lose,
we do it together.

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:14.021 position:24% line:89% align:start
Never forget that.

00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:16.791 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mira... (chuckles)

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.659 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you are totally right!

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:21.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
The three of us will win
this thing, no doubt!

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.899 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Daewi] Hey!
-[Mira] Mori!?

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:27.401 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:29.904 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You always push too hard.
-Seungyeon?

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.172 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why...?

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.207 position:10% line:89% align:start
Seung-Ah told me everything.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
She said you're participating
in this tournament

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:37.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
and explained why
you're doing it.

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:42.950 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a lot I'd like to
say, but it doesn't matter.

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
Seung-Ah pretty much
said it all for me.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:48.689 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Seungyeon, I wanted...
-Ilpyo,

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.225 position:21% line:83% align:start
I appreciate your
concern for my leg,

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you've got this
whole thing backwards.

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:58.699 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go fight, but make sure you
fight for what you want.

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your promise, you
should keep it.

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ilpyo] I'm no match
for you two, am I?

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Seungyeon] Nope, not
since we were kids.

00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:10.678 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ilpyo] Thank you
Seungyeon, Seung-Ah.

00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:17.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
Right, I'm good now.

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:23.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's my turn.

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:30.831 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(trembling)
-(panting)

00:10:34.536 --> 00:10:35.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mandeok] God,
grant eternal peace

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the soul of
this noble martyr.

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:46.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Mujin] Nice way
to shut people up.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:49.650 position:21% line:83% align:start
You haven't changed,
Mandeok Sang.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:53.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mandeok] It's been a
long time, Mujin Park.

00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:57.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Mujin] I never thought
you'd show up on your own.

00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mandeok] Well, I
wanted to help you.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
You see, it's conflict
that draws out

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.430 position:16% line:89% align:start
one's latent potential.

00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:07.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why you started
this tournament, isn't it?

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:10.905 position:10% line:89% align:start
To awaken the sleeping Key.

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:13.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, but that won't be enough.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're going to need a
far more powerful trigger.

00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:22.283 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:29.790 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] Fool.

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:32.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know exactly what your
people have in mind.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:38.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
(chuckles) Well
then, how about this?

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:45.306 position:19% line:89% align:start
(light beam blasting)

00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:20.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Referee] Coming up
in the second round,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
it's Mori Jin versus Ilpyo Park!

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can tell, this is gonna
be a pretty good fight.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.750 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let me just say one thing.

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:31.919 position:7% line:89% align:start
With your taekwondo as it is,

00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:34.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll never come
close to beating me.

00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:39.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blade crashing)

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:42.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mandeok] Ah, your
skills have improved.

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:44.231 position:35% line:89% align:start
Damn you!

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:47.268 position:21% line:89% align:start
(driving rock music)

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.376 position:7% line:83% align:start
-(both grunt in exertion)
-(punches and kicks thudding)

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:07.988 position:7% line:89% align:start
(punches and kicks colliding)

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
So there's your first weakness,

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:30.010 position:10% line:89% align:start
you're bad at close combat.

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:34.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
(frustrated groaning)

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:40.921 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Take that!
-(punches and kicks thud)

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
And your second weakness?

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
You telegraph all your attacks.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.593 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're predictable.

00:13:45.627 --> 00:13:48.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Referee] Ilpyo Park is putting
his overwhelming strength

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.799 position:24% line:89% align:start
on display tonight.

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Interesting.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
Think you can defend
against this then?!

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:59.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mori Jin Original:
Twin Blue Dragon Kick!

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:03.444 position:24% line:83% align:start
Taekyyeon: Blazing
Cyclone Blade!

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:07.948 position:10% line:89% align:start
(attacks clash and explode)

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:12.186 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:17.991 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(heavy breathing)
-Your third weakness,

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
your technique places too
much strain on your body.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:26.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
So no matter how hard you're
trying, you can never beat me.

00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:33.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Mandeok] You endure it
well, but it's all in vain.

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:36.477 position:7% line:89% align:start
Creation of Heaven and Earth!

00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:42.483 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monks vocalizing)

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:59.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(doors opening)
-(monster growling)

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:02.269 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that...

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.110 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is it God?

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:20.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
O God, exact divine
judgment upon these fools.

00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:24.626 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(grunts)
-(grunts)

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:28.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
(punches and kicks landing)

00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:29.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Ilpyo] Is that it?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that all the
strength you've got?

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:37.672 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is Taejin Jin's grandson?

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:40.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
He must be disappointed
beyond belief.

00:15:42.844 --> 00:15:44.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're weak, way too weak.

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:46.915 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're nothing!

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:48.683 position:10% line:83% align:start
-(punches and kicks landing)
-(yelps in pain)

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.050 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Mori] Think...

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.920 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Mujin] You three are weak.

00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:55.055 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Mori] I swear,
I'm gonna save him.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:58.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(kick colliding)
-I have to think.

00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:00.795 position:24% line:89% align:start
How can I beat him?

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:02.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
If that's all the
strength you have,

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:04.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll never make
anything happen.

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:10.738 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(kick thudding)
-(blood splashing)

00:16:11.873 --> 00:16:13.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
Moonlight Sword
Style: Swordless!

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:22.082 position:7% line:83% align:start
-(gulping drink)
-[Hallyang] What a nice view!

00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:29.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
-All right, you guys ready?
-(men cheering)

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let's get started.
-[Hallyang] Ready?

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:35.062 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then let's play some music.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait, but that stance is...

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:45.974 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(kick thuds)
-(blood splashes)

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.475 position:5% line:89% align:start
My first weakness: close combat.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.511 position:35% line:89% align:start
Conquered.

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:53.113 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Next up...
-[Ilpyo] It won't work!

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.015 position:30% line:89% align:start
(kick landing)

00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:58.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
-First stance:
-(punch and kick colliding)

00:16:58.653 --> 00:16:59.654 position:27% line:89% align:start
Black Tortoise!

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:02.289 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's using one of mine, too?

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mori] Second weakness:
my prep's too obvious.
