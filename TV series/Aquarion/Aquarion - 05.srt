1
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,666
As of today kid,
your name is Apollo...

2
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,958
Just like the
mythological god of the sun!

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:36,083
Apollo... Apollo!

4
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,250
Apollo!

5
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,833
Baron!

6
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,291
Baron...

7
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,083
Wait for me...

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,875
Okay, which one of you drank
my strawberry protein shake?!

9
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,125
Fess up!

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,541
My amulet's moving.

11
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,333
That's a bad omen.

12
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,583
Who did it?!

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,916
Probably the same person

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
who put teeth marks in
my Roman coin collection.

15
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,708
My guess? It was Apollo.

16
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,708
Apollo's missing!

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,750
I knew it!

18
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,750
Where could he have run off to?

19
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,625
That doesn't make him a thief...

20
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,916
Don't worry!

21
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,583
He won't stay gone long...

22
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,000
You're going to find him!

23
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,666
What?!

24
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,625
Man, this is getting old.

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,750
Just seem to
be going in circles.

26
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,250
One of these tunnels has
got to lead to the Vectors...

27
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,958
Attention, cadets!

28
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,166
Your goal is set!

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,625
The first one to find Apollo

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,000
earns the right
to pilot a Vector!

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,791
Good luck then, and go!

32
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, I forgot to mention
there are traps, so be careful.

33
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,958
Yeah, now she tells us...

34
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,041
Thanks, lady...
Well, hang in there.

35
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,166
Only a mongrel like
you would mistake

36
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,458
that Roman solidus
for a chocolate coin.

37
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,250
A mistake you'll soon regret.

38
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,375
They're actually
coming after me?!

39
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,708
What's this?

40
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,000
Decoy sounds to
throw us off track!

41
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,333
I'm warning you...

42
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't follow me.

43
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,166
But my ears and my gut tell
me he's down this tunnel.

44
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,208
Look, if you come with me...

45
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,000
...you're asking...

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,791
...for bad luck.

47
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,000
Even if that's true...

48
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,833
Wouldn't your luck be
diluted with two people?

49
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,541
Well, am I right?

50
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,708
What are you doing?

51
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,916
Psychography.

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,125
Psych-what?

53
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,333
Psychic photography.

54
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,333
Now please be quiet.

55
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,958
I'm trying to concentrate here.

56
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,500
It's no use.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,583
It's impossible to get a
reading because he's moving.

58
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,375
What are you doing?

59
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,708
When humans move,

60
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,833
they disrupt the magnetic
field and leave a trail.

61
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,125
I'll find Apollo in no time

62
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,791
all through the
power of science.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,333
What happened?

64
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, that...? Well, um,
you see, I have this allergy...

65
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,375
Um... since when can an
allergy blast a hole in a wall?

66
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,250
It's... It's the
power of science!

67
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,458
That again, huh?

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,583
The power of science
is an amazing thing.

69
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,500
If you keep toying
with them like this,

70
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,375
they're really
going to resent you.

71
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,791
Cadets disliking
their superior...?

72
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,458
O perish the thought.

73
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,375
Where are you?!

74
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,583
Still haven't found
your boyfriend

75
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,125
from your previous life, huh?

76
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,208
B-boyfriend?!

77
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,166
You know, they say
lovers have a connection

78
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,041
and can always
locate each other.

79
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,208
Would you stop?

80
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,958
There's no way that
mangy, smelly beast

81
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,541
could ever be my true love.

82
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,416
Shh!

83
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,291
What is it?

84
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,708
There...

85
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,166
Apollo!

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,250
That's for drinking my shake!

87
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,791
You're mine, pal!

88
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,208
Hah!

89
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,875
Come and get me, ya losers!

90
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,458
There's no way you
can hide forever, Apollo!

91
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,791
So just give up now!

92
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,083
No way!

93
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,541
Are you nuts...?!
I've gotta go rescue Baron!

94
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:17,125
All by yourself...?
Now that's nuts!

95
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,750
Think he's toast?

96
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,916
No... That blast wasn't
meant to kill him,

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,791
just knock the wind
out of his sails...

98
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,541
Let's go get him.

99
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,416
Are you convinced
about my bad luck yet?

100
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,625
I am...

101
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,916
But it's going to
take more than that

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,041
to prevent me from
getting close to you.

103
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,833
What are you saying?

104
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,166
Life is far too short...

105
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,000
We can't waste time.

106
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,041
Fire!

107
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,166
That's some drop.

108
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,875
Think the Commander's
trying to kill us?

109
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,958
No.

110
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,750
He probably just
thinks a lot like you.

111
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,583
You know,
survival of the fittest.

112
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,500
Separating the
weak from the strong.

113
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,041
That sort of stuff.

114
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,625
Everyone needs a
helping hand now and then.

115
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,750
Only the weak.

116
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,666
Do you think we'll ever be as
strong as the Commander wants?

117
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,333
Well, we're gonna have to be.

118
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,416
If not, we'll never
defeat the Shadow Angels.

119
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,583
Whoa...

120
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,875
Those self-centered cadets
could find their way out,

121
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,250
if only they would learn how
to cooperate with each other.

122
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,291
So that's the goal
of this training...

123
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,541
Teamwork, eh?

124
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,791
Where are we?

125
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,166
It's... so high...

126
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,250
Hold on.

127
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,000
Sirius!

128
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,041
Reika.

129
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,541
He was here just minutes ago...

130
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:33,333
Yes... I can still feel the
reverberations of the arrows.

131
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,458
He's mine, got it?!

132
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,916
No way. He's mine.

133
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,666
Hey!

134
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,041
So much for your traps!

135
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,250
You really want to
go that badly, do you?

136
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,375
Damn straight...!
Get outta my way!

137
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,083
If that's what
you really want...

138
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,333
Go on then...

139
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,833
But I doubt you'll
get very far by yourself.

140
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,791
Wanna bet?!

141
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,208
It's him!

142
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,166
Reika!

143
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,666
Sirius...

144
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,583
Yahoo!

145
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,791
Vector Luna taking off!

146
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,250
Dammit...! I'd be
in a Vector right now

147
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,666
if I hadn't come back
to save this trap fodder!

148
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,250
Trap fodder?

149
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm on my way, Baron...

150
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,166
Turn that thing around, Apollo!

151
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,791
Forget it...!
I'm gonna rescue Baron.

152
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,916
Hey, get real!

153
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
You don't even know
where to find him!

154
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,041
Shut up...! I am gonna find
him and I'm gonna do it alone!

155
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,208
Valley City is under attack!

156
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,500
Attention Vectors Luna and Mars!

157
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,750
Harvest Beasts have been
sighted over Valley City!

158
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,500
Abandon your current
course and intercept!

159
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,500
We'll deploy a retrieval force
to deal with Apollo shortly.

160
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,125
Well, you heard him, Pierre.

161
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,958
Roger that.

162
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,625
Mars and Luna, hurry!

163
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,166
Intel reports they've
begun harvesting humans!

164
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,166
They're harvesting humans?!

165
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,208
What happened to
"I'm gonna do it alone?!"

166
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,041
I'm gonna make these
Shadow Angels tell me

167
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,541
where they've took Baron!

168
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
Oh, wake up, will you?!

169
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,166
You monsters!

170
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,250
Harvest that.

171
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,500
The leader, huh?

172
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,333
It's gone!

173
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
What?!

174
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,958
Silvia! What the--?!

175
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,750
Oh noo!

176
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,666
Their formations
are in total chaos.

177
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Hey, watch it!

178
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,208
No you watch it, moron!

179
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:34,041
God dammit!

180
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,041
Where are those
blasts coming from?!

181
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,000
Apollo!

182
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,291
Why can't you find that thing?!

183
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,916
I could if you'd shut up!

184
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,083
Hey wait!

185
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,708
Maybe it's hiding
underground somewhere!

186
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,416
Ahh, dammit, this
is getting us nowhere!

187
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,166
They just need to
hurry up and merge!

188
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,083
Negative, sir!

189
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,208
Their auras aren't in sync!

190
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,208
Look at the merge index!

191
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,583
It's too low!

192
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,916
All three... Out of sync...

193
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,583
Apollo!

194
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,416
Silvia hang on!

195
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,041
They're gonna have
to do better than that!

196
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,000
Silvia!

197
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,583
Baron!

198
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,583
Snap out of it!

199
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,333
You're not the only
person who's lost a friend

200
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,500
to the Shadow Angels...

201
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,291
I'd say just about everybody
knows what it feels like

202
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,875
to lose a loved one to those
monsters, myself included.

203
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,041
I didn't know.

204
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,250
There's only one way

205
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,541
to close the gaping
holes in our hearts...

206
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,541
Make ourselves strong
to battle the enemy...!

207
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,500
That's all we can do!

208
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,416
Make ourselves strong...

209
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,916
Make ourselves strong...

210
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,250
Multi-dimensional
quantum levels rising.

211
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,708
Look...! Their merge gauges.

212
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,500
They're finally connecting...

213
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,708
...like a jigsaw puzzle!

214
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,791
That's not a bad analogy.

215
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
An individual piece doesn't
make much of a difference,

216
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,625
but when all the
pieces come together,

217
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,666
you can solve the puzzle.

218
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,833
I think those three
finally just realized that.

219
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,208
Yes. It is the principle
Aquarion was built on.

220
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,333
They had to learn that they will
never prevail without teamwork.

221
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,791
It's the most important lesson.

222
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,958
That's what it takes
to form a true merge.

223
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:45,166
Aquarion Mars...!
Initiate Merge!

224
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,000
Merge One!

225
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,000
Merge Two!

226
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,708
Go...! Aquarion!

227
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,541
I'm on fire!

228
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,875
Well, where is it?

229
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,541
Quiet!

230
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,125
Found it!

231
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,833
White Hot... Fire Kick!

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,041
Pierre's blood pressure
and pulse are elevated!

233
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,000
Lactic acid levels
have risen as well!

234
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you okay...

235
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,750
Guys!

236
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,083
The Harvest Beast
is about to get away!

237
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,041
No!

238
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,541
Change to Solar!

239
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,375
Oh, no, you don't!

240
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:18,333
Outta my way!

241
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,833
We're too late...

242
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,916
Apollo...

243
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,458
I'll find 'em, I swear!

244
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,125
Baron and all the others!

245
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,958
I will bring them back!

246
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,083
Punch, punch,
punch, punch, punch,

247
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,166
punch, punch, punch,
punch, punch, punch...!

248
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,291
Hey, c'mon!

249
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,666
How many times do
I have to say this?

250
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,083
Infinity!

251
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,333
Next time on Aquarion:
"To the Other Side of Emotions."

252
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,958
We're gonna merge
again, aren't we?

253
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,166
Ya' think?!
