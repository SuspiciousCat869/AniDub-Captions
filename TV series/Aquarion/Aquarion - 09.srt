1
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,583
Um, Brother... where are we?

2
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,958
I don't know.

3
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,958
The sun overwhelms the moon...

4
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,666
...and the eclipse eats the sky.

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,916
It's been so long

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,208
since I've had you
all to myself like this...

7
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,000
I know, not since the
beginning of the battle.

8
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,000
You know what,

9
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,500
I don't want to think
about any of that right now...

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,833
Keep reciting your poem for me.

11
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,166
The sun's will weakens

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,666
and the moon
appears once again...

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,625
The pale green
lunar light... silently...

14
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,041
illuminates our dreams.

15
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,375
Come to me... little boy...

16
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,791
Come to me.

17
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,083
Brother, hey wait!

18
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,458
Brother!

19
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,000
Just a dream.

20
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,041
Wake up, brother...
Brother, wake up...!

21
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,583
Brother!

22
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,916
Brother!!

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,583
We've been receiving
reports of a global epidemic

24
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,083
in which children have become
comatose while sleeping,

25
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,125
seemingly trapped within
their consciousness

26
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,083
by an external force.

27
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,541
We believe it might be

28
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,541
a psychological warfare
tactic of the Shadow Angels.

29
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,625
How should we handle this?

30
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,916
The path between reality
and dreams has opened.

31
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,416
Time for bed.

32
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
What, you're kidding me...

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,375
Our exercise for
the day is sleep?

34
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,083
If our training demands it...

35
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,625
I can sleep.

36
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,666
Men and women sleeping
in the same room...?

37
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,125
I don't mind with Sirius, but...

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,458
Reika...?

39
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,458
Reika, is it alright if
I share the bed with you?

40
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,958
No, I, uh,...

41
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,208
I kick too much in my sleep.

42
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,458
Sleeping alone is boring.

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,375
Pierre...! Get out of my bed!

44
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,750
You can't get in my bed either!

45
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,000
Who did that?

46
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,375
What...? I did.

47
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,625
That is rank...! You pig!

48
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,250
What was that for, jerk?!

49
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,291
Now you've done it!

50
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,208
Ow!

51
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,666
You are so dead!

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,208
Hey, give me back my pillow!

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,833
Here's a pillow for you!

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,291
Here's another one for ya!

55
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,250
The wingless ones must sleep.

56
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,166
That is their weakness.

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,958
The Harvest Beast Titania
preys upon their slumber...

58
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,458
She enters their dreams
through the moonlight

59
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,416
and captures
their living Prana...

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,750
They're held prisoner
within her dream world,

61
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
trapped behind the walls
of their own consciousness.

62
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,541
Leaving only a hollow shell...

63
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,208
And the wingless ones are
powerless to stop her...

64
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,333
They cannot rescue the
children from her domain...

65
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,416
Because they do not know
the lunar path to dreams.

66
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
Commander.

67
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,208
The moon.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,083
It appears in the sky as a
crescent, but remember

69
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,541
that is only the visible surface
which the sunlight strikes.

70
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:44,458
The true essence of the moon
is the part that remains hidden.

71
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,333
This is also true with dreams.

72
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,666
Is there a link
between dreams...

73
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,583
And the moon?

74
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,333
Oh, Pierre.

75
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,750
You're the man of
my dreams, Pierre.

76
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,250
Hold me, baby.

77
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,583
Wouldn't you rather
hold both of us?

78
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,166
Would you care
for a Madeleine...?

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,125
They're so delicious.

80
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,416
Would you care
for a Madeleine...?

81
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,083
They're so delicious.

82
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
Oh, Sirius.

83
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,125
Look at you...!

84
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,458
You call yourself a prince?

85
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,791
You're such a freaking joke...

86
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,208
You don't even have wings.

87
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,375
Loser...! Loser!

88
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,083
Come here, little boy.

89
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,291
Come to me.

90
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, nice try...

91
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,791
You smell like a morgue!

92
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,166
This will be your last dream
you disobedient little boy!

93
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:26,666
Over here...!

94
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,541
Bring me an ampule!

95
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,125
Nothing seems to be working...

96
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:29,791
Why won't they wake up?!

97
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,916
Adrenaline, stat!

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,583
Cardiopulmonary
levels decreasing!

99
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,416
Theta rhythms up!

100
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,583
Sirius, please!

101
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,333
He's not responding!

102
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
Oxygen!

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,083
Get an IV...! Bring it here!

104
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,791
So you've managed to wake up?

105
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,041
Yeah...

106
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,583
But what's the matter
with the rest of 'em.

107
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,291
They're being held captive,
prisoners within their dreams.

108
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,750
So that smell... That woman
was a Harvest Beast.

109
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,583
Brother...! Brother!

110
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,291
Seems only five of you were
fortunate enough to wake up.

111
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,750
Why wasn't I affected
like they all were?

112
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,166
You're dumber than they are.

113
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,583
Okay, what about Chloe?

114
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,291
She's an insomniac.

115
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,125
So then... Rena?

116
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,208
She doesn't remember
having any dreams.

117
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,958
The only similarity
between all the dreams

118
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,916
was that everyone
saw the moon...

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,083
Did either of you?

120
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,625
At night the moon
shines with daylight.

121
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,041
Our dreams are an ocean...

122
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,875
Each wave is the
dream of an individual...

123
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,250
And this tide is controlled
by the pull of the moon...

124
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,125
It illuminates our dreams.

125
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:37,166
If you open the moon, you will
discover the path to dreams.

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,208
Please, Sirius!

127
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,166
Please just wake up!
Sirius! Sirius!

128
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,166
Let's go back to sleep!

129
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,708
What are you talking about...?

130
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,000
You'll end up like them...!

131
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,125
There's no guarantee
you'll survive next time.

132
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,541
If we don't, none
of 'em will survive!

133
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,875
The only way to save them

134
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,708
and stop the Harvest Beast
is to go where they are.

135
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,583
Hey, what do you
think they're going to do

136
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,333
with us if we don't wake up...?

137
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
I mean I don't want to get put
on display like Sleeping Beauty.

138
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,083
Shut up and sleep!

139
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,708
And why do we have
to sleep in the cockpits?

140
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,000
Just go to sleep!

141
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,958
When people die
they're submerged

142
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,000
in the ocean of dreams...
at the end of life's path

143
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
is a door that leads
us to this ocean.

144
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,083
Our dreams transcend
the self to reach this sea

145
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,333
connecting us all
within its lunar tide.

146
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,291
Ah yes, what Jung called the
collective unconscious...?

147
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,000
Are you saying that he was
referring to our dreams...?

148
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,875
And that the moon is their
physical embodiment?

149
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,250
Aquarion taps into the lunar and
solar power of its pilots...

150
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,416
This connection
with the celestial bodies

151
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,666
may help them reach

152
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,666
those children behind
the doors of the moon.

153
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,166
Do these people ever stop
running their mouths...?

154
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,625
Come on already.

155
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,458
Oh, Kurt... I promise
I'll rescue you.

156
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,541
Gotta sleep sometime.

157
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,500
Hey, I'm wide awake...!

158
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,333
How bout some sleeping pills?

159
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,500
I'm afraid not...

160
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,083
They'd interfere with
your REM patterns

161
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,250
and keep you from dreaming.

162
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,166
Who is that?

163
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,041
Which element user fell asleep?

164
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,791
Oh, man, I'm starving.

165
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,333
The Power Stone energy
levels are highly unstable.

166
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,375
There's a quantum
variation in the shields.

167
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,708
An internal abnormality
seems to be affecting them.

168
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,458
Internal?

169
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,500
Here I am.

170
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,166
That Harvest Beast
can't be too much further.

171
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,333
So you've come back to me...?

172
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,333
Such a thoughtful child.

173
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,333
Let my friends go, you witch!

174
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,708
You're an angry boy, aren't you?

175
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,583
So annoying and disrespectful...
but I'll let you have

176
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,875
a well-behaved playmate who
can teach you some manners.

177
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,166
An exceptional child.

178
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,958
Sirius?!

179
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,625
If this is a dream,

180
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,708
then I guess it won't
really make a difference

181
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,541
if I finally beat the
crap out of you.

182
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,083
Stop it...!

183
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,583
Please. Stop it,
you're killing him!

184
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,625
Silvia?!

185
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,083
Where are you?!

186
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,875
What's the matter, boy...?

187
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,666
Don't you want to make him pay
for attacking you like that...?

188
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,958
If you kill him in
the dream world...

189
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,416
Then he'll die in the real one.

190
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,458
Stop hurting my brother,
get away from him!

191
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,208
Impossible!.

192
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,791
I can't be hurting him for real.

193
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,208
Tell me, little boy...

194
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,541
can you feel the pain?

195
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,500
Of course I can feel it.

196
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,833
About time you two got here!

197
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,416
Pierre! Chloe! Let's move!

198
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,666
What is this...? Where are we?

199
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,708
I can't get out!

200
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,166
Call your Vector!

201
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,416
Call them how?

202
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Just figure it out and do it!

203
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,500
You shouldn't be
so foolish, child.

204
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,333
Now you've really made me angry.

205
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,250
What are you waiting for?!

206
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,166
Call 'em, dammit!

207
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,458
Vector!

208
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,666
There's activity in
the Aquarion hangar!

209
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,041
The Power Stone
readings are off the chart.

210
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,416
We're showing a quantum
shift between dimensions!

211
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
What is going on here?!

212
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,833
A prophetic dream.

213
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,375
Where'd they go?

214
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,041
The children were
able to harness

215
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,125
Aquarion's lunar connection to
force open the path to dreams

216
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,708
and retrieve it from this world.

217
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,791
You mean they
retrieved Aquarion?

218
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,333
Then the children's
physical beings

219
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,750
have passed beyond the lunar
doorway... into their dreams.

220
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,250
All right guys; let's
put this beast to bed.

221
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,416
You make me laugh, child.

222
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,708
Your machinery is
useless against me.

223
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,166
You're in my world now
and you will never wake up.

224
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,416
What the?!

225
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,208
Look, she's got
Reika...! And Jun!

226
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,625
Hold on, Kurt!

227
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,291
We can't waste any more
time, we have to merge!

228
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,750
Merge one!

229
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,958
Merge two!

230
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,458
Go, Aquarion!

231
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
It feels so good!

232
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,875
Infinity Punch!

233
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,416
You're wasting your time.

234
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,916
You'll have to try
harder than that.

235
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,000
You must be tired...

236
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,041
Go to sleep, little boy.

237
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,375
We've got trouble!

238
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,583
She's melting our armor...!

239
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,666
At this rate,
she'll tear us apart!

240
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,291
She's got Apollo.

241
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,583
A... pol... lo.

242
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,583
The moon's...
pale green... light...

243
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,416
Silently... illuminates...
our dreams.

244
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,375
Sirius!

245
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,916
Silvia... Fire...
at the... Moon.

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,333
Fire at the moon,
fire at the moon...

247
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,208
Our dreams are an ocean...

248
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,666
Each wave is the
dream of an individual

249
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,208
and this tide is controlled
by the pull of the moon.

250
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:35,041
The moon... is connected...
to our... dreams.

251
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:35,833
I understand...

252
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,458
Hang on, Brother!

253
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,125
If I can't fall asleep,
I'll make myself!

254
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,166
Medical team, stat...!

255
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,916
Chloe's been forcibly ejected!

256
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,500
What...?! Then who's
piloting the third Vector!

257
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,250
Look who's come to join us,

258
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,708
if it isn't little
Princess Amazon.

259
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,583
We're changing
into Aquarion Luna!

260
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,250
Right!

261
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Roger that!

262
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,583
This is the best dream ever!

263
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,250
Aquarion Luna!

264
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,416
How intimidating.

265
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,541
Enough of this!

266
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,000
Gotta hand it to her, the
amazon's got some nice moves.

267
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,791
Let's see how you
like being outnumbered.

268
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,791
How cheap can you get?

269
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,583
Lunatique Archery!

270
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,708
Apollo.

271
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,041
You better know
what you're doing.

272
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,250
I couldn't even put a scratch

273
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,458
on that witch with
my Infinity Punch.

274
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,791
Don't worry...

275
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,708
I can connect reality and
dreams through the moon.

276
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,208
Huh?

277
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:29,791
She's coming!

278
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,875
Hope you're ready.

279
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,250
Let's do it!

280
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,833
Aquarion Luna...

281
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,791
Hyper-Real
Nightmare Moon Attack!

282
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,208
Titania is dead.

283
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,541
And all of the children

284
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,083
whose dreams she had
stolen have been released.

285
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,333
Mom, dad.

286
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,875
We've received a
report that the children

287
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,541
have awoken from
their comatose state.

288
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,000
And Aquarion?

289
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,458
We've lost all contact
with the Elements.

290
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,916
Power Stone readings are zero.

291
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,625
In other words, they're
unable to come back.

292
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,250
They were so overwhelmed
with relief after their victory

293
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,458
that they've
forgotten how to return

294
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,000
and become lost
in the dream world.

295
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,333
There's no way to save them?

296
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,416
It's time to eat!

297
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,958
Old man... I am starving.

298
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,041
Alright, who thinks
they can take me on?!

299
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,541
I think I'm gonna
pass on that one.

300
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,458
I can, but I don't
need to prove it.

301
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,250
I've been looking for
a good fight all day!

302
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,083
What?!

303
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,458
Next time on Aquarion:

304
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,166
"Stars in the Sky,
Flowers on the Ground."

305
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,958
I don't believe this.
