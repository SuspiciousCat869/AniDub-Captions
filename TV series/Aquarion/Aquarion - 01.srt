1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,791
Holy Genesis: Year
Zero-Zero-One-One.

2
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,375
In the eleven years since

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,583
the devastation of the
Great Catastrophe, the Earth

4
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,083
has fallen under the attack by
the Shadow Angels of Atlandia.

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,666
These powerful
beings have awakened

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,666
from their 12,000-year slumber,
and resumed their quest

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,250
to harvest the living
energy known as Plana.

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,041
To counter this threat,
humankind has established

9
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,250
a special military task
force known as DEAVA,

10
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,541
dedicated to the revival

11
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,166
of the legendary
Mechanical Angel Aquarion.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,666
Based on the merge pattern
of its three Vector machines,

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,166
Aquarion is able to transform
into three different

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,625
battle-shapes, each with
unique combat capabilities.

15
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,125
By synergizing the heart, body,
and soul of its host Elements,

16
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,541
it becomes a weapon
of unlimited potential,

17
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,041
and humanity's best hope
against the Shadow Angels.

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,291
The most promising candidates
from around the world have

19
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,208
come forward to enlist in the
rigorous DEAVA training program,

20
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,416
each of them vying
for the chance

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,333
to one day become an Element.

22
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,750
Who will be the Chosen Three?

23
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,541
The final candidates
have been selected!

24
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,250
The battles of these
determined youths begin... now!

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,666
We were born for
a single purpose...

26
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,958
...to Merge with you...

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,375
...to make ourselves strong
in heart, body, and spirit...

28
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,875
...to become one, in all of
these ways, with our beloved...

29
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,750
We have a duty to the Earth,

30
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,666
to protect it from the
next Great Catastrophe...

31
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,625
To stem the tide of the Shadow
Angel invasion, to make

32
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,750
our world safe for humanity
for the next 12,000 years...

33
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,166
Mechanical Angel Aquarion...
stand by for Merge!

34
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,291
Go Merge One!

35
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,083
Merge Two!

36
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,500
Group One--Syncro failure!

37
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,541
Group Two--Aquarion Mars.

38
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,708
Initiating Merge.

39
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,458
That settles it.

40
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,625
These three are the best choice
for our first live field test.

41
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,583
There is another.

42
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,041
A boy with wings.

43
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,416
With wings?

44
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,416
The boy of prophecy:
the true Element,

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
the hero of Atlantis who
embodies the soul of Aquarion...

46
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:20,083
The time has come...
Solar Wing will awaken.

47
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, how about this box?

48
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,083
No-o. Stupid. That's detergent.

49
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,500
Check it out...!

50
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,416
That's gross!

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,750
Shhh...! Keep it down, guys.

52
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,958
Right!

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,875
Hey! Apollo!

54
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,708
Come on guys,
he's on to something.

55
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,083
Whoa-ho!
You got some nose man!

56
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,083
Move it!

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,083
Now get lost.

58
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,625
I'm tryin' to eat here.

59
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,791
'ey... 'bout time, Baron.

60
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,500
Sorry, just had to get
the kids out of the way.

61
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,750
Didn't mean to scare ya.

62
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,625
Let's do it!

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,875
Hey! Nice work!

64
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,500
Now c'mon, let's go.

65
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,750
I'm hungry.

66
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,041
Yeah, I know...

67
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,083
Too bad we can't
get full on toys...

68
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,333
We could maybe eat this

69
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,708
if we washed it off first...

70
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,875
Come on, you're not serious?

71
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,458
Do you even know what that is?

72
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,916
Fresh meat!!

73
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,500
You've got to be kidding me...!

74
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,250
How is an animal like that
supposed to be an Element User?

75
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,583
He's nothing like us!

76
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,083
Actually... Take a look.

77
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,166
His aura pattern is
multi-dimensional,

78
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,791
just like ours.

79
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,583
Still--he's repulsive!

80
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,375
And what if he is the
one we're looking for?

81
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,458
We might have to merge
with him one day...!

82
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,458
...I don't know about you, but
I don't want any part of that!

83
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,041
Easy there, Princess.

84
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,166
Like they say, "don't knock it
'til you've tried it", right?

85
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,333
You're impossible!

86
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,916
And I told you,
don't call me "Princess"!

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,333
Don't start getting
all flirty with me

88
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,833
like you are with
the other girls.

89
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,708
When you're with me, it's
strictly professional, got it!

90
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,958
Right, right.

91
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,625
Well in that case,
let's get back to work...

92
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,291
I mean, this is a
pretty big deal--

93
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,916
if Rena's right and
this kid has the mark,

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,375
it means he's the reincarnation

95
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,208
of the legendary hero
of Atlantis, Solar Wing--

96
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,666
Shut up, Pierre!

97
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,791
We already know
Sirius is a Solar Wing...

98
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,916
...and not some
filthy little street rat!

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,083
Strange though... all this
time, and your brother

100
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,500
can't remember any
details about his past life...

101
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,875
No... the problem isn't that
he can't remember anything,

102
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,375
it's that he doesn't want to...

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,875
All of those terrible
memories of war...

104
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,416
They must have been
too much for him to bear...

105
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,416
So he's sealed them away in the
depths of his subconscious...

106
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,041
Okay, so come on...

107
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,958
Let's check out this boy's back.

108
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,583
What is there to worry about?

109
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,291
Unless you're afraid
he'll actually turn out

110
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,291
to be your true love
from 12,000 years ago...?

111
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,583
I'll prove it's not him!

112
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,166
Who is that?!

113
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,083
You can come out now!

114
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,083
I know you're down there!

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,625
Well, you heard him...

116
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,625
Up we go...!

117
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,500
Cops?

118
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,708
I don't think so...

119
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,458
They don't look like cops...

120
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,166
And cops don't stink like that.

121
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,583
Alright... then who
are you people?!

122
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,000
Relax. We're not
here for you, pal.

123
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,458
Just stay out of the way
and you won't get burned.

124
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,625
We were just hoping
your friend here

125
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,041
would give us a
minute of his time.

126
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,916
Who, me...? Forget it.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,208
Now you realize,

128
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,750
if you don't cooperate
with us willingly,

129
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,666
we may have to rough
you up a little bit...

130
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,083
You can try.

131
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,416
But don't think cuz you're
a girl I'll go easy on ya

132
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,125
I wouldn't dream of it.

133
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:38,958
Pierre!

134
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,875
Got'cha!

135
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,291
Amateur.

136
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,416
Oh yeah?!

137
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,916
Apollo!

138
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,625
Let's see you come and
get me up here, you Amazon!

139
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,333
Amazon?!

140
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,583
Psycho-kinesis!

141
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,666
Nice.

142
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,708
You leave him alone!

143
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,666
There, you see...?

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
I tried to warn you, didn't I?

145
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,208
He stinks...! Pierre!

146
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,833
Get over here
and check his back.

147
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,583
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'...

148
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,750
Nothing...

149
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,250
It's not him.

150
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,333
Sorry, rat boy.

151
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
We thought you
were someone else.

152
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,458
You hear that?

153
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,250
The barrier...!

154
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,708
The Shadow Angels--they're
playing their Hypno-Song...

155
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,291
Shadow Angels?!

156
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,541
Hey! Wait!

157
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,458
Baron! Come back!

158
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,041
Stay down! It's too dangerous!

159
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,916
No...! He's not being
affected by the song.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
See? Look...!

161
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,500
His aura is protecting him.

162
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,000
But... if that's true,

163
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,458
that would mean he's an Element
User like us after all...

164
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:43,708
Hey, what the hell is happening?

165
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Hey, what the hell is happening?

166
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,416
Baron! Hold on...!

167
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,666
I'll get you out!

168
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
Get back!

169
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,708
Wait... No!

170
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,083
Master Toma...

171
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,750
At last, the time
has come to awaken...

172
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,541
The one you seek has returned...

173
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,750
I will not fail you, my lord.

174
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,541
I will give you... Solar Wing!

175
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,791
Help!!

176
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,000
Amazon...?

177
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,500
Vector Mars!

178
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,458
Wait, that's...
that's my brother!

179
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,333
Vector Mars,
calling Special Ops...

180
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,000
Has your team succeeded
in locating Solar Wing?

181
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,708
Special Ops to Vector Mars...!

182
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,500
We did find a boy who
seems to be an Element User,

183
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,750
but he's kinda gross,
and no wings...

184
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,166
I don't know, brother, maybe
you should come check him out...

185
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,666
We're in the middle
of a battle here, Silvia.

186
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,041
Right...

187
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,500
That's sixteen down!

188
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Those last two made
eighteen for me...

189
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,083
Not too bad, Reika.

190
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,458
You're not so bad yourself.

191
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,750
Glen. Reika.

192
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,083
Stay alert, both of you.

193
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,291
There could still be more
enemy craft in the area.

194
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,291
Roger, we'll keep
our eyes peeled...

195
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,000
A portal!

196
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:08,916
Something's coming!

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,541
And whatever it is, it's huge!

198
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,125
Careful!

199
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,416
Cherubim Soldier detected!

200
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,166
Multi-dimensional
quantum level, 92,000!

201
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,375
92,000?!

202
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,125
That's 10-times stronger
than any Cherubim

203
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,041
we've encountered to date!

204
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,875
Vector Mars, this
is DEAVA Control...

205
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,708
You are authorized for Merge!

206
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,833
Sirius, you will be
the Head Element

207
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,333
in this first live field test.

208
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,541
Initiate Merge--use Pattern
73B to destroy the Cherubim!

209
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,250
With all due respect,
Deputy Commander Jerome...

210
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,875
Pattern 73B seems a
rather inelegant choice

211
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,416
of strategy in this situation.

212
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,666
You really think
this is the time

213
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,666
to debate my choice of strategy?

214
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,000
I feel it's my duty...

215
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,875
In that case...

216
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,000
Vector Luna--you're
the Head Element.

217
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,666
This is an outrage!

218
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,000
Reika--understood?

219
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,666
Understood, sir.

220
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,083
Alright, boys... Ready...?

221
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
This is our first live Merge...

222
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,875
Time to see if all that
training was worth it.

223
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,250
Okay...! It's your show!

224
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,916
Sirius and I will
follow your lead!

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,708
Best of luck, Reika.

226
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Vector Luna to all craft...

227
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
Formation: L-M-S!

228
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,458
Code-name:
"The Shape of Destiny"!

229
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,291
Wait a minute, is
that formation L-M-S?

230
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,500
Reika's the head!

231
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,166
So, my brother--

232
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,208
His first Merge is
gonna be with her?

233
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,000
Multi-dimensional
quantum level augmented.

234
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,125
Aura resonance
index at Merge level!

235
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,666
Go Merge One!

236
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,791
Merge Two!

237
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,166
Go...! Aquarion!

238
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,125
The light...

239
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,291
The beautiful, divine light of
Mechanical Angel Aquarion...!

240
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,041
Aquarion... Luna!

241
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,750
Whoa... there it is...
Aquarion Luna...

242
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,833
I can't believe it.

243
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:37,916
Sirius merged without me.

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,750
Move, Glen!

245
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,958
On it!

246
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,541
Spinning Blades!

247
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,291
Incoming!

248
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,458
Reika!

249
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,125
Do it! Now!

250
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,208
Right!

251
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,041
Ready...! Divine Wind Blade!

252
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,750
Dragon Thunder!

253
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,458
Awesome, Reika!

254
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,500
Oh, please...!
It wasn't that great!

255
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,375
Hey she did it!

256
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,333
I knew she could do it!

257
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,666
Reika's the best!

258
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,625
They're all the best--the
perfect Element team!

259
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,791
Which is why
I chose them personally.

260
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,375
Absolutely ridiculous.

261
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:56,750
Wh-Who- Who are you?!

262
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,666
Bang!

263
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,166
It's you! You're alive!

264
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,958
The man they call "the
Great Magician", Gen Fudo!

265
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,291
"Gen Fudo"?

266
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Wait--you don't
mean that "Fudo"?

267
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,583
As in the man who excavated
Aquarion from the Machine Ruins?

268
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,083
The founder of DEAVA?

269
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,458
That's you?!

270
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,333
Lunatique... Draw!

271
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, long ago,
in feudal times,

272
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,250
there lived a
wise old general...

273
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,708
He had a saying...

274
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,958
Alone, even the strongest
arrow can be easily broken,

275
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,333
but three together,
are unbreakable...

276
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,625
Lunatique...
Tri-Element Arrow... Go!

277
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,541
Yes, the general
was Montari of Mori,

278
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,708
born 1497 in Takada
Village, province of Aki.

279
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,791
He spoke those words
on the eve of his death,

280
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,041
as he entrusted his
clan to his three sons:

281
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,666
Takamoto, Motoyasu,
and Takakage.

282
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,458
The principal of
the three elements--

283
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,375
heart, body, and
spirit--working together as one.

284
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,125
The foundation of
Aquarion's strength.

285
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,458
As long as these
elements are combined--

286
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,833
They cannot be broken!

287
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,458
For the most part, yes.

288
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,083
But even with three arrows...

289
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,416
If enough pressure is
applied to the right point...

290
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,083
They will snap!

291
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,208
Look out!

292
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,750
That's it!

293
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
Humans...?

294
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,041
No...!

295
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,625
Brother, no!

296
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,458
They're losin' it...

297
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,291
The bond's broken! Come On!

298
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,750
Syncro Failure!
Merge Index Zero!

299
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,791
Multi-dimensional quantum
levels fading rapidly!

300
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,708
Vector Sol, Glen:
bio-energy at critical levels.

301
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,958
No. How is this possible...?

302
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
These three were
our best Elements!

303
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,833
We need to get
them out of there!

304
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:14,875
Right. I've seen enough.

305
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm assuming command.

306
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:16,875
What?!

307
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,416
But Gen...!

308
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,875
Baron!

309
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,541
Baron! It's me!

310
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,541
Baron, no...

311
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:39,375
Baron... No!

312
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,375
Reika! Reika!

313
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,958
Hang in there!

314
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,166
What?

315
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,208
The Harvest Beast--it
was inside that building!

316
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,791
Make a run for it?

317
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,208
No Time... Here...!

318
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:01,750
Look after her!

319
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,250
H- Hey! Wait!

320
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,583
Initiating start up...!

321
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,375
All systems, green!

322
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,291
Silvia!

323
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,500
Pierre!

324
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,083
Take Glen and Reika
and get to cover now!

325
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,250
Dammit, Princess!

326
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,250
Just do it!

327
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,708
Is that--?!

328
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,916
A-quar-i-oooon...!

329
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,541
What...?

330
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,583
That's impossible.

331
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,166
How could he
know about Aquarion?

332
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,041
Vector Mars to Luna...

333
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,208
 Silvia, that boy.

334
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,041
Is he the one you told me about?

335
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,583
Yeah... That's him.

336
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,125
But... we checked his back.

337
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,041
There was no wing sign!

338
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,000
Glen...?

339
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,083
Then... wait, who's
piloting Vector Sol?

340
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,791
Vector Sol has just
ejected its host Element.

341
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,500
Energy levels are rising fast.

342
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,041
But how--? Wait.

343
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,875
You mean it's flying itself?!

344
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,750
No, he is there...
the one with wings...

345
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:09,166
Aquarioooon!

346
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,583
He's falling!

347
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,958
What?!

348
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,041
I thought you already
beat this thing?!

349
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,833
Apparently not.

350
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,833
What's that?

351
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,291
The wing sign? Could it be?

352
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,333
What is all this?

353
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,500
Mechanical Angel... Aquarion...

354
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,375
Who's there?!

355
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,666
Say these words...

356
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,333
"Merge Form... Genesis..."

357
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,375
"Merge Form Genesis"

358
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,166
Say it: "Merge Form, Genesis!"

359
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,291
"Merge Form Genesis"...

360
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,791
"Merge Form Genesis"...?

361
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,125
What are you saying...?

362
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,333
Where did you learn that?
Who are you?!

363
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,083
Merge Form, Genesis...!

364
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:17,791
Go...! Aquarion!

365
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,625
Some sort of new
transformation...?

366
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,125
Such incredible power...!

367
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,750
It feels... so good...!

368
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,083
Appollonius...

369
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,416
Come, Seliane.

370
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,750
Could he really...
be the one...?

371
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,041
So beautiful...

372
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,708
They actually formed
Solar Aquarion...

373
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,208
Yes, but how...?!

374
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,416
A boy with no training
on his first try?!

375
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,875
That is truly...
Merge Form Genesis!

376
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,166
Alright, my friends...

377
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,083
Lend me your power!

378
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,250
Wait, what?

379
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,958
Your Friends...?

380
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,125
Is he the one...?

381
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,541
Is it him?

382
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:41,291
Merge Form, Genesis!
Go, Aquarion!

383
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,583
It feels... so good!

384
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,000
Next time on Aquarion:
"Beast of Darkness."
