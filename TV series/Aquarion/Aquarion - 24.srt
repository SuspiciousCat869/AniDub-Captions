1
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,958
The day my brother left...

2
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,416
It was as if he had
taken the sun with him.

3
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:36,750
The sky turned the color of ash;
everything looked cold and dead.

4
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,333
Somehow, we've passed
a point of no return.

5
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,791
The Shadow Angels
are bent on driving

6
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,958
the human race to extinction.

7
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:53,000
Sirius... is this the
beautiful world you dreamt of?

8
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,666
Our time has come...

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,833
Sirius, our newest Angel...

10
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,333
Because of your
presence here in Atlandia,

11
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,875
the balance of power
has shifted in our favor.

12
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,625
The tree of life has given
birth to a new harvest beast,

13
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,500
as beautiful as
the falling snow.

14
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,791
Soft and deadly...

15
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,625
Now my friend, you
and I can sit safely by,

16
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,208
while the wingless
ones embrace oblivion.

17
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:33,375
For Atlandia... may it bring
even greater glory to the name.

18
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,666
The final harvest has begun...

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,916
Look... the snowfall
from Atlandia.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,250
It's from Atlandia?

21
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,000
Subspace portals are
appearing all over the world!

22
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,875
And the numbers are increasing!

23
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,583
The count is
approximately 12,000!

24
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,458
I can't believe this...

25
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,625
So what do we do?!

26
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,458
How the hell do we fight this?!

27
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,666
What about all those
people out there?!

28
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,916
People where I'm from,
have never even seen snow!

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,666
Pierre...

30
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,541
Silvia no!

31
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,625
What are you doing?

32
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,708
Dammit... what if
she's betraying us

33
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,250
just like her brother...

34
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,375
This is why I was opposed to
using pilots with angel blood...

35
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,458
They can't be trusted!

36
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,208
What?!

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,958
I think she intends
to bring him back.

38
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:17,125
I don't understand
your reasons, brother...

39
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,000
but your actions
are unforgivable...

40
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:23,416
But I... I can't help it!

41
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,958
I'm coming for you!

42
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,708
Silvia!

43
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,666
The world's Prana is now
channeled here by Harube,

44
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,666
a harvest beast infinitely more
powerful than its forebears.

45
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,625
It nourishes the growth
of the Tree of Life

46
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,708
as it reaches
towards the heavens.

47
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,083
At long last our
precious capitol

48
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,541
of Angels will be resurrected!

49
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,750
At long last the moment
we have waited for...

50
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,833
Solar Wing will awaken...
and with him a new world...

51
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,833
The Tree of Life will
bear true fruit once again,

52
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:12,375
and a new glorious era of
Shadow Angels will be born!

53
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,958
But we must hurry.

54
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,416
The time for pollination is now!

55
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,791
If we miss it, our precious
flowers will wilt and die!

56
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,333
Silvia!

57
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,333
As of right now you are
not to board a Vector!

58
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,916
You are suspended until
you are cleared of suspicion

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,666
of attempting to
flee to Atlandia!

60
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,916
Silvia...

61
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,958
Hey... it's gonna be alright.

62
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
Like the snow--that
falls from the heavens,

63
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,416
he too, will come.

64
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,333
The one she awaits will come

65
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,541
and a tree of
misfortune will bear fruit!

66
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,625
The one I await?

67
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,333
Wait a minute. Who is it...

68
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,666
Who do you mean?

69
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,958
I do not know...

70
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,166
What I speak
comes from this book.

71
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,833
And the prophecy is unclear.

72
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,541
Forget about him.

73
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,708
Forget about him...

74
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not going to forget

75
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,083
about the only brother
I have in this world!

76
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,666
What if he's
responsible for all this?!

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,958
I can't just give up on him!

78
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,791
I have to try to stop him...!

79
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,750
It's not him.

80
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
Toma and the Shadow
Angels are to blame...

81
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,958
They're who we need to stop!

82
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,083
You gotta focus...

83
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,750
We need your strength.

84
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,250
It's time... as it
was 12,000 years ago

85
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,375
when paradise was first lost...

86
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,333
we're about to
enter the final battle!

87
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,833
You must ask yourselves

88
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:03,416
who will be destroyed...
us or them?

89
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,916
Do we accept
defeat as our destiny...

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,333
or do we stand up and fight?

91
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,500
Look deep inside
yourselves... no regrets!

92
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,666
Welcome Commander Fudo.

93
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,333
This is the
mass-production version

94
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,583
of the Assault-type
Aquarion developed jointly

95
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,708
by the military and DEAVA.

96
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,625
The body of this
Aquarion is armed

97
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,375
with an advanced PSG
quantum weaponry unit.

98
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,458
With these, our forces
will finally be able

99
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,708
to smash through
Atlandia's outer barrier,

100
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,666
and take the
fight to their door.

101
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,041
They're simply no match
for our military technology...

102
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,541
our victory is already complete.

103
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,583
There wings will be
rendered innocuous.

104
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
We've made great strides.

105
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,833
The data collected

106
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,625
from the DEAVA Elements
has been most helpful.

107
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,083
We've now effectively harnessed

108
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,125
the power of the
Shadow Angel's feathers.

109
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,208
Indeed we have.

110
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,250
There you go!

111
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,500
Eat up, strong so you can fly!

112
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,791
Here, catch!

113
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,708
Well, dig in!

114
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,458
I envy birds so much.

115
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,125
To soar... to be
able to fly freely

116
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,916
between the
heavens and the earth.

117
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,291
I've got plenty of food...
help yourself.

118
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,208
Eat all of it that you can...
then eat some more.

119
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
Get stronger...

120
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,000
Then you'll fly... We both will.

121
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,750
Not so we can look
down on people...

122
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,958
Just for fun... forever.

123
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,791
Hey... what gives?

124
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,875
Where is everybody?

125
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,833
I suppose they're
off spending time

126
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,791
with the people
they care about...

127
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,666
This is that sort of time.

128
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,208
Hey hey... so it looks like

129
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,916
it's just the two of
us here, huh Sophia?

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,166
Pierre.

131
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,833
Why are you still here?

132
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,333
I'm a loner... but, c'mon...

133
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,166
That's not you... right?

134
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,875
You know, I'm very proud
of how far you've come...

135
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm proud of all of you...

136
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,625
Uh Pierre?

137
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
So... I made this
fruit cake for you...

138
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,583
If you'd like to try a piece.

139
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,500
It's nutritious and
full of vitamins...

140
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,208
Come on sis!

141
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,708
Apollo?

142
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,708
Yeah...

143
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,625
Do you think we
used to walk like this?

144
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,708
What I mean is...

145
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,916
12,000 years ago do you
think we walked together?

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,958
Dunno...

147
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,958
I guess... all I know is,
for whatever reason,

148
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,041
it feels like I've known
you for a long time...

149
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,833
Your scent...

150
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,125
I know it...

151
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,958
Apollo...

152
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,041
Tsugumi... where is she?

153
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,791
I found an awesome tool for her!

154
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,625
Here you go... for you.

155
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,291
Thank you... nice.

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,833
Happiness is fleeting...

157
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,833
But bad luck? It never ends.

158
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,000
You've got me!

159
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you saying I'm bad luck?!

160
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,875
Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

161
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,333
We heard that the final
battle is about to begin...

162
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,208
Here... these are for you guys!

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,541
It's symbolic...
They stand for happiness!

164
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,708
Happiness...

165
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,500
I can't believe... Thank you...

166
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,375
I hate it... When
I think of what he's done...

167
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,833
I wonder if I should
even trust myself...

168
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,458
You can't think like that.

169
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,250
We're gonna win this!

170
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
Like I said, we'll fly...

171
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,083
Even without Aquarion.

172
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,416
Please don't leave me...

173
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,916
I don't think I could
lose you again.

174
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,000
You have to swear to me.

175
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,208
Such a familiar scent...

176
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,083
Such a familiar sound...

177
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,958
What's wrong?

178
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,083
Look... over there!

179
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,458
He's here Apollo,
my brother is here!

180
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,833
I can feel him watching us...

181
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,916
What... Where is he?

182
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,583
Do you see him?

183
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,875
Hey, help me out here...

184
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,458
Silvia.

185
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,291
Silvia!!!

186
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,125
Tsugumi!

187
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,750
Tsugumi!

188
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,375
Get down!

189
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,375
No!

190
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,708
Come on!

191
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,708
Reika...

192
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,125
Oh no!

193
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,250
The angels.

194
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,375
They've... broken
through the barrier!

195
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,166
This can't be happening...

196
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,375
Chloe!

197
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,708
Sister!

198
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,041
Chloe!

199
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,666
You're gonna be alright... okay?

200
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,500
Eat the cake...
please promise me...

201
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,125
Just stop talking like that...

202
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,041
I'm telling you right now that
cake is for the both of us...

203
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,791
Don't you leave me!

204
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,458
Chloe!!!

205
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,625
He was here...
Sirius was outside!

206
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,875
Has he come back?

207
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,458
That traitor was just here?!

208
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,708
He took Silvia...

209
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,666
The bastard took her with him.

210
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,958
Is this true?

211
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,333
Her scent. It's gone...

212
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,125
We barely escaped...
is everyone alright?

213
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,583
Jerome... your orders!

214
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,833
I uh...

215
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,625
Look Jerome, you're
the ranking officer now...

216
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,625
With Fudo gone it's up to you...

217
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,750
Give us your orders!

218
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,541
This information is classified.

219
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,875
Moments from now a military
force will be deployed.

220
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,958
What?

221
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm told, it will
wipe out Atlandia!

222
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,000
What?!

223
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,291
You have to stop them...

224
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,166
What's going to
happen to Silvia?!

225
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,250
That's where Sirius took her!

226
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,333
You can't let this happen!

227
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,791
It's probably futile.

228
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,791
What?!

229
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,166
That is why DEAVA will...

230
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,875
Operate autonomously!!!

231
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,750
It's about time...

232
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,250
Apollo!

233
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,666
Tsugumi... Reika!

234
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,958
Yes sir!

235
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,541
Yes sir!

236
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,583
Mechanical Angel Aquarion...

237
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,041
Prepare for launch!

238
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:57,916
Roger!

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Roger!

240
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,166
Jerome!

241
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,708
Let's go!

242
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,666
Infinity Puuuuuuuuunch!

243
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,458
Come on, guys!

244
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,000
Apollo's aura
levels are beginning

245
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,500
to decrease dangerously.

246
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,208
How hard is this barrier?

247
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,916
Damage increasing
to Vector Luna,

248
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,208
it's Reika's right shoulder!

249
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,125
It's my stupid bad luck...

250
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,250
We'll fail ... and
it's all because of me

251
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,458
No... we can beat this
thing if we stick together!

252
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,916
Give me a chance...

253
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,958
I want you to
let me be the head!

254
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,166
We don't have time for this.

255
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,000
I can do it!

256
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,333
You've got to trust me...

257
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,791
You may think
I'm just some little girl

258
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,458
that can't take care of
herself... but you're wrong...

259
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,375
Let me prove it to you...

260
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,791
Tsugumi...

261
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,833
What's she doing?

262
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,458
Okay... now make us proud!

263
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Right!

264
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,000
Merge One!

265
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,791
Thank you.

266
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,083
Merge Two!

267
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,166
Let's do this!

268
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,166
Go... Aquarion!!!

269
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,625
This feels different...

270
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500
Tsugumi.

271
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,875
Aquarion... Angel!

272
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,458
Tsugumi!

273
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,291
You alright?

274
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,666
Tsugumi's heart rate rising,
aura levels reaching critical!

275
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,666
Tsugumi, don't push yourself!

276
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,750
No... now is the time
for her to clear the wall!

277
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,958
Commander!

278
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,333
Tsugumi is not alone...
she has her friends!

279
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,041
I can hear it.

280
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,375
What do you mean?

281
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,583
The sound of a
passionate heart beat!

282
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,666
Tsugumi... Hold on!

283
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you Jun... Thank you!

284
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,250
Tsugumi!

285
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,500
Tsugumi!!

286
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,208
Thank you everyone...
Thanks so much!

287
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,000
You okay?

288
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,458
Thank you...
You never gave up...

289
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,708
No matter how scared I was,

290
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,291
you always believed
I could do it.

291
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,791
And I love you!

292
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,875
You what?

293
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,416
Everyone... I love everyone.

294
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000
You see... there's
no limit to the power

295
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,583
of the love that I feel!

296
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,750
All the pain... and the sadness.

297
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,750
Everything about it,
good and bad!

298
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,583
I love being alive!

299
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,375
I love it all!!!

300
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:29,625
Look it's Atlandia... no!

301
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,083
I don't believe it...

302
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,125
I hit that barrier with
everything I had...

303
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,750
But she broke through!

304
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,166
Tsugumi... are you alright?

305
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,458
Did I do it...?

306
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,583
Yeah...

307
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,291
I'll be okay, and
I won't let bad luck

308
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,083
or any other thing
bother you ever again...

309
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,333
Just take it easy...

310
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,541
You won't take me...
I won't let you!!!

311
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,291
Reika!

312
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,666
Let's do it Apollo...

313
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,250
Let's do it for Tsugumi!

314
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,875
Damn straight!

315
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,375
Oh no!

316
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,666
The military vectors!

317
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,125
So... they just used us
to break through the barrier!

318
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,958
Come back here!!!

319
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,833
The gates of destiny
have been opened...

320
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,333
Who will be the chosen:
humans or Shadow Angels?

321
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,666
Next time on Aquarion:
"Final Battle! Atlandia!"

322
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,666
Apollo!

323
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,875
Silvia!

324
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,416
That's right...
Be sure to watch!
