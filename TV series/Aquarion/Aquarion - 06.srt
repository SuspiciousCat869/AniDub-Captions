1
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,833
Reika.

2
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,708
How'd you know?

3
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,250
I could sense you...

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,500
And the sound of your footsteps
rings like music in my ears.

5
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,083
Look up there...

6
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,416
Those clouds look
like angel wings.

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,666
The clouds seem so lonely...

8
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,250
in the way they're
always wandering the sky...

9
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,916
never able to find
what they're searching for.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,250
Sometimes I feel that way.

11
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,250
I've never thought of that...

12
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,625
The loneliness... and
the constant searching...

13
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:36,208
You really are a poet, Sirius.

14
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,041
Reika.

15
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,041
I'm sorry for using you...

16
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,125
Just so I could avoid
the traps in the labyrinth.

17
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,500
Fudo's always telling us

18
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,916
that we should use
all available resources...

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,458
You were just doing what
you needed to, that's all.

20
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,208
Thank you for being
so understanding Reika.

21
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,666
You can't...!

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,833
Your sister was right when
she told you I was bad luck.

23
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,250
I wish she would
leave him alone.

24
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,583
Hey, ice cream!

25
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
What's the matter with you?!

26
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,708
That ice cream was supposed

27
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,750
to be a special
surprise for my brother!

28
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,416
You see...

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,750
You'll only get hurt.

30
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay class, today we'll
begin an exercise designed

31
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,583
to channel your thoughts
into long distance attacks...

32
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,416
Your partners will position
themselves at the foot

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,375
of those mushroom mountains,
and you will cause them

34
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,250
to turn around by using the
power of your own thoughts.

35
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,333
One question sir...

36
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,916
Are we permitted
to make them turn around

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,708
by using mental telepathy?

38
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,958
You miss the point.

39
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
This exercise isn't
simply putting words

40
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,375
into your partner's head...

41
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,958
it's about using
your mental energy...

42
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,500
to physically impose
your will on others.

43
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,916
And we're supposed to do
this with just our thoughts?

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,583
But it's so far.

45
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,625
What a waste of time...

46
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,000
At that distance...? No way.

47
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,583
It's gonna crash!

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,458
How did he do that?

49
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,958
We're about to find out...

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,041
Let's try this!

51
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,375
1... 2... 3...

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,750
How'd I get stuck with you?

53
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,416
I'm not happy about
this either, you know.

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,666
I... I can't seem to
get away from you.

55
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,250
I know... I guess its destiny.

56
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,416
Jun, you and Rena standby
to take aura measurements.

57
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
You seem nervous.

58
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,000
Haven't you ever
held a girl's hand?

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,375
No... I...

60
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,125
O-Of course I have!

61
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,625
Here goes nothing.

62
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,083
Psychokinesis!

63
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,208
It's not working!

64
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,583
She's too far.

65
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,583
Okay, strike...!

66
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,958
Come on, already...! Strike!!

67
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,625
He has an impressive aura...

68
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,166
Too bad he can't control it.

69
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,041
His aura levels
are off the chart.

70
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,708
Okay, but what good does
it do if he can't harness it?

71
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,208
Commander, their ESP is
still severely underdeveloped,

72
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,750
not to mention unstable...

73
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,416
Perhaps we should
start a shorter distance

74
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
in order boost their confidence.

75
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,208
Distance isn't the problem.

76
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,041
It only seems far to them
because they believe it's far...

77
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,458
Their hearts... are weak.

78
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,333
Distance and time
are simply constructs

79
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,791
of an uncertain spirit.

80
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,041
So we create them?

81
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,958
Interesting.

82
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,541
I sense the
Solar Wing has invaded

83
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,250
your thoughts once
more, Master Toma...

84
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,208
Actually, I was
thinking about you.

85
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,208
You tease me, my lord.

86
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,041
Master Toma, wait...!

87
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,458
The moon becomes
you tonight, my lord.

88
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,458
Like you it teases:

89
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,875
Close enough to bask
in the light of its beauty,

90
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,750
but too far away to
ever hope to touch it.

91
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,208
I suppose it's in my nature...

92
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,666
Never close, yet never far.

93
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,416
Yes... that's perfect.

94
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,791
I still don't feel anything.

95
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,291
Hey Tsugumi!

96
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,833
How about next time
you partner with me?

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,958
Give it a rest Pierre.

98
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,333
She's too young for you.

99
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:49,250
Okay... if old man Fudo
can do it, then so can I...

100
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,333
Just concentrate!

101
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Come on!!!!

102
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,750
Use your voice one more
time and you're disqualified.

103
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,250
Shut your face!!

104
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,333
What an idiot.

105
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,125
Alright, it's time to give
it everything I've got...

106
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,250
Maximum Psychokinesis!!!

107
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,291
Well, I guess it kind of worked.

108
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,375
You screwed up big time!

109
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,250
Shut up!!

110
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,250
Apollonius...!

111
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,333
Apollonius, hang on!!

112
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,083
Seriane, Please, don't let go!!

113
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,833
Reach me...

114
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,333
You can do it... just try!

115
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,541
Apollonius, don't leave me!!!

116
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,500
This better be good.

117
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,041
I have a small favor to ask you.

118
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,916
I'm not interested in being
your trap fodder again, okay?

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,416
That isn't what
I want Reika, I promise...

120
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,583
I just thought that
you could help me

121
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,625
practice the technique
we learned today.

122
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,791
Okay... why ask me...?

123
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,125
Wouldn't your sister
be a better choice

124
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,958
for something like this?

125
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,666
Silvia's still a little girl...

126
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,208
She's so wrapped up
with her own feelings

127
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:00,333
that she can't be bothered to
concern herself with others.

128
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,041
I see...

129
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,625
The Book of Holy
Genesis makes it clear...

130
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,250
The Shadow Angels will
continue to grow in power

131
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,458
if they're allowed to keep
harvesting human prana...

132
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,875
It's up to us to stop them,

133
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,666
but we're not going to be able
to unless we get stronger too.

134
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,583
I'll do it for the sake of Glen

135
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,583
and everybody else that
they've taken, but that's it...

136
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,833
It isn't because of you.

137
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,666
It's so beautiful.

138
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,291
A night-blooming cereus,

139
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,500
a blossom that only
thrives in the darkness.

140
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,416
It suits you.

141
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,041
Well if you say so.

142
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,500
The way things have
been going lately,

143
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,875
I'm never gonna find
a way to rescue Baron.

144
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,791
Why do I keep smelling flowers?

145
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,375
They're practicing...?

146
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,250
Not without me they're not.

147
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,541
Well if my Sword of
the Heart can't reach her.

148
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,333
I'm sorry I couldn't save
you 12,000 years ago...

149
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,500
But I won't make the same
mistake in this life...

150
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,625
This time I'll make sure my
feelings reach my true love...

151
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,958
After all, brother...
you are the true Solar Wing.

152
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,875
Maybe I should get closer.

153
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,333
Come on brother!

154
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,500
It should work from here.

155
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,750
The Heart's Arrow...!

156
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,166
It worked!!

157
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,208
Sirius!!

158
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,333
Did it reach you?!

159
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,625
Why did it hit Apollo?!

160
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,916
Silvia!!

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,291
Oh don't mind me...

162
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,208
I was just practicing...

163
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,791
Silvia!...!

164
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,708
How did I know it was you?!!

165
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,083
Sirius!!

166
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,750
Reika?!

167
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,958
Careful!

168
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,625
Unit Two requesting
reinforcements!!

169
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,125
Let's get this over with

170
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,375
before it can do any
more damage to the city...

171
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,583
Use the Trinity Saber formation.

172
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,583
Roger!

173
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,708
What are you
doing up there?!...!

174
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,875
Filing your nails?!

175
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,250
Be quiet...
I need to concentrate.

176
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,083
Long Range Saber Strike!!

177
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,500
What the?!!

178
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,708
What happened?!

179
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,416
It's figured out Aquarion
Mars' attack range.

180
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,625
Hey Sirius...!

181
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,375
You should attack
with the Heart's Arrow...!

182
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,583
All you have to do is
concentrate like before...

183
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,291
Like when you aimed at my heart!

184
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,666
At your what?!!

185
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,166
What are you talking about?!

186
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,333
Excellent idea...

187
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,833
Good work Reika.

188
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,916
Silvia...

189
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,833
We're going to switch
to Aquarion Luna.

190
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,916
You handle the bow,

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,125
and I'll take care of the arrow.

192
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:13,791
Fine.

193
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,125
If you say so...

194
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,208
but its only because
you're my big brother.

195
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,000
Hey Princess Screw Up...

196
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,500
I hope you can drive
better than you can throw.

197
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,958
I'll show you!

198
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,458
If Reika can manage to pilot
this thing then so can I!

199
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,333
Knock it off,
you two... Merge One!

200
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,291
If you say so... Merge Two!

201
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,416
Go...! Aquarion!!

202
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,125
It feels so good!

203
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,000
Aquarion... Luna!!

204
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,791
Oh wow...!

205
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,625
So this is what it feels
like to be the head...!

206
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,125
Silvia...! Its time to focus!

207
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:09,333
Right... Lunatique... Archery!!!

208
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,000
Long Range... Arrow!!!

209
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,666
Okay, I'm ready!!

210
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,250
Her aim is terrible... Don't
forget that.

211
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,958
Not to worry... I'll do the
targeting.

212
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,833
Okay!!

213
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,000
Now!!

214
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,500
Keep going...

215
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,541
Keep going... Keep going!

216
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,000
Where did it go?!

217
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,625
So what are we
supposed to do now?!

218
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,291
You continue to
amaze me, Master...

219
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,958
What an ingenious idea,
imbuing the Cherubim Soldier

220
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
with the moon's
ability to appear close,

221
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,500
yet remain untouchable.

222
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
Tell me...

223
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,333
What will you do now...?

224
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,833
Solar Wing.

225
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,333
Switch over to Solar Aquarion!!!

226
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,125
Geez... It took you long enough!

227
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,083
But Commander, he failed
the training exercises...

228
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,250
It isn't fair.

229
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,708
That's enough, Sirius...

230
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,750
You've made it clear to me
that your heart isn't ready

231
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,375
to do what I've asked of you.

232
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,458
What's that supposed to mean?

233
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,750
Alright... Let's get started!

234
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,875
Incredible!

235
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,833
This is gonna to be tricky...

236
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm stuck with a couple

237
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,708
of talent-less royal
pains in the neck...

238
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,083
It's not a lot to work with...

239
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,166
But if we can combine
all of our powers...

240
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,708
We just might have a chance.

241
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,541
Apollo, I've
spotted the soldier!

242
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,000
Alright buddy,
time for you to go...

243
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,666
Silvia... Sirius...

244
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,541
I'm going to need
your help, okay?

245
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,083
Did he just ask for our help?

246
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,375
I suppose he did...

247
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,541
Let's do it Silvia.

248
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791
Yeah... Okay!

249
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,666
Ready, NOW!!!!

250
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,333
Not so fast!!

251
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,791
No way!

252
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,791
Yeah! Bull's eye!

253
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,250
But why...?!

254
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,000
I thought for sure
it would work!

255
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,541
He's using his thoughts...

256
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,583
When he should
be using his heart.

257
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,458
You cannot expect to move
mountains with thought alone.

258
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,791
I don't understand
what happened!

259
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,666
Why didn't our punch
have any effect?!!

260
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,041
Come on Sirius...

261
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,333
Think.

262
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,875
Their hearts... are weak...

263
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,041
Distance and time
are simply constructs

264
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,791
of an uncertain spirit.

265
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,125
Apollo...!

266
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,375
You've got to stop putting
limits on your power!!

267
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,541
What did you say?!

268
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,291
Stop trying to
hit the Soldier...!

269
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,666
Aim past it...

270
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,958
Reach through the sky...!

271
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,458
Attack him as though
your life depended on it!

272
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,333
Okay... I'll see what I can do.

273
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,750
Get ready you guys...
here goes!!

274
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,041
The power...!

275
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,375
It's amazing!!

276
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,458
I'm feeling faint...!

277
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,291
It's too much!

278
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,708
Got it!

279
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,208
Now let's finish this!

280
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,375
Infinity Punch!

281
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,625
Keep aiming for the sky!!!

282
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,750
It's amazing!

283
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,625
He actually did it!

284
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,333
So this is what Fudo meant...

285
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:37,000
The power of his thoughts,
and... his whole heart...

286
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,041
Just a little bit further!

287
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,458
He's reached it!

288
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,250
Don't fret, Otoha...

289
00:21:55,333 --> 00:22:02,166
It's just another
crater on the moon.

290
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,625
Now that's...
shootin' for the moon...

291
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,000
Hi Reika.

292
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,583
Like flower petals fall,
love is laid to rest...

293
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,541
All things of
this world dissolve

294
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,208
into the vast
emptiness of darkness...

295
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,958
Evil resurrects
itself once again...

296
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,833
Next time on Aquarion:
"Knight of the Crimson Rose."
