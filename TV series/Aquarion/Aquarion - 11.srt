1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,791
Glen.

2
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,791
'ey. Not too bad, Reika.

3
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,750
You're not so bad yourself.

4
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,166
This is all my fault,

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,791
if only I could have
held the merge...

6
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,291
Doctor!

7
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,375
Why does everything
near me suffer?

8
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,958
Look at the water!

9
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,750
Worrying helps no one.

10
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,708
Glen has always been strong.

11
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,375
He will pull
through this in time.

12
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,458
Reika? 

13
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,541
What does that card symbolize?

14
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,458
The turning point of fate.

15
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,583
This is just great

16
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,291
now how are we supposed
to get back to the dorms?

17
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,625
I wonder whose bad luck
could have caused this?

18
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,083
 Silvia! 

19
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,916
Oh... Sir...

20
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,166
Your eyes are gifted with the
clarity of a bubbling spring.

21
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Unfortunately, this water
cannot render any tea...

22
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,125
Not until the ripples of
fear and doubt have subsided

23
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,333
Sirius?

24
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,250
I was just wondering...

25
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,625
how's Reika related to
Aquarion in her previous life?

26
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,666
I don't know...

27
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
She's a mystery,
but she's certainly

28
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,500
one of the most gifted
elements in the group.

29
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,500
 Yeah? Well that's funny,

30
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,000
because I clearly remember
Reika causing serious problems

31
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,041
on nearly all of our missions.

32
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,625
During our first trial,

33
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,958
Reika was entrusted
with piloting Aquarion...

34
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,791
...our merge was a
transcendent experience.

35
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,500
But Brother.

36
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,333
You wanna merge with
her a second time?!

37
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,375
Brother...

38
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,416
I'll have nightmares if I don't
sleep in your room tonight.

39
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,083
I suppose...
but just for tonight.

40
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,041
Reika, where are you?

41
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,083
Oh good you're back!

42
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,458
I'm glad you made it home okay!

43
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,708
It's ruined.

44
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,625
She's quite a lady.

45
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,541
Alright, this should do it...

46
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,250
Here it goes.

47
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,375
Okay... You're all set.

48
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,000
You're so awesome Jun.

49
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,666
You're really are.

50
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,000
Not really...

51
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,458
Reika, why don't you go
ahead and give it a try?

52
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,958
Who? Me...? Ah... I don't know.

53
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,625
Oh... go ahead.

54
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,291
It's okay,.

55
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,125
It's gonna work fine.

56
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:25,708
What the...?

57
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,625
A black out.

58
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,625
That's... impossible!

59
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,125
The monitor...

60
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,708
Stay away!

61
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,625
Make it stop!

62
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,666
You think those were ghosts?

63
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,041
No. No way...
There's no such thing.

64
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,625
Jun... I'm so sorry...

65
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,375
I ruined all your hard work.

66
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,791
No Jun, this is all the
result of my bad luck.

67
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,958
It's so early Reika...

68
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,958
What are you
doing out and about?

69
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,166
I tell ya, I can't catch
anything today...

70
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,375
Catch anything...?

71
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Exactly... what were
you looking to catch?

72
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,375
I was trying to
find some protein.

73
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,708
Huh...? C'mon Apollo...?

74
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,541
There's plenty of food at DEAVA.

75
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,458
Yeah, but it's full
of preservatives.

76
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,916
Nothing's fresh,
all the flavors are dull.

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,833
Wait... you're telling
me you actually kill

78
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,250
wild animals and eat them raw?

79
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, that was the
only way I could survive

80
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,333
before I got to this hole.

81
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm sorry I ran into you...

82
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,625
if I'd stayed away you could
have caught something.

83
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,583
My presence only seems
to bring people bad luck.

84
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,666
What?

85
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,291
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard...

86
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,083
It was no more than
man versus beast out there

87
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,000
and this round
went to the beast.

88
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,250
Well I guess I stand corrected,
you did ruin my hunt after all.

89
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,791
I picked up your scent from
all the way in the valley...

90
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,375
I was so thrown off by it
I couldn't find a single mouse.

91
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,041
I see... The breeze
must have carried it off...

92
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,375
Hey, not too bad Reika...

93
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,833
Reika, the first
time I try to merge...

94
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,583
I'd really like
it to be with you.

95
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,041
Oh... and you too.

96
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:31,250
Not until the ripples of
fear and doubt have subsided.

97
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,625
High level quantum readings
are coming from Lake Oolong.

98
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,958
Sirius, Silvia, Reika.

99
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,166
Stand by, and prepare to launch.

100
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,583
Vector Mars, taking off!

101
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,541
Vector Luna, taking off!

102
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,208
Reika's not here!

103
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,083
I'm taking over!

104
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:55,958
Apollo???

105
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,708
This is totally unauthorized...!

106
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,708
Reika...? Where is Reika?!

107
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,083
I found this...

108
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,375
...on Reika's desk.

109
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,625
"Please don't come after me." 

110
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,416
Prana energy? In the lake?

111
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,666
What???

112
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,083
Passengers,
please remain calm...

113
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,625
We are trying to determine
the reason for our stop...

114
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,000
For your safety,

115
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,625
please remain seated
with your seatbelts fastened.

116
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm to blame for this.

117
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,250
Vectors.

118
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,333
My bad luck must
have brought them here.

119
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,166
My reason for leaving DEAVA
was to protect the others

120
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,291
from my curse...

121
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,416
Why's it still happening?

122
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,958
Please, make it stop.

123
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,041
 I just don't get it...

124
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,333
I don't see any Cherubim.

125
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,625
I mean there's no
beast around here either.

126
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,416
I don't know about that.

127
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,708
Hey!

128
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,291
Something about that train...

129
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,416
Let's double back... Now!

130
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,750
Right.

131
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,666
I've got to get away
from here quickly.

132
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,958
They'll die.

133
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,166
The quantum levels at the lake
are skyrocketing.

134
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,166
Check last month's volume data.

135
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,041
There's been no rain for months,

136
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,791
and yet the lake's swelled
to five times its normal size.

137
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,583
That's impossible.

138
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,791
My suspicion is that a Harvest
Beast is hiding in the water.

139
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,125
All right then...

140
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,375
Vectors merge immediately
with Sirius as the head.

141
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,916
Roger!

142
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,375
I've got to get away...
before everyone suffers.

143
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,416
Aquarion!

144
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,500
What the--?!

145
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,541
What's wrong...? We can't merge.

146
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,125
What just happened?

147
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,666
Oh no.

148
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,500
Their merge shields
are completely disabled.

149
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,583
Forgive me.

150
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,958
It's so cold.

151
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,000
What...? Hold on...

152
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:45,875
I just checked
your cabin readings,

153
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,958
the temperature hasn't changed!

154
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,000
Sooooo, I wonder
what that's about...?

155
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,458
Hey Silvia, maybe
you're just cold hearted?

156
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,666
Shut your face!

157
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,208
You're looking much warmer now.

158
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,208
I'm not kidding.

159
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,666
It feels like I'm
freezing to death in here.

160
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,875
Can't... move...

161
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,375
I'm showing operational
systems failure

162
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,916
from all three Vectors sir...

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,583
They've lost control.

164
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,833
Well then shut up and fix it...!

165
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,458
We don't know how long
they can last down there!

166
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,750
My body is
completely immobilized.

167
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,750
They're in serious
danger Commander...

168
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,291
Please... you must
order a change.

169
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,500
We can't...

170
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,166
Their teleporters are
completely disabled.

171
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,291
What's the cause?!

172
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,125
It's unknown.

173
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,541
That scent?

174
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,125
The breeze must
have carried it off...

175
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,416
She's close.

176
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,000
Reika!

177
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,583
What the hell are
you doing out here?

178
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,166
Reika?

179
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,875
What's she doing?
What's going on?

180
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,083
Amazing.

181
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,291
You mean to tell me
that she's responsible

182
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,458
for this terrible mess we're in?

183
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,666
I'm so sorry...

184
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,208
I wanted to protect
you all from this.

185
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,541
I think there's something
at the bottom of that lake...

186
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,083
No...

187
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,416
Any effort from me will
only make things worse...

188
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,166
Get out of here Reika and
take your curse with you.

189
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,416
Forgive me!

190
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,333
Rieka!

191
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,375
Holy crap!

192
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,416
Look, there she is!

193
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,291
She's okay!

194
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,916
This is my bad luck again.

195
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,250
You call this bad luck...?
This is called life.

196
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,166
Life gets tough,
so you have to get tougher.

197
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,291
No, you're wrong.

198
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,041
You're all so blind...

199
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,541
It's my bad luck that's holding
you now, but you can't see it.

200
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,041
All right, fine...

201
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,916
You got a choice;
hold on to your shame...

202
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,625
Or find the courage to
face your fate head on!

203
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,000
My fate is inescapable.

204
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,041
So let's see just how
doomed I really am!

205
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,166
Sirius.

206
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,500
Sirius...

207
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,625
I'll come for you...
just hang on.

208
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,125
The lake now appears
to be changing its form.

209
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,583
It's doing what?

210
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,333
Quantum levels are
on the rise again...!

211
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,666
They've more than tripled!

212
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,250
I can move.

213
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,125
Those poor children...

214
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,916
They were crying
out to us for help.

215
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,666
They're still alive!

216
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,291
Reika!

217
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,208
Feelin' lucky yet...?

218
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,750
You call the shots now!

219
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,625
Okay, but consider
yourself warned.

220
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,666
That's the spirit...!

221
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,208
What's our plan?

222
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,250
The whole lake
has been possessed

223
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,666
by the harvest beast...

224
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,000
It's swallowing people,

225
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,250
then draining their
life force to serve its own.

226
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,625
It ate us?

227
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,333
I guess that means we're
stuck inside its belly, huh?

228
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,625
Well let's chew our way out.

229
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,750
Good idea.

230
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,833
Where's my brother?

231
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,958
Don't worry Silvia...

232
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,875
I'm not letting him go.

233
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,041
Reika.

234
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,041
There's not much time!

235
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,500
Look... The whole
lake's floating away.

236
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,500
I know...

237
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,416
We've gotta get
them out of there

238
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,250
before they're
gone for good!

239
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,666
Reika's quantum
levels are climbing...

240
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,416
Rapidly.

241
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,250
Her successful merge rate
is only 17.2 percent...

242
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,416
We can't risk a mistake!

243
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,000
The old pond is full, Reika.

244
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,041
Merge One!

245
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,208
Merge two.

246
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,208
Go Aquarion!

247
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
Reika?

248
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,916
This is so creepy!

249
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,458
Now transform all my fear, and
shame into Aquarion's power!

250
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,791
Reika.

251
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,083
I had no idea
you hurt so deeply.

252
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,708
Aquarion... Strike!

253
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,375
You've hit rock bottom...
now breakthrough!

254
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,791
Right! Let's Go!

255
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,250
It's time I foughtt back!

256
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,625
Unlucky Bottom Attack!

257
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,041
Good work.

258
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,416
 Smells like victory.

259
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,166
Thank you so much...
Both of you.

260
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,250
Sure...

261
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,541
I'm just relieved
everyone was able

262
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,666
to make it through unharmed.

263
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,500
My brother... He's okay.

264
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,916
You should talk to him,

265
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,791
let him know that you
were able to merge again...

266
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,375
He'll be happier than
anyone to hear that.

267
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,625
Ya.

268
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,666
Glen?!

269
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,208
Tell me what happened to Glen.

270
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,125
Just give me a second.

271
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,583
He's been transferred to the New
United Nations Medical Center,

272
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,375
and right now his condition
appears to be unknown.

273
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,041
But Silvia...

274
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,958
I feel awkward
doing the preview.

275
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,291
Well don't...

276
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,750
You know everything you
do is executed flawlessly.

277
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,458
You think so?

278
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,666
Of course...

279
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,083
Next time on Aquarion:
"The Time of Amber."

280
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:16,916
Don't forget...

281
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,958
We'll merge next time too.
