1
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,500
Baron, no...

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,000
Baron!

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,791
Apollo, look out for
the little ones for me!

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,208
Baron!

5
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,458
Baron... Why was
I dreaming about him?

6
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you alright, Silvia...?

7
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,583
It's late for you to be up.

8
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,125
I'm sorry to
bother you, Sophia...

9
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,250
I can't sleep...

10
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,125
I had a really strange dream.

11
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,375
Tell me about it.

12
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,208
Um, well... You see...

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:51,666
In my dream I saw
everything like I was Apollo.

14
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,791
That's interesting...

15
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,083
You're sure it was Apollo?

16
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
I think...

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,250
...I was walking in a forest...
and I was all alone.

18
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,625
Everything was dark.

19
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:10,958
And it was cold...
And then it began to snow.

20
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,458
Here!

21
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,041
Go ahead. Eat up...

22
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,375
I know it's not much,

23
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,333
but we gotta eat what we
can to survive, you know.

24
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,791
Are you kidding me...

25
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
How is he not freezing.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,083
It's like he's from the sun...

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,583
Hey, I finally decided
on a name for ya!

28
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,166
A name?

29
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,583
Well as of today kid,
your name is Apollo...

30
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,500
Just like the mythological
god of the sun!

31
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:53,375
A- a... po... lo.

32
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,833
Apollo. Apollo!

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,333
I see...

34
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,666
So in the dream,
Baron was there...

35
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,416
And he gave you the name Apollo?

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,625
Ya, And then I was
sitting there with everyone...

37
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,333
Baron and all the others...

38
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,625
...and I knew their
names somehow...

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,291
I knew them.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,666
And we were all
sharing food, like a family.

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,750
I don't know how
to explain it...

42
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,041
It felt like... home.

43
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,750
You felt very close to
these people, didn't you?

44
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:34,791
Ya... But then suddenly,
from nowhere, he was there.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,416
It was that monster, Toma.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,666
Forgive me... Master Johannes.

47
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,625
I regret that I was
unable to retrieve

48
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,750
the feather sealed in amber.

49
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,416
Are you telling me you
weren't able to learn

50
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,083
what information
the feather contained?

51
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,625
I'm sorry to say it,
but I learned nothing...

52
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,541
You aren't quite living
up to your name.

53
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,583
What is it they call you...
"Exalted Angel"...?

54
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,333
Your affection for that traitor
has made you weak, Toma...

55
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,208
No doubt that is why you
failed to retrieve the feather.

56
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,166
No...! Master Toma
would never hold on

57
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,708
to such foolish feelings.

58
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,958
Then why exactly has
he adorned a helmet

59
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,166
with the feathers of that
cursed traitor Apollonius...

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,750
And why is it that he carries
it with him wherever he goes?

61
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,333
Twelve thousand years ago,
Apollonius was chosen

62
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,250
for the sacred act
that would ensure

63
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,833
the continuation of our kind...

64
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,375
But he betrayed us,
me most of all.

65
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,541
I carry the helmet
as a reminder of this

66
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,041
and of my own foolishness.

67
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,458
Well... It sounds
to me a bit like

68
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,875
you haven't quite let
go of those old feelings.

69
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,625
We'll leave it
at that, Moroha...

70
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,416
More importantly, we need to
know if Solar Wing's powers

71
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,166
are developing to the strength
of his previous incarnation.

72
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,791
Master, from what
I have observed,

73
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,125
his powers are still
far from what they were

74
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,750
when he fell from our grace
twelve thousand years ago...

75
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,083
Though he has not yet
come fully back to himself,

76
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,833
he has begun exhibiting powers
that even we do not possess...

77
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,125
It is imperative that Solar Wing
regain sufficient power

78
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,166
to pollinate the Tree of Life...

79
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,250
If he is unable to
join with the Tree

80
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,375
and create the fruit that
will bring forth a new world,

81
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,875
then we have no
further use for him.

82
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,666
There are some things which
are beyond our control...

83
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,375
If Solar Wing
proves useless to us

84
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,833
then I will see to his
destruction personally.

85
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,916
After Toma appeared in my dream,

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,041
time began to
jump around, like...

87
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,250
like I was reliving my life and
someone else's at the same time.

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,166
It was twelve thousand years ago

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,625
when my beloved
Apollonius left me...

90
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,458
He wasn't the only one
I remembered losing.

91
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,375
When I was young...
my mother left.

92
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,958
And then my father. And now...

93
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:25,125
And now Baron's gone too
because they took him from me.

94
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,875
Silvia, these feelings
aren't yours alone...

95
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,750
They're his too... Apollo's.

96
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,458
How is that possible?

97
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,666
He's dealing with the loss

98
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
of someone incredibly
important to him...

99
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,791
And it's tearing him up.

100
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,833
Ya I know.

101
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,541
I think his sadness was so great

102
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,833
that it somehow invaded your
heart and entered your dreams...

103
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,000
So what you're feeling right
now are not just your emotions,

104
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,666
but Apollo's as well.

105
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,375
You're saying Apollo's
feelings are inside me?

106
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,916
That's so gross...!
You can't be serious.

107
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,541
Wings huh?

108
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,916
He remembers...

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,958
Something from his past life.

110
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,416
Apollo has memories
of being Solar Wing.

111
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,583
Look, that's not what I said?

112
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,458
You didn't have to.

113
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,125
He touched the feather that was
embedded in amber, didn't he...?

114
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,166
When you two snuck into
the laboratory that day.

115
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,291
Yes...

116
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:10,916
He touched it... and then we...
started seeing things...

117
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,291
We shared visions
of their past...

118
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:27,208
We saw their memories...
Apollonius... and Seliane.

119
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,708
I see...

120
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,750
Silvia, I'm sure you're telling
the truth about all this,

121
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,625
but I'm afraid we can't
just assume that what you

122
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,000
and Apollo saw were really
memories of past lives...

123
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,125
There are too many
other explanations.

124
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
But?

125
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,708
I'm sorry to tell you...

126
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,416
A memory's a strange thing...

127
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,333
And it isn't always
that accurate.

128
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,458
It's possible that your minds
have created false memories,

129
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,041
drawing them from
everything you've heard about

130
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,083
the Book of Holy Genesis
since you came to DEAVA.

131
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,166
I've never heard
of false memories.

132
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,708
Remember, too, that the
feathers of the Shadow Angels

133
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,041
contain many powers
that we don't understand...

134
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,625
It's possible that information
from twelve thousand years ago

135
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,500
was recorded in
that feather somehow...

136
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,333
Perhaps the two of
you managed to access

137
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,458
and read that information,
and then you internalized it.

138
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,125
And there's one more thing
you need to consider, Silvia...

139
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,375
It's possible that,

140
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,291
while you were in the
presence of the feather,

141
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,708
some of your
unconscious memories

142
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,791
were transferred to Apollo...

143
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,750
He could have seen
them... felt them...

144
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,875
...and easily mistaken them
for memories of his own.

145
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,291
What...?

146
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,250
Y- you think Apollo could
have seen my memories...?

147
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,625
No way, that's not possible!

148
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,666
Is it really that unlikely...?

149
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,125
You did just see
Apollo's memories

150
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,708
in your dream, didn't you?

151
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,791
Well, yeah...
but that's different.

152
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,458
Here's what I think.

153
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,250
When you Merge
to become Aquarion,

154
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
you cease to be
three individual people...

155
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,500
The minds and hearts of
each Element start to overlap.

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,291
As a result of this,
I think you're beginning

157
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,125
to share each other's
feelings and memories.

158
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,708
Share feelings with him?!

159
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,916
With my brother, maybe...

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,041
But never with that beast...!

161
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,750
I don't want him wondering
around inside my head!

162
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,625
Oh really... Then why
did the two of you

163
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,166
merge together so well
if you detest him so much?

164
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,833
It feels... so good!

165
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,250
I...

166
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,916
Well, the heart can certainly
be a troublesome thing...

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,541
You'd think it would be easy,
but sometimes the hardest part

168
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,333
is figuring out
how you really feel.

169
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,791
How do I do that...?

170
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,000
Figure it out?

171
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,250
How horrible.

172
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,125
This doesn't look good.

173
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,500
Incoming!

174
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,583
Where is it?!

175
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,291
Something's wrong...

176
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,958
I can't find the target.

177
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,750
Why can't we see it?

178
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,000
I think the enemy

179
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,958
is using an invisibility
shield to hide itself.

180
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,416
So that's their game!

181
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,875
We won't accomplish
anything like this.

182
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,666
We have to Merge
and look for it!

183
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,041
Right!

184
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,250
Aquarion Luna!

185
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,041
I have to stay calm...

186
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,041
That's the only
way I'll find it.

187
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,458
It's there!

188
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,166
Stay calm!

189
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,458
We've got it!

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,250
What the...?!

191
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,916
It was a decoy.

192
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,208
That's enough... We're
running out of options, Jun Lee!

193
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,125
Become the head and use psychic
imaging to find the target!

194
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:27,958
Me as the head?

195
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,875
You've got to be joking!

196
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,416
That's just reckless!

197
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,583
Come on, Jun.

198
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,250
It's time to act like a man!

199
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,833
Yeah... sure.

200
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,333
Go Merge One.

201
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,291
Merge Two!

202
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:42,041
G- Go... Aquarion!

203
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,166
This is incredible!

204
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,208
Aquarion... Mars!

205
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,833
Alright!

206
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,625
Jun...

207
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,625
Stop fooling around,
Aquarion, and find the target!

208
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,791
Roger that.

209
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,500
Searching for an image.

210
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,333
It's close!

211
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,208
You were too slow, Jun...!

212
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,416
You have to act faster!

213
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,500
I have to find it...

214
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,916
Have to find... ...the image.

215
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,708
Jun, no!

216
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,416
He's gotta do better than that.

217
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,291
He's pitiful.

218
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,333
That kid wasn't ready
to be the Head Element.

219
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,125
Enough...!

220
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,833
Silence yourselves and try
to see what you're looking at.

221
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:49,708
Huh?

222
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,875
See what?

223
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,083
You look at him and see nothing

224
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,333
but a fool tripping
all over himself.

225
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,291
Have to find... the image.

226
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,875
But when I look at him, I see
a kid who's scared to death,

227
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,000
who's doing everything he can

228
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,125
to fight an enemy
that he can't see...

229
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,375
And he's doing all this
while coping with the terror

230
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,291
of being the Head Element
for the first time and the fear

231
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,916
of disappointing the people
who are depending on him.

232
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,208
Cant' you see how
hard he's trying for you?!

233
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,916
Commander.

234
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,375
Come on...
you have to find it now.

235
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
Seliane!

236
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,583
Apollonius, I hear you.

237
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,750
Seliane!

238
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,083
Jun...! Reika...! Pierre...!

239
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,041
Respond...
please somebody respond!

240
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,625
Element bioenergy
is fading rapidly...

241
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,958
They're approaching
critical levels...!

242
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,416
Why are you
just sitting there...?

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,291
We gonna give these
guys a real fight, or what?

244
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,833
I think he's awakened.

245
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,416
We're fighting for lost lives!

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,875
Seliane! Come!

247
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,583
What?

248
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,750
What the...

249
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,500
Did you really just say Seliane?

250
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:53,208
He's delusional... that's all...

251
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,625
Has this beast of a boy
remembered a past life?

252
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,041
All right everyone... Let's go!

253
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
Everybody?!

254
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,500
All Elements are instructed
to standby for teleport change!

255
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,208
Genesis Form...

256
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,583
Go! Aquarion!

257
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,958
It's never been
like this before.

258
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,833
They killed Baron, Seliane!

259
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,083
Their time is up... Now!

260
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,375
He mentioned Baron and
Seliane in the same breath...

261
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,333
Apollo's confusing his
past life with the present.

262
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,833
Stay calm, everyone.

263
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,000
We'll only find the enemy if
we quiet our minds and focus.

264
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,541
This from you?

265
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,375
Which one of them is
the real Solar Wing?

266
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,958
I don't know anymore.

267
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,333
Luna Element's emotional
aura is developing a split wave!

268
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,750
I'm reading great confusion!

269
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,208
Silvia, hold on.

270
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,541
This is serious, Seliane.

271
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,625
You have to quiet
your mind, and quickly.

272
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,166
You can shut up now...!

273
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,083
You think you can
order me around?

274
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,500
If you were really the
reincarnation of my dead lover,

275
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,458
you'd be nicer to me.

276
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,083
So who are you...?

277
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,208
Tell me now!

278
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:50,041
You know who I am.

279
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,125
What's happening to Aquarion?

280
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,250
Vector Sol has disappeared!

281
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,125
Where's Apollo? He's Gone!

282
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,208
He's disappeared?

283
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,916
He's disappeared... He's gone.

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,833
What's going on?

285
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,875
Where are you, Apollo?

286
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,666
Using the Mystic Veil was an
excellent idea, Master Toma...

287
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,625
We can see if Solar Wing
enjoys being invisible...

288
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,041
I wonder what those fools will
do when they think he's gone.

289
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,125
One of the greatest faults
of the wingless ones

290
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,708
is that they trust only what
they can see...

291
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,250
This should be interesting,

292
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,625
watching them fall
pathetically apart.

293
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,500
Where are you?
Answer me... Damn it!

294
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,458
Is it possible...?

295
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,916
Could he be dead?

296
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,125
He's there...

297
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,500
If anything had
happened to Apollo,

298
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,125
the whole Merge would have
fallen apart right away.

299
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,833
I can sense an unseen force...

300
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,208
And with it, an unseen heart.

301
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,666
Apollo...! This is not cute!

302
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,750
Apollo.

303
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,666
Baron!

304
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:10,500
No...! Baron...! No!

305
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,625
What...?

306
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,333
Calm down now, Silvia!

307
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,166
Come on now,
this is no time to panic!

308
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,833
Just get away, Brother...!

309
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,125
You don't know what I'm feeling!

310
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,333
What?

311
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,791
What's... happening?

312
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,208
Silvia.

313
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,916
Forgive me... I don't...

314
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm sorry!

315
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,083
Silvia... Sister.

316
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,750
What's happening to me?

317
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,958
You think it would be easy,
Silvia, but sometimes

318
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,375
the hardest part is figuring
out how you really feel.

319
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,333
No!

320
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,666
How did this happen...?

321
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,125
It's Apollo...

322
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,916
It was always Apollo...
and now he's gone.

323
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,375
What's going on...?

324
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,125
It looks like some kind of
storm's surrounding Silvia.

325
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,958
Silvia's pulse and blood
pressure are rising too rapidly!

326
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,875
If it continues like this,
she could be in danger!

327
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,625
I see it now...
Why couldn't I before?

328
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,750
Where are you?

329
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,583
So she finally figured it out.

330
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,750
Let's take care of this, Silvia.

331
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,250
You got it.

332
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,125
It's been there, hiding
in the shadows all along.

333
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,708
The trick... is knowing
where to look.

334
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,458
Apollo... This is for you.

335
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,625
Thank you... Silvia.

336
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,500
As far as I'm concerned,
the people who talk about

337
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,333
how sweet love is don't
know how bitter it can be...

338
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,583
It's better to Merge...

339
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,875
That way, if anyone hurts you,

340
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,125
you can just give
them a Fire Kick!

341
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,291
