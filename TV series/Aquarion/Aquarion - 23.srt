1
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,208
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,083
Something human beings
must never run out of.

3
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,000
What? Like food?

4
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,500
Food for the soul...
It means "dreams."

5
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,250
I'm pretty sure
you can't eat dreams.

6
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,041
Without them,
life is meaningless

7
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,291
and our minds and
spirits would starve.

8
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,375
If you say so.

9
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,916
It's the truth...

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,625
But it isn't always
easy for humans

11
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,958
to hold onto their dreams...

12
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,291
Combine the symbols
for person and dreams.

13
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,125
Can you read it?

14
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,291
No, not really.

15
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,333
It means "fleeting."

16
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,208
Your life is temporary.

17
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,208
As is the life of Sirius.

18
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,666
Take a look at your hand.

19
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,916
The decision to grasp your
dreams or let them slip away

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,125
rests within the
strength of that hand.

21
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,208
Silvia... and the
rest of you as well.

22
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,708
Behold what humans did to Angels

23
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,208
and what you've done to
those you called friends!

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,791
Is that...?

25
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,708
It's Glen!

26
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,000
You were brave
to volunteer, Glen.

27
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,333
With your help,

28
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,500
humanity can finally
defeat the Shadow Angels.

29
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,166
Indeed my boy.

30
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,041
The Shadow Angel
feather will increase

31
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:20,458
your physical abilities
to unprecedented levels.

32
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,541
It seems the feather
is causing him

33
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,333
to experience some kind
of sensory overload...

34
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,458
Perhaps the Shadow
Angel physiology

35
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,250
is more incompatible
than we presumed.

36
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,833
I'm afraid we've failed.

37
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:59,000
No... All we have to do is numb
his physical response to pain.

38
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,958
You have nothing
to worry about, Glen...

39
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,458
You're going to be fine...

40
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,000
Just leave everything to us.

41
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,208
Glen!

42
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,708
You mean that's...

43
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,916
But he... he has feathers!

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,125
They wouldn't!

45
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,833
They transplanted...
the feathers of the child.

46
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,208
That's so cruel.

47
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,750
It's hardly cruel...

48
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,333
The Shadow Angel feather has
enhanced his physical abilities

49
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,791
to a level beyond
any other human's.

50
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,208
Which is how he's able

51
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,250
to pilot the Assault-Type
Aquarion single-handedly.

52
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,750
A solitary arrow...

53
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,750
Sirius, I'm begging you...

54
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,833
Please don't fight with Glen;
the two of you are friends.

55
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,708
Dammit, stop! This is nuts!

56
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,708
That was unbelievable.

57
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,500
No ordinary human could have
that much control over Aquarion.

58
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,916
So you want feathers,
too... Is that it?!

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,916
No, that's not what I...

60
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,000
Please, Glen. Sirius, no!

61
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,416
Have to say I'm
disappointed in you.

62
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,333
To attack me with
such a crude weapon.

63
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,416
Where's your sense of elegance?

64
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,791
Separation!

65
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
They merged in
two point two seconds!

66
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,375
How is that even possible?

67
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,750
He's not human...

68
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,666
That feather
replaced his humanity.

69
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,458
This isn't the answer.

70
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,291
You don't have to do this...

71
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,625
Please just stop.

72
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,500
Can't you two remember
that we were friends...?!

73
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,791
We were friends!

74
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,333
Stop this now!

75
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,958
They what?

76
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,041
They've taken the
feather of the child...

77
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,375
Futaba...

78
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,666
They've turned it into a
weapon... to use against us...

79
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,708
Why must they corrupt the
memory of his innocence?

80
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,083
Incredible!

81
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,541
He's unstoppable...!

82
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,208
If we had ten more of these,
victory would be assured!

83
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,208
A solitary arrow
is easily snapped...

84
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,416
It doesn't matter
how many we have...

85
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,958
We'll never win as long
as mankind remains selfish.

86
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,458
I've detected Cherubim Mars!

87
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,875
What?!

88
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,750
It's Sirius, he's alive!

89
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,000
Silvia...

90
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,750
Brother, is that you?

91
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,083
Do you understand now,
just how ugly humans can be?

92
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,416
Look what they've
done to Glen...

93
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,958
Life means nothing to them.

94
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,833
They're willing
to sacrifice their own

95
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,041
for the sake of a
meaningless victory.

96
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,583
And to DEAVA, those of us with
feathers, like you and me...

97
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,291
We're an aberration to them.

98
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,916
Brother, stop this please.

99
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,958
Forget them...

100
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,541
Come to me, Silvia.

101
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,166
I'm sorry, I can't.

102
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,458
Brother, be careful!

103
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,708
Who are you talking to?

104
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,250
Silvia!

105
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,666
Sirius!

106
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,375
Silvia!

107
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,333
Where am I...?

108
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,083
Why are you doing this?

109
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,166
Sirius!

110
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,583
Silvia teleported aboard the
second Assault-Type Vector!

111
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,500
She did what?!

112
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,708
Vector Alpha, come in!

113
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,583
Come in Glen, do you read me?

114
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,375
Don't let Silvia go to him!

115
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,791
Just stop her at all costs,
shoot her down if you must!

116
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,708
Roger.

117
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,250
Brother!

118
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,375
Silvia!

119
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,083
Are you certain he will be able

120
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,208
to bring the one
he calls sister?

121
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,041
Of course he will...

122
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,583
They are two wings
of the same blood...

123
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,041
The two are as one...

124
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,000
They will overcome
all obstacles to reunite.

125
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:18,791
And once they've done so,
no power can stop them.

126
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,416
Oh no, Glen!

127
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,250
Direct hit to
Assault-Type Vector...

128
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,583
Maximum damage!

129
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,666
Propulsion system disabled!

130
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,958
The unmanned Vector has
been completely incapacitated!

131
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,083
Glen's vital signs are stable.

132
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,250
But how?!

133
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,750
How could he be
so easily defeated?!

134
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:43,000
As I've said; one arrow
on its own is easily broken.

135
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,041
Then how can we stop him?

136
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,291
Why must you look to
others for the answer.

137
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,000
Those who can ask the question
already have the answer within.

138
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,125
I couldn't have said it better.

139
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,916
Join me, Silvia.

140
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,625
Oh, brother...
come back to me...

141
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,750
Silvia!

142
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,083
Vector Sol's third emotional
aura increasing rapidly!

143
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,625
His Power Crystal is
emitting a heavy resonance!.

144
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,333
It's repairing itself
using emergency power!

145
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,958
Silvia! No!

146
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,958
But...

147
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:22,791
Dammit, Silvia!

148
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,708
Stay her and merge with me!

149
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,458
I won't let you go!

150
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,000
Override failsafe!

151
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,708
Go, Aquarion!

152
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,375
Where is this
power coming from?!

153
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,000
No!

154
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,625
Silvia, come back!

155
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,166
I feel it... I'm in control...

156
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,875
Aquarion... Angel!

157
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,833
He's insane!

158
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,250
He's actually merged
with Vector Omega...

159
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,708
Damn you, Wingless Ones...

160
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
Release Silvia now!

161
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,208
Once more... Rejuvenation Merge!

162
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,625
Cherubim Mars!

163
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,375
How the hell?!

164
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,125
He somehow retrieved
another Cherubim Soldier!

165
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,291
Silvia, listen.

166
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,666
Are you really capable of
fighting your own brother...?

167
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,291
Have you forgotten who I am?

168
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,708
Brother, please.

169
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,833
Join me...
Come stand by my side.

170
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,291
It's your destiny...

171
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,625
Silvia!

172
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,791
You don't have
to listen to him!

173
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,750
Apollo.

174
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,333
Sirius, stop!

175
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,541
If you really love Silvia,

176
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,041
then why are you
making her suffer like this?

177
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,250
Come back to us,
we'll always be your friends.

178
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,416
Yes, we will.

179
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,083
Don't believe them, Silvia!

180
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,708
I won't let you
fall for their lies!

181
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,708
 Silvia!

182
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,791
What is that?

183
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
Are those feathers?

184
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,416
It can't be.

185
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,541
What the...? Are those...

186
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,416
What's going on,
they have wings?

187
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,333
Do you think
they're Shadow Angels?

188
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,958
You mean Silvia was a
Shadow Angel all this time?

189
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,250
They both were, her and Sirius.

190
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,625
But they can't be...

191
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,000
Why didn't anybody tell me

192
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,500
we had Shadow Angels
working for us?!

193
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,291
Maybe you should pay attention

194
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,458
to something
other than yourself.

195
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,250
Were the feathers
grafted onto them

196
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,083
the same way they did with Glen?

197
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
They wore wristbands...

198
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,375
They always wore wristbands in
order to hide the wings from us!

199
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,416
What? You're saying
they were born that way?

200
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:04,083
If birth determines who we are,
then why do we dream?!

201
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,083
We are not the
products of chance;

202
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,458
we have the power
to overcome fate...

203
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:14,000
That's the purpose of dreams,
to shape our own destinies!

204
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,750
Silvia... I'm the only
real family you have

205
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,083
left in this world

206
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,625
and you can't live without
the ones who love you...

207
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,458
We're bound to each other,
meant to be together...

208
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,541
With our wings united,
think of the possibilities...

209
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,416
...how high we can fly!

210
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,208
With our wings united...

211
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,458
Silvia... Hey, Silvia...!

212
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,875
Amazon, snap out of it!

213
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,458
Listen, my sister.

214
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,833
You know you're
meant to be with me...

215
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,583
Just take me by the hand...

216
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,291
Join me and we'll fly together.

217
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,291
Silvia!

218
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,416
He wants to fly so he can
look down on the rest of us.

219
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,041
Sirius only cares about himself;
do not sink to his level!

220
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,125
Don't presume to know what
motivates someone like me,

221
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,625
you filthy wretch...

222
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,250
Interesting choice
of words, though.

223
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,166
Especially for a
pitiful Wingless One

224
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,958
who's incapable of flight.

225
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,833
Maybe I don't have wings,
and maybe I can't fly...

226
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,666
But you know what?

227
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,291
I do hold on to my dreams!

228
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,708
I knew you were stupid, Apollo,

229
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,541
but even so, I'm amazed
that you could be so naïve...

230
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,125
Yes... You've been listening

231
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,458
to Commander Fudo
again, haven't you?

232
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,833
A simple mongrel like you
grasping for your dreams...?

233
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,666
What lies you'll fall for.

234
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,208
Silvia, take my hand...

235
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,125
What is it,
what's wrong, Silvia?

236
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,250
I understand now...

237
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,833
Silvia?

238
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,250
And I know...
that... that this hand...

239
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:30,500
This other hand belongs to me...
It will always belong to me...

240
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
And to the one who understands

241
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,750
that I have to follow
my own dreams...

242
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,833
Silvia!

243
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Is this, what you really want?

244
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,041
Yes, it is...

245
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,541
I don't need to fly,
but I need this.

246
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,541
And I need you.

247
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,500
Do you know the
pain you cause...?

248
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,125
How this feels?

249
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,291
To be rejected by the
only person you love?

250
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,791
Your only family?

251
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,083
I'm sorry, Brother.

252
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,708
The source of this
anguish must suffer as well.

253
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,791
Reika, look out!

254
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,458
Apollo, Reika! I need your help!

255
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,333
I'm here!

256
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,041
But... are you sure?

257
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,708
Yes, I'm sure...

258
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,791
This isn't about fighting him,
it's about the team...

259
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,833
We have to bring him back!

260
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,166
Yes!

261
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
Then let's bring him back.

262
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,375
Three as one!

263
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,291
Angel Sword!

264
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,708
Too easy!

265
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,500
He deflected it!

266
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,333
No, this is my chance.

267
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,916
Silvia!

268
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,666
How could you do this to me?

269
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,500
Well done... Sister.

270
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Thank you for helping me.

271
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,958
Thank you.

272
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,666
Vector Mars has retreated.

273
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,333
Retrieve Glen and salvage the
Military Assault-Type Vectors...

274
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,750
Begin repairs immediately!

275
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,041
And call the others...

276
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,958
I want all three of
them back here right now!

277
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,291
Yes sir.

278
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,083
What type of automation is this?

279
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,708
Is that...

280
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,875
That looks like
one of the feathers

281
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,958
from the Shadow Angel child!

282
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,208
So often... people make what
they believe is the right choice

283
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,416
but righteous intentions
can easily lead

284
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,791
to a foolish decision.

285
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,875
That is the sorrow...
of being human.

286
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,208
And tell me, my friend...
was your loved one well?

287
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,625
Yes... Yes, she was...

288
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,500
She's almost ready to join us...

289
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm glad to hear that.

290
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,291
Once she does,

291
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:23,166
you and I will finally be
able to stand side by side.

292
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,041
Yes.

293
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,250
Um, uh, Reika?

294
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,166
I was wondering if I might
be able to ask you a favor?

295
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,041
Sure, what is it?

296
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:10,916
Uh...

297
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,666
Will you give me your button?

298
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,583
What are you talking about?!

299
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,791
Next on Aquarion:
"Heaven's Gate."

300
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,041
So... what are
you gonna use it for?
