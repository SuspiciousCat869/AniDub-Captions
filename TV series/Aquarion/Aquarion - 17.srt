1
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,500
I'd give anything to
have a waist like yours.

2
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,916
It's tiny.

3
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,291
Oh, it's not that small.

4
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,250
In fact, lately I've been
gaining some weight.

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,541
I'm up two pounds
since yesterday.

6
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,916
What? You mean you
actually weigh yourself?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,041
I'm too scared. I'd just die!

8
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,833
Tsugumi, weight control
is an important part

9
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,208
of our training.

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,750
We have to stay aware of
every aspect of our bodies.

11
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,416
If we gain too much weight,

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
it will affect our
ability to Merge.

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,750
It could even cost us our lives!

14
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,833
We could die?

15
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,750
Ah, finally; I'm starving.

16
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,458
What's wrong?

17
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,916
That can't really be all that
you guys are gonna eat.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,458
We- we're trying to eat light

19
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,041
because Reika said we
could die if we gain weight.

20
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,958
We could die?!

21
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,916
Well no...

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,416
I just meant that
we might want to be

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
kind of careful about our
weight because of Aquarion...

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,458
We don't want to
risk throwing off

25
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,166
the equilibrium of the Merge.

26
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
Well alright, but isn't dieting
too much supposed

27
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,125
to be bad for you?

28
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,416
Look at that.

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,083
You know you wanna eat some...

30
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,083
Come on now,
what are you gonna do?

31
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,000
Just sit there and
starve yourselves?

32
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,958
Oh wow.

33
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,083
This is really good!

34
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,375
Now what's this...?

35
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
A princess putting on weight...

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,833
It seems she has
almost no self-control ...

37
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
What do you suppose her brother

38
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,500
will think about such
over-indulgence?

39
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,291
Disgusting.

40
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,333
No, wait!

41
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,708
Come back, Brother.

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,458
Don't leave me!

43
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,208
Thank you.

44
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,666
You feeling okay?

45
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,666
Normally you inhale your food.

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,125
The diet begins today.

47
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,791
I happen to think women are
cuter with some meat on them,

48
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,333
I don't know about you two.

49
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,750
They won't listen.

50
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,125
They've got their own
ideas about beauty.

51
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,666
Even so, they're going
about this all wrong.

52
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,083
Exercising constantly

53
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,583
and starving themselves
isn't going to help at all...

54
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,750
All they're going to do

55
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,750
is put unnecessary
stress on their bodies.

56
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,916
This isn't going to make
it easier for them to Merge.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,041
If anything, it will just
make it more difficult.

58
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,708
Tortes, cupcakes, cookies.

59
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,291
It all looks so good,
and I'm so hungry.

60
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,541
One bite couldn't hurt.

61
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,333
Hold it!

62
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,708
We can't just give in now!

63
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,208
Reika...

64
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,458
We've done so well today,
don't we deserve a reward...?

65
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,500
Come on... we'll just
take one bite each,

66
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,666
and not tell anybody.

67
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,291
No... we're not undoing
all our hard work.

68
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,291
Drop it!

69
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,416
It's so good!

70
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,041
The wingless ones
are just revolting...

71
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,083
Look at them, they use
their sacred mouths

72
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,458
for eating while awake,

73
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,041
and can't even contain
themselves in their dreams.

74
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,166
That is the curse
of the wingless ones,

75
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,958
Child Angel Futaba...

76
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,625
From the time
they are born until

77
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,000
the end of their
wretched little lives,

78
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,333
they must gorge themselves...

79
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,291
They must take the lives
of all other creatures

80
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,625
in order to
sustain themselves...

81
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,833
And they are never
full, never sated.

82
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,500
How stupid are they
that they don't know

83
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,458
that the mouth is sacred
and meant only for breathing

84
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,916
and singing the
songs of the stars?

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,791
Disgusting.

86
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,916
No, brother.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,250
I don't want to eat anymore!

88
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,208
No, make it go away!

89
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,125
Make the food go away!

90
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,083
Very well, wingless
gluttons. I will!

91
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,833
What the-

92
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,333
Got it!

93
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,333
My food!

94
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,875
Nooooooo!

95
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,291
Local teams reported that
all food has disappeared.

96
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,791
Reserves are depleted.

97
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,166
Teams are reporting
from the city sector...

98
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,833
All the food's gone...

99
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,208
It has disappeared from every
household and grocery store...

100
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,375
All of the crops have
withered and all the livestock

101
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,041
has been wiped out,
down to the last cow...

102
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,791
There is absolutely
no food to be found

103
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,875
within a fifty-mile radius.

104
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,875
I have a report from the
scientific investigative unit...

105
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,208
It seems microscopic
holes were opened

106
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,583
in all of the food packaging,
allowing bacteria-like

107
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,875
microorganisms to enter
and break down the food.

108
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,958
There was no way to
detect their presence.

109
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,458
What...?!

110
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,083
Are you suggesting there are
microscopic harvest beasts?

111
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,458
Is it true?

112
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,833
It's all my fault
that this happened...

113
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,083
I was just so worried
about how much I weighed,

114
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,250
and in my dream I asked
for all the food to disappear.

115
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,166
What now?

116
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,375
No one panic...

117
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,416
Have a reconnaissance unit
start searching for plants

118
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,708
and small animals in
the vicinity of the base.

119
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,125
Don't bother.

120
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,916
Just before dawn,
all the animals disappeared

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,416
from the area around
the base, even rats...

122
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,666
You can look for plants,

123
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,375
but all the edible ones
have withered and died.

124
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,500
The beasts have
left us with nothing.

125
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,666
We're receiving a
message from Command...

126
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,708
The provisions supply
unit is being attacked

127
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,583
by a harvest beast!

128
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,083
Mayday! Mayday!

129
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,791
 Oh no!

130
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,791
Our last chance.

131
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,250
All the food is gone.

132
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,416
I'm so hungry I think I'm
starting to see things...

133
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,041
This morning my little stuffed
piglet looked like a pork chop.

134
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,625
We have to stay strong or
the Shadow Angels win...

135
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,625
We can just think of it
as a part of our diet.

136
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,208
Tsugumi, how much
weight have you lost so far?

137
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,458
Nothing...

138
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,958
I've been so hungry
and I feel so empty...

139
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,625
So I've been drinking water.

140
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,666
What...?

141
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,666
You mean all that is just water?

142
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,541
I just can't take this anymore!

143
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,500
My stomach keeps getting bigger
but my chest is shrinking!

144
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,208
If I'd known we'd gain
weight by not eating,

145
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,708
I wouldn't have started
that diet in the first place!

146
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,250
I know.

147
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
Hungry!

148
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,125
When I woke up this
morning I realized

149
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,041
that I was chewing on my pillow.

150
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,375
So hungry I nearly
ate it anyway.

151
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,916
Quit whining.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,916
You think that we
have it bad here,

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,125
but there are many
people doing worse...

154
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,750
The young and healthy will
survive this the longest.

155
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,541
I know.

156
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,250
Idiot!

157
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,708
What the hell are you doing?

158
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,791
What...

159
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,416
A guy still gotta
eat doesn't he.

160
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
Not feet!

161
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,750
Prepare to attack!

162
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,416
Attack who?

163
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,583
Please excuse my boldness,
Commander,

164
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,666
but the harvest beasts

165
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,625
destroying our food
are microscopic...

166
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,125
How are we supposed to find,
let alone attack them?

167
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,208
I'm afraid you'll have to answer
that question on your own.

168
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,125
On our own?

169
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,750
Who are you gonna send?

170
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,833
Let us go, Commander!

171
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,625
Can you handle this?

172
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,500
We can do it...

173
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,375
Let us go.

174
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,166
Yes, please...

175
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,666
We want to fight!

176
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,666
Please sir, just let us
get our food back!

177
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,500
Area B 17...

178
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,083
I can detect no heat signatures.

179
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,208
Searching Area C Thirteen...

180
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,708
I'm getting nothing here.

181
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,583
Damn it, this is
just pointless...

182
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,250
The stupid things are too
small to detect with infrared...

183
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,375
Let's just Merge so
we can find them, now!

184
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,708
We're going to Merge?

185
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,625
That's right!

186
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,041
We don't have a choice...

187
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,291
If you two are ready
to begin the Merge...

188
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,375
Let's win our food back!

189
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,333
Merge One!

190
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,458
Merge Two!

191
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,250
Go... Aquarion!

192
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,958
Oh, wow!

193
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,916
I'm so hungry!

194
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,833
Aquarion... Luna!

195
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:20,666
Now let's go! Aquarion!

196
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,375
How did this happen?

197
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,708
Luna Element's thought

198
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,458
and motor functions
appear to be disconnecting.

199
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,125
That's only natural...

200
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,708
Blood sugar levels down...

201
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,583
Metabolism's down to the point
where thought almost stops.

202
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,583
Silvia!

203
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,958
I'm sorry... so hungry
I can barely move.

204
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,125
Silvia, I know...
I'm fading too.

205
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,583
Stop them...!

206
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,291
Their bodies can't
take much more of this.

207
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,000
They feel hunger because
they think they need to eat.

208
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,541
Commander...

209
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,708
Forgive me but is it really
time for a philosophy lesson?

210
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,875
Emptiness and hunger
are not the same thing.

211
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,791
It is through emptiness
that we find strength.

212
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,791
You must harness
that emptiness and fight!

213
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,791
Huh?

214
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,750
We can't.

215
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,125
I'm just so hungry!

216
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,583
What does he mean,
"harness the emptiness"...?

217
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,750
How do you harness
what isn't there...?

218
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,958
I've got it... That's
how we catch them.

219
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,000
That's it...

220
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,208
When you fast,
the emptiness causes

221
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,583
the rest of your senses
to become sharper.

222
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,541
We can use hunger
to our advantage.

223
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,041
What does he mean
sharpened senses?

224
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,291
He means scent...!

225
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,583
That's it... Tell them!

226
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,625
Silvia... Tsugumi... Reika!

227
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,583
Listen to me.

228
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,875
You have to smell them.

229
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,416
You have to track
them down by their scent!

230
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,583
Smell them?

231
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,125
Their scent?

232
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,416
They're too small for any of
our instruments to pick up...

233
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,208
But they didn't just destroy
our food, they ate it...!

234
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,000
They must have left
a trail behind them...

235
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,291
Sniff them out!

236
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,875
All right, Brother.

237
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,333
We'll start sniffing.

238
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,583
Sniffing?

239
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,333
If your gonna pick up
a scent, you need me.

240
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:24,166
Hey?

241
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
Incoming!

242
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,333
What do you think you're doing?

243
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,166
Doing what I do best.

244
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,333
Ah-ha.

245
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,916
Let's get 'em.

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,458
Elements ready for attack!

247
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,708
Go now!

248
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,625
Can we eat now?

249
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,625
What the?

250
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,916
It worked! We got them!

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,333
Now, Solar Wing,
I will have the great pleasure

252
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,916
of watching you
being eaten alive...

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,625
And I promise, I will
enjoy every minute of it.

254
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,208
So Aquarion, is...

255
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,250
...being devoured.

256
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,208
Stop it...!

257
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,583
Please stop...!
I don't taste good.

258
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,250
And so it goes...

259
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,625
We eat to survive...
until we are eaten.

260
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,416
What's happening...?

261
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Are we being eaten alive?

262
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,750
They'll feed on us...

263
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,500
...until we disappear...

264
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,458
...and return... to the earth.

265
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,958
We're all done for.

266
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,500
I can't believe it.

267
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,000
Silence!

268
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,791
I can hear it...

269
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,958
The song of awakening;
the song of new life.

270
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,750
The earth is being replenished.

271
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,250
Listen to its song!

272
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,666
I know that voice...! Rena?

273
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,333
What's that?

274
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,708
Maybe... as Aquarion was eaten,

275
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,500
it's body fed the earth
and brought it to life ...

276
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,375
Now everything is growing again.

277
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
What's that song?

278
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,958
It's Rena.

279
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,041
I think ...

280
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:19,250
I think we Merged...
with the earth.

281
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,541
What's going on?

282
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,708
We won...!

283
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,875
Where are my harvest beasts?

284
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,250
The Tree of Life...

285
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,708
I didn't think this
pathetic reincarnation

286
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,750
of Solar Wing had the power...

287
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,625
Solar Wing...
I'll make him regret this.

288
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,750
Wow!

289
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,916
It's amazing.

290
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,708
It smells wonderful!

291
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,000
Delicious.

292
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,875
How do any of us ever
know who we really are...?

293
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,291
How can we find ourselves

294
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,458
when other people are
always getting in the way...?

295
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,250
I guess we're going
to find out...!

296
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,250
Next on Aquarion:
"Cosplay of the Soul."

297
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,916
You'll never recognize us!

298
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,583
Quiet, Sister.
