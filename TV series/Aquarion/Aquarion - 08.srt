1
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,166
 Hey, Chloe...

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,791
What was it like the other day?

3
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:26,791
Huh?

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,958
Yeah, wasn't it
your first Merge?

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,000
Her first?

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,791
Come on, what was it like?

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,666
Yeah. Chloe, please tell us!

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,416
Ok I heard that
everyone's nervous

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,625
the first time they Merge?

10
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,791
Is that true?

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:40,500
Oh my gosh!

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,083
Was it really amazing?

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:47,083
Well, it was... I don't
know how to describe it.

14
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,458
No, I can't...

15
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,958
Why don't you try
asking Silvia instead?

16
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,458
She's more
experienced than I am.

17
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,916
Really...? It's always
that incredible?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,916
It doesn't matter
who you do it with...?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,916
What if it's Apollo?

20
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:12,250
It's the same, even
with an animal like him.

21
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,791
You know, I don't really
mind not being a pilot.

22
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,250
How can you say that, Jun...?

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,583
You and I are the only
ones who haven't Merged...!

24
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,583
Don't you think
it's embarrassing?

25
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,166
Not really.

26
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,833
It's enough for me just to be
around these amazing machines.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,541
That's all the rush I need.

28
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,041
Hey, idiots!

29
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,625
Get back to work or you'll find
yourself scrubbing the johns!

30
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes sir!

31
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,125
You really want
to go into battle?

32
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,791
Yeah, why not?

33
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,833
Why not...?

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,625
Aquarion's dangerous...

35
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,875
You've seen
those fights before...

36
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,541
You could get hurt, or even die.

37
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,416
I know all that...

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,250
I know it's dangerous.

39
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,166
But still...

40
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,041
Still what?

41
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,041
Well... it's just...

42
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,166
I really want to know what

43
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,083
it would be like to
Merge, that's all.

44
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,041
That's it?

45
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,583
They say that it's the
best feeling in the world.

46
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,541
Hey, Reika.

47
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,166
You want some coffee...?

48
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,000
It's the weak stuff
from the cafeteria,

49
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,791
but still, it's
better than nothing.

50
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,125
I can't...

51
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,333
Everyone's better off
if I just stay by myself.

52
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,041
Oooo!

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,208
You know... it's after curfew.

54
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,666
Reika! I'm sorry I'm late.

55
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,916
It won't happen again!

56
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,625
Reika...

57
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,750
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

58
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,916
'Kay, what is it?

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,291
Well... um... it's just...

60
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,333
What was it like the
first time you Merged?

61
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,416
Were you scared?
Did it feel good?

62
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,208
So that's what
this is all about...

63
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,833
The first time?

64
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,625
Yeah, well,
I heard it feels good.

65
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,708
They grow up so soon!

66
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,041
How do I explain this?

67
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,208
Well... for one thing,

68
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,958
the first time isn't
the same for anyone.

69
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,458
Okay...

70
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,333
But Silvia said it feels great
no matter who you're with.

71
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:36,541
Oh... well...
Silvia said that, did she?

72
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,875
It's important
not to be selfish.

73
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,416
Remember you're not
the only one involved...

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,125
Your feelings
are only part of it.

75
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,125
Right... I'm only part of it...

76
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,375
Gotcha, what else
do I need to know?

77
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,166
Remember the other
people in the Merge.

78
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,833
You have to be
in sync with them.

79
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,125
In sync... I can do that.

80
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,333
Alright...

81
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,333
But it isn't enough
just to remain in sync.

82
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,250
Uh-huh.

83
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,500
Nope...

84
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,583
You have to take control
when the time comes...

85
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,375
You have to be firm.

86
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,750
Firm... Like this?

87
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,541
No, no, no.

88
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,708
You don't quite have it.

89
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,958
See... That's more
like what I meant.

90
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,291
Sometimes your Merge
partners may get carried away.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,000
But you have to remember to
stay in control of yourself.

92
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,208
Okay, but how do you do that?

93
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,625
It's like I told you before.

94
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,916
Remain calm and
remember to breathe...

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,125
I'm sorry Tsugumi,
is any of this helpful?

96
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,416
Oh yes...! You've
been a huge help!

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You're so easy to talk to.

98
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,916
Oh... You mean it?

99
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah... You're great!

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,625
No... No...!

101
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,833
Nooooo!

102
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,125
Vector Luna reporting.

103
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,333
I'm- I'm prepared
to Merge... I think.

104
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,583
Just try to relax, Tsugumi.

105
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,000
We're going to get through this.

106
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,250
I'm not sure I can...
I'm nervous.

107
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,375
We all are the first time.

108
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,458
Alright.

109
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
Vector Mars standing
by for Merge.

110
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,125
Here we go!

111
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:12,500
Okay. Merge One!

112
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,500
Merge Two!

113
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,291
Go... Aquarion!

114
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:34,375
Oh wow...! We Merged!

115
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,541
I forgot, the stupid simulator
doesn't go all the way.

116
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,208
You did well.

117
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,791
Thanks. I tried really hard.

118
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,750
You seemed to
relax as time passed.

119
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,000
That's good.

120
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,333
Well, yeah...
But it took awhile.

121
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,458
Just keep trying.

122
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,458
Reika?

123
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,291
Sorry about that, Tsugumi.

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,375
Are you alright?

125
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,000
What's that?

126
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,125
What the heck's happening...?

127
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,625
Where'd all that rumbling
come from just now?

128
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,500
Another explosion...?

129
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,708
What's going on around here?

130
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,083
They're trying to find
the source of it right now.

131
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,458
I want to know what happened!

132
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,250
Brother, didn't this same thing
happen a little while ago?

133
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,375
Yes.

134
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,250
Anybody know what that was?

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,833
Huh? What is this?

136
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,208
Hey you guys, look!

137
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,000
There's something pulsing.

138
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,291
What are we looking at?

139
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,791
What's this image from?

140
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,166
It's Jun's psychograph.

141
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,666
That thing--it
looks like a heart.

142
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,833
I don't know about you,
but I can never tell

143
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,208
what those weird pictures
are supposed to be.

144
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,500
Whatever it is, it's going
faster than it was before.

145
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,791
Tsugumi!

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,750
Where'd it go?

147
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,041
It's another explosion...!

148
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,458
Everybody take cover!

149
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,708
It's Tsugumi again!

150
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,291
Tsugumi! Tsugumi!

151
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,000
That girl's a danger!

152
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,166
Nobody's safe when she's around

153
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,000
Make them stop!

154
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,833
I can't Merge;
nobody's safe around me!

155
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,625
Cherubim soldiers
sighted in Mira City.

156
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,750
Model unknown.

157
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,041
Vector Sol, Apollo.

158
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,291
Vector Mars, Jun Lee.

159
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,416
Vector Luna, Tsugumi Rosenmeir.

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,666
Report to flight deck and
prepare for launch immediately.

161
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,625
I can't go...!

162
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,666
Someone else has to do it!

163
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,208
I can't; I can't go!

164
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,250
Time to move out!

165
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,083
I can't go. Please understand!

166
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,250
I can't do anything to help!

167
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,916
So you plan to sit here and
let the others do the fighting?

168
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,375
Will you always be running away?

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,291
Suit yourself.

170
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,750
I suppose it had
to happen sometime.

171
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,041
Where's Tsugumi?

172
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:41,916
She's going to miss the launch.

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,333
What's that girl up to?

174
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,041
This is no time for
a disappearing act!

175
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,333
I'll volunteer to go
in her place, sir!

176
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,500
Of course.

177
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,583
Remember, I'm the head Element!

178
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,125
Fine by me.

179
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,333
I'm just happy that I'm going
to be seeing some action...

180
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,500
Don't worry, Reika, I'm sure
I'll do just as well as Tsugumi.

181
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,666
Well... I guess there's
really no other way.

182
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,458
Prepare to launch with Pierre as
Vector Luna instead of Tsugumi.

183
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,000
Tsugumi.

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,291
Launch gates
standing by for take-off.

185
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,500
Launch gates standing by.

186
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,750
Clear launch area.
Secure hangers.

187
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,125
All non-flight personnel
evacuate flight deck.

188
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,583
Repeat: all non-flight
personnel evacuate flight deck

189
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,958
and report to observation deck.

190
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,458
All vectors in place...
Initiating launch sequence.

191
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,958
Just don't get in
my way, Rookie...

192
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:36,750
Got that?

193
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,208
Uh, yeah... r-right.

194
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,000
Just remember everything
we talked about, Jun.

195
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,833
And don't take
Apollo too seriously.

196
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, this should be
interesting, at least.

197
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,000
Vector status,
twenty seconds to arrival.

198
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,000
Prepare to acquire target.

199
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,416
Roger. Quantum
reactor initiated.

200
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,208
Target sighted.

201
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,625
Let's go.

202
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,708
Uh... yes!

203
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,291
Right...! Merge One!

204
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,000
Merge Two!

205
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,458
Go...! Aquarion!

206
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,625
Oh wow.

207
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:40,541
Even better than I'd heard.

208
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,666
So Jun got to Merge...
I'm glad.

209
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,833
Here it goes guys!

210
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,291
Infinity Punch!

211
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,583
What...?

212
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,958
Are you sure you want
to use that one now?!

213
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,500
What happened?

214
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,625
It always works!

215
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,291
Apollo, give me a shot at 'em.

216
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,125
I think I can
heat things up a bit.

217
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,125
Good idea!

218
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,375
Alright... Let's go.

219
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,750
I'm ready.

220
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,166
Fire!

221
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,833
Punch!

222
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,208
New model has a harder
shell than the others.

223
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,708
I noticed.

224
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,083
It looks as if it may have
an impenetrable suit of armor.

225
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,833
We need to change our tactics.

226
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,750
Ah, You think?!

227
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,416
Aquarion's been hit.

228
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,750
Pierre!

229
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,208
Pierre...! Answer me!

230
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,458
Pierre's pulse is barely
registering, Jerome.

231
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,791
He may die.

232
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,750
This is why I wanted
Tsugumi for this mission...!

233
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,375
She can't hide forever...

234
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,666
Changing Element!

235
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,583
Vector Luna from Pierre
to Tsugumi Rosenmeier.

236
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,250
No...! No!

237
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,166
No, wait!

238
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,541
Let me go instead.

239
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,750
I'll take Tsugumi's place.

240
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,708
Tsugumi has to fly sometime.

241
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,583
And, in my opinion, she's
better suited to this mission.

242
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,583
As her senior,
I assume responsibility.

243
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,333
Reika.

244
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,250
Very well. Begin
preparations for teleport.

245
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,208
Teleport standing by.

246
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,791
Initiating teleport switch.

247
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,833
Medical team, move in now!

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,541
Measure his pulse
and blood pressure...

249
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,708
There may be brain damage,
so perform a CT scan as well.

250
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,541
And be careful!

251
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,125
Reika will be fine...

252
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,041
It's better for everyone
if I just stay here.

253
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,625
Vector Luna in...

254
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,083
Teleport switch complete.

255
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:17,708
Alright then...

256
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,291
Let's get moving.

257
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,416
I'm coming! Wait for me!

258
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,375
Guys, we need to
Merge--and soon!

259
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,000
We know that!

260
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,666
Look out!

261
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,875
Reika's been hit!

262
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,041
I repeat! Reika's hit!

263
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,250
Vector Luna, come in!

264
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,333
Reika!

265
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,625
Are you okay, Reika?

266
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,083
Just barely.

267
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,666
Vector Luna's stats are falling.

268
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,166
Aura level nearing zero.

269
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,458
Energy at fifty percent.

270
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,375
Mental capacity fading.

271
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,208
We can't get past its armor...

272
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,708
None of our usual
attacks are going to

273
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
work with this thing...!

274
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,875
We have to think of
something quick or we're toast.

275
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,625
Jun, what're you doing?!

276
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:18,166
My chest it... it... feels like
my heart's gonna explode.

277
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,750
Wait... That's it!

278
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,958
It's Tsugumi!

279
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,458
Hey, Tsugumi!

280
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,541
We need you!

281
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,000
We need what you can do...

282
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,541
You have to switch places
with Reika immediately.

283
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,291
We don't have
any time to lose...!

284
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,041
Come on Tsugumi,
you can do this.

285
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,083
You have to do this!

286
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,208
They need me?

287
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,625
Tsugumi, hurry!

288
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,041
It has to have a
weakness somewhere.

289
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,458
I'll be fine; I can do this...

290
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,083
Now let's just Merge!

291
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,375
I'm sorry, Reika...
but it has to be Tsugumi.

292
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,708
Reika.

293
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,625
Tsugumi Rosenmeier
reporting for duty.

294
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
Standing by for teleport switch.

295
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,166
What...?

296
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,708
Well look who showed up?

297
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,000
Tsugumi.

298
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,291
Hey everybody.

299
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,333
I'm sorry I'm late, but I'm
here now and I'm ready to go.

300
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey Tsugumi.

301
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
Thanks for getting me here, Jun.

302
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,916
No problem...

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,750
But right now, we need you

304
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,833
to send your power
inside that soldier.

305
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,916
You know?

306
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,166
How'd you find out?

307
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,125
I figured it out earlier
from my psychograph...

308
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,416
I get it...

309
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,583
Your heart rate sets
off some kind of reaction.

310
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,208
Right.

311
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,333
It affects the stability
of objects in the vicinity.

312
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,166
We can't beat that
soldier from the outside,

313
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,583
so we have to destroy
it from the inside.

314
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,958
I'll use my psychograph
to guide you.

315
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,833
Hey...! What's going on?

316
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,250
There's no time to
explain that right now...

317
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,625
Get ready to Merge.

318
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:45,416
OK... whatever it is you're
up to it better be good!

319
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,708
Alright, Tsugumi, let's go.

320
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,708
Formation is L-S-M...

321
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,000
Codename "Explosion." 

322
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,041
Merge One!

323
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,291
Merge Two!

324
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Go... Aquarion!

325
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,750
Oh my gosh...
This is incredible!

326
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,541
Aquarion Luna.

327
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,416
This is strange.

328
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,541
Vector Luna's energy level

329
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,875
is higher than I've
ever seen before.

330
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,416
No!

331
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,125
Jun I can't... make it stop!

332
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,500
Tsugumi, hold
on a little longer.

333
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,041
How?

334
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,583
Apollo, get us moving!

335
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,291
What...? To where?

336
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,000
Just run!

337
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,500
Alright.

338
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't. I can't.

339
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,208
Remember to stay
in control of yourself.

340
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,000
Right.

341
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,625
Tsugumi...

342
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,916
Remember what I said, please.

343
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,958
Here goes nothing.

344
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,333
Now...

345
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,041
It's time for... an explosion!

346
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,333
Let's go.

347
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,333
What?

348
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,958
So this is why
they needed Tsugumi.

349
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,416
To Merge is... to explode!

350
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,541
I really did it.

351
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,708
You are getting sleepy...

352
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,166
Very sleepy...

353
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,958
You are drifting into
the world of dreams...

354
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,000
You are getting sleepy...
Very sleepy.

355
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,291
Next on Aquarion:
"The Path to Dreams."

356
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,750
Now... you are mine.
