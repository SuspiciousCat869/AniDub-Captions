1
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:03,750
Atlandia... The
kingdom of splendor.

2
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:08,458
Where fragrant breezes...
whisper through the trees.

3
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,416
Where fairies sing
pure and clear.

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,333
Where beautiful flowers...
guild upon the grounds.

5
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,708
Where the crisp sound of
bells cast from human souls

6
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:23,041
echo beautifully off
the walls of history.

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,041
Marking an era of
glorious rebirth,

8
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,708
where the old world
would be renewed

9
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,416
from the ash of mankind...

10
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,083
It seems you've quickly
become accustomed to this place.

11
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:42,125
Yes... It feels as if I've been
here since the day I was born.

12
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:49,416
You were born here.
This is your home.

13
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,458
In distant times past...
and now again...

14
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,583
Solar Wing...?
Then am I the one?

15
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,750
No! Brother! How could you?!

16
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,208
Welcome home...

17
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,666
Here in Atlandia your
wings will finally bloom.

18
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,875
Master Johannes...

19
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,416
I fear something unholy
has entered our sanctuary.

20
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:09,333
Calm yourself... Toma knows
exactly what he's doing.

21
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,083
The humans have
taken our only child.

22
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,625
Leaving us only one
chance of survival...

23
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,958
We must hope now

24
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,375
that the sacred Tree of
Life will self-pollinate,

25
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,541
that it will bear a
single Genesis fruit

26
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,625
and spawn a new life...

27
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,666
...before it completely
withers and dies...

28
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:35,125
That day, I fear...
is very close-at-hand.

29
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,916
Brother...

30
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,541
This is his handwriting...!

31
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:30,333
The elephant dances.
The elephant dances.

32
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,708
The elephant dances
an elegant tango.

33
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:39,958
The elephant spins and it
goes round and round and round

34
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:44,041
until it forgets... the
weight of the world on its back.

35
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,750
What is this...?!

36
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,083
Brother...

37
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,708
Silvia... I'm so sorry...
I know you must-

38
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,000
Get away from me!

39
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,500
Sophia, have you seen
the Commander?!

40
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,375
No...? Do you need
him for something?

41
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,083
I just received a
message from our superiors,

42
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,041
if we don't recover that
stolen Vector immediately...

43
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,791
Your Mighty Commander Fudo
will be stripped of his post.

44
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,333
So sad... already the
roses wither and die...

45
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,416
Their master gone...

46
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,041
So does this mean...

47
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,333
Apollo wasn't
Solar Wing after all ?

48
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,000
Honestly, I hadn't
thought about it.

49
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,375
Either way, Sirius was
the one the angels took...

50
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,916
I feel so sorry for Silvia...

51
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,625
He was her brother.

52
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,000
Just stop it!

53
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,708
Everybody's been
looking for you.

54
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:02,166
I'm just taking a small
break from life's rigors.

55
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,000
Actually, I could use
a little break myself.

56
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,958
You know, I've
never figured it out...

57
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,875
Why DEAVA built a base

58
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,166
inside the monastery of
the Alisian royal family...

59
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,833
And why members
of the royal family

60
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,875
would then agree to stay...

61
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,541
Those wristbands...

62
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,500
I've always sensed that
the answer had something

63
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,041
to do with what
they were hiding...

64
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,666
What is this?

65
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,083
You should follow me...

66
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,958
If, that is, you're prepared
to know the truth.

67
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You don't smell very happy.

68
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,500
Well that's because I'm not...!

69
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,875
How could I possibly
be happy right now?

70
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,708
First Glen and now Sirius...

71
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,833
Both of them are gone
and it's all because of me...

72
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,833
That's a bunch of
crap and you know it...

73
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,333
It was the feathers.

74
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,041
Sirius did this cause
he was ashamed of himself.

75
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,833
You mean to tell me
you knew what Sirius

76
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,208
was hiding under his
wristband all along?

77
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,541
Well... yeah... I guess so...

78
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,083
And it didn't bother you?!

79
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,666
You didn't think it might be
important to let someone know?!

80
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,416
What...? Guess I didn't think
it was all that big of a deal...

81
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:16,125
If I had known...
If I'd had time to react...

82
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,291
I might have made
a different choice.

83
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,291
I might have taken Sirius'
hand when I had the chance...

84
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:27,041
But I didn't. I couldn't
find it in my heart...

85
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,791
Let's go...

86
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,458
You're coming with me.

87
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,333
Apollo?!

88
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,916
Look around...

89
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,208
This is what we
overthrew the royal family

90
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,333
to get our hands on...

91
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,958
Once the capital of
humanity... Shangri-la.

92
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:23,208
Shangri-la... The eternal city.

93
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,416
But, these... It takes a century

94
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,000
for stalactites to grow
just one centimeter...

95
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,875
So for these to have
become this thick,

96
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,375
it must have
taken at least...

97
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,333
Twelve thousand years.

98
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,583
Twelve thousand.

99
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,416
Amazing.

100
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,041
Is that...?

101
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:49,625
A monument to its builders...
Apollonius and Celiane.

102
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,625
It was in this place...
that humans first discovered

103
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,708
a way of combating
the Shadow Angels...

104
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,416
Many innovative technologies
were developed here...

105
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,416
And as legend would have it...

106
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,083
Both human-like Shadow Angels
and Angel-like humans were born.

107
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,208
Securing this
location was paramount,

108
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,833
without it Aquarion
would be inoperable.

109
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,625
In the strata just
beneath these ruins

110
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,750
rests an incredible
source of power.

111
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,333
And that was reason enough

112
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,375
for the royal family
to be overthrown.

113
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,416
Their wristbands were
concealing something...

114
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,541
Shadow Angel feathers.

115
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,791
Silvia and Sirius...

116
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,750
Both are descendants
of Apollonius and Celiane,

117
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,500
whose love for one another was
forbidden, and would eventually

118
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,541
result in the ancient battle
that destroyed the world.

119
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,958
But how could that be?

120
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,000
What was two souls...
became one.

121
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,166
That single soul
became two once more

122
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,791
and from them came a third
soul, the soul of Aquarion.

123
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,708
Why'd you bring me out here?

124
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,458
I don't know...

125
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:32,166
Cause' it's pretty...
and the smells are nice.

126
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,083
Delicious.

127
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,000
Old man Fudo once said...

128
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,291
"Even if a spring
is never discovered,

129
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,750
it still continues to flow"...

130
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,083
Whatever that means, right?

131
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,166
Apollo?!

132
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,500
Silvia.

133
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,166
Silvia.

134
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,708
Silvia.

135
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,291
Sirius?

136
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,875
Silvia... Please...

137
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,458
Trust me... it's better here.

138
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,833
But Brother?

139
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,416
Silvia no!

140
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,750
Did she reject your offer?

141
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,000
Not at all.

142
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,166
We were just
rudely interrupted...

143
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,666
She'll follow me.

144
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,750
Was he here?!

145
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,708
Was Sirius here?!

146
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,375
You can't!

147
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,791
Silvia, don't go!

148
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:45,125
Apollo?

149
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,375
How can you be certain
he won't betray you...?

150
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,541
You mean as Apollonius did?

151
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,208
He will not stray from me...

152
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,708
He inherits the Angels' wings

153
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,166
and believes he is
fulfilling his destiny

154
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,625
Even so, he only partially
shares our bloodline--

155
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,333
he is still human as well!

156
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,208
Enough.

157
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,708
The time has come
for your first battle...

158
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,625
Are you truly prepared
to face your former friends?

159
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,083
Friends, they may be...

160
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,666
But not mine...

161
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,791
I've been alone, until now...

162
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,458
Sir?

163
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,041
Your Vector...

164
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,041
Can you fly?

165
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,750
Sir, are you ordering
me on this mission?

166
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,958
Then I promise...

167
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,625
I won't let go
of his hand again!

168
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
Go then... You know what to do.

169
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,833
Quantum signature approaching...

170
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,958
Barrier field raised...!
Mount defenses!

171
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,208
High-level quantum
signature confirmed.

172
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,791
Wait is that...?
It's Vector Mars!

173
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,333
So what are you saying...

174
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,166
Then is that Sirius?

175
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,708
It's my brother...?!
Is he coming back home?

176
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,375
I can't tell...
is it really him?

177
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,125
All I know, if he's in there...

178
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,291
I'm bringing him back.

179
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,750
Sirius... Stop this...!
Is that you?!

180
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,625
Reika...! Come back!

181
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,000
Reika!

182
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,291
Sirius, listen!

183
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,333
You don't have to forgive me...
what I did was awful...

184
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,666
I betrayed you and I'm sorry.

185
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,125
But please...

186
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,333
You can't stop trusting
everyone because of my mistake!

187
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,291
Please Sirius...!

188
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,250
Please come home,
I'm begging you!

189
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,041
Sirius!

190
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,291
You said trust...? In whom?

191
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,666
Reika!

192
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,458
Reika... Bastard.

193
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,708
How could you hurt a friend?

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,666
Now, mongrel...

195
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,500
Let's go...! Angelic Merge!

196
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,125
Cherubim... Mars!

197
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,666
Sirius!!!!

198
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,916
Vector Mars has just
successfully merged

199
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,583
with a Cherubim!

200
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,708
This isn't happening...

201
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,333
Oh no...

202
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,083
Three seconds.

203
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,625
That's all I'll need...
to finish this.

204
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:37,416
Three seconds huh...?
Then bring it ooooon!

205
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,250
Okay... One.

206
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,750
Two.

207
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,916
Three.

208
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,791
Apollo!

209
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,250
C'mon...

210
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,541
Everything's busted,
I can't move an inch!

211
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,666
Commander...!

212
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,708
He's anticipating
every move we make!

213
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:16,250
Now sit there and watch as
I completely destroy DEAVA.

214
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,583
Vectors Sol and Luna
have been incapacitated!

215
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,041
The enemy is right on top of us!

216
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,125
Defense Systems...
Overloading...!

217
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,041
Code red...!

218
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,875
Vector Mars' energy vibrations

219
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,958
are weakening the
Barrier shields!

220
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,541
It won't be long
'til he breaks through!

221
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,041
Oh no!

222
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,458
Make it stop. Please Brother!

223
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,458
There may be nothing
we can do but pray.

224
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,375
Unknown objects approaching...
at high speeds!

225
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,291
What are their stats?

226
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,125
I can not get a reading!

227
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,875
What's this?

228
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,416
What is that?!

229
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,625
Could it be...?
It almost looks like...

230
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,833
Aquarion!

231
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,583
Stay calm... We're all safe now.

232
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,458
You are looking at
the lastest in weaponry

233
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,583
developed jointly by DEAVA
and the New United Nations.

234
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,208
The new Assault-Type Aquarion!

235
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,625
Silvia... and the
rest of you as well.

236
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,250
Behold what humans did to Angels

237
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:59,625
and what you've done to
those you called friends?

238
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,416
Feathers? What the hell?

239
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:17,625
What's that...? It's Glen!
Is it really you ?!

240
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,083
It's finally happened...

241
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,458
Humans have crossed
the point of no return,

242
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,041
harnessing forbidden
technologies...

243
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,666
Is it too late for this
travesty to be stopped?

244
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,041
Next on Aquarion:
"Fleeting Wings"

245
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:16,875
Merge with me!

246
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,625
Merge with me!!
