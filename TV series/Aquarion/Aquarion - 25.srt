1
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,791
I love being alive...!
I love it all!

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Tsugumi... are you alright?

3
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
Military vectors.

4
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,291
So, they just used us to
break through the barriers.

5
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,375
Silvia's up there.

6
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,333
We can't let'em
get through. Not now.

7
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,541
What?

8
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,958
Tsugumi!

9
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,958
Tsugumi will switch with Pierre.

10
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:55,125
You've got it!

11
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't worry, Chloe.

12
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,291
We'll get you better, I promise.

13
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,833
Get me up there!

14
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,125
Go!

15
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,875
Right.

16
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Prepared for Operation
Blackout... Confirm.

17
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,166
Yes sir.

18
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,833
Yes sir.

19
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,291
How many vectors
do we have left?

20
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,458
Nine, sir.

21
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,333
All vectors assume
Armageddon Formation.

22
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,958
What the-

23
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,666
Target is at twelve o'clock...

24
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,625
Set PSG cannons to maximum fire.

25
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,250
Roger.

26
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,458
Roger.

27
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,625
Fire!

28
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,458
What was that?

29
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,833
Damn!

30
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,875
Cursed wingless ones!

31
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,750
Give up your pathetic fight...

32
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,125
You won't get any further!

33
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,041
Omega change.

34
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,875
Child's play!

35
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,208
Glen!

36
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,583
Worthless creature!

37
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,208
No!

38
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm sorry...

39
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,083
It's you.

40
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:11,000
Remember

41
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,083
Reika!

42
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
Now you die!

43
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,791
Reika.

44
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,875
You're back!

45
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,958
You're alright...?

46
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,833
Does this mean you're
back to normal?!

47
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,250
Yeah... It's me.

48
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,291
Sorry if I scared ya.

49
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,750
You're finished!

50
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,083
Glen!

51
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,375
You go on. I've got this.

52
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,625
I won't leave you!

53
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,291
You don't have a choice!

54
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,791
Yes I do, and I'm not
leaving you behind!

55
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,416
Dammit, there's
no time to argue.

56
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,958
But-

57
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,625
This is bigger than the two of
us, Reika, and you know it!

58
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,833
All right.

59
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,791
Let's go!

60
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,916
Why won't you die!

61
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,208
Thanks, Glen...

62
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,208
Apollo, Pierre...
let's get moving!

63
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,208
Right behind you.

64
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,541
According to prophecy,

65
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,250
when Solar Wing
returns to Heaven...

66
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,250
Then the world...
will come to an end.

67
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,708
Do they have a hope of winning?

68
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,416
Winning?

69
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,625
Will they be able to
destroy the Shadow Angels?

70
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,208
Where the hell are we?

71
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,416
It's their garden...!

72
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,083
Those are the
people taken for Prana

73
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,583
by the Shadow Angels
during their harvests.

74
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you kidding me?

75
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,875
If that's true, if that's really
who those people are,

76
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,625
do you think everyone
the Shadow Angels

77
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,750
have ever taken away is
still down there somewhere?

78
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,166
The fate of the Shadow
Angels' is linked to ours...

79
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,666
They use humans... but they
also need us to survive...

80
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,333
They cannot afford
to destroy us.

81
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,125
Even so, we'll be slaves!

82
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,666
We will...

83
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,375
If the Shadow Angels
Prevail we'll live

84
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,958
but we won't be free...
our lives will be cheap...

85
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,083
Dammit, this is taking
way too much time.

86
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,958
We got to get to Silvia.

87
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,833
Let's go!

88
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,916
It's huge!

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,791
That's it...!

90
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,958
That has to be the Tree of Life.

91
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,416
Can you guys smell that?

92
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,750
What is it?

93
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,583
It's... like nothing
I've ever smelled before...

94
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,875
Whatever it is,
it's really powerful.

95
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,125
Powerful?

96
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,458
What do you think is up there?

97
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,416
They must not topple
the Tree of Life...

98
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
The tree contains the
life-force of the entire planet,

99
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,333
and controls its fate...

100
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,583
They cannot let
that force loose...

101
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:58,333
If the tree falls and
the energy escapes,

102
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,875
this will be a
lifeless planet forever.

103
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,416
Is that really possible?

104
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,833
You won't get away!

105
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,375
We'll see.

106
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,916
Is that really the
best you can do?

107
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
Wingless fools...

108
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,125
You can't even
put up a good fight.

109
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,083
Bastard! This isn't over yet.

110
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:43,916
Hear me! It's not over!

111
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
What is this?
What are you doing?

112
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,208
Your kind will never win.

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,791
No! Glen!

114
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:18,791
No, please! Glen!!!

115
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,958
How is it that you have
the answer to everything...?

116
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,333
Twelve thousand years ago,
we defeated the Shadow Angels...

117
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,333
There were only three
Elements in that battle:

118
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,750
Apollonius, Seliane,
and one Element whose name

119
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,416
has been erased from
the Book of Genesis.

120
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,583
You were the third, weren't you?

121
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,000
Apollonius!

122
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,958
Seliane!

123
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,208
Where am I?

124
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,250
Sirius!

125
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,208
Welcome home.

126
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,458
Brother!

127
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,083
Wait a second.

128
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,416
Is this place...
What I think it is?

129
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,875
Yes... You are in Atlandia now.

130
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,458
But this place belongs
to the Shadow Angels!

131
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,875
There really are
angels, Silvia...

132
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,666
Look around and you'll see it...

133
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,916
Their city is beautiful.

134
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,125
No, it's not.

135
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,958
You've at least remembered parts
of your past life as Seliane...

136
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,041
I envy you that.

137
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,916
I haven't seen
anything of mine...

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
But I know the
memory's inside of me...

139
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,833
I need to find it, Silvia, so I
can figure out who I really am.

140
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,333
That's why I needed to
come here to Atlandia...

141
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:59,791
And why it's so important
for you to stand by my side.

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,083
You're wrong...

143
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,000
You're so blind...
But I'll make you see!

144
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,791
You can watch from
a nice, safe place

145
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,291
while we put an end
to the wingless ones.

146
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,541
Wow.

147
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,583
The Tree of Life.

148
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,458
It looks exactly like
it did in my dream...

149
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,000
It's so big,
but so fragile too...

150
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,125
I hope it stays safe.

151
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,208
That's Vector Sol...!

152
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,166
Apollo! Apollo, is that you?

153
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,916
That's her scent...! Silvia!

154
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,208
Sirius?!

155
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,083
Where have you been...?
You're late.

156
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,458
Angel attack... Go Mars!

157
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,791
Uh-oh... Sirius merged himself
with the Cherubim again.

158
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,208
Reika...!

159
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,041
Whatever you have to do,
you can't let go of his hand.

160
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,166
No, for Glen's sake,
I won't... Merge One!

161
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,250
Merge Two!

162
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Go! Aquarion!

163
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Sirius!!!

164
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,375
No!

165
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,833
You can't... please stop!

166
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,958
Reika!

167
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,416
Right!

168
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,166
Let it go, Sirius. It's over.

169
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,333
He's right...

170
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,666
Please listen. You have to stop!

171
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,833
Cherubim Mars and Solar Aquarion

172
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,500
seem to be equal in
strength and agility...

173
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,000
This won't be short.

174
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,833
There seems to be a
strange reaction occurring

175
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,750
between the machines.

176
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,833
Well... They should
have company soon.

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,833
I can't see. What the hell???

178
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,208
Hello Solar Wing.

179
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:28,125
I've waited ages
for this day to come

180
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:36,916
I've waited ages
for this day to come

181
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,416
Nice try, but you missed!

182
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,916
What the hell?

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,208
I never miss.

184
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
Apollo!

185
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,625
What...!
The controls won't work.

186
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,333
We can't do anything from here.

187
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,708
Don't you remember, Apollonius?

188
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,958
Think back to twelve
thousand years ago.

189
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:47,208
Even in this new body, you
must remember who you were.

190
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,916
Have you forgotten the
feel of my hand in yours.

191
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,750
You cannot have forgotten
how I loved you...

192
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,166
We were twin souls.

193
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,875
Apollonius?

194
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,458
What was that...? Why is
that memory in my head?

195
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:24,583
You will remember...! You will!

196
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,333
Yes, I do remember...

197
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,458
I remember your
hands, your face,

198
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,500
loving you
so much it hurt.

199
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,250
I remember it all.

200
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,125
You do?

201
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,000
Seliane!

202
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,583
Apollonius!

203
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,416
Even now, you can't
abandon her memory,

204
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,541
even though she was nothing...

205
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,791
You knew her then, Apollonius,

206
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,208
and in your ignorance,
you feel you know her now.

207
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,458
But you don't
know her true form.

208
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,833
What do you mean?

209
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,875
Silvia?

210
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,791
Seliane...

211
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,458
Being weak, your sin was far
too great to bear alone...

212
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,625
So naturally, your soul divided.

213
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,708
One half became you, and
the other became your brother.

214
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,916
Haven't you wondered why
you both have one winged arm.

215
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,375
No...! This is ridiculous!

216
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,458
I can't be her!

217
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,541
The proof is on your arms...

218
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,166
Seliane's soul split in two:

219
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,000
one half that remembered,
and one that forgot.

220
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,083
The half that remembered
the world's destruction

221
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,666
became the
haunted older brother.

222
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,791
The one that forgot
became the carefree sister.

223
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
No! He's wrong!

224
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,166
But I don't remember!

225
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,041
Your mind doesn't...

226
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,625
It could never
handle the knowledge

227
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,375
of who you really are...

228
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,833
But your soul knows the truth.

229
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,208
You're lying...

230
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,250
I'm the reincarnation of
Apollonius, not Seliane...!

231
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,416
Do you hear me, I am Solar Wing!

232
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,333
You, Solar Wing?

233
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,541
You truly know nothing...

234
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,875
Solar Wing is neither
angel nor human,

235
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,708
but something far greater...

236
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,333
Solar Wing is Aquarion!

237
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,333
But how?

238
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,541
That doesn't make sense!

239
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,416
You got to be kidding me!

240
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,500
Twelve thousand years ago,
Apollonius betrayed me...

241
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,458
He betrayed our whole race
for his love, Seliane...

242
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,583
He left Atlandia
behind him forever...

243
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,208
but he didn't vanish...

244
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,458
He reappeared clothed in a
form I did not recognize...

245
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,791
He was born into the
land of the wingless ones

246
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,916
as Aquarion, the Solar Wing...

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,083
And as Solar Wing,

248
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,708
he mercilessly
destroyed our home...

249
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,375
As if he had never
known its heavenly light...

250
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,041
And now...

251
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,416
Now what?

252
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,166
And now you will
pay for that betrayal...

253
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,375
You'll know what it means

254
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,708
to lose the one you
love, just as I did...

255
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,708
You do still love
Seliane, do you not...?

256
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,416
Don't!

257
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,375
But that's my sister...!
You can't do this!

258
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,375
Time to die, Seliane.

259
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,250
Seliane, no!

260
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,375
Be careful.

261
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,708
I am not as weak
as you think I am...

262
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,333
Remember... I am heir to
the legacy of Apollonius...

263
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,208
I'm not Seliane.

264
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,125
I am Silvia of de Alisia!

265
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,416
Brother, no!

266
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It's over.

267
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,833
Master Toma!

268
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,916
Now it's your turn
to say goodbye.

269
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,375
Toma!

270
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,083
Brother!

271
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,083
Sirius!

272
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,375
The Tree of Life has
grown heavy, burdened

273
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,958
with the fruit that will
bring forth a new world...

274
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:12,208
Watch closely and
listen well, wingless ones.

275
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,208
Next on Aquarion...
the final episode...

276
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,333
"The Day the World Begins."
