1
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,250
How's the view...

2
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,791
...of my costume? That is!

3
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,958
It makes me feel sooo sexy!

4
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,500
Yes! I knew I could
program a sexier costume

5
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,291
for Manamana if
I put my mind to it!

6
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,416
Do you think you could help me
put it back on, pretty please?!

7
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,333
You thieving punks!

8
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,583
I'm burning... up!

9
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Huh?

10
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,500
Aw, man...
That guy's freakin crazy.

11
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,833
Are you kidding me...?

12
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,041
How is he not freezing...?

13
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,958
It's like he's from the sun.

14
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,250
Hey, I finally decided
on a name for ya!

15
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,750
A name?

16
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,083
Yeah, unless you wanna
be known as "Hey, You!"

17
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,875
You said you've been alone
since the Great Catastrophe

18
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,625
and didn't have a name, right?

19
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,875
Right.

20
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,291
Well, as of today, kid,
your name is Apollo...

21
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,083
Just like the mythological
god of the sun!

22
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:18,000
Ah... Ah... pah... lo?

23
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,291
Apollo... Apollo!

24
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,541
I like that name, Baron!

25
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,541
Toma Epanolt, I must admit,

26
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,208
I never expected you to
awaken from your long slumber.

27
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,708
We bid you welcome.

28
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,541
Thank you, Master Johannes.

29
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,916
Master, I must
share this with you...

30
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,666
I have been dreaming
a holy dream.

31
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,458
A holy dream?

32
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,083
About restoring this planet
which has been tainted

33
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,833
by the Wingless Ones,

34
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,875
and turning it into a beautiful
paradise befitting our kind.

35
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,500
We can make this dream a reality

36
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,916
by bringing back the Solar Wing.

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,458
With its power, we can
revive the Tree of Life,

38
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,708
and eliminate the Wingless Ones.

39
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,583
I see that eons of slumber
have not dulled your ambition!

40
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,041
Revive the Tree of Life
with the Solar Wing?!

41
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,958
Yes...

42
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,666
Take off those shoes!

43
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,708
I want to see your bare feet!

44
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,875
Our bare feet?

45
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,250
I just don't see the
point, Commander...

46
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,583
What does being barefoot have

47
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,333
to do with today's
special training?

48
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,875
Do you have a problem
with being barefoot?

49
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,083
Yes...

50
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,208
My mother raised me
with the utmost care...

51
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,041
And that meant no bare feet
for germs to breed upon.

52
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,958
Well, that explains a lot.

53
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,041
Don't forget, people.

54
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,500
You were born barefoot.

55
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,125
It's your natural state.

56
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,375
Count me out!

57
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,000
Barefoot or not, I don't take
orders from anyone, Old Man!

58
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:18,166
Got it?!

59
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,333
Weak!

60
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,958
Nice feet you've
got there, kid...

61
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,791
You must be a soccer player.

62
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,250
Center forward, right?

63
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,041
Proficient with striking
shots and with defense.

64
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,541
Man, you're perceptive.

65
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,416
Your upper torso balance, on
the other hand, is pretty weak.

66
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,166
Here, I'll demonstrate.

67
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,875
What's he staring at?!

68
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,041
Everyone else may think he's
some kind of big shot,

69
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,833
but if you ask me, he's nothing
more than a dirty old man!

70
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,833
So I'm a dirty old man, am I?

71
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,916
He can read minds, too?!

72
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,833
Your preferred dessert
is strawberry pie,

73
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,041
and your favorite book
is "Alice in Wonderland."

74
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,750
And you're fixated
on your brother,

75
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,916
so you don't have a boyfriend.

76
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,166
I didn't have to
read your mind...

77
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,666
...I just had to
read your footsteps

78
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,375
My footsteps?

79
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,833
What, is that like palmistry?

80
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,000
I've no idea.

81
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:16,916
H-his eyes...! F-feels
like I'm being sucked in...

82
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,500
He's so huge!

83
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,708
Reika!

84
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,500
Hmm...? Your left leg's slow.

85
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,416
Just a little, but
still half a breath off

86
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,166
from your conscious reaction.

87
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,041
No... My movements
are in perfect unison.

88
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,875
You're sluggish when it
comes to noticing things.

89
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,208
How did...?

90
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,916
Being that unobservant
can get someone killed...

91
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,333
Or at the very least,

92
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:08,500
knocked to the ground in
front of their fellow cadets.

93
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
He did that on one leg?!

94
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,375
How'd he do that!

95
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
Where did...?

96
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,083
We'll see who's weak!

97
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,500
How sad...

98
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,333
Uh. Listen, Pierre...?
Are you sure about this?

99
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,333
Special training starts
with the legs right,

100
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,250
so that's what I'm focusing on.

101
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,500
How could he know all
that from my footsteps?

102
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,958
You were standing
here somewhere...

103
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,958
That hurt...

104
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,291
Hey, what's the big idea?!

105
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,625
Too stupid to find
your own footprint, huh?

106
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,958
Here's a hint, dummy.

107
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
Huh...? There's nothing there!

108
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,291
Look closer...

109
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:48,500
Wait! How can you be so sure
this footprint's even mine?

110
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,625
It's yours alright...

111
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,250
The bad smell proves it!

112
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,208
I'm just telling the truth!

113
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,541
What are you doing here anyway?

114
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,458
Well, I...

115
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,500
Is it because you
got embarrassed...?

116
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,625
I'd be, too, if Old Man Fudo
mopped the floor with me.

117
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,583
Shut up!

118
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,708
No, you!

119
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,208
I see you're getting along.

120
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:20,916
Huh?!

121
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,625
I had a feeling someone
would return here.

122
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,708
Huh?

123
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,166
Why?

124
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,250
During the training, both of
your auras became hotter,

125
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,250
but your equilibrium wavered.

126
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,166
The Commander
on the other hand...

127
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,500
Well, it was like watching
a child versus an adult.

128
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,416
Oh, yeah?!

129
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,958
What's so great about his?!

130
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,833
The Commander's aura...

131
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,291
It was like a column of light...

132
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
...reaching to the sky.

133
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,500
Uh...

134
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,125
Really?

135
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:47,958
A column of light?

136
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,583
That old guy?

137
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,666
Hey, Rena...

138
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,458
Do you know how
that dirty old man...

139
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,375
Uh, I mean... you know,
Commander Fudo,

140
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,166
can tell so many things just
from someone's footprints?

141
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,541
If I do tell you...

142
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,583
Will you listen to
me for a change? Hm?

143
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,583
Of course I will!

144
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,708
Ouch. That hurt.

145
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,416
Huh?

146
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,875
Hey! Guess the smell's not

147
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,791
the only strong
thing about her feet.

148
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,041
Shut up, or
I'm gonna break your legs!

149
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,125
Sorry.

150
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,791
It's like reading a
page of music notes.

151
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,750
Music notes?

152
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,750
Footprints are
musical signatures

153
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,791
imprinted on the earth.

154
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,208
You're saying you

155
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,125
and the Old Guy actually
hear music in our footprints?

156
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,041
Apollo...

157
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,791
Stand by for take-off!

158
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,291
Stand by for take-off!

159
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,333
All personnel!

160
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,500
Clear the flight deck!

161
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,625
Vectors are moving
into launch position!

162
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,208
Engines at full power!

163
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,500
All systems go!

164
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,416
Vectors, you are
cleared for launch!

165
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,041
Repeat, launch!

166
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,541
Vectors away.

167
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
Estimated time of
arrival to target zone:

168
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,291
five minutes,
twenty-two seconds...

169
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,083
Why them...?!
Why not Reika or me...?!

170
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,000
Why did you allow
Apollo and Pierre to go?!

171
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,458
After the day you had,

172
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,041
I didn't think you'd want to
embarrass yourself again.

173
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,333
Embarrass?!

174
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,583
Merge One!

175
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,000
Merge Two!

176
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,625
Go...! Aquarion!

177
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,291
Aquarion... Mars!

178
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,791
Yeah!

179
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,333
Head Element...! At last!

180
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,291
Fire... Kick!

181
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,625
What did you do?!

182
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,625
Sorry!

183
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,875
I guess my foot
must have slipped!

184
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,416
How...?!

185
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,666
Lemme guess slipped again!

186
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,291
Uh, Princess...

187
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,375
A little help here please!

188
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,750
Get us up! Work the legs!

189
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,291
Shut up! I'm doing
my part, unlike you!

190
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,791
That's so unsightly...

191
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,375
Hey...! No wonder they
can't stay on their feet!

192
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,166
A strike from that
Cherubim Soldier's staff

193
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,250
nullifies all gravity
for a few seconds!

194
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,250
Wait there's no gravity...

195
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,166
...then Mars doesn't
stand a chance!

196
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,833
His long legs make his
center of gravity too high!

197
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,666
What?! Are you saying my
long legs are a problem?!

198
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,500
Hey wait... Guys,
I'm taking over!

199
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
What?!

200
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,833
No! He's got the right idea!

201
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,625
Of the three formations,

202
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,916
Solar Aquarion has the
lowest center of gravity!

203
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,666
That makes Apollo
the head element!

204
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,875
Not him again!

205
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,458
Oh, well. I guess we'll let
the little guy have a chance.

206
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,375
Merge One!

207
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,166
Merge Two!

208
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,666
Go...! Aquarion!

209
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,833
Oh, man!

210
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,250
So good!

211
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,291
Let's do it!

212
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,208
Impossible...

213
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,375
Alright!

214
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,916
What the--?!

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,916
But how...?! How are we even
supposed to move this beast?!

216
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,375
It's useless!

217
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,833
With no gravity,
you've got no friction!

218
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,125
You can't move forward if
you don't have any friction!

219
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,666
Friction?

220
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,041
You're hopeless!

221
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,125
Hey, my legs of fire
will get us out of this!

222
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:11,833
Huh?

223
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,875
'Kay, Apollo...?! Fire!

224
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,083
Good call!

225
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,458
This is painful.

226
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,666
I can't watch this anymore.

227
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,416
Commander?

228
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,666
Sirius is right.

229
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,708
Those three are unsightly...

230
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,041
But...!

231
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,833
Sometimes you have
to look ridiculous in order

232
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,791
to master something new!

233
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,833
Think back, everyone.

234
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,083
When you were toddlers,
how did you learn how to walk?

235
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,500
Well, I...

236
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,625
I crawled on all
fours at first, sir...

237
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,541
I banged into things and
fell flat on my butt a lot...

238
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,875
I would just grab onto anything
that was within reach...

239
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,958
And then somehow try to stand...

240
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,375
Silvia!

241
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:39,750
Psycho-kinesis!

242
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,416
Silvia...

243
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,041
Every time they get knocked
down, they still try to get up.

244
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,625
Like infants
learning how to walk.

245
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,333
They will persevere

246
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,750
Take your shoes off!

247
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,250
Huh?!

248
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:00,958
Our shoes?!

249
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,291
We have to go barefoot!

250
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,875
Gotcha!

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Wow!

252
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,875
Amazing!

253
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,833
Human will is flowing
right into Aquarion's legs!

254
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,166
Even so...

255
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,625
Tell me... what good
can come of it...

256
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,000
...if there isn't any gravity?!

257
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,333
Elements...!

258
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,416
During training, where
did you all try to stand?!

259
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,833
Think hard!

260
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,041
Well, uh...

261
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,541
Where else...? The surface.

262
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,666
Right, Commander?

263
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,375
But standing on the
surface doesn't work!

264
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,208
What do you mean?!

265
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,833
Is this a trick question?

266
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,791
There's... gotta be a way!

267
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,166
There is...!
The column of light!

268
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,958
The column of light?!

269
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,291
They stood...

270
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,416
They stood...

271
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,666
They stood...

272
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,916
They stood...

273
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
Yes, but... but how?

274
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,791
I think I figured it out!

275
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,916
That Cherubim Soldier
nullifies all gravity

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,291
in a one kilometer radius,
but if they were somehow

277
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,541
able to tap into that gravity
underneath that radius...

278
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,541
Such beautiful music...

279
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,166
Apollo.

280
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
Apollo!

281
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,250
I get it now.

282
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,541
Finally...

283
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,583
We can't separate
ourselves from the earth...

284
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,833
We stand... Rooted... As one.

285
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,750
So he stood...

286
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,083
You're an idiot, princess!

287
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,250
How dare you say that?!

288
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,916
You don't even
know me, you mongrel!

289
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,958
I'm just calling
a spade a spade!

290
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,000
Going with my gut feeling!

291
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,583
Telling it like it is!

292
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,916
Next time, on Aquarion: "King of
the Underground Labyrinth"...

293
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,708
I'm gonna take a dive next time!
