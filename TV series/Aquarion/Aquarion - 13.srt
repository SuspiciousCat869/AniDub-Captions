1
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,458
Seliane.

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,458
Apollonius.

3
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,333
Do you remember that day
twelve thousand years ago?

4
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,875
The two of us sat
atop the highest clouds

5
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,041
that reached the stratosphere.

6
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,791
Together, we
watched the dusk fall,

7
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,583
the prominence arching
over the solar spots,

8
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,125
we marveled at its
beauty and power...

9
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,500
Wh-what?

10
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,125
We indulged in our
love of the land...

11
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,833
We listened quietly for
memories of the ocean depths

12
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,125
in each drop of rain
that fell from the sky...

13
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,791
And together, that morning,
we heard them...

14
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,083
What are you talking about?

15
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,875
We heard the sea's mighty
chorus, saw them gathered

16
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,083
in the shimmering
sanctuary of the deep...

17
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,208
We heard their prayers...

18
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,291
We sat under the tree...
the tree of life...

19
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:44,041
we drowned our senses in the
beauty of the world's Genesis.

20
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,833
How it shined...

21
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,791
...and glistened...

22
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
I don't know what you're saying,

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,541
but if you've got
my friend Baron

24
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,916
you'd better give him back!

25
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,708
Your eyes do not reflect me...

26
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,208
They are strange to me.

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,541
Apollo, what just happened?

28
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,833
Here it comes, get ready!

29
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,291
Master Toma.

30
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,833
It makes me sad...

31
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,583
To see the
emptiness in his eyes...

32
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,166
To see the powerful
become the powerless.

33
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,208
It will end now!

34
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,875
Solar Aquarion's
quantum readings

35
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,208
are down eleven points
and dropping rapidly!

36
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,000
Incoming!

37
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,666
Enemy Cherubim moving in!

38
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,208
We don't have any
other options left,

39
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,333
open a hole in the barrier field
and retrieve Aquarion now!

40
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,875
Adjusting the
Barrier Field Generator...

41
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,208
We're good to go!

42
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,250
Have you completely forgotten?

43
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,958
Do you remember nothing
from 12,000 years ago?

44
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,541
Then perhaps you will remember
your friend from this life...

45
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,708
Is that?

46
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,083
Is that you?

47
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,625
Baron... Baron!!!

48
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,208
Baron!

49
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,625
Baron!

50
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,416
Baron, it's me! Are you alright?

51
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,083
Apollo?!

52
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,666
Apollo! Is that really
you over there??!

53
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,333
Damn right!

54
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,041
I'm the one flying this thing!

55
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,750
Apollo...! Get back!

56
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,333
Apollo you can't come near me!

57
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,666
What's wrong with you?

58
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,625
The Shadow Angel
said this thing is a bomb...

59
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,375
If you come near
me it'll explode!

60
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,583
Forget about me!

61
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,583
Just leave!

62
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,541
I won't!

63
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,458
How could they?

64
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,666
They'll pay for this!

65
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,083
Damn those bastards!!

66
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,416
The Barrier Field
Generator is overloading!

67
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Loads everywhere
exceeding 75 percent!

68
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,375
Apollo! Withdraw
to base immediately!

69
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,875
Stop it, Apollo!

70
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,458
I know he means a lot
to you, but if you break

71
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,333
the Barrier Field
Generator you'll kill us all!

72
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,041
Let go!

73
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,250
Help Pierre!

74
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,208
Do something--you have
to help me stop him!

75
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,208
There are just some times,
when a man has

76
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:54,291
to take a stand and do
what's right by his friend!

77
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,291
Let's do it!

78
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,250
Oh no!

79
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:10,458
Thank you...

80
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:18,750
Thank you...

81
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,916
No, how could they do that!

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,750
The wingless ones are fools...

83
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,416
They have invited
their own demise!

84
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,791
Baron, you okay?

85
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,291
Dammit Apollo...!

86
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,666
Why didn't you just do what
I said and leave me there?!

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,166
I could never leave you!

88
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,166
You're my friend!!

89
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,291
You idiot.

90
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,500
Don't you get it?

91
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,416
You're all I have in this world.

92
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,666
Apollo wait!

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,458
Now stand back!

94
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,625
Jump!

95
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:52,250
Here I go.

96
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Baron!

97
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,833
I can't believe you
did all this just for me!

98
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,750
Go!!!

99
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Apollo... look after
the little ones for me!

100
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:18,125
Apollo... look after
the little ones for me!

101
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,958
The Barrier Field is down
and we are completely exposed!

102
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,666
Whats he done...

103
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,333
Apollo has just sacrificed
the entirety of the human race

104
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,833
for the sake of a single person!

105
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,541
If Sirius was on board this
never would have happened!

106
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,541
Apollo, you idiot...!

107
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,208
How could he do this...?

108
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,125
The Shadow Angel will be able to
destroy all three of them now.

109
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,416
A DEAVA soldier has
compassion for his friends...!

110
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,541
Those who don't can leave!

111
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,375
Apollo!

112
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,083
Apollo!

113
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,666
Get up!

114
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
What are you
waiting for Apollo?!

115
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
Take a stand and
fight for your friend!

116
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,916
Use your anger, use your rage,

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,875
use your pain to
strike back at them!

118
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
That's why we have been chosen

119
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,250
to carry this
amazing power with us!

120
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,416
The power of Aquarion!

121
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,500
Aquarion.

122
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,791
I will not be defeated!

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,208
Malfunction!

124
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,500
Aquarion's power stone

125
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,541
is releasing abnormal
amounts of energy!

126
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,500
Levels critical!

127
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,250
So what now?

128
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,333
You see that?!

129
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,583
It looks like
Aquarion is weeping...

130
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,333
Revolting.

131
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,208
Otoha.

132
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm leaving the rest up to you!

133
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,708
But Toma...

134
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,958
My battle will come later!

135
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,666
It's time for me to settle a
score that is long over due...

136
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,833
Toma!

137
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,083
Toma?!

138
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,791
He's coming.

139
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,750
It's him. He's the one.

140
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
From 12,000 years ago...!

141
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,458
The Shadow Angel!

142
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,958
There it is.

143
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,791
Shadow Angel detected!
Shadow Angel detected!

144
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,583
Red Alert...!

145
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,500
The shadow angel is inside!

146
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,416
Inside?

147
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,916
Tooomaaaaaa!

148
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,916
Apollo!

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,625
Wait!

150
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,375
Sol and Luna
elements have ejected

151
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,500
and have abandoned the site!

152
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,750
Send out a code red alert now...

153
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,250
order every section to evacuate!

154
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,583
Reika, Tsugumi...

155
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,666
run and take Apollo and
Silvia's places right now!

156
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,625
Commander?

157
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,250
I'm afraid that's not possible!

158
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,625
We can't teleport to the Vectors

159
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,875
because the elements
aren't on board!

160
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,375
And that is exactly
why I told you to "run"!

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,375
We're on our way!

162
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,875
A shadow angel
has breached DEAVA!

163
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,208
All sections evacuate now!

164
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,541
Code red alert!

165
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,166
A shadow angel... here?

166
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,500
Reika!

167
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,583
You still don't understand
what you really are, do you?

168
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,625
You could be reborn
into your true self!

169
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,958
I could kill you now
and make it happen!

170
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,083
Stop... Stand down!

171
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,916
You dare point a sword
at a shadow angel?

172
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,166
You're no ordinary human!

173
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,250
Brother no!

174
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,791
Great... Flight
systems are down!

175
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,875
The head is severely damaged

176
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,750
and the arms are
severed and unusable!

177
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,958
Do you think she'll still move?

178
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,000
It doesn't look good!

179
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,125
It's amazing Apollo
was able to fight at all!

180
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,166
Main core?

181
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,875
The power stone...
levels are good!

182
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,083
Alright Tsugumi, share your
powers with me right now!

183
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,083
Right, I'll try!

184
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,500
That's the spirit!

185
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,666
You realize there's no way
we're gonna get airborne?!

186
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,291
I think I can pick up Sol...

187
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,750
but I need you to cover me!

188
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,166
Pick up?

189
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,125
These... vibrations!

190
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,958
It is Toma.

191
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,041
Who's Toma?!

192
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,500
He's the Shadow Angel
who entrapped

193
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,625
Apollonius and Seliane
12,000 years ago!

194
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,125
 What?

195
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,375
How delightful...
at least someone remembers.

196
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,833
I will never forget you

197
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,833
no matter how many
times I'm reincarnated!

198
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,375
Silvia!

199
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,250
Sirius!

200
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,000
Apollo!

201
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,541
So you're awake.

202
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,208
You bastard, what have
you done to them...?!

203
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,458
Let them go, now!!

204
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,166
Apollo...

205
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,041
You fool, do you really
think you're a match for me?

206
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,333
Why don't you come over
here and we'll find out?

207
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,958
Don't do this.

208
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,583
You wingless ones amaze me,
arrogant as you are,

209
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,500
you still feel the
pain of losing a friend!

210
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,291
Look out for the
little ones for me.

211
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,500
Baron...

212
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,166
I can bring your
friend back to you...

213
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,708
If that is what you desire...

214
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,250
You can what?

215
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,750
Of course not even the
powerful Shadow Angels

216
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,875
have the ability
to create new life.

217
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,666
As a sacrifice in kind,
offer me the lives of those two.

218
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,208
You can't be serious!

219
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,625
If I offer them to
our Tree of Life...

220
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,083
your friend will be
brought back to this world...

221
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,333
and he will return to
your side once again!

222
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,750
But how?

223
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,041
Let me put this to you in
a way you'll understand.

224
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,583
Just say one thing:

225
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,166
"I offer their lives to you."

226
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,833
I'll die before you hear
those words from me!

227
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,416
Even after you learn the truth
about who they really are?

228
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,166
What truth?

229
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,833
No... no!

230
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,916
What are you doing?

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,041
Stop it.

232
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,541
Didn't you know your
two friends share

233
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,833
the ancient blood
of the Shadow Angels?

234
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,250
Shadow Angels?

235
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,750
They may be descendants...

236
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,833
of the traitor Apollonius and
the wingless one, Seliane!

237
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,208
They are my kind...

238
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,250
So... it looks like your
friends are not human!

239
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,833
No, you're lying to me.

240
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,750
What I tell you is the truth...

241
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,000
why would you hesitate
to sacrifice them?

242
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,583
Don't look!

243
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,458
But they're my friends!

244
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,708
They're all I've got!

245
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,250
Go to hell! I won't do it!

246
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,083
I will never betray
my friends to you!

247
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Can't believe it!

248
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,625
He could have let us die.

249
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:39,375
Then I suppose the sacrifice
will have to be you!

250
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,375
Pierre! Cover us!

251
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,125
I'm on my way!

252
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,291
Let's do it, Tsugumi!

253
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,750
I'm ready!

254
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,500
Pierre!

255
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,083
I'm right behind you!!

256
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,083
I can't hold it much longer!

257
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,666
Hold on Tsugumi!

258
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,583
Aquarion Soluna!

259
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,000
Soluna?

260
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,666
Shadow Angel!

261
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
You're mine!

262
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,916
This feeling... How interesting!

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,791
Come and get it!

264
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,208
Pierre!

265
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,916
Right!

266
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,250
Now!

267
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,875
Now you die!

268
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,166
Too slow!

269
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,791
All right you guys.

270
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,625
Let's finish her off!

271
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,708
Three as one!

272
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,125
Flame explosion!

273
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,875
Right... fire!

274
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,125
 But I'm scared!

275
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,541
Now Tsugumi!

276
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,416
Reika...!

277
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:26,375
What's this?

278
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,625
See you soon!

279
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,375
What?

280
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,666
You bastard.

281
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,416
Master Toma.

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,708
Let's go home...

283
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,958
Are you satisfied?

284
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
Indeed.

285
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
If the feather had
survived this incident...

286
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,125
we might have been able

287
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,166
to prevent the
destruction of Atlandia.

288
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,708
But... destroyed...

289
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,750
It no longer matters...

290
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,541
You were willing to sacrifice...

291
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,041
You would have given
me up in the hopes

292
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,416
of being able to
retrieve the feather...

293
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,333
You would have
let them destroy me,

294
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,333
because of your love and
affection for Solar Wing!

295
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,166
You knew all along?

296
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,250
I know you.

297
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,291
That's why you
dodged their attack.

298
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,208
And that's why I adore you.

299
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,750
My love...

300
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,583
Hey are you alright?

301
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,041
Don't look...

302
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,000
But Brother!

303
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,916
If you tell anyone about this...

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,750
I swear I'll kill you myself.

305
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,916
Whatta ya doing out here?

306
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,333
Hey, listen... about earlier.

307
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,083
You forgot this...

308
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,708
Thought you might want it,
even though it's broken.

309
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,500
But it... the wings I...
shouldn't.

310
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,833
I couldn't care less
about the stupid wings.

311
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,333
What matters is you're you,
and that's all I care about.

312
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,833
You moron.

313
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,458
Ya, so you going to thank me.

314
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,833
You shouldn't have.

315
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,541
Is that more like it?

316
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,500
Oh yeah that's the stuff.

317
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,000
Apollo!

318
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,125
Apollo...

319
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,833
I'm so sorry.

320
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,125
Oh! Say it isn't so!

321
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,708
Seliane!

322
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,791
Sub-Commander Jerome can't be
the reincarnation of Apollonius!

323
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,541
Here I come Seliane!

324
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,666
On the next Aquarion:
"Shining Shadows"!

325
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,875
This preview is full of it!
