1
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,166
Made you look!

2
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,666
Futaba...!

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,208
Child, what are you doing
playing with that feather again?

4
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,208
It's so much fun...!

5
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,458
This was Apollonius' feather...!

6
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,625
C'mon, let me show
you one of its tricks!

7
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,041
Look at this!

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,708
You see?

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,416
Would you turn a symbol of our
dark past into a mere toy...?

10
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,666
That boy is so innocent...

11
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,208
When we were his age, we
were too busy helping harvest

12
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,666
for Prana to have
time for idle playing...

13
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,833
Of course, that was long ago.

14
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:21,625
I doubt the wingless ones will
find Futaba so innocent...

15
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,791
To them, every last
one of us is a threat.

16
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,041
Don't overestimate the child...

17
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,666
He may have a special
control over that feather,

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,500
but he has no
place in a harvest.

19
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,916
Don't you think this is a bit
too much food for one person?

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,083
Seriously, Apollo, you
look like a disgusting pig.

21
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,625
Shut up...!

22
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,875
I'm not going to stop eating

23
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,666
until I've had my share
and all of theirs, too...!

24
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
Just leave me alone.

25
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,500
Who's he talking about?

26
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,791
I think he means all his friends

27
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,125
who were taken away
by the Shadow Angels.

28
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,250
Today's supposed to be some
sort of anniversary for him-

29
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,833
don't know what for, though...

30
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,500
He mentioned something
about it to me this morning.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,750
I'll never forgive
them for taking you.

32
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,083
And I'll always
remember that first day

33
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,041
when you gave me my name.

34
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,541
How is he not freezing.

35
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,458
It's like he's from the sun

36
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,791
Hey, I finally decided
on a name for ya!

37
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,875
A name?

38
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,875
As of today kid,
your name is Apollo...

39
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,541
Just like the
mythological god of the sun!

40
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,333
A- a... po... lo.

41
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,291
Hey guys...!

42
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,958
I hope you're hungry...

43
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,125
'Cause today we hit the jackpot!

44
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,958
You know what I really want...?

45
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,250
I want all of us to be able to
eat our fill every day

46
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,500
of the week for the rest
of our lives like a family.

47
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,333
Look after the
little ones for me!

48
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,541
Baron... I won't let you
down again... I promise.

49
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,666
What perfect timing.

50
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,583
What's going on...?

51
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,708
Why are there so many of them?

52
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,708
Something's not right.

53
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,083
Tough...

54
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,666
'cause I'm really not in
the mood to ask questions...

55
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
Now let's Merge!

56
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,791
Merge One!

57
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,083
Go Merge Two!

58
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,500
Go... Aquarion!

59
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:47,916
Let's go!

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,916
It's more powerful than normal!

61
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,166
What...?

62
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,541
A feather?

63
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,208
That sound.

64
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,708
We're the only ones
that can hear it.

65
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,666
Come on...

66
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,166
Unless you'd
rather chat all day!

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,125
This is horrible!

68
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,250
All the people in that
city will be killed!

69
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,833
Commander, it
doesn't make sense.

70
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,000
They're not harvesting humans,

71
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,750
they're just laying
waste to the city...

72
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,916
Why are they doing that?

73
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,583
I don't think that
they have a reason.

74
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,916
That's what worries me.

75
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,375
Is this Futaba's mischief?

76
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,833
Yes... He seems to
get a special pleasure

77
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,250
out of toying
with Solar Wing.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,416
Foolish boy...

79
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,000
He treats the harvest
like a child's game.

80
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,291
Let him be. He is a child.

81
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,083
His battles are wasteful...

82
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,250
He can't be allowed to wipe out
our Prana supply on a whim...

83
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:58,041
The boy needs to learn to
take the harvest seriously.

84
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,416
He's still young...

85
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,250
He has plenty of time to learn.

86
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,583
You have always been
so easy on Futaba, Master.

87
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,083
It would seem the
feather of Apollonius

88
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:14,250
has found a new
way to torment us...

89
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,291
I tried to talk to him...

90
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,250
The boy should
have listened to me.

91
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,458
Do you understand

92
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,583
why we must harvest
the wingless ones...?

93
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,166
We need them for their Prana.

94
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,291
That's no fun.

95
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,708
How are we supposed
to play with them

96
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,625
if they've got all the
life sucked out of 'em?

97
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,916
I bet the wingless
ones don't like it either.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,333
Not so...

99
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,166
The wingless ones are
merely ignorant and afraid...

100
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,708
But observe how content they are

101
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,125
once they've become
a part of our garden.

102
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,875
Oh, I didn't know that...

103
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,625
I'll bring lots
of 'em here then!

104
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,791
Futaba, wait!

105
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,208
I'll see you later, Shiruha!

106
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,291
Get back here!

107
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,125
What happened?

108
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,000
It just exploded.

109
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Wait... that noise...

110
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,500
Brother, was that-

111
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,541
The feather. But I can't
tell where it's coming from.

112
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,083
Well... Let's find out!

113
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,416
I love fireworks!

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,708
Was that a child?

115
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,625
Elements report...

116
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,041
What's happened up there?

117
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,166
A child...!

118
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,708
There was definitely
a child's voice...

119
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,916
Didn't you hear it?

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,458
What do you mean...?
We didn't hear anything.

121
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,250
Then Jun, Rena,
figure out what's going on.

122
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
Right.

123
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,833
I see innocence...
and I see death...

124
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,416
A massacre without
malice or murderous intent.

125
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
I've got it...

126
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,833
It looks like a tiny
hand holding a feather.

127
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,375
What does it mean?

128
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,166
Is that laughter?

129
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,083
Brother... what's
a child doing here?

130
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,958
Stay calm... Just ignore it.

131
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,708
But, how can I?

132
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,791
Quit playing around!

133
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,958
Game over!

134
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,541
Apollo!

135
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,125
What the...? That light...

136
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,416
It's... jumping between
the Cherubim soldiers.

137
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,125
They're toying with us.

138
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's aim for the light...

139
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,875
If we get that,
we can stop them all.

140
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,750
Consider it done.

141
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
You missed.

142
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,333
I'm getting tired of this.

143
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,875
Look!

144
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,416
Silvia's right...

145
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,083
It is a child... But how
is that even possible?

146
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,875
It doesn't matter...
Let's just get rid of it.

147
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,041
A child? Are you sure?

148
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,041
How old do you think it is?

149
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,458
Clearly too young
to know the difference

150
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
between right and wrong...

151
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,416
Commander?

152
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,875
What...? You've finished it...?

153
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,416
You're sure that it's
ready to be tested...?

154
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,333
All right, then begin
preparations for launch.

155
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,291
Sir!

156
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,666
All launch gates standing by...

157
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,125
System ready... All
personnel clear launch area.

158
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,583
We've been perfecting
this system for years...

159
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,291
Failure is not acceptable.
Is that understood?

160
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,958
Yes sir!

161
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,916
Gotcha! Now you're dead...

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
I won't let you
get away this time.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,416
Apollo, calm down...!

164
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
Remember this is just a little
kid you're talking about.

165
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,416
No... I'm talkin' about
a shadow angel.

166
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,958
Just stop... Think
about what you're doing!

167
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,208
I am thinkin'...
about my friends...

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,916
About Baron...

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,083
And how the shadow angels

170
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,500
just took his life
like it was nothing...

171
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,833
I won't forgive any of them!

172
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,166
Apollo.

173
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,125
Hold on... What is that?

174
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,500
What is what?

175
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,833
Apollo, Sirius, Silvia...

176
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,291
We're going to try to
capture the Shadow Angel.

177
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,125
Huh?

178
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,333
How are we supposed to do that?

179
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,666
Preparing Systems.

180
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,291
Capture Systems one through
six now ready for launch, sir.

181
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,333
All Elements...!

182
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,916
Concentrate your power auras!

183
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,541
The net is in
place for capture...

184
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,666
All Vectors standing by.

185
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,458
What's that thing
supposed to be?

186
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,125
It's the new Quantum
Barrier Field system...

187
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,166
No one can escape once
they've crossed the barrier

188
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,666
and been caught in the net...

189
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,791
Drive the Shadow Angel into
the net but don't hurt him.

190
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't think so...!

191
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,125
Those monsters need to suffer!

192
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,166
Apollo... Just let me do this.

193
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,250
Why should I?

194
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,250
Because he may
be a Shadow Angel,

195
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,541
but he's just a kid...

196
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,166
We'll gain nothing
by hurting him.

197
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
Hey, come back!

198
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,500
Stop...! This isn't just
some game, you little brat!

199
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,500
No, Apollo...! Let him go...

200
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,333
He's just a kid, he doesn't
understand the difference.

201
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,208
Apollo, you know she's right!

202
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,375
You're wrong...

203
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,250
Kid or not...
he's still one of them...

204
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,375
He knows his kind
hunt down humans!

205
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,083
No!

206
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,291
I've had enough of this!

207
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,541
Apollo!

208
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,333
I'm warning you to stop now!

209
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,166
Shut the hell up!

210
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,708
Catch me if you can!

211
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,791
Calm down... Apollo, you
have to get a grip on yourself!

212
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,041
Please, Apollo! Leave him alone!

213
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,166
Quit saying that!

214
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
For the last time,
I don't care...!

215
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,625
How does being a kid
give him the right to kill?

216
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,208
It doesn't...

217
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,708
But we don't have to hurt him...

218
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,708
Can't we at least
try talking to him first?

219
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,458
Talking to him first.

220
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,833
That's something
Baron would have done...

221
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,875
He said kids just
need someone...

222
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,958
teach 'em right from wrong...

223
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,791
No Apollo...! You can't do this!

224
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,125
Be rational for
once in your life!

225
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,375
Give it a rest...!

226
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,875
I'm gonna give this kid
exactly what he needs...

227
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,916
a good talking to...!

228
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,125
Oh no you don't!

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,833
Infinity... Slap!

230
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,041
Elements... Transfer your auras!

231
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,625
Barrier field activated!

232
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,416
You did it...!

233
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,333
You got him into the
net without hurting him!

234
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,250
Yeah. Great.

235
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,000
Mission completed.

236
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,250
We have successfully
captured the Shadow Angel.

237
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,208
We'll transfer him now to
the army's Laguna Base

238
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,541
for further investigation.

239
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,291
He's so small.

240
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,208
Look at that...
why is he shivering?

241
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,458
They'll lower his
body temperature

242
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,125
until he enters a state
of suspended animation.

243
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,333
It's easier to handle that way.

244
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,166
Reika...

245
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,250
What'll they do...?

246
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,625
I mean... you don't think

247
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,791
they're going to
kill him, do you?

248
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,583
No, they won't kill him...
at least not right away...

249
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,250
They'll study him for a while,

250
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,166
treat him like a
science experiment...

251
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,458
He's a good specimen,

252
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,958
and there's a lot we
don't know about his kind.

253
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:36,000
Specimen...
Sounds pretty cold...

254
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,666
He'll spend his life in a box...

255
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,583
His future's
shrouded in darkness.

256
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,083
I'm worried, Brother...

257
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,125
I'm not really sure that
we did the right thing.

258
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,708
Commander... the capture
of the Shadow Angel child

259
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:18,708
seems to be causing some
uneasiness among the Elements.

260
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,333
Those who look closely
will see that humans

261
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,458
and Shadow Angels are in
may ways, "birds of a feather."

262
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,583
Still... Shadow Angels
believe that we humans

263
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,125
are no better than animals,

264
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,833
that we lack any real
intelligence or emotion.

265
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,000
That's how they can do it...

266
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,791
How they're able
to harvest us...

267
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,666
They've convinced themselves
that a human life is nothing.

268
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,333
They see the harvesting
of humans as we see

269
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,583
the raising of livestock
and the planting of crops.

270
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,000
I know...

271
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,750
We may be no better
than them in the end.

272
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,291
You were the one who captured
the Shadow Angel today, yes?

273
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,958
Yeah, what of it.

274
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,708
You've never captured anyone
before, have you, Apollo...?

275
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,208
You have to see this
through to the end.

276
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,916
You must understand that all
actions have consequences.

277
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,833
I don't like it here!

278
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,833
I'm afraid!

279
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,875
That sound again...!
The angel child...!

280
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,583
Silvia! What is it?
Are you okay?

281
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,083
Reika, listen...!

282
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,500
Can't you hear that noise...?

283
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a feather...

284
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,666
There it is again...! The
angel's feather is calling out!

285
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,208
I'm sorry, but
I don't hear anything.

286
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,625
Stop... Stop crying!

287
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,458
I want to go home...!
I'm scared!

288
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,916
He's able to hear
the Shadow Angel, too!

289
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,708
What's the matter?

290
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,958
What... What is this?

291
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,625
No!

292
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,375
He's dead?!

293
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:50,000
I can smell it...
It's the same...

294
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,666
The same smell as when the
Shadow Angels took Baron.

295
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,958
It's happened again...

296
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,708
The feathers of our kind
falling to the ground.

297
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,208
Master Toma...

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,666
The wingless ones
have sealed their fate.

299
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,083
What...?! More special training?

300
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,416
Quit whining!

301
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,208
What, are you afraid
you can't handle it?

302
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,708
Let's see you train with us,
"Deputy Commander."

303
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,833
You're on...!

304
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll show you brats
a thing or two...

305
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,750
Next on Aquarion:
"Crimson Path"!
