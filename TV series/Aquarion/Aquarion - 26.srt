1
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,208
Brother!

2
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,583
Sirius!

3
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,208
How could you... do this?

4
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,708
Did you actually think
I'd ever trust someone

5
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,583
born to the wingless ones?

6
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, that's it.

7
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,791
Merge form Genesis!

8
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:11,708
Go... Aquarion!

9
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,666
Brother... you're alright!

10
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,791
What's happening...?

11
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,583
My wounds are closing.

12
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,708
Is Aquarion healing me?

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,666
I can't believe it. He's alive.

14
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,333
Sirius!

15
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,041
Hey, you alright?

16
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,041
I'm fine... for now...

17
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,625
But I don't blame
you if you both wish

18
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,416
that Toma had killed me.

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,708
You're still one of us!

20
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,333
Just be glad you're alive!

21
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,458
Right.

22
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,500
Welcome back, Solar Wing...

23
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,583
Let this be our final battle?

24
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,750
Hell yeah! Let's go!

25
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:58,875
Look out! Reika!

26
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,500
Right!

27
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,250
He's fast.

28
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,833
He's just playing with us!

29
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:14,083
Damn it... What?

30
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,500
Chibiko!

31
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,458
Isn't she the one you
were trying to rescue?

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,958
Apollo, look after
the little ones for me!

33
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,333
Chibiko!

34
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,416
Chibiko...? Oh, her!

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,541
Chibiko...! Maji!

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,750
Giving up so soon?

37
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,791
Never! You stole
my friends' lives!

38
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,875
Apollo... hold on.

39
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,916
Let me help you beat him.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,708
Thank you...

41
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,625
Glad you're back.

42
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,916
This should be fun.

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
Time to die!

44
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,666
We'll see.

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,625
Finally... It's
happening at last.

46
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,625
This is the true
light of Solar Wing

47
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,041
as it should have
been centuries ago.

48
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:41,541
They don't realize it, but their
struggle will restore our power.

49
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,958
After all these
years of waiting,

50
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,375
at last, Solar Wing will
do what we cannot...

51
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:58,916
The Tree of Life will bear the
fruit of a hundred generations.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,583
We must go to the
Tree of Life, Master.

53
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes...

54
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,666
These bodies
are old and tired...

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,375
We will offer them to the Tree

56
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,791
and we will be
reborn with the world.

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,041
To the Tree of Life!

58
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,291
To the Tree of Life!

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
What's happening?

60
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,541
Look...! Look at the Tree!

61
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,000
Watch out!

62
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,125
It's perfect.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,958
At last our time has come.

64
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,791
How can this be happening...?

65
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,541
The light of Solar Wing
touched the Tree...

66
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,125
Everything is in place!

67
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,458
It's dying when it
should be bearing fruit...

68
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,333
I don't understand...!

69
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
It can't die...!

70
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,833
We've waited too long for this!

71
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,416
No!

72
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,291
You're finished!

73
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,250
Toma!

74
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,625
Why bother to kill me...

75
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,000
The world will end soon enough.

76
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,291
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,041
Do you know nothing...?

78
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,875
The roots of the
Tree of Life reach down

79
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,375
into the very
core of our planet.

80
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,083
The Tree is going to die

81
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,000
and when it does...
the crumbling of its roots

82
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,125
will tear the Earth to pieces...

83
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,333
All life will be destroyed.

84
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:39,750
What?!

85
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,625
He's wrong!

86
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
Look at the Tree!

87
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,541
I'm detecting some
movement at the Earth's core!

88
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,541
Movement is escalating through
every stratum.

89
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,333
If this keeps up, the earth's
crust will begin to shift.

90
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,166
But how?

91
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,250
Something's happened
to the Tree of Life...

92
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,416
It must be collapsing.

93
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,708
Then the world
will collapse with it.

94
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,500
It's over.

95
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,458
No!

96
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,916
Apollo, killing him
isn't the answer.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,125
He's one of them.
He deserves to die.

98
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,791
You can't.

99
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,041
Think this through.

100
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,833
Apollonius! That scent!

101
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,458
A Shadow Angel!

102
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,416
That was Toma's scent.

103
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,375
That's it...

104
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,875
We need a Shadow Angel on board.

105
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,250
Without one of them,
Aquarion's power isn't complete.

106
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,958
We need Toma...

107
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,875
Enemy or not, he's the
only one who can help us.

108
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,958
You children truly know
nothing of the past...

109
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,958
Think of the name: Solar Wing...

110
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,375
It cannot awaken without
the presence of angels.

111
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,916
Reika!

112
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,458
Teleport detected
in Vector Luna!

113
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,208
But who's trying to teleport?

114
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,666
It looks like a Shadow Angel.

115
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,250
Where'd Reika go?

116
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,875
Rieka! Reika!

117
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,875
Toma!

118
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,708
I should have let the kid kill
you when he had the chance.

119
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,250
Now I'll do it for him instead.

120
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,166
Pitiful Wingless One...

121
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,125
I shall not die by your hand.

122
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,666
My legacy will be greater.

123
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,166
If I must sacrifice
my life to restore

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,125
the Shadow Angels
to power, then so be it.

125
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,791
I will become Solar Wing!

126
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,500
Are you alright?

127
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,458
Yeah...

128
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,166
I'll be fine.

129
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,416
Toma!

130
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,666
Apollo...! I have to go.

131
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,791
Silvia!

132
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,833
Apollo!

133
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,958
What are you doing?

134
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,708
Please don't go after them!

135
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,750
I have to help...
You heard Toma.

136
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,041
The world's falling apart.

137
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,500
Then let me come too...

138
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,541
Please, don't leave
me behind like this.

139
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,083
No. I need you to stay here and
protect Chibiko and the others!

140
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,666
I swore to Baron
I would rescue them...

141
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,875
Please help me
keep that promise.

142
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,708
No, wait!

143
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,583
Apollo!

144
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,958
I should have killed you
twelve thousand years ago!

145
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,291
That's right, wingless ones.

146
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:15,333
Just follow me. Genesis merge!

147
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,833
No! Over my dead body!

148
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,541
No way you're going to be
the Head Element, you bastard!

149
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,875
Your kind stole
my friends' lives...

150
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,375
Now back down!

151
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,333
You're nothing
but wingless filth!

152
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,208
You betrayed me!

153
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,208
It appears all three
Vectors are trying

154
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,000
to become the Head Element.

155
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,291
Their aura levels
are out of range.

156
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,708
If they keep that up, they're
going to self destruct.

157
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,416
Distortions in the Earth's
strata are increasing.

158
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,916
The movements are becoming
more severe every minute...

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,083
The Earth's crust
can't take much more.

160
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,458
Get away from me...

161
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,041
How do you like that?

162
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,666
Pierre!

163
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,041
You okay, Silvia?

164
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,625
Yeah, I'm alright...
just my arm.

165
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm glad...

166
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,458
Nice wing by the way.

167
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
Thank you.

168
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,333
It's back up!

169
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,791
That's it.

170
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,375
I'll use that Vector.

171
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,291
Let's go!

172
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Look out!

173
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,833
You've got to be kidding me!

174
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,083
Pierre!

175
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,708
Reika!

176
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,250
That was too close.

177
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,333
I'm going. They need help.

178
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,041
Rena?!

179
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,500
What're you doing here?

180
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,166
I thought you could
use some help,

181
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,958
but the teleport switch threw
me off just a little bit.

182
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,791
Let's go take care of this...

183
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,416
I couldn't agree more...
Merge One!

184
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,416
Merge Two!

185
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,875
Go... Aquarion!

186
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,375
This is amazing!

187
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,208
Aquarion Alpha!

188
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,875
It's almost too easy.

189
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,208
Good luck, you guys.

190
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,708
Apollo... Brother.

191
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,291
Fire Kick!

192
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,458
I may die, but I'm
taking you with me.

193
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,000
Change formation!

194
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,708
This is horrible.

195
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,875
They have to stop fighting!

196
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,041
How pathetic.

197
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,500
Commander?

198
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,291
Just look at them.

199
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,875
Can't you see
their blind hatred...?

200
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:38,375
Born centuries ago when Seliane
and Apollonius fell in love...

201
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,750
Look what they've done!

202
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,583
And now, the world
is dying again.

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm so sorry...

204
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,500
I am... But that day,
when I first met Apollonius,

205
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,541
nothing seemed to
exist but the two of us.

206
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,583
And I knew that,
whatever else changed,

207
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,625
I would always love him.

208
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,083
Even if... the world
comes to an end.

209
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,666
Even then-

210
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,916
I will never regret that love...

211
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,875
Tell me, Silvia, when
you place your hands

212
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,875
together like this, what
is left between them?

213
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,166
Right and left...
Angel, human...

214
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,541
When you place them
together, what do you see?

215
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,333
Find what exists
in between, Silvia!

216
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,708
Commander?

217
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,541
Do you see now...?

218
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,791
It's over... You're
no match for an Angel.

219
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,416
What now?

220
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,916
Just hold on...

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,916
I'm going to see if I can
break through the barrier field.

222
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,583
It's our only chance.

223
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,458
But how?

224
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,625
Just leave that part to me.

225
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,375
What's happening?
What have you done??

226
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,458
Shadow Angel...

227
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,875
Your luck... has changed!

228
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,125
Something that exists
in between my hands?

229
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,833
I don't know what he means...

230
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,625
There's nothing there.

231
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,875
Darkness?

232
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,333
There's nothing between
my hands but darkness...

233
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,291
Darkness and...
something else...

234
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,375
What is it?

235
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,500
There's warmth.

236
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
A light born out of darkness!

237
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,291
Silvia?

238
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,833
Brother.

239
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,500
Always remember...
you really are my other half.

240
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,083
Always.

241
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,583
Get away from me you filth.

242
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,833
What?

243
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,875
I can never forgive you
for what you've done.

244
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,250
I can't forgive you, but...

245
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,458
What is this.

246
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,125
Apollo, do you remember...

247
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,708
The day the world began,
there was nothing;

248
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,500
and there was everything...

249
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,125
There were billions of stars
swirling around in a great void,

250
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,791
light inside of darkness...

251
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,041
We were a part of it...

252
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,750
I think our souls knew
each other even then.

253
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,375
Our souls?

254
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,833
The part of us that
never changes...

255
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,708
no matter who we become...
or how many lives we live.

256
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,125
Since the world began...
I've loved you!

257
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,500
Silvia.

258
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,541
And now, together, we have to
mend the things we've broken.

259
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,833
I don't have to
do everything alone.

260
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,041
It's okay to need help.

261
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,333
I've felt so much pain,
so much hatred...

262
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,791
Is that what Toma was feeling

263
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:38,458
when Apollonius betrayed
him for Seliane... for me?

264
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:42,208
They have feelings
without wings.

265
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,833
They know pain... and joy.

266
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,416
I never understood how
the angels could suffer...

267
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,250
Watching their kind fade.

268
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,833
We thought only of ourselves.

269
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,500
And let the Earth die.

270
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,166
There's time... We can heal her.

271
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,125
Genesis merge!

272
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,416
They're actually Merging?

273
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,791
What the hell are they doing?

274
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,083
Look at the constellations...

275
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,625
They've become one!

276
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,625
Merge Form Genesis!

277
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,750
Go!

278
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,791
Aquarion!

279
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,375
It's never been like this.

280
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,416
It's... complete.

281
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,333
It feels like... I'm...

282
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,583
Free!

283
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,833
The Merge to Solar
Aquarion is complete.

284
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,541
I've never seen aura
levels this strong before!

285
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:02,375
Look...! They've really
done it... They've Merged.

286
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,750
They've done it.

287
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,250
They've become Solar Wing!

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,625
Apollo!

289
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,208
Thank you Silvia,
for everything.

290
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,666
I'll always remember this scent.

291
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,375
I'll never forget you.

292
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,000
Apo-

293
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,541
Don't leave.

294
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,875
I have to.

295
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,000
But I'll find you
again... I promise.

296
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,208
Apollo!

297
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,916
All right, it's time?

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,875
For the angels...

299
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,375
and the humans.

300
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,208
Prepare for... Genesis!

301
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,250
Chibiko!

302
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,375
She's waking up!

303
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,125
Hello, Chibiko.

304
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,208
Silvia?

305
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,000
How do you know me?

306
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,750
I saw Apollo in a dream...

307
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,583
He told me you
were going to find me.

308
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,208
A dream?

309
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,458
But where is he now?

310
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:04,625
Apollo... Where is he?

311
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:09,958
He had to leave... but don't
worry, he'll be back someday.

312
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,500
And until then...
You can see him there.
