1
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,000
What the hell does that mean?

2
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,250
It means "person"...

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,791
Can't you see it...?

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,541
It's actually a form of two
people supporting each other.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,500
That's stupid, it's two lines.

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,500
Look close...

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,916
It's not stupid, it's beautiful.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,416
Hey there, Tsugumi.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,583
Hey, Pierre, what's up?

10
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,708
Busy Saturday?

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,250
I've got tickets to El Sueno...

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,958
You wanna go with me?

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,958
Do you really want me to go?

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,458
Sophia, hey!

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,916
Well that's an ambitious switch.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,250
What a jerk.

17
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,833
Hey, so I was thinking
you and I could go see-

18
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,916
What's this...?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,791
Well, it's a
letter for Pierre...

20
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:03,250
I guess one of your girlfriends
doesn't have internet access.

21
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,166
We've been lucky so far.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,916
The Harvest Beasts haven't
appeared here in San Jose.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,625
Hopefully they never will...

24
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,875
So don't worry.

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,208
Our entire family is fine... Be
safe, Pierre.

26
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,291
Don't go playing the hero and do
something reckless, okay?

27
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,791
P.S... Our brother Lopez is
getting married next month...

28
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,250
You'll never guess who to...

29
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,041
Esperanza...

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,750
What, is that all you got...?

31
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,083
Now, let's shoot to score!

32
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:21,916
White hot...

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,291
...fire kick!

34
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,625
That was way too easy...

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,583
You girls up for round two?

36
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,041
C'mon, there's gotta be

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,291
another Harvest Beast
around here somewhere!

38
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,958
What's gotten into him?

39
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,250
I don't know.

40
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,541
You okay...?

41
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,666
What happened to all
that energy you had earlier?

42
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,166
Guess I used it all up...

43
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,583
Controlling myself around
you pretty girls. That's all.

44
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,291
I recognize bad luck
when I see it, Pierre.

45
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,875
No, I'm fine.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,916
What...?! Who did that...?

47
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,625
A- Apollo!

48
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,333
What's your problem,
man, what's the big idea?

49
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,458
Figured it would
liven you up some.

50
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,000
Is that how you liven up
people who look depressed?

51
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,333
By hitting them?!

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,875
Well... it worked didn't it.

53
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong with you?

54
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,083
Whatever, I've got
better things to do.

55
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,916
I need to do it.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,416
Don't care with who...

57
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,500
So, as you can see...

58
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,875
Aquarion's Merge Index is
defined by the Element's aura,

59
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,458
which we call Alpha...

60
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,416
This aura determines the level
of quantum patterns necessary

61
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,541
to create a bond
between the Elements.

62
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,083
But this is also determined
by planetary alignment...

63
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,625
We call this aspect Beta.

64
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,208
These factors have
the strongest effect...

65
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,458
But there's also the
influence of sunspots.

66
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,416
And of course...
there's the allure of the

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
Earth's magnetic field which
pulls these factors together.

68
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,583
These elements characterize
the given amount of energy...

69
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,208
I wanna do it.

70
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,916
Excuse me, Pierre!

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,291
Please explain merge in your
own words for the class; and go!

72
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,916
Yes...!

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,375
Let's do it!

74
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,000
Um... I appreciate your
enthusiasm, but "Let's do it"

75
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,208
is not an accurate explanation
of the merge equation.

76
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,833
How cute!

77
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,250
Pierre, you and Esperanza
look great together!

78
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,208
You are so disgusting!

79
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,375
I didn't wear this skirt
so you could stare up it!

80
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,916
I hope that hurts...

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,166
That's what you get
for looking... Pervert.

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,583
Whoa, don't you
have anything to say?

83
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,666
Pierre's not
really himself today.

84
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,291
What's weird is he
wasn't looking at her.

85
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,708
Part of him is missing.

86
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,333
He's dead inside.

87
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,458
Mi- missing?

88
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,916
What do you mean "dead inside"?

89
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:05,916
Bravo...!

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,750
Bravissimo, Pierre!

91
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,375
Pierre!

92
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,333
What's wrong with you...?!

93
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,791
Snap out of it!

94
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,708
I need it...

95
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:29,416
I need to merge...
I need... I need...

96
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,333
Apollo...! Hold him down!

97
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,291
I need to merge!

98
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,458
It seems that Pierre has
become addicted to merging.

99
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,916
Pierre's addicted...?

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,250
What's that supposed to mean?

101
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,375
Addiction is a sickness

102
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,208
where you can't live
without something.

103
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,791
I get that, but we're
talking about Pierre?

104
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,083
I'm afraid that he is...
His dopamine levels

105
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,625
have dramatically dropped
since his last merge...

106
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,333
This clearly shows dependency.

107
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,250
But he's going to
be all right, isn't he?

108
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,958
This was just a simulation...

109
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,666
You saw his reaction...

110
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,791
If this... If this had
been a real merge, then...

111
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,041
...his mental state would
have probably collapsed.

112
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,833
A Harvest Beast has been
detected over San Jose...!

113
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,125
All Elements...
Prepare to launch!

114
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,000
San Jose... No, it can't be!

115
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,125
Let me out...!

116
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,375
Let me out of here!

117
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,000
Esperanza!

118
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,000
Lopez...! Get out of here!

119
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,541
I'm not leaving.

120
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,208
Alright, let's do this!

121
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:04,958
Merge One!

122
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,916
Merge Two!

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,291
Go, Aquarion!

124
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,500
Ah... The Wingless
Ones have arrived.

125
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,375
Lets do some damage!

126
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,416
Apollo...! There's
another one behind us!

127
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,708
What the?!

128
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,666
Lets even the odds!

129
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,708
Easy enough...

130
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,375
Why do they bother?

131
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,875
Apollo, look!

132
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,958
Focus...

133
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,500
Psychic eye!

134
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,041
Analyzing internal structure!

135
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,041
There it is...!

136
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,833
The other one is
the controlling unit!

137
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,000
That's not fair!

138
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,000
But now that we know that...

139
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,291
his cheating ass is ours!

140
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,541
Infinity Punch!

141
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,250
That got him!

142
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,500
How the...?

143
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,833
Jun...! Wasn't
that the controller?!

144
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,875
Whoa...

145
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,500
The weak spot's
moving between them!

146
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,666
What do you mean "moving"?!

147
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,666
No way!

148
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,250
Kumbha and Nikumbha.

149
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,708
Two bodies sharing
a single heart.

150
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,833
If Kumbha is in battle, the
heart moves to Nikumbha...

151
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,333
In effect, their heart is
never exposed to danger.

152
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Together they are invincible...

153
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,666
They'll never stop...

154
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,583
They'll fight for
the span of eternity,

155
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,166
if that's what it takes.

156
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,000
But... How long can
the Wingless Ones last?

157
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
Vector Luna...!
Do you copy...?

158
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,583
Vector Luna!

159
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,791
Silvia's bio-energy
levels are dropping!

160
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,083
Her aura is weakening!

161
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,625
I'm not sure how much
more she can take!

162
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,541
Silvia.

163
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,916
Initiate Teleport...!

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,291
Tsugumi, switch with Silvia!

165
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,958
Sir!

166
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,958
Apollo... Jun...

167
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,416
We can do this.

168
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
Chloe! Man her station...!

169
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,708
We've got a long
battle ahead of us.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,041
Stay alert, everyone!

171
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,958
I could strangle
Pierre right now...

172
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,666
What a perfect
time to be useless.

173
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,166
Merge One!

174
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,958
Merge Two!

175
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,708
Let me do it!

176
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,541
Pathetic!

177
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,208
Chloe, take Jun's place!.

178
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,083
Reika, take over for Tsugumi.

179
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:47,916
Roger!

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,750
Let me out of here, now!

181
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,541
Let me... Let me merge!

182
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,083
Merge One!

183
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,083
Merge Two!

184
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,958
Go, Aquarion!

185
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,458
Aquarion Luna!

186
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,791
Spinning Blades!

187
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,833
Divine Wind Blade!

188
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,666
Dragon... Thunder!

189
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,083
We got him.

190
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,375
Look out!

191
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,208
This character...

192
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,375
means "person" yet it's two
people supporting each other.

193
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,166
Seems rather trite to me.

194
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,375
Two people relying on
one other for support?

195
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,583
They'll inevitably
become weak and fall.

196
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,125
I... I need...

197
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,000
You have to let me merge!

198
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,541
If you're going to support
another, then you better

199
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,750
be able to support yourself
without their help.

200
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:15,125
And if you're going to collapse,
you should fall alone.

201
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,166
Initiate Teleport...!

202
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,625
Sirius for Reika!

203
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,375
Yes, sir!

204
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,083
Please... She needs me...

205
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's end this!

206
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,250
A direct hit.

207
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,125
Finally.

208
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,333
What?

209
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,583
Chloe!
Her bio-energy's dropping!

210
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,666
Teleport...!

211
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,958
Send the next available cadet!

212
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,583
There's no one else...

213
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,708
Get the trainees...!

214
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,583
It's an emergency!

215
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,625
Quit sniveling... You had
the best simulation scores

216
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,500
in your class, you'll be fine.

217
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,583
Sir!

218
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,166
San Jose... is my home!

219
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,875
You can't stop me!

220
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,791
You can't...!

221
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,208
You could be paralyzed!

222
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,125
Wait, come back!

223
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,333
You sure about this?

224
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,916
Merging might destroy me,

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,750
but if that's what it takes to
save my loved ones, so be it.

226
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,291
You mean it, don't you?

227
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,958
My family lives in San Jose.

228
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,333
Your family?

229
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,500
Well... why didn't you say so...

230
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,541
Merge One!

231
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,708
Go Merge Two!

232
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:56,375
Go, Aquarion!

233
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,208
What's wrong?

234
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,500
Feels like I'm burning.

235
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,458
What is this heat?

236
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,708
Aquarion... Mars!

237
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,875
Firekick!

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,541
We're not done yet!

239
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,625
Let's go for the goal!

240
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,208
Dribble, dribble,
dribble, dribble, dribble.

241
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,958
Dribble, dribble, dribble...

242
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,833
Dribble, dribble...

243
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,541
This is impossible...

244
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,416
Aquarion's
engulfed in flames...!

245
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,708
We're on fire!

246
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,375
Dribble and shoot!

247
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,250
Pierre! Pierre!

248
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,291
He's not responding!

249
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,791
Apollo! Try to slow us down!

250
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,250
Right!

251
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,583
Wake up! Esperanza! Come on!

252
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,125
You have to get up...!

253
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,208
Esperanza, please,
they're coming back...!

254
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,583
She'll be fine, Anna,
she's fine, I promise...

255
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:54,208
Lopez... Esperanza.

256
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,958
Goodbye... Pierre.

257
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,875
Pierre! His levels have
reached critical status!.

258
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:16,916
He's dying!

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,125
Chief!

260
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,625
Apollo! You have to
try to undo the merge!

261
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:24,083
Or try to find some
way to pilot Aquarion!

262
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,791
Forget it... This fight
belongs to Pierre, not me.

263
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,458
You're not serious!.

264
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,000
He can't fight,
he's on the verge of dying!

265
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,791
He has to do this!

266
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,666
It's his battle, I won't
take that away from him!

267
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,416
We saw the flames of his passion
and only he can put them out.

268
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,250
This is insubordination...

269
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,583
Fine, you leave me no choice!

270
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,750
I'll override the merge!

271
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,166
They're not disengaging...!

272
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
What's going on?!

273
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,916
The merge index
is too elevated...

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,458
Aquarion's not responding
to any remote commands.

275
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,458
But that's impossible!

276
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,625
Try to get up... Pierre!

277
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,208
He can't rise.

278
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,708
He hasn't finished collapsing...

279
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,041
So how could he possibly get up

280
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,375
if he's still in the
process of falling?

281
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,750
He must fall...
Let him fall the whole way.

282
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,625
Before a person
can support another...

283
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,583
He must be able to
stand and carry himself...

284
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,208
We stand alone
to stand together,

285
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,916
he still craves support.

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,208
Craves support?

287
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,000
You mean his
addiction to merging?

288
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,333
That's okay...

289
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,250
You're not the only woman.

290
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,916
I don't need to need you.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,583
I was...

292
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,333
I was just hoping
someone would carry me,

293
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,916
because I was scared?

294
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,291
After a person has
entirely collapsed,

295
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,125
he is left with only
one possible choice.

296
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,916
He has to stand up

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,625
with both of his feet
firmly planted on the ground.

298
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,958
Just like this character.

299
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,791
A person must spread
his arms to be...

300
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,708
Great!

301
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,041
Rise up... on... your... own!

302
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,625
Esperanza!

303
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
Lopez, Anna!

304
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,916
Are you alright?

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,333
Here, hold on to me.

306
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,541
I can't believe it.

307
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,833
Ole...! Aquarion!

308
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,500
Pierre hey,

309
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,541
Come in!

310
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,000
I haven't kicked the bucket yet!

311
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,458
Then lets kick ass.

312
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,458
Aquarion is back up!

313
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,458
Are they okay?

314
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,208
All systems seem to be normal!

315
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,541
Energy levelssteadily rising!

316
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,541
Amazing!

317
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,625
Has Pierre
overcome the addiction?

318
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,416
These boys don't
know when to quit.

319
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,833
Go for the goal, Pierre.

320
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,083
Let's finish this
game and win it!

321
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,958
Damn straight.

322
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,291
Fire up!

323
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:33,791
Heartbreak... attack!

324
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,541
And Pierre approaches
for the final kick!

325
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,416
He shoots!

326
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,375
It looks good... And he scores!

327
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,541
Bravissimo!

328
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,916
So the fire is within them.

329
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Yes, and I want it to burn...

330
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,208
Burn brightly...
for our grand resurrection.

331
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,125
Could it really be?

332
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,416
Good luck, you two.

333
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,083
Releasing... merge bond.

334
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,125
I'm happy Pierre's
fully recovered...

335
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,708
I was afraid that he wouldn't.

336
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,208
Me too.

337
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,708
But from this point on...
I'm going to carefully observe

338
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,291
all the Elements'
psychological conditions...

339
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,833
If one of you
could become addicted,

340
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,333
then it can happen again.

341
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,208
I highly doubt that.

342
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,125
You never know...

343
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,791
Although, thankfully,
no one else

344
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,916
seems quite as
susceptible as Pierre.

345
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But I'll still run full checks
on all of you, just to be safe.

346
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,750
Yeah.

347
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,916
Mirror, mirror,
on the wall...

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,041
Tell me who's the
loveliest of them all.

349
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,083
Please, you have
to let me do it.

350
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:11,750
I want to merge,
I want to merge.

351
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,916
Rena, what are you?!

352
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,875
Next time on Aquarion:
"Black Mirror."

353
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,791
I need to merge!
