1
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,708
It is year eleven
of the Holy Genesis...

2
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,666
The Earth, which
was laid to ruin

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,791
during the Great
Catastrophe, is now plagued

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,791
by relentless attacks from
the Shadow Angels of Atlandia,

5
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,541
who have awakened
after 12,000 years ...

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,958
The planet's only chance

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,708
for survival lies in the
hands of the Elements...

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,166
a group of extraordinary
youths whose rare gifts

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,500
have enabled them to set
forth on this noble mission.

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,958
They have been chosen to
unite in mind, body, and soul

11
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,625
in the hopes that
their combined power

12
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,000
will be the salvation
of the human race.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,125
Aquarion!

14
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,666
Such incredible power...!

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,375
It feels... so good...!

16
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,250
Master...

17
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,125
The Wingless Ones...

18
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,208
Yes.

19
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,583
Otoha, how long
have I been at rest?

20
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,541
12,000 years my lord.

21
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,750
12,000 years...?

22
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,833
And what has become
of the Lower World?

23
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,083
The Earth is in
a state of decline,

24
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,375
as it has been ever since
that foolish human ate

25
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,958
of the Fruit of Knowledge...

26
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,875
It has become a vile place...

27
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,625
So... the Wingless Ones continue

28
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,375
to defile our grand
dreams of paradise...

29
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,708
My lord... you must know...

30
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,375
The one who betrayed us...

31
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,666
The one who betrayed you...

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,416
Solar Wing...

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,625
He's been resurrected...
hasn't he?

34
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,375
It would seem so...

35
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,791
And he seeks to
battle us once again...

36
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,125
Then we shall give
him what he wants.

37
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,250
I'll ask you one more time...

38
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,583
What's your name...?

39
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,250
How old are you...?

40
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,458
Do you have any family?

41
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:00,916
Look...

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,166
It's been a long day.

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,125
Why don't you make
it easier on all of us...

44
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,958
Just a couple answers
and we're through.

45
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,291
It's easy...

46
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
What's your name...?

47
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,791
How old are you...?

48
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,750
Do you have any family?

49
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,875
I am talking to you...!

50
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,625
You deaf?!
You filthy street rat?!

51
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,125
Hey...! Get Down!!

52
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,875
Stay right where you are!!

53
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,250
C- Commander...?

54
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,083
Who are you?

55
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,708
So you do speak...

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,416
Well, before I answer
your questions...

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,541
You'll do the polite thing...
and answer ours first.

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,958
Now for the last time...

59
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,625
What do you call yourself?

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,041
Apollo.

61
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,333
Apollo... a fine name.

62
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,541
So, brother?

63
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,625
We did it--our first Merge!

64
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,666
What was it like for you?

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,916
It was like the entire
world had been reborn.

66
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,916
It felt like ten thousand
white roses caressing me...

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,625
It was like waking up to
the face of my one true love.

68
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,291
Such incredible power...

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,625
...so good...!

70
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,625
Yeah... me too.

71
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,000
There was a blinding light...

72
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,166
It was beautiful... like
something from another world

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,500
like it was shining
down from paradise...

74
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,916
At least that's what I thought.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,958
I'll never forget that
first merge with Reika.

76
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,208
You were talking about her?!

77
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,833
Maybe I saw the ultimate
light the light of creation

78
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,791
the Alisia family's spent
centuries searching for

79
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,791
to finally guide us to complete
peace and understanding...

80
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,916
But... I didn't see
it the second time.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,541
Not with that boy...

82
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,833
I can't believe a man as
smart as Fudo is convinced

83
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,458
he's the reincarnation
of Solar Wing.

84
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,583
It's sacrilege.

85
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,833
The time I merged with Apollo
was so violent and aggressive...

86
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,833
Not beautiful, the way a
real merge is supposed to be.

87
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,166
It's true...!
That's why it can't be him!

88
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,250
He can't!!

89
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,916
He simply can't be
the Solar Wing...!

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,916
Everyone knows
that it's you, brother.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,333
Silvia... You mustn't be so
frivolous with your claims.

92
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,000
But why?

93
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,833
It's dangerous.

94
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
Damn you!!!...!

95
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,541
Let me out of this hell hole!!

96
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,208
Look at him...!

97
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,708
Is this kid for real...?

98
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,625
I've seen rabid dogs more
well behaved than this urchin.

99
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,333
It stretches the imagination...

100
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,916
to think he's the same Solar
Wing who saved the human race

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,875
in the battle of Atlandia
12,000 years ago.

102
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,458
Who can say?

103
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,500
You... You mean to tell me that
you don't know for certain...?!

104
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,375
You allowed a complete novice,
you know nothing about...

105
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,791
...to pilot Aquarion
without being sure?!

106
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,625
Apollo was chosen by Aquarion.

107
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,916
In the same way a
horse chooses its rider...

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,875
Aquarion chose that boy.

109
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,833
Huh, well, if that's true,

110
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,125
it does seem an odd choice...

111
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,958
I'm starving.

112
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,333
Here!

113
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
Go ahead. Eat up...

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,791
I know, it's not much, but...

115
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,500
We gotta eat what we
can to survive, ya know?

116
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,208
Baron...

117
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,625
You don't have to
be so afraid of me...

118
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,458
I won't hurt you.

119
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,666
You really are an animal.

120
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,208
That's what Commander
Fudo says that there's a beast

121
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,083
of darkness trapped within
you, waiting to be freed...

122
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,708
And you believe him?

123
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,625
Well, I'm not sure I see
you the way he does...

124
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,250
You're... blind?

125
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,041
I have other ways of seeing...

126
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,416
I don't need to use my eyes.

127
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,333
I was curious so I
came to find out:

128
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,833
are you Solar Wing
or just an empty headed beast?

129
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,833
You don't even know do you?

130
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,750
Makes you wonder, huh...?

131
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,916
I mean, if our top three
Elements get the crap kicked out

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,750
of 'em in their
first real battle, well...

133
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,875
It's too bad they
didn't send me out there.

134
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,625
Things would'a turned out a lot
differently, I tell you that.

135
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:33,125
Oh please... Send you out...?
Don't be absurd.

136
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,750
Sure, you think
just 'cause you're

137
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,250
some kinda prince,
your better than me?

138
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,750
Well you got another
thing coming pal!

139
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:09,791
Reika?

140
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,250
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,791
This is all my fault...

142
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,833
If I hadn't lost it up there
none of this would've happened.

143
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,208
This town... and Glen.

144
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,541
Don't be so hard on yourself...

145
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,916
It's my fault too.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,333
I should have done
more to support you...

147
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,458
Sirius, no.

148
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,708
Get away from him!

149
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,916
Silvia?

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,541
You bring nothing
but bad luck...

151
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,791
I don't want you
anywhere near my brother!

152
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,875
Anyone who gets involved
with you ends up hurt or dead!

153
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,916
But I...

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Silvia!

155
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,750
It's true!

156
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,041
No... It's okay...

157
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,541
Your sister's right.

158
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,750
Stand by at launch pad!
Stand by at launch pad!

159
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,541
This is not a drill,
I repeat, this is not a drill.

160
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,291
All pilots to launch pad.

161
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,208
Begin launch sequence!

162
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,750
Vector docking
sequence complete!

163
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,166
Host Elements engaged!

164
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,666
Initiating Vector start up!

165
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,916
Power levels confirmed!

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,833
Status check: all systems green!

167
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,125
Configurations complete...

168
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,291
Clear for take-off.

169
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,000
All Vectors standing by,
ready for launch!

170
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,583
Initiating countdown
sequence, ten seconds...!

171
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:23,916
9... 8... 7...
6... 5... 4... 3...

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,708
Vector Sol, ready for takeoff!

173
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,958
Vector Mars, taking off!

174
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,333
Vector Luna, taking off!

175
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,000
Harvest Beast sighted...
It's directly ahead!

176
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,333
So merciless.

177
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,791
I'm not gonna let you
down this time, Glen.

178
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,083
Vector Sol to team...
Formation S-L-M.

179
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,583
Code-name...! Battle Leviathan!

180
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,041
 Quantum levels augmented.

181
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,083
Aura resonance at Merge level.

182
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,291
Merge One!

183
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,458
Go Merge Two!

184
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,208
Go...! Aquarion--

185
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,125
Do you sense something?

186
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,916
I don't know.

187
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,333
Baron...

188
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,916
Delicious.

189
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,208
There's something wrong
with Reika's psyche level!

190
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,083
The fear in Aquarion's
response field has spiked!

191
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,791
Help her...!

192
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,708
She's having some
kind of a flashback!

193
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,708
Syncro Failure!

194
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,708
Merge index has dropped
to critical levels...

195
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,291
Abort merge!

196
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,833
Vector Sol: Multi-dimensional
quantum levels fading rapidly!

197
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,500
Commander!

198
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
Let me trade places with her...!

199
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,416
We could do a teleport transfer!

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,833
Teleport transfer...?

201
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you sure you want to
do something that dangerous?

202
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,458
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were worried about me.

203
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,333
I'm worried about Reika,
not you, you big ape.

204
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,458
You're no fun, Chloe...

205
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,375
Seriane!

206
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,833
Why are you
just sitting there...?

207
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,541
I thought you were a fighter?!

208
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,083
What's wrong with you?

209
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,291
Have you forgotten
your warrior's pride?

210
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,625
Seriane!!

211
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,083
A- Apollonius...?

212
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,208
How dare you lecture me!

213
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,583
Who was that?!

214
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,416
He's calling Silvia
from her past life.

215
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,583
Then why don't you join with me

216
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,708
and prove you haven't
lost your will to fight!

217
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,916
This is amazing...

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,708
They've both crossed
into a past existence.

219
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,791
Move... I'm going in.

220
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,458
Have you completely lost it...?

221
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want to have
to hurt you again.

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,375
Hey, what are you doing?!

223
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,625
Start the transfer.

224
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,125
Will somebody get down
there and drag him off?!

225
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,666
Not so fast.

226
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,500
Now listen up... prepare for
immediate teleport transfer!

227
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,666
You heard him...

228
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,125
But commander, please...
You can't do this.

229
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,416
We don't know
anything about that kid.

230
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,166
And that's precisely why we
ought to test him and find out.

231
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,250
Activate the teleport sphere.

232
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,666
Teleport countdown...

233
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,916
5... 4... 3... 2... 1.

234
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,458
Transfer!!

235
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,500
Teleport complete.

236
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,083
Someone get a medic!

237
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,333
Let's go, you two!

238
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,833
We don't follow you!

239
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,708
This cretin actually
thinks he's Apollonius...?

240
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,125
Impossible!

241
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,250
Genesis Merge... Go!!!

242
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
How is he doing this...?!

243
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,791
Quantum levels augmented!

244
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,000
Merge index increasing!

245
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,208
Aquarion!!!

246
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,291
Let's take him out!!

247
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,583
The light...!

248
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,750
This could be the
light we've waited for

249
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,291
these last 12 millennia?

250
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,000
Master Toma...

251
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,166
Otoha... the transmission song.

252
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,083
The soul transmission
song... play it.

253
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,041
That voice...

254
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,875
Sounded like singing...

255
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,583
Wait--what voice?

256
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,625
It came back to life.

257
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,708
And it's even
stronger than before.

258
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,416
So that's how
we're gonna play it.

259
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,708
The Cherubim Soldier's
quantum levels

260
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,333
have increased seven times.

261
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,625
What?! Impossible.

262
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,000
You must've made a mistake.

263
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,208
It's no mistake!

264
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,416
Come on, somebody let me at it.

265
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,750
The body's too heavy...

266
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,958
Who's controlling the legs?

267
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,541
You're reaction
time is too slow!

268
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,458
Too slow?!

269
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:26,666
Here it comes!

270
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,166
What are you doing...?!

271
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,333
C'mon Seliane, you're supposed
to be guarding the rear!!

272
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,291
Oh yeah? Says who?!

273
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,250
This isn't a real merge!

274
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,416
We're not in sync at all!!

275
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,416
No!

276
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,500
Hurry...!

277
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,458
Do something Apollo!!

278
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,666
Come on!!

279
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,000
You've grown weak...

280
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,375
What's become
of you, Solar Wing?

281
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,208
Who's that?!

282
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,000
It's coming from the Cherubim!

283
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,708
Time has stripped
you of your glory...

284
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,875
There's not even a glimmer

285
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,833
of the strong, beautiful
Wing I once knew.

286
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:49,416
It's him...
It has to be... Toma!

287
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,333
Toma...

288
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,958
It's so... so cold.

289
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,125
What is this...?

290
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,625
This feeling--like
the light inside

291
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,250
my soul has suddenly
gone dark...

292
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,125
Their aura levels are down!

293
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,625
Their hearts are being
consumed by the darkness!

294
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,625
He's reached the edge.

295
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,000
Apollo's soul has fallen

296
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,916
into the inner depths
of his consciousness.

297
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,250
Solar Wing...

298
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,875
Please... Shine your light.

299
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,833
My light...?

300
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,166
The light which betrayed us

301
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,833
and cast a shadow
over this world...

302
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,041
The ultimate light.

303
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,625
Awaken, Solar Wing...

304
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,083
Take your rightful
place by my side.

305
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,125
My beloved.

306
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,916
It's too late!

307
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,416
Yes...! That's it!!

308
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,875
So the beast within
has spread its wings...

309
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,000
It's the light born
out of darkness...

310
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,041
The Genesis Light from which
the whole universe was made!

311
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,791
The purest light.

312
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,625
The light... I once loved.

313
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,166
What...?! I can't
do the preview!

314
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,458
Don't be silly,
of course you can, brother!

315
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,833
Everything you do is perfect!

316
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,083
Very well...

317
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,750
Next time on Aquarion:
"Element School."

318
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,750
There, you see...?

319
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,250
I knew you'd be great at it!
