1
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,000
You can beat him brother!

2
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,916
Are those two
freaks still at it?

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,583
Three minutes thirty
seconds and counting.

4
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,458
That's crazy.

5
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,916
It's like they're not human...

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,250
No doubt...

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,666
I wish we had big breaths
like that, huh Reika?

8
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,916
Definitely...

9
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,000
Victory!

10
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,083
You imbecile...

11
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,208
That's the mission alarm!

12
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,875
Whatever you say loser... I win!

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,458
Oh yeah!

14
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,625
What is that?

15
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,625
I don't know.
But I don't like it.

16
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,750
Who cares... come on
guys--let's just do it!

17
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,333
Don't be so hasty, Apollo.

18
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,125
We don't know what
this is. Calm down.

19
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,208
What? Calm is for losers.

20
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,541
No, wait...!

21
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,833
I'm picking up some sort
of quantum fluctuation...!

22
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,541
We've lost our visual sir!

23
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,250
Apollo, what's happening?!

24
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,916
Power stone
modulation increasing...

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,583
Apollo! Respond!

26
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,541
Something's coming!

27
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,666
Reika's brainwave patterns
are becoming too unstable!

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,083
Stand by for teleport change...!

29
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,541
Sirius, take Reika's place!

30
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,166
Yes, sir!

31
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
That shape...

32
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,750
Silvia! Respond!

33
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,666
Apollo! Say something!

34
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,500
Power stone element sync
has gone completely off-line!

35
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,333
Reika...

36
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,958
...she hasn't come back!

37
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,000
Where is Sirius?!

38
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,541
He's gone!

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,250
You mean they've
both disappeared...?

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,083
No, oh...

41
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,291
You alive in there...?

42
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,416
Yo! Princess Screw-Up!

43
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,166
Shut up!

44
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,208
You-You look horrible...

45
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,625
I mean it, you
really look like hell!

46
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,875
What happened to your face?!

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,208
Your whole body!

48
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,833
It's hideous!

49
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,083
You idiot!

50
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,375
You're the same way!

51
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,583
What?

52
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,250
Horrible.

53
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,791
Look we'll be fine.

54
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,375
Fine...?

55
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,500
Communications are down, GPS is
useless, and we look ridiculous.

56
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,333
This is bad.

57
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,791
Is that really a cat?

58
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,250
I think so.

59
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,208
Of course it is!

60
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,791
It stinks like one!

61
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,916
So cute!

62
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,333
You have no idea how much I've
always wanted a cat of my own!

63
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,125
What the hell was that?

64
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,458
Without GPS capabilities
they'll never find us...

65
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,833
We don't even know
where the vectors are.

66
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,541
It's my fault.

67
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,916
We'll be fine... the way
out's just around the--

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,166
What?

69
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,000
Where did that come from?

70
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,291
Wasn't that thing behind
us when we started?

71
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,375
The cat got us off course.

72
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,416
Fine, whatever.
Let's turn around.

73
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,916
Are we even getting any closer?

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,458
I don't like this...

75
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,125
There's some kind of ominous
power at work in this city...

76
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,750
Who are you?

77
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,000
Is that a harvest beast?

78
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,875
No it can't be it's too little.

79
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,250
Who are you?

80
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,583
I'm Apollo.

81
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
Who is Apollo?

82
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,041
Not too bright are ya?

83
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,916
If you really wanna know why
don't you ask one of my friends?

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,250
Who are your friends?

85
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,000
Silvia!

86
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,791
Hey...! Reika!

87
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,083
Who are you?

88
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,750
Chibiko?

89
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,416
You're going...
going... going insane!

90
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,791
Losing your mind!

91
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,541
Up to your mischief again?

92
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,208
Tell me Otoha...

93
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,250
These wingless creatures...?

94
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,708
What are they?

95
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,541
The "wingless ones"
are cultivated organisms

96
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,541
that provide
Shadow Angels with Prana.

97
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:48,833
In the world below,
they call themselves humans.

98
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,750
These humans have
so many children...

99
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,958
Am I the only
Shadow Angel child?

100
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,375
12,000 years ago...

101
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,291
Just after you were born...

102
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,833
Paradise was destroyed.

103
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,833
I know.

104
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,416
The wingless ones destroyed

105
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,458
our beautiful city of
Atlandia, isn't that right?

106
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,083
Yes. And all
because of a traitor

107
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,750
whose name is too
reviled to even mention

108
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,125
You're talking about
Apollonius aren't you?

109
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,041
Toma got really
angry when Apollonius

110
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,583
betrayed the Shadow Angels
and made his wings

111
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,041
into a helmet to teach
him a lesson, didn't he?

112
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,916
It wasn't out of anger.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,708
It was out of love.

114
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,916
Toma loved him so much
he wanted to kill him...

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,666
But first, he did everything
in his power to save him...

116
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,083
He opened the
forbidden Crimson Path.

117
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,583
He called out.

118
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,000
But not even his mighty voice

119
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,000
could reach ears
stained by impure souls.

120
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,458
Because of that traitor,

121
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,375
the fruit of the Tree
of Knowledge was stolen.

122
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:53,083
The wingless ones bore children,
and populated the earth.

123
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,458
Meanwhile, the Angels
were left barren...

124
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,125
Oh...?

125
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:03,458
And so... Futaba, that makes
you our precious only child...

126
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,958
That feather...!

127
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,666
It's all right, isn't it?

128
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,333
There were so many,
I just took one...

129
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,125
But that's--

130
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,458
Futaba. Your mischief
has gone too far.

131
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,541
Apollo...! Reika!

132
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,875
Apollo!

133
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,958
Come on!

134
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,625
Where the heck did
they disappear to?

135
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,958
Thanks for
leaving me alone guys!

136
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,416
Reika...! Silvia!

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,625
Where are you?!

138
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,333
Apollonius...

139
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,875
What?

140
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,000
What's going on...?

141
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,500
How did I get away
from Apollo and Silvia...?

142
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,041
Where are they?

143
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,750
Here, use this...

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,666
Thank you!

145
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,375
Rena, how'd you get here?

146
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,000
This is just a dream.

147
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,500
Everything in this place
is a reflection of you...

148
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,875
...and the darkness
in your soul.

149
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,041
Darkness... in my soul?

150
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:12,916
Do you know...?

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,666
The truth about Apollonius...

152
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,625
Some of it, I guess...

153
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,041
He was a traitor.

154
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,416
Such a terrible misfortune.

155
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Apollonius was a powerful
Shadow Angel once.

156
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,416
He betrayed the angels...

157
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,666
And sided with the humans.

158
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,916
Do you know why
he betrayed them...?

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,375
Because he fell in
love with a human.

160
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,041
Because he fell in
love with Seliane.

161
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,000
S- Seliane...?

162
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,208
You mean Silvia's past life?

163
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,416
That's right!

164
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,416
I know; me and Silvia
were supposed to be

165
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
in love a long time ago.

166
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,916
Come on, it's just sick...

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,541
Really?

168
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,291
Well...

169
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,291
not that you're...

170
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,833
You loved me.,
don't you remember?

171
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,250
12,000 years ago...

172
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,958
We risked everything
for that love.

173
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,416
Silvia!

174
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,708
Silvia...

175
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,958
Damn it.

176
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,333
I don't know
what kind of game

177
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,000
you think you're
playing with me?!

178
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,833
But If I can't get
away from you...

179
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,750
then I'm coming
after you myself!

180
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,333
Hah!

181
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,583
Come if you dare!

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,250
He's a traitor!

183
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,541
It's the traitor!
Kill him! Kill him!

184
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,541
He's a Shadow Angel!

185
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,541
Kill the Shadow Angel!

186
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,458
Kill him...

187
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,541
Nooooooo!!! Brother...

188
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
Silvia!

189
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,583
Silvia!

190
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,583
Wait! Listen to me!

191
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,833
Nooo!!!

192
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,208
Calm down... please...
get a hold of yourself!

193
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,333
Silvia!

194
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,291
Silvia! It's me!

195
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,791
Brother...?
Is it really you? But--

196
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,416
I didn't want to
be seen like this.

197
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,041
During the teleport change
the subspace corridor

198
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,208
was out of sync...

199
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,541
And I ended up in this city!

200
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,500
Brother!

201
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,541
I'm so glad...!

202
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,583
It was just an
illusion wasn't it?

203
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,250
No!

204
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,958
It was real!

205
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,083
What?!

206
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,000
The idea really isn't
all that far fetched.

207
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,125
Witch hunts...

208
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,750
The Spanish Inquisition...

209
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,708
History is full of examples...

210
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,083
And if our secret is discovered,

211
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,791
that's what will
happen to us--believe it!

212
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,041
Human beings are that cruel.

213
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,708
But that's-

214
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,458
There's nothing.
Communications are still down.

215
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,208
Do you think they're dead?

216
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,333
Hey! Don't even think that!

217
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,125
Reika...! Where are you?!

218
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,166
Reika! Answer us!

219
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,041
Over here! Look up!

220
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,125
Reika!

221
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,583
Sirius...! How in
the world did you-

222
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,625
Reika...! Are you okay?

223
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,416
Thank you, yes.

224
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,750
I-- Dammit...

225
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,791
Let's pretend
I never saw anything!

226
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,166
As they say, some
things in this world

227
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,625
that are better left unseen!

228
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,625
I want you both to
return to your vectors!

229
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,125
We have work to do!

230
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,000
Are we going to look for Apollo?

231
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,125
No!

232
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,250
We're going after
that Harvest Beast!

233
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,500
But Apollo's out
there all by himself.

234
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,666
What if he's lost
and needs our help?

235
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,166
Our only duty is
to defeat the enemy.

236
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,208
We're not here to
search for missing people.

237
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,291
What could be happening
to them out there?

238
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,958
Often, a moth in search of light
flies straight for the fire...

239
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,583
The question is how
close they can get...

240
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,125
...without bursting into flames.

241
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,375
Here I come!

242
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,083
People!

243
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,916
Just hang on!

244
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,041
Chibiko! Everything's okay!
I'm coming to save you!

245
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,458
Save me...? From what?

246
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,750
Reika! Silvia! Let's go!

247
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,833
Merge one!

248
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,958
Merge two!

249
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,375
Go! Aquarion!

250
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,750
Aquarion Mars!

251
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,291
Harvest Beast! Prepare to die!

252
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,958
Who... are you?

253
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,625
Don't you recognize
me, Chibiko...?

254
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,708
It's me...! Apollo!

255
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Don't you remember your friends?

256
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,458
Friends...?
I'm not human anymore.

257
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,708
I don't need friends.

258
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,958
What?!

259
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,750
What the--?

260
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,375
Toma...? What is this?

261
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,208
I see you're still
pretending to be human.

262
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,041
Liar!

263
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,666
Sirius! Who are you talking to?!

264
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,166
It's only a matter of time

265
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,333
before your friends
discover the truth.

266
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,541
I'm a human being!

267
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,875
Oh really...?

268
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,916
Then why do you bear
the mark of your enemy?

269
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,625
I've become part of
the tree of life now...

270
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,083
And they put these
feathers on me too.

271
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
Now how could you
consider yourself a friend

272
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,125
to someone like me?

273
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,291
I don't care...! Feathers...?
Give me a break!

274
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,833
No matter what happens
a friend is still a friend!

275
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,666
If you're such a good friend,
why didn't you come rescue me?

276
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,958
You couldn't save
Baron either, could you?

277
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,833
I know the answer...

278
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,583
You weren't strong
enough to rescue us!

279
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,583
You're neither angel or human!

280
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,583
So tell me: What are you?!

281
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,333
I am... I am...

282
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,916
Who are you?

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,583
You can't even
rescue your friends!

284
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,500
Neither angel nor human!

285
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,666
So who are you?

286
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,541
What's happening?!

287
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,000
Tell me now...

288
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,916
Just who are you?

289
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,708
I'm... I...

290
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,708
I'm...!

291
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,291
I'm...!!!

292
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,208
I'm... I'm...

293
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,875
Who am I...? I don't know...

294
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,875
I can't remember!!

295
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,333
You're not Chibiko...
Who are you?

296
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,958
The real Chibiko loved her
friends more than anything else!

297
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,375
And she never would
have given up on them!

298
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,333
No...! You're not really her.

299
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,000
Now get outta here
before I kill you!

300
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,666
Well done!

301
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,541
Apollo!

302
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,416
What?

303
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,458
Let's finish this! Silvia!

304
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,666
Right!

305
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,208
Nice move...

306
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,750
Damn you!

307
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,000
That's enough!!!

308
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,250
Gotcha!

309
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:14,958
Guys!

310
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,500
Let's go!

311
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,083
Cursed Shadow Angels...

312
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,166
...before you ask us:
Ask yourself first!

313
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,666
Who are you?!!
True Identity Blade

314
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,250
Oh no! It broke!

315
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,875
I had no idea...

316
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:06,125
Apollonius' feather makes
the most beautiful sound!

317
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,541
This is fun!

318
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,916
I know who my friends are.

319
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,000
Apollo...

320
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,958
I feel... Like I'm
not myself lately.

321
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,375
I feel the same way...

322
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,708
Like something bad will happen

323
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,375
When that happens, merge!

324
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,208
I don't know
what's happening but-

325
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,750
Next on Aquarion:
"Sound of an Angel's Feather"!
