1
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,875
It's the vampire!

2
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,416
This is the end Reika! Hold me!

3
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,583
Get... off... of... me!

4
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,458
Stop acting like a
little girl, Pierre...

5
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,708
It's just a movie.

6
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,625
Silvia... try using
your imagination...

7
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,500
Isn't that right sweetness?

8
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,166
Hey! Quit groping!

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,583
Tough girl huh...?

10
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,041
Nothing scares you... right?

11
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,083
Did that vampire look
familiar to you guys?

12
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,208
I kept thinking I was
seeing Rena up there.

13
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,541
Jun, what's that...?

14
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,875
On your neck?

15
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,916
You've got two red marks...

16
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,458
Hate to tell you this, kid...

17
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,583
...but you've been
bit by a vampire.

18
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,416
Look Tsugumi!

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,791
You've got the same marks.

20
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down!

21
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,291
Deep breathes...
Please don't blow up!

22
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,166
Relax... They're tick bites.

23
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,208
What?

24
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,583
You can stop freaking out...

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,541
Ticks always
bite at least twice.

26
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,541
Okay then, there's no
such thing as vampires

27
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:01,000
and we can all just relax.

28
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,875
During the year of Holy Genesis,
great changes occurred

29
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,875
in the magnetic fields
of our planets...

30
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,500
These changes activated
many latent characteristics

31
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,375
usually hidden in the
genomes of human beings...

32
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,958
These characteristics
are the basis

33
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,291
for your abilities as elements.

34
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
Tsugumi?

35
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,625
Are you okay... Are you sick?

36
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,958
I don't know... I feel so dizzy.

37
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,416
Jun.

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,833
Someone call the
infirmary, immediately!

39
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,583
Unbelievable...

40
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,791
An anemic outbreak here...?

41
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
It just goes to show

42
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,916
they're not taking care
of themselves properly.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,875
Maybe, but for two to get sick
at the exact same time...?

44
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,416
I should probably take
another look at our meal plans.

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,708
Water is the dark
mirror to all things.

46
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,000
Wait for it.

47
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,000
Demonic blood suckers...
or vampires.

48
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
These creatures of darkness date

49
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,708
all the way back
to ancient Greece...

50
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,250
...consumption of human blood...
provides them eternal life.

51
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,875
They're repelled by crosses and
garlic and invisible to mirrors.

52
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,750
Exposure to sunlight
burns them to dust.

53
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,208
The character of Count Dracula

54
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,958
was modeled after an actual
person,... Vlad Tepes...

55
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,041
Better known as,
"Vlad, the Impaler."

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,500
Impaler?

57
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,916
Could Rena be
related to this prince?

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,250
From what I see here,
that's entirely possible.

59
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,750
What's this?

60
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,166
Looks familiar.

61
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,250
Hold on...

62
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,458
Now that I think about it...

63
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,416
One time Rena drank
my blood like that...

64
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,875
So she must be a vampire.

65
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,625
I wonder who's next on her list?

66
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,833
I can't believe it...

67
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,125
She's so little and cute.

68
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,916
Hey, what is it, Tsugumi?

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,375
I remember... I was
pruning roses in the garden.

70
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,750
Are you okay?

71
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,166
Hi Rena.

72
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,500
She what?!

73
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,625
Seriously...

74
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,916
She's taken blood
from three of us...

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,958
Could she be draining
us little by little?

76
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,416
That accounts for the
sudden outbreak of anemia.

77
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,625
I remember something else!

78
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,625
I fell during a
training exercise

79
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,791
and Rena came out of nowhere.

80
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,000
Isn't it a possibility that
every time Rena takes blood

81
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,333
from us, she's taking
some of our Prana as well?

82
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,791
Our Prana...?!

83
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,250
Then she's no different
than the Shadow Angels!

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,666
Then that makes Rena the enemy?

85
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Well... think about it.

86
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,875
Since vampires don't exist...

87
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,791
She's most likely
a shadow angel!

88
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,458
I see... she takes a
little blood at a time...

89
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,041
Secretly draining
our life force...

90
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,083
Reika.

91
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,291
Your gossiping makes me sick!

92
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,958
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,958
Silvia?!

94
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,625
Rena... Rena!

95
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,083
Apollo... Did Rena
come this way?

96
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,833
Huh?

97
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,208
You weren't looking for...

98
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,791
What are you doing?!

99
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,916
I was just looking
for something to eat.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,833
Idiot!

101
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,291
What's the hell wrong with you?

102
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,583
Never mind!

103
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,875
For just a second,
I thought you might actually

104
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,041
be thinking about
somebody else for a change.

105
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,583
You're you and
that's all I care about.

106
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,916
It's so pure... music like that
comes straight from the soul.

107
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Listen... her words are weeping.

108
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,541
You're an angel...

109
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,083
Will you sing
another one for us?

110
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,333
I got a question...

111
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,583
What's with the umbrella?

112
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,625
It's a nice day out.

113
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,958
Moron...! It's called a parasol!

114
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,208
It's a fashion accessory!

115
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,375
I'm sensitive to the sun.

116
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:40,333
Rena... why is it that
you're constantly avoiding us?

117
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,750
Rena?

118
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,291
This can't be you...
This picture's so old.

119
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,791
Suppose I said... It is me?

120
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,083
Careful, that's twice
you've hurt yourself.

121
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,833
Rena...! I was
actually looking for...

122
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,291
I can feel that
you're afraid of me.

123
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,125
The others are afraid as well...

124
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,333
That's why you're here?

125
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,666
That's not it...!

126
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,791
I just wanted to stop
everyone from gossiping.

127
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,958
I'm your friend.

128
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,708
It doesn't matter what
anybody else says...

129
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,125
I trust you!

130
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:12,333
Are you certain...?
Ask yourself.

131
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,166
Rena.

132
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,000
She still hasn't
come back... has she?

133
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,541
High-level quantum readings in
the vicinity of Lowland City...

134
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,958
Vectors, dispatch immediately.

135
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,291
Guys...?

136
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,833
Why is it getting so dark?!

137
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,000
Wait!

138
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:10,875
Where are they?

139
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,000
Probably hiding like cowards.

140
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,083
Are we close?

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,916
Come out already.

142
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,458
Where are you hiding?

143
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,416
Vitals summary...

144
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,666
Their pulses are rising.

145
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,875
Emotional auras
are shifting rapidly.

146
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,083
Fear and anxiety
are gaining control.

147
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,041
Commander...
their uncertainty

148
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,500
could undermine
Aquarion's potency.

149
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,333
Let's see.

150
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,791
Is that it...? I can't tell.

151
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,208
Could it be?

152
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,000
Rena's the enemy!

153
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,500
Now what?

154
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,791
She's a vampire
and a Harvest Beast!

155
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,250
No way!

156
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh no.

157
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,416
Rena...?! Find Rena!

158
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,083
It's no use... she's either
not responding or out of range.

159
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,875
Because she's out there!

160
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,541
Isn't it obvious.

161
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,625
It can't be.

162
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,625
How could this have happened?

163
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,625
Stop. Don't come near me!

164
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,666
Silvia...! Do something!

165
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,750
But, Silvia was the one who
defended Rena.

166
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,000
And it's Rena that will
destroy her...! Defend yourself!

167
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,416
No wait!

168
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,333
Well we just can't stand here.

169
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,250
That's Rena you're fighting!

170
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:14,708
Question...! What should you do
if your friend becomes your foe?

171
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,333
Commander...? What does that-?

172
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,833
Sirius, tell me
what you would do?

173
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,375
I would kill them.

174
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,750
You think you'd be able to?

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,291
Do something...!
Rena's gonna slaughter us all.

176
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,458
Please! Rena no!

177
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:57,833
What's happening...!

178
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:58,666
What's she doing?

179
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,583
She's feeding...

180
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,250
Leeching Aquarion of its prana!

181
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,750
She's gaining strength.

182
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,916
Let go of me!

183
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,541
That's not Rena I'm smelling...

184
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,708
It stinks like harvest beast!

185
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,875
Rena, where are you?

186
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,166
Apollo!

187
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,166
Come back to us...?!
We need you...!

188
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,250
I know you can hear me!

189
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,333
That mongrel has lost his mind.

190
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,958
Ree--Naah!

191
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,416
Listen to me...

192
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,291
The time is now!

193
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,375
Apollo.

194
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,958
Show us who you
really are... Rena...

195
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,541
Your friends need you.

196
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,416
Come home!

197
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,375
Rena!

198
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,791
Reeeeenaaaaaah!

199
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,333
He calls.

200
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:29,875
It's Rena!

201
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,750
But... how is she there?

202
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,708
I don't know...

203
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,250
I sure didn't teleport her.

204
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,333
That's not possible.

205
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,375
It's some sort of trick.

206
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,500
Watch out, she'll kill you!

207
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,041
Welcome back.

208
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,666
Yep... It's you.

209
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,083
Rena...? How did you...?

210
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,708
Silvia.

211
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,166
I'm so sorry... I thought...

212
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,750
I know...

213
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,625
I can be very frightening... no
one knows that better than I do.

214
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,500
Rena.

215
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,208
And you...?
Why aren't you afraid?

216
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,833
What, like I don't know you?

217
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,833
C'mon.

218
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,500
Let's do this.

219
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
What?!

220
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,791
Merge one!

221
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,250
Merge two!

222
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,666
Go!

223
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,750
Aquarion!

224
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,583
Oh my.

225
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,041
This feels... so strange.

226
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,291
It's lovely.

227
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,958
Amazing.

228
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,416
It was.

229
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,458
It's coming.

230
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,708
Get up!

231
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,625
Their aura levels are way down!

232
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,833
Bio-energy dropping fast...!
They're too weak!

233
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,541
It's sucking our life force.

234
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,125
Rena!

235
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,291
It's taken...
all of my strength.

236
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,708
Okay...

237
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,541
Then you know
what we have to do.

238
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,958
Drink from my neck...

239
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,958
This is your fight;
you can do this!

240
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,708
Really...

241
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,458
Oh no you don't!

242
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,791
We're in this together!

243
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,791
Rena, you can have
some of mine too.

244
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,125
Silvia, thank you...
both of you.

245
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,416
Alright then, dig in.

246
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:31,083
I'm sorry.

247
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,625
Element's bio-levels restored...

248
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,583
Energy's climbing.

249
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,416
Now Aquarion...!

250
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,708
Rise up and regroup!

251
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,875
That a girl.

252
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,333
Now show that thing whose boss.

253
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:48,958
You're okay?

254
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:49,833
But she...

255
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,208
Hurry.

256
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,916
Silvia... I need you to help me.

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,583
You got it.

258
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,208
Know your true enemy...

259
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:14,000
Vampire... Silver Cross!

260
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,583
Mirrors that reflect darkness.

261
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,333
Shed light on the darkness that
lurks within all of our hearts.

262
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,291
The harvest beast itself
was merely a manifestation...

263
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,166
their true enemy was the
fear they carried inside.

264
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,833
Please forgive me...

265
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,125
There are times... when
the moon is at its fullest

266
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,708
that I lose all self control and
succumb to my primal urges...

267
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,458
I apologize if I upset anyone...

268
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,041
I guess you're welcome...

269
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,958
Rena your elemental
powers are unmatched.

270
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,541
ESP and vampirism...

271
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,291
I mean...

272
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,458
Ehhhh...

273
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,208
"Receiver and giver
of life force."...

274
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,375
Oh and I almost
forgot the teleportation.

275
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,916
I want to apologize, Rena.

276
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,708
Somehow I got it into my
head that you were the enemy.

277
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,958
We all did...

278
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,375
Our judgment was
clouded by fear...

279
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,041
You're forgiven...

280
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,166
But I'll gladly remove
any residual guilt

281
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,875
through two little
holes in your necks.

282
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,958
What!

283
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,208
You won't be needing ours

284
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,125
because Apollo said your
welcome to his any time.

285
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,333
Ah what?

286
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,833
And Rena, his blood's
always the hottest.

287
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,583
It's okay?

288
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,625
Why not? Not like
it hurts, right?

289
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,375
Wait a minute.

290
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,750
Can't too much of that
be bad for his health!

291
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,208
Sounds like someone's
a little jealous!

292
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,416
What? What are
you talking about...

293
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,458
That's absolutely ridiculous!

294
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,875
You know, if it's ridiculous,
why are being so defensive?

295
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,041
Shut your mouth! Tsugumi!

296
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:17,875
Whatever!

297
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,375
C'mon. He's cute. Admit it!

298
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,708
Oh yeah, maybe to somebody
like you, whose blind as a bat!

299
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,541
You're blushing.

300
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,791
I am not blushing! Shut up!

301
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,750
Silvia loves Apollo...

302
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,750
I do not!! Ugh!
Would you stop it?

303
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,041
You do! You do!

304
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,708
Ugh! Shut up!!

305
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,583
Reika, I can't handle
much more of this!

306
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,583
Yes you can, Tsugumi! Be strong!

307
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,458
It's not worth it!

308
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,791
Tsugumi!

309
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,500
Next on Aquarion:
"Merge to Eat."

310
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,750
I'm so hungry!
