1
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,541
Oh, lovely rose in bloom...

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Your petals...

3
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,083
Dripping red

4
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,458
Your leaves lithe and green

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,875
Your lustrously moist
fragrance fills the air.

6
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:54,208
Receive my blood.
Let it flow through your lips

7
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,500
Drink it...

8
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,291
Taste it with your tongue.

9
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,125
Quench your thirst...

10
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,875
Before you wither and die.

11
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,291
What is he doing?

12
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,583
Reciting a poem, most likely.

13
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,250
You mean he recites
poetry during battle?

14
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,625
He says the civilization

15
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:36,208
that forgets the
poetic soul is doomed

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,833
Alas, I have lost my muse...

17
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,791
My poem remains... unfinished.

18
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,750
They really expect us
to write this report

19
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,458
on the Power Stone by tomorrow?

20
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,750
It'd be so much easier

21
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,708
if they'd just let us
use the Net, you know?

22
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,583
I mean, it takes forever just
to find anything in this place.

23
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,625
Yeah, there's an understatement.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,208
What's this one...?

25
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,958
It's so pretty...

26
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,708
It's called Lithica.

27
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,875
It's a book on the
properties of jewels.

28
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,833
It's generally attributed to
Onomakritos of Greece,

29
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,416
though certain scholars maintain

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,958
it's actually one of
Orpheus' poems...

31
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,333
I guess it figures
you'd know that...

32
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,750
This came from
the Alisian library...

33
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,000
I have to show Sirius.

34
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,958
See, Orpheus teaches
that the soul is eternal.

35
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,375
It never dies, it just moves
from body to body

36
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,666
in a never-ending
cycle of reincarnation.

37
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,750
In many ways,
jewels are also eternal.

38
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,833
So they're like a
physical representation

39
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,250
of the souls we
all have inside...

40
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,625
I thought Rena
was the librarian.

41
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,833
She's still bedridden
with anemia...

42
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,458
I'm just filling in for her.

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,833
I'm sorry, but... you're not,

44
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,291
allowed to check this out,
it's for reference only.

45
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,375
Well, fine then.

46
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,708
Silvia, hey... wait up!

47
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,583
Hold on!

48
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,250
I wonder what
she's so mad about?

49
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,750
Excuse me.

50
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,083
Can you help me locate a book...

51
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,541
The Alisian
translation of Lithica?

52
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,750
A red rose.

53
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,875
Left by the hand of a mortal...?

54
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,083
Then there is a wingless one

55
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,166
who understands the
beauty of destruction.

56
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,666
That may be... and that
might also be his undoing.

57
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,125
Such a bitter aura.

58
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,333
How perfect...

59
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,833
I'll show this human
what true beauty is.

60
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,791
Sirius... I brought
this for you.

61
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,208
I thought you said
this was restricted.

62
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,833
It is, but you're nobility.

63
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,625
That's the one exception
to the rule I overlooked...

64
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry I didn't
realize earlier,

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,541
wasn't very fair to you,
or to Silvia for that matter.

66
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,000
What's this...?

67
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,291
Is the Princess a Peeping Tom?

68
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,791
Stupid mongrel!

69
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,625
Amazon! That hurt!

70
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,791
It took me months to cultivate
these Kronenburg Alisias.

71
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,791
Sorry... but--

72
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,000
Look... there's
still some left...!

73
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,000
These crippled remains
don't even deserve

74
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,500
to be acknowledged as roses.

75
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,958
But... but they're
still alive, Sirius.

76
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,458
That means nothing.

77
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,041
Life becomes a joke
after such humiliation.

78
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,833
Yeah... that explains
why the noble Alisia family

79
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,250
is such an embarrassment.

80
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,458
Shut your mouth!

81
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,833
I don't care

82
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,333
if people say you're the
reincarnation of Solar Wing,

83
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,916
that doesn't give you
the right to arrogance.

84
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,375
What's this...?

85
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,500
Sounds like
Prince Sirius is jealous.

86
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,666
What did you say?!

87
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,333
Solar Wing is nothing
but a childish fairy tale.

88
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,291
Y'Calling me a child?

89
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,250
Sirius!

90
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,291
Stop it!

91
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,083
I don't care what anybody says,

92
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,083
Sirius is the
reincarnation of Solar Wing!

93
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,291
What are you doing?

94
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,333
Silvia!

95
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,625
What's her problem?

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,291
Oh, Sirius...

97
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:54,041
Fear not... A slight sting, and
your suffering will be over...

98
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,083
What...?!

99
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,541
Apollonius!

100
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,791
Apollonius...

101
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,208
They're too high...

102
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,458
What was I thinking?

103
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,958
A mere mortal like me
cannot even touch them.

104
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,250
Apollonius...

105
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,958
In the hope that our
prayers may be answered,

106
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,791
I give this to you now...

107
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,708
Take this jewel in your hand,

108
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,000
sparkling like the rays of
the sun as clear and beautiful

109
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,750
as the flowing waters of
a mountain spring...

110
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Take its power as your own.

111
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:19,541
This jewel... that has captured
the moment of the flame,

112
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,625
bursting forth from the
heart of the eternal sun...

113
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,375
...unwavering, undying...

114
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,416
the flame that dances
within our immortal souls...

115
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,125
Offer this to the temple, and
none shall refuse your prayer...

116
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,291
Carry it with you...

117
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,666
...so it may guide
you on the journey ahead

118
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,458
until the end of time itself.

119
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,916
Does the soul this poem
speaks to still exist...?

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,083
If so, in whose body
does it now reside?

121
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,791
Mine?

122
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,458
I don't believe it.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,083
There is no Solar Wing.

124
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,708
Reincarnation is a myth.

125
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,083
Without any warning,

126
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,083
the Shadow Angels have
demolished four cities.

127
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,083
The destruction is incalculable,

128
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,625
but this is by far
the most fatal assault

129
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,291
they've orchestrated against us.

130
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,541
Although we have no way

131
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,750
of detecting their
next location of attack...

132
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,250
You're wrong.

133
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,625
Our DEAVA analysts have run
a probability projection...

134
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,500
There is a sixty percent
chance the next target

135
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,458
is somewhere in Alabama.

136
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
Confirming...

137
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,541
They're connected.

138
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,041
Your prediction is inaccurate...

139
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,708
They will most likely
attack Memphis.

140
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,375
Based on what reason?

141
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,250
Look at this, it's evident.

142
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,125
This is a schematic analysis
of the 4 previous targets...

143
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,666
As you can see,

144
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,250
each location is on a perfectly
aligned set of coordinates.

145
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,958
And what's your point?

146
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,583
This isn't random...

147
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,708
They're marking a pattern...

148
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,875
And Memphis will
be the final point

149
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,041
to form a perfect pentagon.

150
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,666
That's absurd.

151
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,750
Are you actually claiming to
know what the Shadow Angels

152
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,625
plans are based on this?

153
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,208
I'm not making that claim.

154
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,583
But I do understand
the beauty of geometry

155
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,416
and I can see that
there's a pattern.

156
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,250
Then you reject
the expert conclusion

157
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,833
of our team of analysts on the
basis of such feeble reasoning?

158
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,208
Yes, I do...

159
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,166
There are too many lives
at stake for us to be wrong.

160
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,750
Sirius...

161
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,458
What's got his
panties all knotted up?

162
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,916
Harvest Beasts
have been detected!

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,750
They've appeared over Memphis,
just as Sirius predicted.

164
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,666
It can't be.

165
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,083
Brother was right!

166
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,208
I don't believe it.

167
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,625
Look! Straight ahead...!
Those lights!

168
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,166
All Elements!
Prepare for attack!

169
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,666
Like we needed
you to tell us that.

170
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,333
What is that light? Report!

171
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,750
It's unknown!

172
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,833
According to the optical
sensors, there's nothing there!

173
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,541
Whatever this light is, we're
not seeing it with our eyes!

174
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,583
Absolutely stunning...

175
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,125
It's beautiful...

176
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,333
Attention all Elements...!

177
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,708
Be advised:

178
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,958
we're picking up some
unusual brain wave patterns!

179
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,666
Beautiful...

180
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,000
I had no idea

181
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,333
such a vile beast could
give off such divine light...

182
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,083
As I expected.

183
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,208
The signs on his back
have not appeared.

184
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 Father!

185
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,666
Then this child
is not Solar Wing.

186
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,083
And all of our hopes are lost.

187
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,791
M- Mother...!

188
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,875
The restoration of
the Kingdom of Alisia

189
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,291
will forever remain a dream...

190
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,750
Your sister Silvia remembers

191
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,000
her past life as
Seliane... but you...

192
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,583
Did you hear?

193
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,916
They say this new Apollo boy is
the reincarnated Solar Wing...

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,250
Ah, no wonder he can
pilot Aquarion so well...

195
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,875
Stop it!

196
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,875
Silvie. Silvie.

197
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,583
Silvie...

198
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,708
I told you, it's time
for fencing practice.

199
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,916
Brother.

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,291
I don't have time to
deal with you right now.

201
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,125
 Brother... Brother...!

202
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,291
Why don't you want
to play with me anymore?

203
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,875
The lights way too bright!

204
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,166
Where is your courage now, boy?

205
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,541
What this one needs is
a character transplant.

206
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,750
Don't you ever talk down to me!

207
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,708
So he's just a
mongrel after all...

208
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,250
His poor friend Baron
doesn't stand a chance.

209
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,208
Apollo...

210
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,125
I'm the head...

211
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,125
Follow my lead!

212
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,625
Shut uuupppp!

213
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,000
So this is the power

214
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,250
of the sacred geometric
structure of Antichthon?

215
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,125
Even the wingless ones tremble

216
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,500
before the immense
power of its beauty.

217
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,541
Yes.

218
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,375
Bear witness...

219
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,083
Antichthon will bring
out their ugliness

220
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,875
and turn it into our power...

221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,125
I'm going to try switching
to the polarized camera.

222
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,041
What perfect dodecahedrons!

223
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,541
No, I confirm only
ten plane faces...

224
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,000
Which makes them
perfect decahedrons.

225
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,958
But I count twelve,
so are they warping space?

226
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:06,916
No, not space.

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,291
They're warping our awareness 

228
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,166
The Harvest Beast...

229
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,375
It's distorting our reality

230
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,958
with its multidimensional
geo-patterns.

231
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,041
How could something so
ugly be so breathtaking?

232
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,708
What's beautiful is vile;

233
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,291
what's vile is beautiful.

234
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,333
No, no, no...!

235
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,000
What a terrible aura!

236
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,416
You couldn't possibly
be the reborn Solar-Wing!

237
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,250
Thought you didn't
believe in reincarnation?!

238
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,500
Apollonius.

239
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,291
Apollonious, don't just
leave me here all alone!

240
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,875
Was that Silvia?

241
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,916
Emotional wave levels rising!

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,916
Amazing...

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,083
It appears the
beast is absorbing

244
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,625
their negative emotions,
all of their fear,

245
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,375
jealousy, and rage,
is being harnessed

246
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,875
and used as source of
hostile power against them.

247
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:05,750
Jealousy?

248
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,791
They can't merge now.

249
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,291
It just too risky.

250
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,833
As Aquarion, amplifying their
negative emotional energy

251
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,583
could prove to be fatal.

252
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,250
If it should destroy them

253
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,250
then that was their limit.

254
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,666
Initiate Merge! Aquarion!

255
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,583
Alright! But the head is mine!

256
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,208
Reincarnation is tripe...

257
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,291
But I'm still far better
suited to be Solar Wing

258
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,125
than that moronic vulgarian!

259
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,791
Sirius!

260
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,375
I'm the head!

261
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,250
Not a chance!

262
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,083
Did you forget?

263
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
I don't take
orders from anybody!

264
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,375
I am the chosen one... submit.

265
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,416
Die, you filthy mongrel!

266
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,291
What the-?

267
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:13,791
No...

268
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,166
Absurd.

269
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,041
Stop this now!

270
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,375
All indexes skyrocketing!

271
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,750
Their merge index has
entered the red zone!

272
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,500
At this rate, they'll
tear themselves apart.

273
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,083
Please just stop...! Sirius

274
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,291
Why isn't my voice reaching him?

275
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,791
Beautiful, isn't it...?

276
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,375
Shamed by their own ugliness,

277
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,250
the wingless ones are attempting
to destroy themselves...

278
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,375
At long last, Master...

279
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,791
Solar Wing will perish, and you
will have your satisfaction...

280
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,208
Is that what you
believe, Otoha...?

281
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,875
Or is this your
jealousy speaking?

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Solar Wing!

283
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,125
Purge yourself of
these dark thoughts...

284
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,583
Ignite the flame
within your soul

285
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,583
and offer your jewel
to my temple in prayer!

286
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,791
Structural limits exceeded.

287
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,958
Aquarion is breaking apart.

288
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,458
 Sirius.

289
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,875
Hold on...

290
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,583
I'll reach him with
an arrow from my heart.

291
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,125
Reika.

292
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,666
Stop it now!

293
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,958
Straight.

294
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,333
To the heart!

295
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,708
Brother...! Apollo...!
I'm begging you.

296
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,291
Can't you see,
you're killing us all!

297
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,666
Please, somebody help us!

298
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,791
Sirius...

299
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,958
Sirius!

300
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,166
Reika.

301
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,583
Don't you see...?

302
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,250
The shadow angels
are using their light

303
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,375
to distort your minds.

304
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,708
Reika.

305
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,041
Reika... keep your meddling
hands away from us.

306
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,666
Leave my brother alone!

307
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:18,375
Horrible... we're slowly
destroying each other...

308
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,375
It's so brilliant it
turned my heart...

309
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:26,125
...and then fear and jealously
became my only vision!

310
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,625
In this life, when one human
discovers a piece of their soul

311
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,500
in another, then they initially
experience true love...

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,208
But then love mutates
with the realization that

313
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,833
that piece is unattainable...
jealously replaces love...

314
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,041
Jealousy, the voice
of the human soul

315
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,583
longing for that
which is unattainable.

316
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,083
Longing is energy!

317
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,916
So their jealously
is their energy?

318
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,541
That's it.

319
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,333
I understand now.

320
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,041
Now carry it
with you and live...

321
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,666
Aquarion!

322
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm the head!

323
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,916
Please, stop this brother!

324
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,625
I was chosen!

325
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,333
So this is the
power of jealousy...

326
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,708
...the fire that burns within...

327
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,875
We must take it,
and make it our own!

328
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,875
Want some...!
Here have a taste!

329
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,583
Brother!

330
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,083
Nooooooooooo!

331
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,500
Their collective emotional aura
it's dropping its pressure...!

332
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,500
It looks to be
forming a tornado!

333
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
Aquarion's maximizing
their reaction quantums.

334
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,458
Amazing.

335
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,166
Our jealous weakness shall
now become our strength!

336
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:10,916
Jealotopia Gladius...!
The Jealous Sword!

337
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,416
They did it! They won!

338
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,791
Commander!

339
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,916
They did it! Awesome!

340
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,666
Fantastic

341
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,583
What happened?

342
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,875
Did we beat it?

343
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,916
It's a rose made of stone.

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,083
A jealous rose.

345
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,750
We've won.

346
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,125
It seems he has done it again...

347
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,541
Your Solar Wing
has defeated you.

348
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,958
Yes. Indeed he has.

349
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,250
However... the seed
has been sown...

350
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,375
...tiny though it is...

351
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,125
Oh, lovely rose
about to bloom...

352
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,583
Your petals, dripping red...

353
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,208
Your leaves lithe and green...

354
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,791
Your lustrously moist
fragrance fills the air...

355
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,041
Receive my blood...

356
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,916
Let it flow through your lips...

357
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,041
Drink it...

358
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,791
Taste it with your tongue.

359
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,333
Quench your thirst...
before you wither and die.

360
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,666
Begin your life anew... and
blossom... with destruction.

361
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,250
Blossom...

362
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,708
Um, Reika?

363
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,583
What was your first time like?

364
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,458
My first time? You mean--?

365
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,416
Well, yeah!

366
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,041
What else would I mean?

367
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,833
Next time on Aquarion:
"The First Merge"!

368
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,291
It feels so good...!
