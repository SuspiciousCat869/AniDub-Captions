1
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,916
Its composition is
80 percent carbon,

2
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,291
10 percent hydrogen,

3
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,708
and 10 percent organic
compounds containing oxygen.

4
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,583
In other words: amber

5
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,000
The evidence suggests that the
feather was not placed inside...

6
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,166
But, it appears that the amber

7
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,500
formed around the
feather at its center...

8
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,125
So you're suggesting
the feather belonged

9
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,125
to some sort of winged dinosaur?

10
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,583
No, the dates
are too far apart...

11
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,791
We've used carbon dating to
establish a basic timeline...

12
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,500
Our data shows
it's 12,000 years old.

13
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,500
12,000 years old...?!

14
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,208
Impossible, amber is
fossilized tree resin...

15
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,208
There's no way it could've
formed in that span of time...

16
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,500
You've obviously
made a miscalculation!

17
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,500
A single feather sealed
in amber changes

18
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,916
the course of our journey...

19
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,375
It must be delivered
to Solar Wing...

20
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:02,583
This feather will bring about an
ultimate end to our bloody war.

21
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,041
Chapter 6, verse 7,
"The Mystery Song"

22
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,416
from the pages of the
Book of Holy Genesis.

23
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
If that's true, then...

24
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,833
...that would make this the most
important discovery of our time!

25
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,500
Says the man who was
sure we miscalculated!

26
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,833
Well naturally I'm a
bit skeptical, but...

27
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,208
when it comes to
the Shadow Angels,

28
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,208
we have to analyze
every possibility.

29
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,583
We must listen to the
words of Holy Genesis...

30
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,708
Treat them with the
respect they deserve.

31
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,791
Y'know, there are better
ways to spend a day off...

32
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,458
Are you just gonna
sit there all afternoon?

33
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,500
Yep.

34
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,125
Well, I tried...

35
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,000
I really hope I get
promoted this time...

36
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah? How'd your finals go?

37
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,125
Not good.

38
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,375
Hey... they're doing
"Giselle" at the ballet,

39
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,416
you wanna go with me?

40
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,458
"Giselle" is the
story of a poor woman

41
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,458
who gets taken advantage of by a
complete egotistical jerk.

42
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,416
You sure know
how to kill the mood?

43
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,125
Look, just don't walk so close.

44
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,000
Aw, come on Reika,
don't be like that!

45
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,250
I tried to warn you, Pierre--my
bad luck is contagious.

46
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,208
So does this mean you won't go
to the ballet with me...

47
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,000
Cause I really like you...
Bad luck or not!

48
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,500
Now... Your birthday
is coming up soon...

49
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,958
What should I get for you?

50
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,541
My birthday...?

51
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,708
That's not for weeks...

52
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,000
This thing looks interesting!

53
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,916
What is it?

54
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,833
Those were quite fashionable
in the 18th century.

55
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,750
It's a flea trap--women used to
wear them under their skirts...

56
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,500
What about this?

57
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,708
Silvia.

58
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,583
Oh... sorry... 

59
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,125
Stop it right now Apollo!

60
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,708
Leave my brother alone!

61
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,416
He's the one who says he never
lets his guard down

62
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,041
He's an idiot, don't stoop to
the level of a child like him!

63
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,500
You're right this
is child's play.

64
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,416
I'm not a child...

65
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,875
I'm more of a man than you are.

66
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,875
You see?

67
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,875
The Barrier Field Generator...

68
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,833
Just look at it...

69
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,750
It's the top of the line.

70
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,875
The system isn't that different

71
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,750
from what you'd find
in any other city,

72
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,250
but its energy
output is way superior.

73
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,041
Cool stuff, huh?

74
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,833
The Barrier Field energy levels
depend on the geological strata.

75
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,708
The field is especially
strong here...

76
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,458
That's why DEAVA
chose to use this location.

77
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,750
How do you know all that?

78
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,791
I know everything!

79
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,208
What in the heck?

80
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:13,625
Those wingless bastards...!
They've broken the seal!

81
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,500
Are you saying
our feather has fallen

82
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,291
into the hands of
the wingless ones?

83
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,875
Yes, that is correct...

84
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,041
Lord Johannes!

85
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,291
What hopes were
invested in that feather?

86
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,833
The records are lost.

87
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,916
There is no question that the
feather came from Atlandia.

88
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,250
Therefore, we must assume

89
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,666
that the item contains
priceless information.

90
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,291
Lord Johannes,
we must get it back.

91
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,708
We can't afford to be hasty.

92
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,916
This could be a plan

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,208
by the wingless ones
to bait us into action.

94
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,791
Toma, you can't
seriously be considering

95
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,541
barging into Solar Wing's
lair by yourself?

96
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,083
And what would you
have me do, Moroha?

97
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,041
Sit back and allow
the filthy wingless ones

98
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,041
to discover the
secrets of our holy relic.

99
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,625
You misunderstand
Moroha's meaning...

100
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,833
No one is suggesting
we allow the wingless ones

101
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,166
to defile what
rightfully belongs to us.

102
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,916
The feather is being
held at the DEAVA base.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,291
How will you be able

104
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,916
to break through the
Barrier Field Generator?

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,750
Leave that part
to me my friends.

106
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,375
Do you hear it...?
That strange sound?

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
The tree of life...

108
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,291
Do you remember the tree...?
The tree of life...

109
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,000
There from the very beginning...

110
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,750
At the Genesis of the world.

111
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,416
Rena!

112
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,375
Someone call for a doctor!

113
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,166
Right!

114
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,541
Commander!

115
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,041
Well don't touch it,
we don't know what it might do!

116
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,750
Perhaps not...

117
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,000
Announce this to everyone...

118
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,250
Anyone who touches the
feather is going to be punished!

119
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,833
Why is that sir?

120
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,291
Don't ask questions...!

121
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
Answer them!

122
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,166
Brother.

123
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,041
Brother, what's wrong with you?

124
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,083
Go away!

125
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,541
Stay away from me!

126
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,041
Please stay away...

127
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,416
Please don't come near me.

128
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,708
Stay away from me!

129
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,000
Sirius!

130
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,791
Panties too tight.

131
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,958
Okay, that's not like you.

132
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,041
Silvia I know would punch me,

133
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,166
then kick me in the
teeth for good measure

134
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,875
Apollo!

135
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,708
Idiot!

136
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,750
See now there's
the Silvia I know!

137
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,833
Now... how 'bout we
go see the feather?

138
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,375
Fudo said not to touch it,
but you know me;

139
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,416
I've never been one
for following rules.

140
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,500
It might be able to tell
us something about Baron.

141
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,000
Baron, Baron...
It's always Baron with you!

142
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,791
Baron was my best friend...

143
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,250
Hell; my only friend.

144
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,458
They say that a fruit
never tastes as sweet

145
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,166
as the moment before it rots.

146
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,250
Master Toma...

147
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,833
We are prepared
to launch our attack...

148
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,375
You must wish to meet him
again... your dear friend.

149
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,833
I am going to meet someone
precious to me as well.

150
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,166
Very precious indeed.

151
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,750
Sophia...

152
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,125
Have you ever
told another person

153
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,166
that you were in love them?

154
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,291
Have you?

155
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,041
Yes.

156
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,833
Oh I see...

157
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,416
I'm so sorry.

158
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,958
Please don't...

159
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,250
It seems my question
has upset you...?

160
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
For all of my wisdom...

161
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,416
The mind of a woman is still
a complete mystery to me...

162
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,625
It's just a little mouse...

163
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,458
We'll let it go.

164
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,333
Hold up!

165
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,291
I smell something here.

166
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,458
Are you trying to tell me

167
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,916
you can actually smell
the infrared ions?

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,666
Ions...?
What the hell's an ion...?

169
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,708
All I know is it stinks!

170
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,083
I know this scent
from somewhere.

171
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,125
Where?

172
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,708
That's what I'm
trying to remember.

173
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,416
Apollo...! What's wrong?!

174
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,458
It's... It's the wing sign...

175
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,000
I remember it all so well

176
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,958
I screamed and
cried out for you...

177
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,708
And you... I heard you...

178
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,583
You heard me call
your name that day.

179
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,875
Apollonius.

180
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,875
Seliane.

181
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,833
If only... If only the
two of us had never met.

182
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,250
If only our stars
had never crossed...

183
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,833
For if we had never met...

184
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,500
I could have remained
a shadow angel...

185
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,000
The misfortune of our union.

186
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,166
And the joy...

187
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,541
The bliss of our meeting.

188
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,458
Seliane!

189
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,208
Apollonius!

190
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,416
I fell madly in love with you...

191
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,833
I fell in love
with a wingless one.

192
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,458
I fell in love
with you as well...

193
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:01,333
I fell madly in love with
a powerful Shadow Angel.

194
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,500
Apollonius.

195
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,500
I've been ordered to...
to execute you.

196
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,958
Then do it... Kill me.

197
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,958
Why?

198
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,791
Why...?!

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,125
Apollonius, I've captured
a foolish wingless creature

200
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,708
who was attempting
to save your life!

201
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,875
Seliane!

202
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,333
Apollonius!

203
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,875
How does it feel...?

204
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,541
To be so close, and
yet so utterly powerless

205
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,916
to save the life
of the one you love?!

206
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,791
No!

207
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,583
I will let the
wingless one go free...

208
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:10,083
I'll spare her life...
if you'll return to me.

209
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,958
Please.

210
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,291
Moroha...

211
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,625
Leave her with me...

212
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,750
I will take care
of this wingless fool.

213
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,458
I won't beg for my
life to a Shadow Angel!

214
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,916
Then you have chosen
the path of death!

215
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,458
No!

216
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,708
Apollonius!

217
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,458
You love her that much?

218
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,083
That much?!!!

219
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,958
We fought them...

220
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,125
We battled the Shadow Angels.

221
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,125
Together...

222
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,333
We fought to the end.

223
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,208
Seliane...

224
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,833
Apollonius...

225
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,791
What's the big idea?!

226
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,791
That's nasty!

227
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,875
Hey! You're the one who's nasty!

228
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,708
Do you remember what happened?

229
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,250
Uh... just barely.

230
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,083
In our previous lives we were...

231
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,416
Red Alert!

232
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,541
Attention Elements!

233
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,458
All personnel report
to command center.

234
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,500
DEAVA is under attack!

235
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,041
Hello, Solar Wing!

236
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,916
I've come for you.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,166
Silvia! Pierre!

238
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,500
Fire... fist!

239
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,708
From 12,000 years of
suffering come quiet signs

240
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,250
of devastation and destruction.

241
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:16,875
Next time on Aquarion: "The
12,000-Year-Old Love Letter"!

242
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,833
It's... sort of nice.
