1
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,375
This is all your fault, Apollo!

2
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,791
We had them in our sights
and you just let them get away!

3
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:34,625
My fault...?

4
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,750
I would've caught 'em

5
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,875
if I wasn't dragging
your dead weight!

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:38,916
Whatever...!

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,625
You're always
getting in our way!

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,875
What...?!

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,916
I'm the one who has
to take responsibility

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,125
for your failures...

11
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,875
Just put yourself in my shoes.

12
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,666
Good idea.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,375
We'll start with the shoes
and move upwards,

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,833
until you've completely
become each other!

15
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,625
Commander?

16
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,291
What's he mean?

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,125
That doesn't sound good.

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,083
Ya, no.

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,375
Hello...!

20
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,125
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

21
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,125
Why are you dressed
like that, Jun?!

22
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,250
Dressed like what?

23
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,333
And my name isn't Jun.

24
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,708
It's Tsugumi.
Tsugumi Rosenmeier...

25
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,416
Pleased to meet you!

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,041
What, the?

27
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,875
Okay guys, Jun's
finally cracked.

28
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,916
Just ignore him.

29
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,708
What are...
What the hell are you doing?!

30
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,833
Please don't yell at me!

31
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,750
I can't take it...!

32
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,041
My heart might explode!

33
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,166
Stopppp!

34
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,083
My melon loaves!

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,041
I can't take this.

36
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,125
Tsugumi, are you okay?

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,083
This isn't funny, Jun.

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,958
It's not a joke, in
order to become someone,

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,500
you have to start by
taking on their appearance.

40
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,583
What?!

41
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,625
Oh, no...

42
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,458
Please say you
don't mean Cos Play!

43
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,666
Yup!

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,250
I've been into role
playing for years now...

45
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,833
Oh here,

46
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,791
I've got some pictures from my
last sci-fi convention... See!

47
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,833
And we have
costumes for everyone!

48
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,416
Tell me he's joking.

49
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,375
I had the DEAVA uniform
department duplicate

50
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,833
your outfits into
different sizes.

51
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,166
No way.

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,916
Silvia and Reika...
Pierre and Chloe...

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,708
Apollo and Sirius...

54
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,125
You will each wear
the other's clothes...

55
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,833
And you will wear them
as if they were your own!

56
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,916
What? This isn't fair,
why do I have to be Reika?

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,291
This is absurd...!

58
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:33,041
I'd have to devolve
to imitate that mongrel!

59
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,125
And how can I be you...?

60
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,291
I don't have a stick up my butt.

61
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,166
Come on... Is it that bad?

62
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,041
Yeah! It's that bad.

63
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,916
Couldn't be worse.

64
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,791
I hate to tell you this...

65
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,416
But that means
you're afraid to admit

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,250
how much of yourself you
see in the other person.

67
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,291
What?!

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,875
She doesn't know
what she's saying...

69
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,125
You're nothing like him.

70
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,291
This sucks.

71
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,708
We already covered
it in basic psychology.

72
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,541
When people detect their own
repressed emotions in another,

73
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,375
they tend to reject that person.

74
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,625
So the person you might
hate or have trouble with

75
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,958
is the person most similar

76
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,250
to the traits you don't
want to see in yourself.

77
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,458
And no matter how much you
don't want to admit it...

78
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,791
You've got a lot in
common with them.

79
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,041
Whaat...?!

80
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,416
So, you're saying that
Reika and I are alike?!

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,041
No way.

82
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,083
Just my luck

83
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,375
Why don't you
all quit pretending

84
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,166
that you don't know
what I'm talking about...

85
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
Reika, Sirius, Chloe...

86
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,875
Your papers on
unconscious projection

87
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,083
were very well written.

88
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,208
This isn't a
term paper, it's life.

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes...

90
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,375
And the cold truth of
reality is always harder

91
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,375
to face than the
safety of a theory...

92
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,041
It's time to quit thinking
about the truth...!

93
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,166
And experience it!

94
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,333
Hey, Chloe...

95
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,125
You're always so distant
when I'm around...

96
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,541
Does this mean you actually
wanna get close to me?

97
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,333
I think not.

98
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:58,500
Well! Let's see
how you really feel!

99
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,125
That's sick.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pierre...!

101
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,541
I'm always so
standoffish towards you

102
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,791
because I don't like it when
you talk to the other girls...!

103
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:22,041
From now on, I only want
you to talk to me... 'kay?

104
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,916
Really?

105
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,500
But, sis?

106
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,083
Well it's true...

107
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,666
I'm always so reserved around
Pierre because I'm afraid that

108
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,708
if I open up he might
not actually like me.

109
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,416
Did you... really mean that?

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,625
As I said...

111
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,125
We repress our
compassion out of fear.

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,541
I'll show you compassion!

113
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,750
Oh, brother...

114
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,583
Don't you like me as
much as you like Reika?

115
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Back off...!

116
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,166
Now you've crossed
the line Pierre.

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,333
Brother!

118
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,750
Stop acting like that,
you're scaring me.

119
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,916
You sound just like Apollo.

120
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,166
Pierre!

121
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,875
No fair.

122
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,500
That's exactly
how you treat Apollo.

123
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,458
What?! You stay out of this!

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,916
Oh no!

125
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,500
My misfortune.

126
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,791
Do I really sound like that?

127
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,500
You're hiding food from me.

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,666
Melon loaves!

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,041
Hands off!

130
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,375
That's me.

131
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,416
Sorry, Silvia, guess
we don't have a choice.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,166
What?

133
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,791
Sirius!

134
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,250
Sirius...! Where are you?

135
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,125
Where are you brother...?

136
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,416
Please come back.

137
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,333
Don't leave me alone.

138
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,625
That's so tragic...

139
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,666
What kind of a world would
tear two siblings away

140
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,416
from each other?

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,708
Hark, Slyvia.

142
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,750
Let's talk about flowers.

143
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,708
Come...! I'll waste
your time with a poem!

144
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,541
Brother?

145
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,708
There you are!

146
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,208
Oh, thank goodness,
I've been looking everywhere!

147
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,041
I found you!

148
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,875
Hands off!

149
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,750
Stay away from him,
your brother's over there!

150
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,916
You're breaking character!

151
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,500
Okay, look Reika...

152
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,000
If you can so easily
pretend to be me,

153
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,333
then you can pretend
that he's your brother!

154
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,375
Come... beloved sister!

155
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,625
Uh, right. Sorry.

156
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,875
Oh brother!

157
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,208
Stop it!

158
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,208
What?

159
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,333
Huh? Ah, I...

160
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,333
Silvia doesn't
want us to see it...

161
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,041
But she can't hide the fact
that she's in love with Apollo,

162
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,250
although she's too scared
to reincarnate their passion.

163
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,083
Oh please no...

164
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,458
Don't be cruel, Pierre...!

165
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,750
You shouldn't tease them
with the truth like that.

166
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,333
What do you mean the truth?

167
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,000
Please stop.

168
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,750
See what you've done?

169
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,916
Yeah.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,208
Y-you've got it all wrong,

171
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,208
Silvia just got confused
and she thought I was Sirius!

172
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,458
Oh, sweet rose.

173
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,750
Your fragrance stirs my soul.

174
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,625
I crave your soft touch...

175
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,833
...and hunger for you.

176
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,416
Brother!

177
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,083
When was the last time
you looked into a mirror?

178
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,083
What're you all lookin' at...?

179
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,625
This costume crap's easy...

180
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,250
Just ask the little prince here.

181
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,291
You can wear the clothes,

182
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,833
but you still smell
like a mongrel to me.

183
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
How revolting.

184
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,541
Very convincing.

185
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,500
Convincingly pathetic.

186
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,458
Rena...?! You can walk!

187
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,083
You've mimicked
words and appearances

188
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,791
to create a mockery
of each other,

189
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,083
but inside nothing has changed.

190
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,750
It's you! But when- ?

191
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,583
From the very start.

192
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,916
Then where's Rena?

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,958
In the infirmary with Anemia...

194
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,833
As usual.

195
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,333
Look, old man...

196
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,666
Just cause you're magic doesn't
mean we're doing it wrong.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
This frog knows itself...

198
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:53,250
It doesn't have to try because
it already knows what it is!

199
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,583
What?

200
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,208
Sirius... it's getting late.

201
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,208
A frog doesn't try because
it knows what it is...

202
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,250
How can I become
something without trying?

203
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,166
You wanna be like Apollo?

204
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,291
You could start
by catching that frog...

205
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,041
...and then eating it alive.

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,375
He eats... frogs?

207
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,791
That's disgusting!

208
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,083
He doesn't just eat frogs.

209
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,750
He once told me that he hunts

210
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,708
for animals in the woods
behind DEAVA headquarters.

211
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,625
Then he can't resist
his primal instincts.

212
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,750
He tracks the animals
by their scent.

213
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,666
By scent...? Interesting.

214
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,250
Wait, where are you going?

215
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,750
I'm going hunting...

216
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,000
It's the only way
to become Apollo.

217
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,500
He can't mean that.

218
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,166
I'm afraid he does...

219
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,541
They can imitate
outward emotion...

220
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,708
But they can't seem to
see beyond the surface...

221
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,041
I think it's still
too early for them

222
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,000
to recognize the common
darkness within them.

223
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,833
Children always grow up

224
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:16,833
faster than their
parents expect them to.

225
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,958
They're on the verge of
understanding the truth

226
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,583
of the three arrows and
harnessing their strength.

227
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,208
I don't mean to
question you, Commander,

228
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,250
but I'm just a
little confused...

229
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,166
When you told us that story,
I thought the whole point was

230
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,541
that even three arrows together
could still be broken...

231
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,833
There's no weakness

232
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,083
when each arrow understands
the strength of the others.

233
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,666
Only through
their collective power

234
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,833
will they realize
their full potential.

235
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,500
Their full potential?

236
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,416
Sirius.

237
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,708
Mama, nooo! Father, please!

238
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,375
Where's mama!

239
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,583
Where's mama!

240
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,750
Reika...? What's wrong?

241
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,416
No, please! Brother!

242
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,750
Don't leave me like this!

243
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
Come back! Sirius!

244
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,833
Please don't go!

245
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,666
Is that... supposed to be me?

246
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,125
Brother!

247
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,666
Don't leave me alone.

248
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,125
Man, how stuffy
can a dorm room get?

249
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,125
It smells like an antique store.

250
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,625
Well that smells odd.

251
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,708
What is it?

252
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,625
Reika's bad luck
must be rubbing off.

253
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,458
Jeez, does Reika
always have it this bad?

254
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,666
Sirius...?

255
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,958
You've gone so far
to become Apollo...

256
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,458
I can't stop until
I've become Reika.

257
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,125
If you've chosen to
suffer, then so will I.

258
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,083
How does he do endure this?

259
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,541
Flowers.

260
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,625
It smells so nice.

261
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,750
Something's on fire!

262
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,833
Not them.

263
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,708
Everything burned to the ground.

264
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,375
Not now!

265
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,125
That is just my luck.

266
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,208
No, I can't go without brother!

267
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,416
This is absurd.

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,166
Yeah! I can smell them nearby!

269
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,333
I'm scared...

270
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,500
Something is wrong.

271
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,875
Like what?

272
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,541
What is that?

273
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,166
What the hell is that!

274
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,583
They look exactly like us...!

275
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,375
I've confirmed their
quantum patterns...!

276
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,958
They're perfect copies...

277
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,833
From their size right down to
their energy output signatures!

278
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:53,833
Look at that...!

279
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,500
It's like a mirror image!

280
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,041
How cheap can they get?

281
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,250
Vector Sol to all Units...

282
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,500
Initiate formation, S L M...

283
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:04,625
Call it codename,
Beautiful Shape.

284
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,291
Roger!

285
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay, let's do it!

286
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:07,875
Hot damn!

287
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:08,666
Awesome...!

288
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,708
They're still in character

289
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,666
without even wearing
their costumes!

290
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,125
Merge One!

291
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,333
Merge Two!

292
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,083
Go, Aquarion!

293
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,208
What happened?!

294
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,458
Merge failed!.

295
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,916
Their Third Emotional
Merge Level potential

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,833
is nowhere close to sufficient!

297
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,750
But that level
registers the soul.

298
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,083
The third emotional
level is vital.

299
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,041
Harvest Beasts approaching!

300
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,125
Look!

301
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,041
The enemy is merging!

302
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,208
That can't be...!

303
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,833
How can the Shadow Angels
form Aquarion?!

304
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,625
Why of course!

305
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,375
They've analyzed and replicated

306
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,083
our Merge formations
from other encounters.

307
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,166
What's going on...?!

308
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,291
Why can't we merge?!

309
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,000
Brother.

310
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,041
What's stopping us?

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,500
Once a frog, always a frog...

312
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,083
Once a hawk, always a hawk...

313
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,291
Once a wolf, always a wolf.

314
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,166
But, sir.

315
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,458
Those are just words.

316
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,250
Quit speaking in
riddles, old man.

317
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,416
We've already become each other.

318
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,125
Bastards!

319
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,791
They won't stop mimicking us!

320
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,125
Mimic.

321
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,166
Mimic.

322
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,250
Mimic.

323
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,333
I can mimic all I want!

324
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,041
But I'll always be me!

325
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,083
You're right,
I can only be me...!

326
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,625
And I accept that!

327
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,250
That was well put, Silvia...

328
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,791
You are indeed my sister.

329
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,375
Yes, and you're my brother!

330
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,500
The Third Emotional Levels
have reached full capacity!

331
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,916
Merge One!

332
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,791
Merge Two!

333
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,041
Go, Aquarion!

334
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,583
This merge, it's different.

335
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,000
It's incredible!

336
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,541
I feel like I'm melting!

337
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,250
They did it!

338
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,041
It's radiating!

339
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,208
The time has come.

340
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,208
Hey, copycat...!

341
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
Can you do this?!

342
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Aquarion!

343
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,333
It's growing!

344
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,833
How is that possible?!

345
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,250
Solar diagnostic.

346
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,750
Quantum energy
levels increasing...!

347
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,166
It seems to be
drawing mass from within!

348
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,208
But how?

349
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,458
I've never seen
anything like this.

350
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,875
Three arrows pointed in the
same direction are useless...

351
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,750
They're easily broken!

352
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,875
But if they choose
their own course

353
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,583
and respect each other's path...

354
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,833
If they appreciate their
individual strengths,

355
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,708
they will help each other grow.

356
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,125
But if each arrow faces off
in their own random direction...

357
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,041
Won't they be rendered useless?

358
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,458
Of course, if the
directions were random...

359
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,541
Although... if they're
able to find a connection

360
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,291
in each other's weaknesses,

361
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,291
they will soon
recognize their strengths.

362
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Once they've made this
connection

363
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,166
and they're finally able
to become themselves,

364
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,458
they'll be free to become
one with each other.

365
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,208
The sign of the Vectors!

366
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,875
I can't believe it!

367
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,166
When the three
Vectors join souls

368
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,458
and extend from the
center of this bond,

369
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,958
they create harmony...

370
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,625
They become perfectly aligned
with the solar system...

371
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,666
And once they've
managed to do this...

372
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,583
They will transcend
the third dimension...

373
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,833
Transcend your configuration
and join as one...

374
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,666
Become a single giant shape!

375
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,458
Mimic that.

376
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,833
The power within
us can never be

377
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,958
duplicated through
pale imitation.

378
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:07,541
Let's do it!

379
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,375
United...

380
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,750
Trans-dimensional...

381
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,666
Attack!

382
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,291
They found their true selves.

383
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,250
By seeing through
one another's eyes.

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,250
Commander...

385
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,083
If they had to reject each
other to discover that,

386
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,666
how were they able to connect?

387
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,958
Oh look... It's just so perfect.

388
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,375
Circle... Circle...

389
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,125
Up, down, I can't figure it out.

390
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,125
What does it mean?!

391
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,791
Jerome, you're
thinking too much.

392
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,208
That isn't an unsolved
code, it's just graffiti.

393
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,083
Graffiti?!

394
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,416
Next time:
"Mischief Without Malice."
