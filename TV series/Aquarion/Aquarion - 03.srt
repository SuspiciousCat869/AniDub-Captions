1
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,708
 What'd I do now?

2
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,291
Huh...? Well That's interesting.

3
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,166
Hey, You're not hurt are you?

4
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,500
Huh...? Oh, no, I'm fine...

5
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,666
But, would you mind telling me,
is that an RF5 3000?

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,666
Huh?

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,833
Here, look.

8
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,125
Cool...

9
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,583
That's a different model
than mine though.

10
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,208
Mine's not as fancy.

11
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,125
It was one of the first
models they made...

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,166
It's from the 2000 series.

13
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,083
Wow, that's a classic...!

14
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,375
Where did you get it?

15
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,375
My grandfather left it to me.

16
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,416
It's almost seventy years old
now, but it still runs great.

17
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,500
Oh, hey...

18
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,791
Look, I have one too.

19
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,833
You're trying out
for Aquarion too?

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,208
Uh...

21
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,333
Well, I'm from
Area 17 in Neo Asia.

22
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,625
I'm Jun Lee...

23
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,916
It's so nice to meet you all.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,208
I, um... My name is Tsugumi
Rosenmeier, and I, um...

25
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,541
I'm from the North
German Defense Zone.

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,208
Hey... Up here...!

27
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,333
What are your
measurements, Tsugumi?

28
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,500
Do I have to answer that?

29
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,166
Just ignore him.

30
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,333
You two can take your seats now.

31
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,458
Sorry, it took me some
time to get him down here.

32
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,583
I had to bribe him with these.

33
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,208
We have one more new student.

34
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,833
This promising young
man hails from Arc City.

35
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,250
That stupid street rat!

36
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,333
What's up with this place?

37
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,750
You can call it a school,

38
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,625
but it looks more like
voluntary imprisonment to me.

39
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,625
You don't know anything...

40
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,875
Why don't you just leave?

41
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:08,750
You've done enough!

42
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,666
You've ruined my first Merge!

43
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,625
Hey, isn't that the guy who
destroyed a Cherubim soldier?

44
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,875
Yeah.

45
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,083
They say he's the reincarnation
of Solar Wing!

46
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,250
Hey, he's kinda cute!

47
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,250
Jun, what do they
mean by "Solar Wing?"

48
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,833
Kind of a long story...

49
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,250
Solar Wing is the other
name given to Apollinius...

50
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,583
You know, the hero from
twelve thousand years ago...?

51
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,583
Anyway, the Alisian Empire wrote

52
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,541
all about him in the
Book of Holy Genesis.

53
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,916
Along with Seliane and
the other Element users,

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
he battled the Shadow Angels
by controlling Aquarion...

55
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,916
At least, that's what I've read.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,291
How do you know all that?

57
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,583
You do know that
information's classified?

58
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,375
Well, it's not so
classified to me...

59
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,333
DEAVA's system was
easy to hack into...

60
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,625
I know a lot...
Former Prince of Alisia.

61
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,416
You hacked into the system?!

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,833
Yeah, but it turns out they were
monitoring me the whole time.

63
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,541
Alright, so where's
the giant robot...

64
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,291
I've got a friend
to rescue here.

65
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,666
Let's go...
I haven't got all day.

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,833
No... Play time's over for you!

67
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,291
I should tell you, I never
fall for the same trick twice.

68
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,458
Let me down!

69
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,208
Idiot. Now think...

70
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,666
Do you even remember
what you did last time?

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,000
Get over yourself...

72
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,708
I'm here because I was
told I could use Aquarion.

73
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,875
Apollo, you can fly Aquarion,

74
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,458
But there are tests that
you have to complete first...

75
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,875
To be an Element,

76
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,125
your whole being must be
compatible with a mechanism.

77
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,291
Compatible...?!

78
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,208
I've controlled the
thing twice already!

79
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,791
Yes, and your great
control destroyed a town.

80
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,083
Wow.

81
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,083
How awful!

82
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,666
Why did I get stuck
training this moron?

83
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,208
Just think, Silvia, if you are
the reincarnation of Seliane...

84
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,958
He may be your true love...

85
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,458
This "moron" could
be Apollonius reborn.

86
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,666
You're kidding me, right?

87
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,875
My true love...?!

88
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,708
I don't care how
similar his name is,

89
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,125
there's no way he's Solar Wing!

90
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,291
Are we done with
the small talk now...?

91
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,583
I'd like to get on with
these little tests of yours.

92
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,041
I wouldn't take the simulator
so lightly if I were you...

93
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,375
Also... You still don't
know how to achieve kinship...

94
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,625
Without it, you can never
truly Merge with Aquarion.

95
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,333
Don't worry about me...

96
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,208
Wait, what's kinship?

97
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,166
You really don't know
anything, do you...?

98
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,541
You're a complete
waste of my time.

99
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,125
You aren't even
wearing an Element suit!

100
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,166
Shut your face!

101
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,000
You shut yours!

102
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,500
Silvia...

103
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,250
If you can't do your job and
teach your training partner

104
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,500
to act as an Element User should

105
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,791
then perhaps you'll
drop a level, too.

106
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,375
Reika, I was wondering...

107
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,208
Is there any advice
you can give me?

108
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,500
Try to remember...

109
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,791
Aquarion responds to
the body, heart, and soul

110
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,291
of its Element Users.

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,458
It can sense things in you
that even you don't notice...

112
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,958
Stay calm, and you'll be fine.

113
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,208
She sounds so confident in me.

114
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:04,916
What about me?

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
You got any tips
before we start?

116
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,583
Don't go into this
expecting a game...

117
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,625
Take it as seriously
as the real thing.

118
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,083
Right!

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,166
Hurry it up!

120
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
This thing is huge!

121
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,875
Just stay calm, Tsugumi...

122
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,250
The response mechanism
is very sensitive...

123
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,166
You have to relax...
It'll be alright.

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,625
O-okay!

125
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,583
There you go, gently now.

126
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,083
You have to learn to operate
your body and your mind as one.

127
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,375
If they're off even a little,
Aquarion will know.

128
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,416
Now concentrate!

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,916
I'll try.

130
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,250
You might want to turn.

131
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,000
Huh...? Oh, right.

132
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
I'm taking the controls...

133
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,583
Vector Sol, what the
hell are you doing?

134
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,083
I didn't mean to!

135
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,291
This idiot couldn't even
fly a paper airplane!

136
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,791
Silvia...

137
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,708
When we fight, we're all
responsible for each other...

138
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,625
It doesn't matter who
messes up, we all go down!

139
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,166
I know, but you don't underst-

140
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,208
Told ya' I could fly this thing!

141
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,875
You idiot, I took
over the controls!

142
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,333
You're not flying it.

143
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,000
You what?!

144
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,333
You little... Give me
back the controls!

145
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,500
Come on, who's
this guy kidding...?

146
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
He can't even fly.

147
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,000
No way he's the
reincarnation of Solar Wing!

148
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,833
The way Silvia's acting,

149
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,458
it's easy to doubt her
supposed past life too.

150
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,916
Let's just get this
travesty over with.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,875
Wait a second, take a look
at their aura dynamics...!

152
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,041
There may be disharmony
everywhere else...

153
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,375
But the red domains

154
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,250
of the two spirit sectors
are perfectly aligned.

155
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
And what exactly does that mean?

156
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,541
Passion.

157
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,375
The red domain corresponds
to the First Chakra.

158
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:19,833
C'mon Give it back!

159
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,625
Let go!

160
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,083
Just slow down and feel it.

161
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,791
You must learn to
control the Vector...

162
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,541
Or you will never
control Aquarion!

163
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,041
I can't... I can't, I can't.

164
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
Get-off-me!

165
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,208
Red domain level rising!

166
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,750
It makes you think...

167
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,791
Yeah. She's pushing him away,
but does she really mean it?

168
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,333
Too fast!

169
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,708
What was that?

170
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,958
I can't, I can't, I can't.

171
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,500
I did it again.

172
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:29,833
That little rat!

173
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,208
If he ever tries that again,

174
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,166
I'll punch him
right in the nose!

175
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,833
I'm sorry I let you down, Reika.

176
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,958
I couldn't feel it.

177
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,291
Don't apologize...
It's my fault...

178
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,083
I failed you.
I should have led better.

179
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,625
She doesn't know what happened.

180
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,291
I should have led better...

181
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,750
I failed... I failed him.

182
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,833
Reika... Reika, are you okay?

183
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,708
Just remember this...

184
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:14,083
The simulator is much
kinder than reality.

185
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,291
Baron...

186
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,208
You're still here?

187
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,958
I don't understand.

188
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,041
Why couldn't I fly it this time?

189
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,500
What was that "kinship" thing
you were trying to tell me?

190
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,833
What do you think it is?

191
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,625
I don't know.

192
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,958
That's why I'm asking you.

193
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,416
Aren't you people supposed
to have all the answers?

194
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,541
It's him.

195
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,875
Think back a bit...

196
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,291
Why were you able to fly
during that first battle?

197
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,125
That was different.

198
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,958
Different how?

199
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,500
It sounds crazy...

200
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,208
But that first time, I heard
a voice coming from somewhere.

201
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,625
A voice?

202
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,958
Also...

203
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,875
I thought I saw someone too.

204
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,458
It's nuts, but I thought...

205
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,208
It looked like a man with wings.

206
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,958
Are you sure he had wings?

207
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,125
He can't be talking about...

208
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,666
Solar Wing!

209
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,208
Yeah. He had huge wings

210
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,875
and his hair looked
like fire or something...

211
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,625
But his eyes are what
I remember the most.

212
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,541
They were frightening
and sad at the same time.

213
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,250
I know someone else
who has eyes like that.

214
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,250
That's exactly how I would
describe your eyes, Apollo.

215
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,208
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,583
I'm not sad!

217
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,541
Don't worry; you do an
impressive job of hiding it.

218
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,958
She can't be right...

219
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,875
That street rat's heartless.

220
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,041
So... What did this
man with wings say?

221
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,583
I don't remember.

222
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,083
It was weird...

223
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,250
I just remember wanting to
rescue Baron from that thing.

224
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,125
Before I knew it, I was
in the machine fighting.

225
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,333
And what's Baron like?

226
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,500
We were in the same
internment camp...

227
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,375
He was the first
friend I made there.

228
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,416
I was starving in that
place, about to die...

229
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,541
Baron gave me his own
food to keep me alive...

230
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,541
After that, we
were like brothers.

231
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,541
When we escaped,
he gave me this.

232
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,125
There's something else.

233
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,166
My name... The name Apollo...

234
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,083
He gave me that name.

235
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,833
Poor kid.

236
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,750
You see... You do know.

237
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,458
That's the real
meaning of kinship.

238
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,375
The simulator was just
like a game to you...

239
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,750
You couldn't make it work cause
you didn't take it seriously.

240
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,000
What do you mean?

241
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,083
Your feelings for
Baron made Aquarion

242
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,166
act for you that first time...

243
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,750
The test today
wasn't real to you,

244
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,500
so you felt nothing
and nothing happened.

245
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,166
So what...?
My emotions controlled it?

246
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,625
Area 17 Sector 5:
Harvest Beast sighted.

247
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,000
Vector Mars, Sirius...

248
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,541
Vector Sol, Reika...

249
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,250
Vector Luna, Silvia.

250
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,250
Report to flight
deck immediately.

251
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,708
Yes!

252
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,000
What the--

253
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,541
Sorry, gotta get going!

254
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,458
Hey, hold it...!

255
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,083
Why didn't I get called...?

256
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,875
I'm coming too!

257
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,791
It's time to go!

258
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,083
Hey, wait. Wait for me!

259
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,916
I gotta catch her!

260
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,333
Which way'd she go?

261
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,333
Found her!

262
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,166
Stand by for launch.
Stand by for launch.

263
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,791
Launch sequence initiated...

264
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,083
All non-flight personnel
clear the decks immediately.

265
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,916
I repeat: all
non-flight personnel

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,375
clear the decks immediately.

267
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
How's the kid doing?

268
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,750
You put him through
the simulator, right?

269
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
I did. How did you know?

270
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,708
I read your footsteps.

271
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,250
They told me all
I needed to know.

272
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,541
Yes, of course.

273
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,875
Commander Fudo...

274
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,458
The boy... His eyes
are a lot like yours.

275
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,083
What makes you say that?

276
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,208
They're intense, but
there's sorrow in them too.

277
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,375
Perhaps you're right.

278
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,875
Vector Mars, taking off!

279
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,000
Vector Sol, ready for takeoff!

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,583
Vector Luna, taking off!

281
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh... Him again.

282
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,416
Commander, we have to abort
the launch immediately.

283
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,166
Never mind. Just let him go.

284
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,583
Huh?!

285
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,791
The very same eyes.

286
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,833
Vector Luna...

287
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,708
You're behind.

288
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,625
It's not my fault...

289
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,250
I have extra baggage.

290
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,250
Don't call me baggage!

291
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,791
What is that thing's weakness?

292
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,083
So many people.

293
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,458
That's it!

294
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,333
I've located the Harvest
Beast's weakness...

295
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,500
Let me Merge and
I can defeat it.

296
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,500
Reika, are you certain
that you've found it?

297
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,375
I'm positive! Now let me Merge.

298
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,291
Reika!

299
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,000
Reika... Reika are you alright?

300
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:24,833
Vector Sol damaged
and losing energy.

301
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,291
I'm... sorry.

302
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,125
Permission for teleport switch?

303
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,708
Permission granted...

304
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,916
Prepare for teleport switch!

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,750
Let's do this thing!

306
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,416
Preparing for teleport.

307
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,750
Teleport standing by.

308
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,458
Reika!

309
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,208
Pierre at your service.

310
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,208
Nice timing.

311
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,791
Pierre, what took you so long?

312
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,208
The weakness of
the Harvest Beast...

313
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,541
You have to hit.

314
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,875
the point where its
four chests come together...

315
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,583
Anywhere else will destroy
the people it's captured.

316
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,333
We're late!

317
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,166
Oh no, Reika

318
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,125
We'll focus our attack at
the center of its four chests.

319
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,500
Vector Mars, you'll
be Head Element...

320
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,916
Stand by for Merge.

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,375
You only have one chance.

322
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,791
I want it finished in one blow.

323
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,791
Roger that.

324
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,583
Assume formation M-S-L.

325
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,041
Code-name... Aquarion's Sword.

326
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,250
Damn. I'm stuck in the back...

327
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,458
Oh well, I guess it
is my first Merge...

328
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,791
So I'll take it any
way I can get it...

329
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,625
Hey, Pierre...

330
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,208
Just shut up and focus!

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,208
No, Vector Luna!

332
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:21,666
Apollo!

333
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,000
Silvia... Let's go.

334
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,083
She's back.

335
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,250
They're good.

336
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,916
Multi-dimensional
quantum level rising.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,166
Merge index at
ninety-eight percent.

338
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,375
Aura levels are
unusually strong.

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,625
What the...

340
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,833
How'd they do that?

341
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,166
They've learned kinship.

342
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375
No...

343
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,125
I think it's something
else with those two.

344
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:58,916
Merge One!

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,875
Merge Two!

346
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,083
Go... Aquarion!

347
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,666
Aquarion Mars!

348
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,083
It's leaving...!

349
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,875
Let's go. Fire Saber!

350
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,791
Fire!

351
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,791
Saber!

352
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,125
Attack!

353
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,666
Yes!

354
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Wow!

355
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,333
We did quite well.

356
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,208
That was amazing!

357
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,583
You were great!

358
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,291
Move it!

359
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,958
They took it with them!

360
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,083
They're all gone.

361
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,708
You bastards!

362
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,125
There's no use in getting angry.

363
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,750
That won't change anything.

364
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,041
After all we did to beat it!

365
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,750
This isn't fair.

366
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,916
We failed them.

367
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,791
Hey, Jun, we get
to do the preview!

368
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,833
That's great, but what
are we supposed to say?

369
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,416
Stuff about the next episode.

370
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,666
You do it. I'm too nervous.

371
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,666
I'm afraid I'll mess it up.

372
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,916
Oh, alright.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,625
Next on Aquarion:
"Barefoot Warrior"!

374
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay, can we go now?
