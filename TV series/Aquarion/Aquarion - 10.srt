1
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,500
12,000 years ago in Atlantia,

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,125
brave warrior Angels
vigorously waged war,

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,500
pitting their skill and
technique against one another

4
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,416
at the valiant
Festival of Combat.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,458
Now,... because of
Solar Wing's betrayal,

6
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,416
the Angels are gone
and our festival lights

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,916
have all but faded
away and disappeared.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,916
It would not be wise
for us to allow Toma

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,375
to face Solar Wing on his own.

10
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,791
Moroha, a soldier
as powerful as you

11
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,125
deserves a creation
worthy of your skill...

12
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,208
A creation worthy of hosting

13
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,666
such an unparalleled
warrior and tactician.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,750
Lensi, the architect said to
possess the fingers of God.

15
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,875
Tell me, my friend, what
have you created for me?

16
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:18,666
An unparalleled Cherubim
soldier, a flawless specimen.

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,625
So... two outta three?

18
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,958
But that was three.

19
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,875
Oh well, it's not like
anyone else can beat you

20
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,166
with a sword either.

21
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
Wanna bet?!

22
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,791
So it's you.

23
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,916
Moron, if he really
thinks he can beat

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,291
my brother he's
dumber than I thought.

25
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,500
No one can...
He's untouchable...

26
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,583
According to my calculations,
Apollo will last 4.8 seconds.

27
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,375
Sirius!

28
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,791
I was wrong!

29
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,500
Apollo can really fight!

30
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,375
Apollo is strong.

31
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,000
He definitely has raw talent,

32
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
but Sirius has
perfect technique.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,958
It's nearly flawless.

34
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,625
Technique beats
strength every time.

35
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,791
Don't be so sure...

36
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,291
If you seek perfection

37
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,958
and gaze only toward
the stars in the sky...

38
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,500
...you will fail to see the
flowers on the ground...

39
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,250
What flowers?

40
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,791
He bit him!

41
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,791
No!

42
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,416
That's not fair.

43
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,125
You broke the rules.

44
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,875
When you're in a real fight,

45
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,958
your stupid "rules"
don't mean anything!

46
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,958
Get him!

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Cherubim Soldier
detected in Yuze City!

48
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,166
Aquarion! Make ready for launch!

49
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,666
Pierre, Silvia, Apollo,
report immediately!!

50
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,083
Yeah!

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,583
I'm with him again?

52
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
I only want to
merge with you brother!

53
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,250
I know that Apollo
frustrates you,

54
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,083
but your feelings do not
negate the task at hand.

55
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,833
Fine... but I don't
have to like it!

56
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,000
All non-flight personnel
clear the decks immediately.

57
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,291
Vector docking
sequence complete!

58
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,750
Host Elements engaged!

59
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,500
Initiating Vector start up!

60
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,708
Power levels confirmed...!

61
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,125
Launch tracks activated...!

62
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,375
Launch gate is clear!

63
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,708
Ready for launch!

64
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,833
We can't find the
Cherubim in our database!

65
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,708
Merge as Aquarion
Luna for surveillance

66
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,416
but keep a safe distance!

67
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,333
Roger!

68
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,291
Forget it, I'm taking the lead!

69
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,833
What did you say?

70
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,541
You're just gonna screw it up!

71
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,541
I hate merging with you!

72
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,083
You're horrible at it!

73
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,166
You don't deserve
to be the head!

74
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,166
I'M horrible?!

75
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,208
This is no time
for petty arguing!

76
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,458
But... he started it!

77
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,541
You know the strongest
one should be the head!

78
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,791
Your ego's too
big to be the head!

79
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,958
It's about the right person for
the right situation... got it?

80
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,833
Screw that.
What a giant load of crap!

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,541
Follow your orders!

82
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,916
Still mad 'cause I beat you.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,708
What?!

84
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,791
Guys we're about to merge!

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,583
What do you think you're doing?!

86
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,875
I told you, I'm the head!

87
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,625
Listen, we're here to fight a
Cherubim, not each other!

88
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,291
Hey old man.

89
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,125
You know what's up, right?

90
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,541
Tell 'em I'm the strongest!

91
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,708
That's enough!

92
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,708
Let's merge...
we need to do it now!

93
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,500
Roger that!

94
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,083
This isn't over yet Apollo!

95
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:26,916
Merge One!

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,250
Merge Two!

97
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:32,166
Go! Aquarion!!!

98
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,041
Let's do it!

99
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,208
They're sustaining damage!

100
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,208
Feedback levels rising!

101
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,750
Silvia!

102
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm fine Brother!

103
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,125
Permission to relieve Silvia,
Commander Fudo!

104
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,583
No!

105
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,416
I can do it... I know I can!

106
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,166
That thing packs a mean punch.

107
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,125
We have to get outta here...

108
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,208
Retreat Apollo!

109
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,791
No way!

110
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,833
That... That Cherubim soldier...

111
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,458
Its aura...!

112
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,000
No... this high level
quantum pattern, it's...!

113
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,208
We're in trouble...

114
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,541
It looks like there's
a Shadow Angel on board!

115
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,041
Wingless fools!

116
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,208
Silvia!

117
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,833
Come on... get up!

118
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,333
Dodge!

119
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,041
Damn it!

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,625
I won't let a Shadow Angel win!

121
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,333
Silvia!

122
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,208
Apollo...

123
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,083
Her life aura is
dropping to critical!

124
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,208
Let me switch with her!

125
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:45,125
Oh no!!!

126
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,916
It's gone.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
There's no response
from the vectors!

128
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,833
We need to get them outta there!

129
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,416
It's not over yet.

130
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,500
Please forgive me Moroha,

131
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,166
I have failed you.

132
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,500
With all my talent, not
even my most earnest effort

133
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:19,291
could create a soldier who could
withstand your absolute power.

134
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,166
Regardless, we managed
to immobilize them...

135
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,875
Solar wing is weaker
than I anticipated...

136
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,833
If we've witnessed the
full capacity of his power,

137
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,666
it would be
meaningless to acquire it.

138
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,708
What do you suppose
Toma will have to say?

139
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,458
I know what he'll say,

140
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,875
even if Solar Wing's power
has indeed fallen so low,

141
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,041
we still must not allow the
wingless one to possess it...

142
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,208
He'll demand victory.

143
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,375
Attention: until enemy activity

144
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,875
or receipt of further
instructions all elements

145
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,625
are ordered to stand by and
maintain your current position.

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,541
Her injuries are severe.

147
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,916
She needs a blood transfusion...

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,250
Or else... she may not make it.

149
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,291
We're the same blood type,
you can use mine.

150
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,125
Hey doc... use mine too.

151
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,125
Here... the more the merrier.

152
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,041
Get back...

153
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,458
This has nothing to do with you.

154
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,625
Hell it doesn't

155
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,083
Maybe if you knew
how to follow orders,

156
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,625
this never would've happened.

157
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,916
Yeah, but--

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,416
You animal, you're
not welcome here!

159
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,666
You jerk!

160
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,500
Come on...

161
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,000
Sirius is a better match...

162
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,916
They're brother and sister.

163
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:46,916
Don't worry about
Silvia, she'll be fine.

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,333
What I would worry
about is... we lost.

165
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,541
We've done all we can,
so now it's up to her...

166
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,083
Rest...

167
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:00,958
We're Alisians.

168
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,958
We're stronger than you think.

169
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,333
We'll be here if you need us.

170
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,958
Thanks.

171
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,041
We're strong.

172
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,208
Idiot...

173
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,250
Sirius...

174
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,041
Look...

175
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,833
Baron taught me about these...

176
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,500
They're really good for ya.

177
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,875
Tell your sister to eat it.

178
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,125
What the hell was that for?!

179
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,000
Am I unworthy?

180
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,958
I can't live with that.

181
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,041
Apollo.

182
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,208
They're serious.

183
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,375
You should be in bed!

184
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,791
Is brother okay?

185
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,250
He's not the same...

186
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,375
He's changed.

187
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,083
Do something Pierre...

188
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,625
Can you stop them?

189
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,083
I can't...

190
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,625
Why not...?

191
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,208
I know my brother wouldn't have
started something like this.

192
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,375
That beast Apollo
started it, didn't he?

193
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,208
I'm not so sure.

194
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,541
No!

195
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,791
Okay, that's
crossing the line...

196
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,125
I can't believe it.

197
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:35,416
Idiot... to lose my temper
over something like this!

198
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,583
Is that all you got?

199
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,083
You want more?!

200
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,166
You're a filthy beast!

201
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,833
It takes one to know one!

202
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,708
It's the the alarm!

203
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,333
How are the repairs coming?

204
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,625
We're not completely
finished yet sir!

205
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,541
Just as long as it flies...

206
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,958
That smell...

207
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,083
It's the one from yesterday!

208
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,750
Sirius!

209
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,458
Figures.

210
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,375
Let's go... I'll finish this.

211
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,458
Aquarion Luna!

212
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,916
Repair index is insufficient...

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,625
Luna won't survive.

214
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,875
What the--?!

215
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,291
Here it comes... Watch out!

216
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,166
We can't take much more of this!

217
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,583
I won't lose!

218
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,166
Hey!

219
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,958
This thing will pay for all the
Alisian blood it's spilled...!

220
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,833
I will avenge my sister!

221
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,958
Apollo!

222
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,125
What am I saying...?

223
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
Sirius!

224
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,583
Listen!

225
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:39,875
Leave me be!

226
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,166
Look down, by your feet!

227
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,166
Shut up!

228
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,375
You don't know
what you're doing!

229
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,458
Silvia!

230
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,916
My sister...

231
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,750
I- I almost...!

232
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,625
Luna element psyche
level is dropping.

233
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,083
Merge index falling!

234
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,541
They're breaking up...

235
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,041
We need to merge again!

236
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,958
Let me take lead this time!

237
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,166
I'm fine!

238
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,166
You didn't even know
Silvia was down there!

239
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,875
Keep her name out of
your mouth you beast!

240
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,083
Both of you need to get
your heads on straight...

241
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
We're here to avenge Silvia!

242
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,791
That's right... and I was the
one who failed to see her.

243
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,958
You see the sky but you
can't see the ground...

244
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,500
You're missing so much...

245
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,375
You must see
everything... Aquarion!

246
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,375
The world, I can see it!

247
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,375
I can see everything!

248
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,833
Too little too late...
it is done!

249
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,000
You can do better than that!

250
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,500
I didn't ask for your opinion!

251
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,708
I admit, I wasn't
seeing clearly,

252
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,333
but neither are you.

253
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,750
What the hell are you sayin'?!

254
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,625
You need me!

255
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,500
Shut up!

256
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,833
Come on!

257
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,333
 Infinity Cross!!!

258
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,958
So that's Solar Wing...

259
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,583
This has suddenly
become more interesting...

260
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:23,583
They did it...
They won... together...

261
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,791
Oh brother...
will you forgive me?

262
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,625
What are you doing here?

263
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,250
I came to see Silvia.

264
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,333
She's asleep.

265
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,958
Come back tomorrow.

266
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,458
Misfortune is my symbol.

267
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,083
Bad luck is my identity.

268
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,708
Solitude and tragedy become me.

269
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,916
That is who I am.

270
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,916
Next on Aquarion: "Happiness is
at the Bottom of the Lake"
