1
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:29,666
Oh lovely rose about to bloom,
on a pale, moonlit night...

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,541
Your petals dripping red

3
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,666
Your leaves lithe and green.

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,250
Your lustrous
fragrance fills the air

5
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,458
Receive my blood...

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,500
Let it flow through your lips

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:50,875
Drink it, taste
it with your tongue

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:56,416
Quench your thirst...
before you wither... and die.

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,875
No... do not wither and die.

10
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,333
Master Toma...

11
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,333
What are your intentions?

12
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,375
What will you do now?

13
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,500
That which I loved
most was taken from me...

14
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,541
And I must take that
same love in return.

15
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,500
He is ready...

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,333
I have but to show him the path.

17
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,750
That red path has
to mean something.

18
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,708
I don't know what it means...
but it sure smelled sweet.

19
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,583
Apollo?

20
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,916
You're talkin' about that bright
red path to the moon, right?

21
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,625
Almost made me sick
how sweet it smelled...

22
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,791
But, there was somethin'
familiar about it, too...

23
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,416
Commander...?

24
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,166
Is there something on your mind?

25
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,166
The time has come when
all must choose their path...

26
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,958
Guess you couldn't sleep either?

27
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,166
No... I was in the middle of
having a dream when I woke up...

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,583
Really... Me too...

29
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,375
A nightmare...

30
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,875
Thousands of dancing feathers...

31
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,541
I understand...

32
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,583
I think the child Shadow Angel's
death is weighing heavily

33
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,083
on everyone's
conscience right now.

34
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,625
No, no... it was more than that.

35
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,458
I saw Glen! He was in pain!

36
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,000
The feathers were
attacking him...!

37
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,541
His body was gray
and withered...!

38
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:05,000
Reika... There's something
I need to ask you...

39
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,125
Sure, anything, Sirius...

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,875
What would you do if you
learned of a shadow angel...

41
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,833
...right here, among us?

42
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,958
Fight with all my strength...

43
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,250
...no matter what...!

44
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,000
Shadow angels are the enemy!

45
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,083
Why? What's wrong?

46
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:29,500
Nothing... I was being
rhetorical... Good night.

47
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,833
Who is it?

48
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,833
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's just me...

49
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,666
May I come in?

50
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,000
It's late Silvia...

51
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,250
What do you need?

52
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,875
It's silly... I was
having a bad dream...

53
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,541
I see... You're
not the only one.

54
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,333
Tell me... What did you see?

55
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,708
I'm not sure...

56
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,208
It was twelve thousand years ago

57
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,250
when humanity first stood
against the Shadow Angels ...

58
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,750
I was watching
Solar Wing from a distance...

59
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,541
He was heading out
for the final battle.

60
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,541
The Battle of Atlandia...

61
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,666
As he flew away into the sky,
red feathers fell from his body

62
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,041
and rained down
upon the earth...

63
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,458
He disappeared
with a flash of light

64
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,833
and never returned again...

65
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,666
As I watched Solar Wing
it felt as though

66
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,500
you were the one leaving.

67
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,666
Don't worry... You and I will
always be together Silvia.

68
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,458
I know that...
Why wouldn't we...

69
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
We spent so much time here...

70
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,000
Remember how
reclusive we used to be?

71
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,416
But things are
different now, aren't they?

72
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,833
You've managed to make
friends with the others...

73
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,000
You're not such an
outsider anymore...

74
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,916
Believe it or not,
neither are you, brother,

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,041
even though I still can't
get you to eat with us...

76
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,875
Everyone thinks
of you as a friend.

77
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,666
They all trust you and
respect your intelligence.

78
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,000
Sometimes I wonder.

79
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,541
Well there's nothing
to wonder about...

80
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,333
It took time, but we're
a part of the group now.

81
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,916
Both of us.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,875
Listen... why don't you join us
for just one meal tomorrow...?

83
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,541
Your pick.

84
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,708
You know my feelings
on eating in public...

85
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,875
It lacks elegance.

86
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,583
Oh right. I forgot.

87
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,416
This armor is so beautiful...

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,583
I bet it would look
amazing on you.

89
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,125
It's an imitation.

90
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,958
Along with everything
in this room...

91
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,500
Including myself...

92
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,375
When I think about
my place in DEAVA I just...

93
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:55,250
Sometimes I just
wonder if there is one.

94
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,666
It's late... I'll walk you back.

95
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,208
Brother...

96
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,583
Do you think we
could talk again soon?

97
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,208
Of course.

98
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,791
You're eating again?!

99
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,375
 You got a problem?

100
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,458
Yeah!

101
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,708
Walking around
with your mouth stuffed

102
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,541
full of food like
that--it's uncivilized...!

103
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,083
Isn't that right, brother?

104
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,416
I'm curious, Apollo, why is
it you're always so hungry?

105
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,166
Are you that unfulfilled?

106
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,416
Huh?

107
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,958
You appear to be masking
your lack of fulfillment

108
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,666
by constantly gorging yourself.

109
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,750
What the hell...?

110
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,666
I eat when I get
hungry--that's it...

111
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,250
There's no reason to it...

112
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,416
A human's actions should
be guided by reason...

113
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,166
It separates us from animals

114
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,875
Yeah, my life's eating,
sleeping and fighting.

115
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,958
I don't have time for
this psycho-babble crap.

116
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,958
You're wasting
your time, brother.

117
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,208
The only reason Apollo has

118
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,291
for doing anything
is the way it smells.

119
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,500
He lets his nose do all
of his thinking for him.

120
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,083
What's wrong with that?

121
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
I got a good nose, so I use it.

122
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,916
Apollo... Tell me something.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
Yeah? What?

124
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,333
What does your keen nose
sense when you smell me?

125
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,500
Forget it...
I don't want to know.

126
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,333
I'm sorry I bothered you.

127
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,416
Okay?

128
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,458
Brother, wait up.

129
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,875
Where are you going...

130
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
And you!

131
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,416
Don't come crying to me when you
get a bellyache from overeating!

132
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,333
"Overeating?!" I don't
even know that word!

133
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,833
Who are you?

134
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,125
I just spoke with Apollo...

135
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,583
Apparently, he saw
something last night...

136
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,500
Some sort of red path,
stretching up into the sky...

137
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,291
The crimson path.

138
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,375
This looks fun.

139
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,291
I'll bet it's one of our new
special training exercises.

140
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,166
The Crimson Path...

141
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,208
It existed in ancient times...
as a link from earth...

142
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,250
...up into the heavens...

143
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,125
Solar Wing made
the path his own.

144
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,291
Meaning what...? Exactly?

145
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:43,041
The Crimson path is beckoning...
reaching out for Solar Wing.

146
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,708
What are you saying here?

147
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,083
It's the path that Solar
Wing will have to travel...

148
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,041
Yeah, that part of it I got...

149
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,708
Well, the story goes,
in ancient times...

150
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,583
I'm fine.

151
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,125
What is this...?
What am I feeling?

152
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,333
Am I envious of Apollo?

153
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,083
Which one of you will win
control of the red path...?

154
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,083
Will it be Apollo?! Or Sirius?!

155
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,708
The loser will be the first
of you who slips. Begin!

156
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,583
Stay focused...

157
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,541
I cannot lose this match!

158
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,125
Wow, sunshine... What's up?

159
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,333
You seem even
more tense than usual.

160
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,708
Get back...! It's my path!

161
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,083
Apollo!

162
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,375
Apollo...

163
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,625
Sirius. No.

164
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,875
What's he doing...?

165
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,875
An attack?

166
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,708
Shadow Angels...

167
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,083
High-level quantum
signature approaching...

168
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,125
High-level quantum
signature approaching.

169
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,583
Elements stand by...
Elements stand by...

170
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,291
Vector docking
sequence complete!

171
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,625
Status check:
all systems green...

172
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,500
Power levels confirmed...

173
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,625
Vectors, ready for launch...

174
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,708
Prepare for launch
track activation...

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,625
Clear for take-off...

176
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,708
Initiating countdown sequence...

177
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:38,333
In 5... 4... 3...
2... 1... Launch!

178
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,125
Vector Mars. Taking off!

179
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,375
Vector Luna. Taking off!

180
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,666
Let's go!

181
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,375
Launch complete...
Vectors airborne.

182
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,000
Initiating barrier fields.

183
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,375
Quantum signature levels at 300.

184
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,583
No wait... They're at 320,000!

185
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,333
320, 000...?! It's got
to be a false reading!

186
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,541
No sir...

187
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,916
And the enemy's power
is still increasing.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,875
It can't be.

189
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,625
I'm worried...

190
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,041
What if this Cheribum is piloted

191
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,041
by another
Shadow Angel Child...?

192
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,666
Silvia, Stay focused.

193
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,250
If you're having doubts,
better switch out now.

194
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,291
I'm not switching out!

195
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:28,666
What the?

196
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,750
What on earth... was that?

197
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,291
Stay calm!

198
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,375
Mount defense weaponry
and engage the enemy!

199
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,500
Fire!

200
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,416
What the hell is that?

201
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
Some new kind of Cherubim?!

202
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,208
Could it be an
actual shadow angel?

203
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,583
It doesn't matter!

204
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,541
We can't withstand that
kind of firepower for long!

205
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,708
Elements, stop that
thing at all costs!

206
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,666
Yeah, like you need
to tell us that.

207
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,916
We have to merge, now!

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,041
Okay. I'm the head!

209
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,791
Not this time... Silvia.

210
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
Roger. Merge one!

211
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,166
This is lame... Merge Two!

212
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,416
Go Aquarion!

213
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,291
I feel an ominous presence.

214
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,708
Brother!

215
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,958
Aquarion Mars!

216
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,750
It's so beautiful.

217
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,125
Sirius, what are you doing?

218
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,041
So we gonna fight or what?

219
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,958
Right, yes... Let's do this!

220
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,041
Amazing... like
nothing I've ever seen!

221
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,166
This presence... could it be...?

222
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,291
My best stroke, and he
parried it like it was nothing.

223
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,791
It's him... the angel...

224
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,333
That sound... Oh no...

225
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,625
Solar Wing...
It's been far too long.

226
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,083
Hey...! What the
hell are you doing?!

227
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,333
What's wrong, with you?

228
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,375
Sirius. What's gotten into you?

229
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,708
Let's finish him off!

230
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,916
Hold on...!

231
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,416
This isn't like him,
there's something wrong.

232
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,291
Screw it...! I'm done waitin'!

233
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,291
If he won't fight,
I will...! Dammit!

234
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,916
These Shadow Angels are
the ones who took Baron!

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,625
That's right Apollo, and we
took one of their children.

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,291
Something's gone wrong...

237
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,958
There's no unity
in their fighting.

238
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,333
A dark messenger
bearing seven colors

239
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,416
is present in this battle...

240
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It is he who now
beckons to Solar Wing.

241
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,541
Messenger...
So you're saying...?!

242
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,333
The enemy has not come to fight.

243
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,333
Is Toma actually planning to
invite Solar Wing to join us?

244
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,875
So then... does that
mean the Shadow Angels

245
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,125
are gonna try to take Apollo...?

246
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,291
This presence...
I felt it in my dream...!

247
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,208
Could it be happening again...?

248
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,083
Noooooo!

249
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,708
Silvia's astral levels
are dropping rapidly!

250
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,333
Abnormal brain function!

251
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,333
She can no longer fight!

252
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,125
Exchange elements now...!

253
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,000
Reika for Silvia...! Engage!

254
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,458
I'm ready...!
Let's stop this thing!

255
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,750
Reika, we're counting on you.

256
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,916
The path is before you.

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,416
The first to slip
will be the loser.

258
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,458
Now go! Aquarion!

259
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,583
I knew it... It is you!

260
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,500
Don't deny your destiny...

261
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,125
Join me...

262
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,000
What are you waiting for?!

263
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,041
Fight, dammit!

264
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,083
Think of what
they've done to us!

265
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,916
All the lives they've taken!

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,833
We are equally guilty of
committing murderous acts...

267
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,250
The numbers bear no relevance.

268
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,875
What the...?

269
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,458
You aren't making any sense...!

270
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,125
The Shadow Angels
are our enemies...!

271
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,875
What have we been fighting for?1

272
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,208
The reason I fight, is to create
a world free of fighting...

273
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,083
where beauty prevails.

274
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:03,750
I don't understand.

275
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,000
What's happened to you, brother?

276
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,875
You've got to
snap out of it Sirius.

277
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,791
He's coming!

278
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,083
It was you, wasn't it...?

279
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,916
The one who beckoned to me...

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,458
What do you mean?

281
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,666
Sirus, listen!

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,625
Tell meeeeeee...!

283
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,416
The Crimson Path.

284
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,791
There it is again--

285
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,041
that same freaky scent
I picked up on last night...

286
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,916
This is bad...

287
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,166
Come on, we've gotta re-merge!

288
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,166
Hey! Sirius!

289
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,208
Don't worry. I can get him.

290
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,833
What are you doing, Sirius?!

291
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,750
Tell me! I can help you!

292
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,000
You'd do that?

293
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,833
Sirius.

294
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,500
Reika.

295
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,708
No, it can't be...

296
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,583
Reika.

297
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:08,833
Reika... I had hoped that you,
at least, would understand...

298
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,541
Sirius wait.

299
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:18,041
I have made my choice!

300
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,416
Please don't do this...!

301
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,833
No! Brother, how could you?!

302
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,333
Forgive me... Silvia,

303
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,750
but my destiny was always
different from the others.

304
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,125
What are you talking about!

305
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,333
You're wrong! Turn back!

306
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,750
At the end of this path...
an ideal world is waiting.

307
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,375
It's found me at last.

308
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,291
Sirius!

309
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,958
Sirius!!

310
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,416
Brother!

311
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,541
What have you done...!

312
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,625
Solar Wing once
made a prediction...

313
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,000
These were his words:

314
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,500
"The path to redemption
shall be drawn in blood."

315
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,166
So then...

316
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,000
You mean my brother was
actually Solar Wing all along?

317
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,333
So they were your hands
I saw reaching for me...

318
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,625
Pulling me, to this place...

319
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,166
Welcome home...

320
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,625
Here in Atlandia your
wings will finally bloom.

321
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,708
The night beasts are howling...

322
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,708
...howling at the blue moon.

323
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,625
Ripping claws...

324
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:13,666
They bare sadness.
My sadness is bare.

325
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,875
Brother?

326
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,416
Next on Aquarion:
"Wings Unseen."
