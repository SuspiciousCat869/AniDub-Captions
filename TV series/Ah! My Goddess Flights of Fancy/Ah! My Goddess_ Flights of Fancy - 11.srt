1
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,291
So what do we do now?

2
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,125
This is so bad...
I mean, this is really bad...

3
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,916
It can't be.
That's someone I didn't think...

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,083
...would ever come back here.

5
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,583
Hm...

6
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,958
Hey Keiichi, do you know what's
the matter with those two?

7
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,708
No...

8
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,125
MORISATO!

9
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,458
Yes, what is it?

10
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,833
The two of us are gonna
lay low for a while.

11
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,208
And don't you dare tell
anyone where we are either.

12
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,833
But who are we gonna tell?

13
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,916
We don't even know
where you're going...

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,583
Just don't tell anyone!

15
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,625
So, adieu, lady
and gentlemen.

16
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:18,000
Um... Why are you taking
so much stuff with you?

17
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:18,833
Oh...

18
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,583
What's the heck's goin' on?

19
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,625
It's been a long time...

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,125
Those adjustments should help to
increase the engine's power.

21
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,375
I wonder if it'll run okay...

22
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,416
All that's left is to
take it for a test run

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
and see if there's
any improvement.

24
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,000
I can hardly wait to see!

25
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,708
You've certainly come
a long way with it.

26
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,083
Uh-huh... We're almost ready
to do a shakedown test.

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,375
Well, before you go do that...

28
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,458
why don't we all take
a short break, okay?

29
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,291
That's so nice of you!

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,416
And there are delicious
sweets to go with the tea.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,750
--Awesome!
--All right!

32
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
Things haven't changed.

33
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,375
WHA...?!

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,708
What the hell's going on?!

35
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,125
I'm not kidding. It's true!

36
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,208
2400 CCs?!

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,583
No, I'm serious!
It really was that big--

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,750
HEY!

39
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,625
Tamiya! Otaki!

40
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,250
What the hell's the
meaning of this?!

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,875
Um, excuse me, but who are you?

42
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,541
Stop staring at me and tell me

43
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,625
where Tamiya and
Otaki have gone.

44
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,000
The seniors ran outta
here a little while ago.

45
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,583
Damn.

46
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,333
They probably figured I'd come
without any advance notice...

47
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,875
Well, never mind...

48
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,458
You, there. Come with me.

49
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,583
Who gave you
permission to do that?

50
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,500
Did you know this vehicle
is the Auto Club's baby?

51
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,750
A treasure passed down from year
to year since the club began!

52
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,791
And therefore I--

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,041
Ah... ah...

54
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,791
Oh, my... it's beautiful!

55
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,041
Huh?

56
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,416
It's amazing...! Is it
a radio-controlled bike?

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Well, no. I'm gonna ride it.

58
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,000
You're gonna ride it?
How come?

59
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,875
Well, we, uh wanted to
investigate the possibilities

60
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,333
of an ultra-small-scale
internal combustion engine...

61
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,583
Huh?

62
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,333
That's the "official"
story, at least.

63
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,083
The truth is we
thought it would be cool

64
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,208
if someone could ride a
radio-controlled vehicle.

65
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:48,125
Talk about easy...! That's
so simple it's ridiculous!

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,750
Ah, I can't breathe!

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,083
W-What? Are you saying 'cause
it's simple, it's no good?

68
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,375
What's so bad about
it being simple?

69
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,250
Look, it seemed like
it'd be fun, okay?

70
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,500
And that's why we're doing it.

71
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,833
Don't you think that's
more than enough reason

72
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,416
to start this kind of project?

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,958
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,166
I didn't mean to make fun of
what you guys are trying to do.

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,708
Years ago...

76
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,416
there was a guy
standing right here,

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,333
who said the same kind of
thing that you're saying now.

78
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,416
Said the same thing?

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,958
You there. You've got a
good eye... What's your name?

80
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,750
Keiichi Morisato, Junior in
Mechanical Engineering.

81
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:32,416
I see... You're Morisato,
huh...? I like you, kid.

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,958
Hey, how about I make
another one of these,

83
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,458
and we have ourselves
a little race?

84
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,000
You wanna have a race?

85
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,166
You don't want to?

86
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,833
Well, this is all
kinda sudden, y'know?

87
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,375
Let's just say, meeting you
has put me in the mood to race.

88
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,583
Not enough of a reason?

89
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,500
I guess it's fine, but...

90
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,125
I think it's a wonderful idea.

91
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,375
Huh?

92
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,291
I'm certain it would be
much more fun to have

93
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:59,000
two people riding them
rather than just one person.

94
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,791
If you think something is fun,

95
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,250
then I believe
that mere enjoyment

96
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,375
is reason enough to do it.

97
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,250
I like your thinking!
What's your name?

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,250
Oh, my name is Belldandy.

99
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,625
Okay, so Morisato and "Bell"...

100
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,041
I'm really glad we
got a chance to meet.

101
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,708
So, we'll have the race
right here in one week, okay?

102
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,375
But, um...

103
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,291
What's the matter?
Does that not work for you?

104
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,791
No, it's just that we still
don't know who you are.

105
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,875
Oh, right... I never
did introduce myself.

106
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,666
I'm Ex-Club Manager Chihiro
Fujimi... Nice to meet you.

107
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
See ya later!

108
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,958
It turns out that
Ms. Fujimi is the one

109
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,500
who took a small group of
like-minded enthusiasts

110
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,375
and elevated them to "Auto Club"
status at Nekomi Tech.

111
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,291
The very first club manager...

112
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,208
Whoa, this is amazing!

113
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,541
Unbelievable!

114
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,208
All-Japan Dirt Trial Runner-Up

115
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,833
and First in the All-Japan
Gymkhana Championship?!

116
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,041
You're kidding...

117
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,625
Third in the Student
Formula SAE Competition

118
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,875
and First in the Six-hour
endurance race?!

119
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,541
Oh, maybe that's where Tamiya
and Otaki came into the picture.

120
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,708
I bet that kind of rigorous
racing environment

121
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,791
made them who they are today.

122
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,791
WHAT?! She came in Third place

123
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,458
in the amateur class
in the Suzuka 8 Hours?!

124
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,750
Yeah! She participated
as an amateur

125
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,500
in the Paris-Dakar Rally, too!

126
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,291
Hey, Keiichi, she raced
in the Sahara, too!

127
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,666
There are pictures of it!

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,958
So basically she was a
totally incredible person,

129
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,708
is that right?

130
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,500
It sure looks that way!

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,541
Plus, she worked in
the motorsports division

132
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,416
of a motorcycle manufacturer
after she graduated.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,250
So, do you think we
even stand a chance

134
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,416
against someone so amazing?

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,125
I honestly don't know.

136
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,875
Ms. Fujimi just came
in here and said that

137
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,000
she wanted to have
a race against us...

138
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,166
but it's not like I really know
anything about her though,

139
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
so it's hard to say...

140
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,500
Don't you want to race?

141
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,291
Huh?

142
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,250
It's nothing to
do with that...

143
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,791
It's just, that's not
why I built this bike.

144
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,375
Encounters like this...

145
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,291
are never merely
coincidence, Keiichi.

146
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,458
I'm sure there must be
some important reason

147
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,000
for the two of you
meeting each other today.

148
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,916
I wonder...

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,041
--Aaaaah!
--Huh?

150
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,083
Hey, come check out
this old photo!

151
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,000
Tamiya and Otaki
look so young here!

152
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,750
I'll bet this picture is
from when their group was

153
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,375
raised to official club
status at the university.

154
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,083
Look at that smile.

155
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,958
She must have been really happy.

156
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,875
Oh, now that really
takes me back.

157
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,708
Aahh! You were standing
right there the whole time?!

158
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,125
Sorry to bother you, but could
I borrow that box end wrench?

159
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,416
Uh, yeah, sure...

160
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,083
Thanks!

161
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,666
What are you going
to use it for?

162
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,625
Well, I couldn't just leave
my baby out there like that...

163
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,875
Oh...

164
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,041
Whoa...

165
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,000
She's fixing it?!

166
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,791
Man! This part's broken, too!

167
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,416
How the heck did she
lower the engine?!

168
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,541
--There's no brake fluid!
--I don't believe it!

169
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,958
Who the hell tuned
this suspension?!

170
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,375
Those guys still
don't know jack.

171
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,541
Belldandy?

172
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Yes?

173
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,041
I think I understand it now...

174
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:15,083
what it is that you
were trying to tell me.

175
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,916
I'm glad!

176
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,000
I kinda think we'd be in
different classes...

177
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,458
Don't worry about that!

178
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,625
Besides, you're the one
who wanted some practice,

179
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
so stop complaining!

180
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,125
Don't be intimidated
by its looks.

181
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,125
I mean, it's only a
child's toy after all.

182
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,708
I am not a child and
Banpei isn't a toy!

183
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,250
Yeah, yeah...

184
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,541
We're gonna show ya...!

185
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,208
This is the Banpei
Hybrid Hydrogen-Powered

186
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,458
Extra-Special Model... GO!

187
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,875
Wait a second!

188
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,458
Good. The bike feels right...

189
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,291
Aaaahh!

190
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,458
This tuning is going to
have a negative impact

191
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,541
on the engine's longevity.

192
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,458
I guess winning is gonna take
more than just horsepower...

193
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,041
What the heck are you doing?!

194
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,333
This is why I said it's
just a child's toy, Skuld.

195
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,583
But Banpei...

196
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,541
You can't lose to
something like that!

197
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,166
Waaahh!

198
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,583
Wow...

199
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,875
Well, I guess I
must've forgotten

200
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,375
to erase his attack program.

201
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,875
Now, listen, you...

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,541
Keiichi!

203
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,416
Hey...

204
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,041
I came to see if you're okay...

205
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,041
I heard a terrible
crash just now!

206
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,958
Uh-huh, yeah,
I'm okay, thanks...

207
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,750
And the bike's even
all right, too. See?

208
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,666
Oh, good, what a relief!

209
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,541
But if you don't mind, Keiichi,

210
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,750
I have a favor I'd
like to ask of you.

211
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,833
Oh. What is it?

212
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,666
An engine swap?!

213
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,083
What? Are you kidding me?!

214
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,333
We'll never have
it set up in time,

215
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,375
even if we start right now!

216
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,333
Our team's sponsor has
put in a very firm request.

217
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,583
The bike ran perfect
during today's practice!

218
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,875
Why change it now?

219
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,208
If we mess with it now,

220
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,500
we'll never get that vehicle
working properly...

221
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
Personally, I think we
oughta deny that request!

222
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,416
Well, that may be true.

223
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,708
The person who sent this
request is an amateur,

224
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,208
who thinks we can win
the race simply by

225
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,750
increasing our
engine performance...

226
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,541
But, he's still
our valued sponsor,

227
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,458
and he's keeping
us in the race...

228
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,416
You understand that, right?

229
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,916
This project is going
to be an all-nighter...

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,083
so thank you in advance for
the hard work. That's all.

231
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,833
It's probably 'cause we
haven't won a single race...

232
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,083
Do you believe this crap?!

233
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,416
Jeez! Unbelievable!

234
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Aw, man!

235
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,500
Well, I can't blame
them for being upset...

236
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,625
It takes sponsors
to have a team...

237
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,125
and money to win... Right?

238
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,416
Aaaahhh! I've had it!

239
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,458
Miss Chihiro?

240
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
Ah...

241
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,708
Hello. Good evening!

242
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,208
I guess I kinda... lost my cool.

243
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,125
Not at all...

244
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,291
This place is wonderful.

245
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,166
That's for sure!

246
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,000
When... I found out
I'd get to work here...

247
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,583
in a place like this...
I was just so excited...

248
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:13,625
I barely got any sleep.
I was working frantically.

249
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,875
And now I have the
fulfillment that comes from

250
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,541
being the head mechanic
everyone can depend on.

251
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,958
But it seems like
something's missing!

252
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,000
It seems...

253
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:29,208
I've been able to achieve
everything I ever wanted.

254
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,708
Do you think I'm spoiled?

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,708
Maybe this doesn't make
too much sense to you, huh?

256
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,583
As a matter of fact, it does.

257
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,458
I see the breeze that blows the
wind in your heart has shifted.

258
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,583
And it's no longer in harmony
with those around you.

259
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,666
Then, a gentle breeze
from your past blew in,

260
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
making you feel nostalgic,

261
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,541
and you were led back
to the Auto Club.

262
00:13:55,625 --> 00:14:00,583
Lately, I can't stop
thinking about the past.

263
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,083
And when I returned to the
clubhouse after all that time,

264
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,916
there were people
like Morisato there.

265
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,458
That's why I decided...

266
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,708
that if I can race against
Morisato and win as I am now,

267
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,625
I'll be able to get over this...

268
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,166
And finally move on...

269
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,625
I mean, why not, right?

270
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,541
Does that seem like an
odd way of thinking to you?

271
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,250
Not at all... I understand it.

272
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,916
You really do
get it, don't you?

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes. Because I am a goddess.

274
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,666
You sure are a funny one,
you know that?

275
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,500
As for Keiichi...

276
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,458
He will not be so
easily defeated.

277
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,166
The fact that I make
my living through racing

278
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,166
counts for something, too.

279
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,875
And I might have a few
tricks up my sleeve.

280
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,375
You can tell
Morisato I said that.

281
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,791
I'll tell him...

282
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,541
however, I doubt that Keiichi

283
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,375
will actually be
concerned about that.

284
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,250
Until we meet again.

285
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,583
Hey.

286
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:06,875
Are you in love with him?
With Morisato I mean.

287
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,625
I am!

288
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,958
Tamiya, Otaki...

289
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:22,541
I know you guys are in there.
You can come out now.

290
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,916
There you are. We've been
looking everywhere for you!

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,458
Since we missed you
back on campus,

292
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,958
we decided to come all the
way out here to see you!

293
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,625
Oh, so that's why you
guys are in there, huh?

294
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,958
Well, whatever...

295
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,833
You guys have managed to
round up a pretty good team...

296
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,291
Which is why I'm not planning to
hold back when I take them on.

297
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
You've done a good job.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,791
Oh, thanks, Miss Chihiro...

299
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,500
You really are much too kind
to a couple of goons like us!

300
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,666
Oh, and one more thing...

301
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,416
There's the whole matter of
someone "modifying" my baby...

302
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,833
Uh, it was just that...

303
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,458
The auto club was
running low on funds,

304
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,666
we didn't have a choice!

305
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,708
No excuses.

306
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,208
Ugh!

307
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,750
We'll discuss this in full
detail later. So be prepared.

308
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,291
Please, Chihiro!

309
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,583
Have mercy! Don't be so cruel!

310
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,958
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

311
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,291
You're done already?

312
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,416
Yes.

313
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,125
Did Chihiro seem...

314
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,958
Yes?

315
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,958
Nevermind... I guess
it's all right.

316
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,041
Let's go home, huh?

317
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,375
Okay!

318
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,791
All right then...

319
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,041
The winner will be decided

320
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,708
after two laps around
the campus course.

321
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,791
Please take care to avoid
endangering pedestrians.

322
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,041
So, who do you think's
gonna win the race?

323
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,791
You nitwit...! It'll
obviously be Chihiro!

324
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,041
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

325
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,541
On your marks...

326
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,041
Get set...

327
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,250
GO!

328
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,166
Good luck to both of you.

329
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,166
But I do hope...
that Keiichi will win.

330
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,208
--Ah!
--Look out, you maniac!

331
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,708
Man, she's fast! How on earth
did she tune that thing?!

332
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,833
Hang in there! You still
have a long way to go!

333
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,916
I'm gonna win
this for Belldandy.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,041
I'll have to give this
everything I've got.

335
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,083
Hm?

336
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,416
This way please!

337
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,125
Wasn't she just...

338
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
Right this way!

339
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,500
Uh... I'll figure
this out later.

340
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,083
Don't push it, Keiichi.

341
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,375
There's no way her engine can
possibly hold up at that speed.

342
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,375
I'll just keep a
nice steady pace.

343
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,958
And I'm sure my
chance will come!

344
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,791
Ah! Here they come!

345
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,500
--Go, Chihiro!
--Go, Chihiro! Yeah!

346
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,708
Not good. I guess it's time...

347
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,666
I don't see Keiichi anywhere...

348
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,000
Looks like he's
fallen way behind her.

349
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,125
Damn right he has!

350
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,416
He IS racing the
great Chihiro Fujimi!

351
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,125
Ah! There he is!

352
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,458
The distance between
him and Chihiro is...

353
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,208
Ah!

354
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,208
Ah!

355
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,458
--It's Chihiro! She's stopped!
--It's Chihiro! She's stopped!

356
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,791
I guess her engine
couldn't hold up

357
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,875
at that constant high
rate of speed after all!

358
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,250
It doesn't make sense.

359
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,083
Chihiro should've known
that was going to happen...

360
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,083
Huh?!

361
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,000
It can't be! A spare engine!

362
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,416
No one ever said swapping in
a new engine was prohibited.

363
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,458
But still... She shouldn't be
able to achieve maximum speed

364
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,416
out of a newly swapped engine!

365
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,958
Those eyes...

366
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,791
They don't look at anything
but what lies straight ahead...

367
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,333
Just like mine used to do...
way back then...

368
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,500
--C'mon! Give it a good push!
--Heave-ho!

369
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,625
--Chihiro!
--Hm?

370
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,666
Come on, let's go get ready
for that big party tonight...

371
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,875
What're you doing?

372
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,166
Sorry, I can't... I'm too
busy here fixing this thing.

373
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,958
Huh...? But what're
you doing that for?

374
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,041
I guess it seemed
like it'd be fun!

375
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,208
Back in those days...

376
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,166
I can do it!

377
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,041
Here they come now!

378
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,791
And it looks like Keiichi's
finally out in front!

379
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,125
--He's WHAT?!
--Impossible!

380
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,958
Come on, Keiichi...
You can do it! 

381
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,083
Uh?!

382
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,666
Chihiro?

383
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,666
I can make it!

384
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,208
You lost the race.

385
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,583
Yeah. But it's for the best,
don't you think?

386
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:12,291
After all, I'm not really the
one Chihiro was trying to beat.

387
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,958
So you realized that?

388
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,916
Yeah, somehow I did.

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,958
But still...

390
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,500
the message you
were able to convey

391
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,500
by racing with all your heart
did get through, Keiichi...

392
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,958
Just look.

393
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,791
--Hey, Morisato.
--Huh?

394
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,041
Thank you so much...
It was a very good race.

395
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,958
Thanks.

396
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,541
And it looked like you
were really enjoying it.

397
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,750
Yeah. I'd say you were, too.

398
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,833
Me...? You think so?

399
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,875
Uh-huh, and I thought
the same thing

400
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,416
when I watched you
repairing that old car.

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,958
I thought to myself,

402
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,916
"this is the kind of
person I'd like to race."

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,708
You wanted to race me?

404
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,291
Yeah! But then, you
were even more amazing

405
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,458
when you were racing
against me today.

406
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,208
The look on your face was
so serious and determined...

407
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,416
it was truly awesome.

408
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,166
Did... I say something funny?

409
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,583
Well, I guess it's true--great
minds really do think alike!

410
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,125
Huh?

411
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:15,041
Thanks again! And I owe
you some thanks also.

412
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,833
Thanks to you, I put
a lot of things behind me.

413
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,875
Oh, no... I really didn't
do anything for you at all.

414
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,708
Actually, it was all
thanks to Keiichi...

415
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,791
and to your own personal
strength as well, Miss Chihiro.

416
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,208
The two of you really
are... quite a pair!

417
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,666
Yes!

418
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,416
I see...

419
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,000
I really haven't changed...
since back then.

420
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,875
Whaaa-?! Chihiro says that...

421
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,541
she's going to quit her
job as head mechanic.

422
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,541
Huh?!

423
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,250
She says here that
it's because...

424
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,500
she wants to design
her own original bike

425
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,208
to be used for fun rather
than winning races.

426
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,250
Awesome...! I'd sure love
to try to do that, too!

427
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,916
As a matter of fact,
she also wrote that...

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
she knew you would say that.

429
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,750
Uh... She did, huh?

430
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,250
All right then...

431
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,166
Please explain what
makes you want to pursue

432
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,250
employment with our company.

433
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,875
Yes, sir!

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,583
There's something
I want to do here!

435
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,833
I had thought our relationship
was over long ago...

436
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,791
But as the plum trees
begin to blossom,

437
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,416
she remembers a love
from the past.

438
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,208
Next time, "Ah! A Goddess's
Tears and His Dream."

439
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,583
I'm telling you,
I'm NOT Urd's boyfriend!

440
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,125
Be sure to watch it!
