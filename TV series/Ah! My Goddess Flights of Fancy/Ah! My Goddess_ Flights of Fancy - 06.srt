1
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,625
Dai and I are gonna be attending

2
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,625
the Student Council's budget
meeting this afternoon.

3
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,041
And I want you guys to
straighten this place up

4
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,250
by the time we get back, okay?

5
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,291
Well, Den... Time to go.

6
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,875
Right, Dai! We gotta hustle!

7
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,416
Sure, they tell us to clean
this place up, but the fact is

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
most of that stuff
belongs to them.

9
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,458
Well, I suppose it
just goes to show you

10
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,916
how much trust they've
placed in you, doesn't it?

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,041
Well, to tell you the truth,

12
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,083
I have a feeling
they're just being lazy.

13
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,208
So, do you think we
should get started then?

14
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,666
Sure...

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,416
But what do you think should
we do with all this stuff?

16
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,666
I mean, they've stacked
these boxes so precariously

17
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,583
that if we move anything
even a little bit, it could...

18
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,041
Hasegawa!

19
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,166
AAAHHH!

20
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,791
Hasegawa, are you
all right?! Hasegawa!

21
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,833
Ahh!

22
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,500
You didn't hurt
anything, did you?

23
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,625
Kei-Keiichi!
Behind you, just now!

24
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,875
Uh...?

25
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,375
I wonder if that
could've been...?

26
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,583
I'm so relieved to see that
neither of you were injured!

27
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,833
Me, too...

28
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,708
--What the heck was that?
--That was close.

29
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,875
Thanks for your help, Belldandy.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,041
Why, of course, you're welcome.

31
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,583
I might've known.

32
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,958
That is... the one.

33
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,666
Well, I'm gonna go
grab some lunch.

34
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,666
Hm... I guess the reactor's
temperature isn't stable...

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
But the intensity shouldn't
be that high, though,

36
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,416
so I wonder if...

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,291
Success is never accomplished
without experiencing failure.

38
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,541
After all, each failed
attempt only brings you

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,125
that much closer to finding the
correct solution, does it not?

40
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,708
But more importantly...

41
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:37,166
Here! Perhaps if you have some
lunch now it'll cheer you up.

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,416
Ah, yeah, you're right.

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,541
Hm...? What?

44
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,041
What's this? A letter?

45
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,875
Shiho Sakakibara...
freshman Electronics major?

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,875
I've never heard of her.

47
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,875
Let's see...

48
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,208
"I'm sorry to send you a letter
like this out of the blue.

49
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,916
I've been keeping
these feelings inside

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,625
since the moment
I first saw you..."

51
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,666
and although I tried many
times to speak to you in person,

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,708
I was never actually able
to go through with it.

53
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,541
But today I've
found the courage,

54
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,041
and I want to tell
you how I feel.

55
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,541
Uh...

56
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,458
C-Could this be...

57
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,250
one of those "love letters"
you always hear about?

58
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,708
I mean, I've written one before,

59
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,166
but no one's ever
given one to me!

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,000
What's that?

61
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,125
AAAHHH!

62
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,875
I believe letters
are meant to express

63
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,666
the sentiments of
those who write them.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,916
Isn't that correct?

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,541
"I will wait in front
of the fountain

66
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,083
until you come to meet me
there. I'll wait forever."

67
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,583
--Urd!
--Keiichi, your such a player!

68
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,250
So... are you gonna
hook up with her?

69
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,583
Huh?! Of course not. I'm not
hooking up with anyone!

70
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,000
Hooking up?

71
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,750
Ah...

72
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,541
Hooking up...

73
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,208
Hm...!

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,833
So, what're you gonna do
about this, huh, Keiichi?

75
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,000
I predict she'll be
incredibly cute, too!

76
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,416
Oh. Is that right?

77
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
What should I do now...?

78
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,541
What do you think
I should say to her?

79
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,875
Uh, it's not what you think!

80
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,916
I'm not going to "hook up"
with her or anything!

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,041
--I'm just going to--
--Keiichi?

82
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,166
Yes?!

83
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,583
I believe that...

84
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,458
it takes a great
amount of energy

85
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,458
in order to express
one's feelings like that.

86
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,791
Therefore, I think you
must respond to her letter!

87
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,708
Ya know, I think I'd kinda like
it if she got a little jealous.

88
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,166
--Keiichi?
--Yeah?!

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
If we are in agreement,

90
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,708
I think we should go and
respond to her right away.

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,125
Uh, yeah...
I guess you're right.

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,166
Remember to express
your feelings honestly.

93
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,333
When she said that...

94
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,166
I could see in her eyes
that she really meant it.

95
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,583
But still...

96
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,416
How can she not be jealous
in this kind of situation?

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,041
Does she really trust
me so completely?

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,583
Or could it possibly be that

99
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,375
I'm not even worth
getting jealous over?

100
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,916
Whoa! She is cute!

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,208
What'd I tell ya? I just
knew she was gonna be a cutie.

102
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,958
Man... There's absolutely
no way there's gonna be

103
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,208
an easy way out
of this situation.

104
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,750
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,500
Look at you blush...
She's your type, isn't she?

106
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,791
How could you say that?!

107
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,250
What do you think, Belldandy?

108
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,041
I think she's a very
beautiful person.

109
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,416
Huh?

110
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,041
And it seems as though
she's looking for someone...

111
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,041
Ah!

112
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,541
I believe she's noticed you.

113
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,166
You did come after all!

114
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,625
Ah!

115
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,541
I'm so glad...!

116
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,791
I was beginning to
think you wouldn't come.

117
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,833
Was... she really the one...?

118
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,250
That sweet, vulnerable
smile of hers

119
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,500
is way too much for me to...

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,750
Listen... I was happy to receive
that letter from you, but...

121
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,041
But I...

122
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,583
I'm sorry! But your feelings
for me are just too--

123
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,958
Hold it right there!

124
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,791
Stay where you are!

125
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,166
Huh...?

126
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,958
I knew it!

127
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,291
You have been possessed by
something, after all...!

128
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,166
You're emitting impulses
of energy right now

129
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,500
that are not human!

130
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,916
WHAAAT?!

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,666
Don't tell me she knows
about the goddesses!

132
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,250
Ah, yes...! With my power,
I'll send evil spirits

133
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,750
who torment people
back to the darkness!

134
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,125
I'm shivering with excitement
just thinking about it!

135
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,583
Uh...? What... "Evil spirits"?

136
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,541
Just you relax!

137
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
Don't worry.

138
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,958
I promise I'll exorcise the evil
spirits that's possessed you!

139
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,958
Uh... so then, you're an
exorcist or something then?

140
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,458
Yes...!

141
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm a second year student in
the correspondence program.

142
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,958
Oh, I think I get it now.
So that's what you meant...

143
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,375
"He'll be my first!"

144
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,083
Right! I'm going to
exorcise you now!

145
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,375
Okay! This is getting annoying!

146
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,000
Why are you just
standing there?!

147
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,333
If you're gonna reject her,
then DO it already!

148
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,625
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,833
Before, you were telling
me to hook up with her!

150
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,875
Oh, come on!
I was just teasing.

151
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,291
I can see it clearly now!

152
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,916
An evil female spirit who
will bring great disaster!

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,875
It's not an evil spirit,
it's my living soul!

154
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,250
Belldandy...!
You're also to blame here!

155
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,375
Don't you have anything to say?

156
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,833
You see, Keiichi told me

157
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,208
that he wanted me to
always be here with him...

158
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,541
and that it would be all right
for me to remain by his side.

159
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:38,041
So I will believe those words,
no matter what else may happen.

160
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,666
I'm sick of this.
Enough is enough...

161
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,250
So this is the place, huh?!

162
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,958
Okay, I'll be going inside to
start my preparations now...

163
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,500
so no peeking, understood?

164
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,708
Come on! I don't understand!

165
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,791
Why are you letting some
crazy stranger use MY room?!

166
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,625
She says it's facing
the right direction.

167
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,375
Direction for doing WHAT?!

168
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,833
For exorcising evil spirits.

169
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,250
AAAH!

170
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,500
You've gotta be kidding me...

171
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,833
Night after night, the
menacing sound of footsteps

172
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,583
echoes down the empty hallway.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,708
Hey, I'm sorry about
this, Belldandy.

174
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,583
This whole ridiculous
situation is because

175
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,791
I wasn't honest with
Shiho from the beginning.

176
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,041
This is not something you
need to apologize for.

177
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,625
But I was... a little
worried about one thing.

178
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,125
I was worried that if Shiho
were really in love with you,

179
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,625
that you would surely have...

180
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,083
ended up... hurting her.

181
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,291
Or am I... wrong to say this?

182
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,875
Mm-mm...

183
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,541
Don't be silly!

184
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,666
Keiichi!

185
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,208
Thank you all for waiting!

186
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,000
That outfit is...

187
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,375
It's nice, isn't it...?

188
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,166
I made it myself, but now...
more importantly...

189
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,958
--Maintain silence.
--Huh?

190
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,166
I am now going to
synchronize our breathing.

191
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,208
Hey! W-Wait... just a minute!

192
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,916
You're... getting too close!

193
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,000
It's poltergeists at work!

194
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,458
Uh...!

195
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,333
You've shown yourselves,
eh, evil spirits?!

196
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,166
So, you wanna mess with me?
Then come and get it!

197
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,000
So, what's all that
stuff for anyway?

198
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,500
Oh... boy...

199
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,791
Just as I thought, I knew
you'd get it wrong...

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,958
These actually summon
low-level evil spirits.

201
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,291
Uh...

202
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,833
Why is this kind of stuff
always happening to me?

203
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,375
Belldandy.

204
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,291
Belldandy!

205
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,375
--Yes, what is it, Urd?
--Belldandy?

206
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,541
Come help me peel
off these talismans.

207
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,041
Of course.

208
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,166
Ah...!

209
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,333
It worked...! My talismans
sure did their job, huh?!

210
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,166
A-ha...! So I DO
have the ability!

211
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,166
Thank you! You're the first one!

212
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,583
The first person to go all the
way in helping me with my hobby!

213
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,708
Well... I could tell
from your expression

214
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,375
that you were very
serious about it,

215
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,708
so I couldn't just
turn you down...

216
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,708
And that aspect of
your personality

217
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,500
is part of the
reason I chose you.

218
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,875
Oh...

219
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,291
So then, you really do like
this kind of stuff, huh?

220
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,041
Uh...

221
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,416
Thank you, Keiichi.

222
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,916
Aaahh!

223
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,916
Aaahh!

224
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
Belldandy!

225
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,666
That was amazing!

226
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,125
It must be a challenge
aimed directly at me,

227
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,375
isn't that right?

228
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,541
Well, I'm a little scared,
but I'll be okay!

229
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,083
Leave it to me!

230
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll get rid of all of them this
time, just you wait and see!

231
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,250
Now, the technique that I'm
about to use is a procedure

232
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,208
I just recently learned,
but it's the method

233
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,375
that will give me
the greatest power!

234
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,375
You just sit there and
remain calm, all right?

235
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,916
Um, okay...

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,708
Oh, don't worry, you can
leave it up to my genius

237
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,625
to take care of
everything, okay?

238
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,000
You're saying her power escaped?

239
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,666
Yeah. Belldandy lost control.

240
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,250
But why?

241
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't know?

242
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,541
Keiichi... how long have you
been with Belldandy now?

243
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,625
She's jealous.

244
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,833
Jealous?

245
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,041
She's not some kind
of doll, you know.

246
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,125
Belldandy experiences those
kinds of emotions, too.

247
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,458
You're kidding.
But she's a goddess, so...

248
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,125
"So she couldn't," is that it?

249
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,708
Falling in love with someone
isn't always pretty...

250
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,208
In fact, it seldom is.

251
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,250
And because she's a goddess...

252
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,750
it hurts her all
the more deeply.

253
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,833
Mm...

254
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,041
You see, this is the first time
that Belldandy has realized...

255
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,916
her own sense of jealousy.

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,666
She's so confused
about what to do now.

257
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,875
She could try shutting all
those feelings up inside.

258
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,416
But if she did that, the
outcome would be disastrous

259
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,708
and she'd explode
before too long.

260
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,666
Belldandy...

261
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,291
Why?

262
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,208
I have a whirlwind
of feelings inside,

263
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,750
and I can't manage to
suppress this dark emotion.

264
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,958
What has happened to me?

265
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,583
Somebody... Help me!

266
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,833
Inri... Yod, Nun... Resh, Yod.

267
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,041
Urd!

268
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,833
Oh, come on, Skuld!
Stop being such a pain!

269
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,458
If you're that scared
then get out of here!

270
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,500
But I'd be even more
scared by myself!

271
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,666
Ugh...

272
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,125
Is there anything
the matter... Keiichi?

273
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:38,000
Ah, it's no big deal really...

274
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,500
But I was just thinking that...

275
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,625
Yes?

276
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,708
I want you to know
that I never...

277
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,416
intended for things to
turn out the way they have.

278
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,833
It's all my fault for not being

279
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,000
more upfront with her
in the first place.

280
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,666
And I really hope
you understand that

281
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,500
it's nothing you
should take to heart.

282
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,666
Keiichi...

283
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,833
Keiichi!

284
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,583
I now require total silence.
It won't be much longer.

285
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,333
Oh... I'm sorry...

286
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,125
No! I'm so scared!

287
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,708
Inri. Yod, Nun, Resh.
Yod, Nun, Resh.

288
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,125
--No! No! NO! Please stop!
--Isis... Apophi... Osiris...

289
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,208
I... A... O!

290
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,125
ARARITA!

291
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,458
Hey, Urd, are you sure
she knows what she's doing?

292
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,708
What would I know about

293
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,458
a worthless incantation
like that one?

294
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,041
GRRR!

295
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,875
Wait, isn't that...

296
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,416
I really did it! I have
awakened the Kundalini!

297
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,208
Whaaat?!

298
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,708
I am called Garm.

299
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:51,000
I am the watchdog over
the dark world Niflheim.

300
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:51,875
No!

301
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,333
You will state your intent...

302
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,791
Looks like she's really
done it this time.

303
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,250
Actually, you're not
the one I was calling.

304
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,375
You idiot!

305
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,666
Such flagrant audacity!

306
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,625
You have dared to summon the
mighty Garm without reason?!

307
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,875
I'm only saying you're
not who I was summoning.

308
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,166
Ten thousand deaths would
not be enough for you!

309
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
Ah! Urd!

310
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,416
Grr... rawr!

311
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,875
Skuld, hurry!
Get those symbols erased!

312
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm scared...

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,291
They're written
in permanent marker,

314
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,708
so they're not coming off!

315
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,500
Then rewrite them as
an anti-demonic program!

316
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,708
I don't know how to write
those kinds of formulas!

317
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,041
Rawr!

318
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,166
No! At this rate,
we're gonna be...

319
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,916
An anti-demonic program
won't work on Garm.

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,958
We must use a
banishment program.

321
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,083
Belldandy!

322
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,416
I have to keep fighting him off!

323
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,541
Belldandy...
you'll have to do it!

324
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,750
Belldandy!

325
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,625
Hey, are you okay?

326
00:17:54,708 --> 00:18:00,833
It's no use. I don't
know it... I can't move...

327
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:05,958
I'm so scared...! It won't
erase...! Please stop this!

328
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,083
Grrrr!

329
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,750
It's no use...
He's way too strong!

330
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,125
Hold on!

331
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,250
Be careful!

332
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,125
I've reached my limit!

333
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,916
Grr...! Rawr!

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,958
Oh, no, Urd!

335
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,666
Keiichi, save me!

336
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,833
You're strangling me!

337
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,708
Rawr!

338
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,875
Grr... What was that?!

339
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,708
--Belldandy!
--I'm really scared!

340
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,625
Was that me...? Did I just...?

341
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,208
I see...

342
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,166
All that pent up jealousy must
have weakened Belldandy's seal.

343
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,833
If she could hit Garm
directly with that power...

344
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,416
she would be able
to send him back.

345
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,541
But then...

346
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,875
I'm sorry, Belldandy, I'm going
to have to play a little dirty.

347
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,416
Forgive me.

348
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,833
Grr...

349
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,958
Aaaahhh! No! Keiichi!
Please do something! Aaaaahh!

350
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,333
Rawr...!

351
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,625
AAAAHHH!

352
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,833
Summon!

353
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,333
Remote Human
Manipulation technique!

354
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,333
Keiichi, I'm... really sorry.

355
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:31,916
Ah! Why the hell am
I doing this to her?!

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,541
I understand.

357
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,708
I was... so afraid...

358
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,583
Rawr...!

359
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,000
Belldandy!

360
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,791
Grr!

361
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
Belldandy...

362
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,291
I'm truly a terrible person...

363
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,291
I thought I was concerned about
her feelings being hurt...

364
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,250
but the real truth
of the matter is that

365
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,583
I was actually more
afraid of losing you.

366
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,583
Despite the fact I told you that
I have complete faith in you.

367
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
Belldandy...

368
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,583
Keiichi...! You must
really hate me now!

369
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,750
No, that's not true!

370
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm the one who
should be apologizing!

371
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:45,125
Because... I was wrong to take
your trust in me for granted.

372
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,916
Urd explained to me that
falling in love with someone

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,333
isn't always pretty,
and I understand that now.

374
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,750
Maybe being in love
with someone means...

375
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,583
that you want to be with
that person all the time...

376
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:01,208
no matter if you're upset
or crying or laughing.

377
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
Look, Belldandy...

378
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:08,666
I hope you understand that your
the only one I want to be with.

379
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,875
Oh, Keiichi...

380
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,875
Oh, thank you!

381
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,666
Belldandy...

382
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,041
Oh, Keiichi...

383
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,750
I know I planned
all this myself,

384
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,916
so what in the world is
this strange itchy feeling?

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,875
--I did it!
--Uh?

386
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
This serves as absolute proof

387
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,500
that I really am
a genius after all!

388
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,333
I will continue to
use this awesome power

389
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,916
to make everyone happy!
Thank you so much for helping!

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,083
The fact she was
able to summon Garm...

391
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,083
might make her a genius,
even if she did it by mistake...

392
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,458
What did you say?!

393
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,958
You should be
grateful just to...

394
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,791
Obsessive, overconfident,
inexperienced, and cocky...

395
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,166
Yep. Those two are birds
of a feather all right.

396
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
I'll tell you something
about geniuses...

397
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,625
You happen to be looking at one!

398
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,625
Oh? And what exactly
makes YOU a genius, hm?

399
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,791
Care to give me a demonstration?

400
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,750
Okay, you asked for it!
Here I go!

401
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,458
It should have been
just another mistake.

402
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,041
Appearing with
the scent of roses,

403
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,750
she rejects their
unexpected reunion.

404
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,833
Next time, "Ah!
I Shall Grant Your Wish."

405
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:15,416
Yes, we know that your
service is the best in Heaven.
