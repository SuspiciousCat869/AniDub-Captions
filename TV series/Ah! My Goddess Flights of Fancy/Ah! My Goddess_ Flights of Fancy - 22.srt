1
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,208
Hey! Just what the
heck is going on?!

2
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,083
You've... gotta be kidding me!

3
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,458
Hild?

4
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,208
Hm? Oh, Bell, I just started
some of my home-cooking.

5
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,750
Would you like
to try some, too?

6
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,291
What are you talking about?!

7
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,750
And just what do you
think you're doing

8
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,833
waltzing into our house and
using our kitchen anyway?!

9
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,375
Hey, Hild?

10
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:06,041
Is breakfast ready yet? I'm so
hungry I could eat a horse!

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,333
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,208
It'll be just a little
longer, darling!

13
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,291
Now be a good boy
and wait patiently.

14
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,458
Well, I can't wait to try

15
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,083
whatever it is you've
made this time.

16
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,875
Just be sure to let me
know when it's ready, okay?

17
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,000
Sure thing!

18
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:21,125
Hey! Get back here,
Keiichi! Keiichi!

19
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:27,458
Why is Keiichi acting like this?

20
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,916
Here. Now say "ah."

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,583
Aaah...

22
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,250
Now I think I understand
what's going on.

23
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,458
I was totally wrong
about you, Keiichi!

24
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,875
How could you two-time Big
Sis with that rotten, Hild?!

25
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,500
AH, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

26
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,416
Just what is the matter
with you, Keiichi?!

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,750
With me...? What do you mean?

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,541
Don't try being coy with me!

29
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,041
How could you do this
when you've got Big Sis?!

30
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,083
Although technically I suppose
Big Sis is still mine...

31
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,125
But still!

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,583
What are you
talking about, Skuld?

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,750
Here, why don't you try some
of this? It's really good!

34
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,916
Like I'd ever try
any of Hild's food!

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,416
Of course, I mean
what would you do

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,958
if it actually turned out to
be better than Belldandy's?

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,041
There's no way
that could happen!

38
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,125
Would you care to take
a little taste test?

39
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,500
Then perhaps you
can see for yourself

40
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,500
whether it's better or not.

41
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,916
Uh-oh.

42
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,375
AAHHH!

43
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,208
Oh, my. Maybe the
flavor profiles were

44
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,125
a tad too intense for a child.

45
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,291
There's no sign he's under
any kind of control, is there?

46
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,541
Correct.

47
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,375
Oh, you've got a speck
of food on your face.

48
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,916
Hey, cut it out.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,875
We shouldn't act like this in
front of Urd and Belldandy.

50
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,416
And why not?

51
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,333
I'm sure they're both very happy
for us, Keiichi. Aren't you?

52
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,541
All right, that's enough...!

53
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,041
I don't know what
your scheme is here,

54
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,666
but if you make
Belldandy angry--

55
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,791
Oh, no.

56
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,166
That is the rising dragon!

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,750
Oh, my... Nanmaida, nanmaida...

58
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,208
Uh, are you okay, Belldandy?

59
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,166
Still just a girl deep down,
aren't you, Bell?

60
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,333
Keiichi...

61
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,333
That's quite a lump of
earwax I just extracted!

62
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, I guess I haven't cleaned
out my ears in a while.

63
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,125
I'm not picking anything up.

64
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,958
There aren't any signs of
a spell being used on him.

65
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,791
But is there any
chance that Keiichi

66
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,375
may have been
possessed by a demon?

67
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,666
No, it's not that either.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,125
That's the real Keiichi.

69
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,791
Do you think he could
have been given something,

70
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,250
like a seed of love,
or some kind of potion?

71
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,541
I look into that too
but there's no indication

72
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,291
that he's been given
any kind of drug.

73
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Then, Keiichi and Hild,
truly are in love?

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
No, there's definitely
something going on here.

75
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,458
I'm sure of it.

76
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey, Keiichi.

77
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,000
You know, it's been a while
since we've had a bath together.

78
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,750
Ah... But I...

79
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,250
You do wanna take
one with me right?

80
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,500
Oh no, it's not that I don't
want to or anything.

81
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,166
It's just that I'm a little
embarrassed. That's all.

82
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,291
But why? We're
in love aren't we?

83
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,375
So I really don't see
what the big deal is.

84
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,875
Yeah, I guess you're right.

85
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,625
Ahh?!

86
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,875
This is bad!

87
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,250
If Belldandy see them
together in the bath,

88
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,333
everything in the area
will be totally obliterated.

89
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,875
What are we gonnaa do?!

90
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,250
Ugh! We'll beat her there and
prevent it from happening!

91
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,666
Ahh!

92
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,916
Would you rather see this
whole place blown to bits?

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,541
I... will do what I can...

94
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,375
Ugh! To think of what I have
to deal with around here.

95
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,125
Hello, Urd.

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,958
Oh, hey! What's up?

97
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,000
Sorry, but we're kind of in the
middle of something right now.

98
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:38,916
Look at this.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Huh?

100
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,833
Now, Keiichi, why don't we start
with washig each other's backs?

101
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,791
Ahhh!!!

102
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,333
You're such a pervert, Keiichi!

103
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,708
Stop looking and just
get outta here already.

104
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,833
Ok! Sorry about that

105
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,250
Just hold on.

106
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,666
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, she's only
a child after all.

108
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,583
What did you just call me?!

109
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,583
Now, listen Skuld, sweetie,

110
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,166
you shouldn't worry about that
until later down the road

111
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,041
once you're all grown up.

112
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,333
Holy...

113
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,833
Now then, Keiichi...

114
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,208
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,375
Come on over here.

116
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,375
Uh...

117
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,166
No!!

118
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,125
Oh my! You shouldn't
fall asleep there.

119
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,125
You'll catch a cold.

120
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,125
What exactly did
you do to Keiichi?

121
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,000
Why I haven't done
anything to him.

122
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,375
We're simply in
love. That's all.

123
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,791
There's no way that's true.

124
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,333
So what did I do to him then?

125
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,041
Hmm?

126
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,500
Well, I don't exactly...

127
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,166
Ok! That's quite enough.

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,625
Oh, why hello, Urdie.

129
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,041
Oh, Keiichi!
Please tell me you're all right!

130
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,708
I think it's high time
you did a little explaning.

131
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,500
Whatever do you mean?

132
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,833
Belldandy found this
interesting little item.

133
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,750
Wow! That was faster
than I expected.

134
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,125
Why would you possibly
want to do this?

135
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,708
Iis it Keiichi's
heart youre after

136
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,333
or something else?

137
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,000
Good question.

138
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,375
I guess I just
did it on a whim.

139
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,250
Just a whim?

140
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,916
Because you felt like it,

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,458
Well, if you don't like it

142
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,791
then why not see if
you can get him back?

143
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,875
He is your Keiichi, right?

144
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,125
Are you ok?

145
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,583
Is that you Hild?

146
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,916
Where am I?

147
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,333
Belldandy...

148
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,333
Let's all go together
and get your Keiichi back.

149
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,666
But Urd...

150
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,625
Y'know, she doesn't seem
the least bit concerned

151
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,250
about what we're doing.

152
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,875
Will this really work?

153
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,541
What's really getting to
me is seeing how much

154
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,000
she's enjoying all this.

155
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,916
Keiichi...

156
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,166
Ooo, I just love that
look in her eyes.

157
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,000
It's giving me the chills.

158
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,875
Are you ready Urd?

159
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,041
Let's do this.

160
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,583
I am the goddess Urd.

161
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,916
In the name of the goddesses who
govern the passage of time,

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,375
guide us into the past,
into the point we seek.

163
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
It's so cold.

164
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,875
Where the heck are we anyway?

165
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,625
We're in the town where
Keiichi was born and grew up.

166
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,375
The town where he was born?

167
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,166
So this is where
Keiichi used to live?

168
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,125
Keiichi...

169
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,416
Oh man, I guessed I
shouldn't have fooled around

170
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,583
with the engine.

171
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,041
I'll never be able
to beat him like this.

172
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,625
Just look at him!
Young Keiichi is so cute!

173
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,750
Yohoo! Keiichi!

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,625
Ugh! What do you
think you're doing?

175
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,666
Don't be such a fool.

176
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,125
Keiichi has met us
yet in this time

177
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,166
so he's obivoulsy not gonna
know who we are.

178
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,958
Oh! You're right. I forgot.

179
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
Good Morning, Keiichi.

180
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,958
Oh, uh, good morning.

181
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,208
Engine break down again?

182
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,916
Yeah, I'm ashamed to admit it.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,375
Hey! Kei, see you
when you get home, eventually!

184
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,750
Haha! Later! Wohoo!

185
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,416
That Keima sure has
a really nice bike.

186
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,458
But even so,
you'll beat him some day.

187
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,458
That's right;
you better believe it.

188
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,083
Oh, Keiichi. I'm freezing.

189
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,083
Can you believe
those two flirting

190
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,208
with each other like that?

191
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,375
What is he thinking?

192
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,250
Well you can hardly blame him.

193
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,458
From what I can tell it doesn't
seem like he was very popular

194
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,125
with the girls
back then, does it?

195
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,958
And yet, she's already managed
to get acquainted with him.

196
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,750
She's reading our moves
and adjusting accordingly.

197
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,500
If we go back in time again,

198
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,666
she'll just got even farther
back and meet Keiichi then.

199
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,625
I'm afraid it's quite simple for
the ruler of demon kind.

200
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,583
But... What should we do?

201
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,916
We have to take a stand here

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,375
and try to turn Keiichi's
attention towards you.

203
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,791
If it's the only way...

204
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,041
All right. Quiet down, everyone.

205
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,875
This is a bit sudden but
I've got a new student

206
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,166
to introduce to you.

207
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,583
Her name is Belldandy.

208
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,750
She just transfered here,

209
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,541
so please try to make
her feel at home.

210
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,416
Hello. My name's Belldandy.

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,333
It's very nice to
meet all of you.

212
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,625
All right, Ryuta. Settle down.

213
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,541
Anyway, as I was saying, please
give Belldandy a hand if you see

214
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,250
that she needs help with
anything for the next few days.

215
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,875
But why do I have to pretend
to be in Elementary school?

216
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,375
Because, you
simply look the part.

217
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,583
That's why.

218
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,916
Well, I'll have you
know that I'm an adult,

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,958
so I should be on the...

220
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,375
You've already been registered

221
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,000
as an Elementary School
transfer student,

222
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,416
so there's nothing I can do.

223
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,458
No run along to
class, young lady.

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,250
I hate you, Urd!!!

225
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,791
Now, have a look at
the triangle on the left.

226
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:07,583
If we draw a line from
point A to points B and C...

227
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,166
This is the kind of
situation that calls

228
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,708
for writing him a letter.

229
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,666
Then find a descreet
way of slipping it to him.

230
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,666
Right. Well that's
all for today then.

231
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,000
This material will be on the
test, so be sure to review it.

232
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,333
Excuse me.

233
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,166
Hmm?

234
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,375
Ah! Sorry about earlier.

235
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,125
I wasn't really
staring at you see...

236
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,166
Uh... Uhm... It's just that I
thought you were kinda pretty

237
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,958
and so I was...

238
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,166
Keiichi.

239
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,375
Woulld you mind showing
me your math notes?

240
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,583
Oh! Uh, sure no problem.

241
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,833
Uh... Let's see...

242
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,958
Oh, there it is,

243
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,083
My, you have such
nice handwriting.

244
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,333
Really? Huh... I never
thought it was that good.

245
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,625
Excuse me.

246
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,208
Can we help you with something?

247
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,125
Well, I just...

248
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,041
Oh look at you Keiichi.
You've got bed head again.

249
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,541
Come on. Let's get going.

250
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:04,625
Sure...

251
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,791
See you later.

252
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,208
Ah, excuse me.

253
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,166
What's going on?

254
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,875
Never mind. It's noithing.

255
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,875
Uhmm...

256
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,458
Come on. Let's forget about
reading and go play basketball.

257
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,916
Please excuse me.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,916
It's just that I was
hoping to give you..

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,083
Keiichi!

260
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,750
What's taking you
so long in there?

261
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,291
We gotta go!

262
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,541
Coming!

263
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,791
If I can just...

264
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,750
Keiichi!

265
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,791
Keiichi...

266
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:34,000
Why? Why can't I capture just
the tiniest bit of courage?

267
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,250
You still haven't
given it to him?

268
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,583
You can't allow her
to get in the way

269
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,500
and obstruct what
you're trying to do.

270
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,333
I know that but I just
couldn't find the courage.

271
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,250
Well the first thing you have to
do is get yourself more noticed.

272
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,208
Shoot hima few amorous
looks now an then.

273
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,208
Or you could even
fall over on purpose

274
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541
so he can see up your skirt.

275
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
Or ask him what kind of
girls he is interested in.

276
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,625
I dunno. All of
this feels so wrong.

277
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,583
It feels like there is a black
cloud over my heart

278
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,500
and it's filled with so
many negative emotions.

279
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,125
Jealousy, huh?

280
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,541
No, of course not!

281
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,250
Well, regardless,
whatever it is,

282
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,250
it's clearly not
working for you.

283
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,291
All right then.

284
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,958
This calls for a
change of plans.

285
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,375
Leave her to me.

286
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,333
You just concetrate
on telling Keiichi

287
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,000
how you really feel about him.

288
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,791
You can manage that much right?

289
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,583
Or rather, you haave to manage
that much, or we're in trouble.

290
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,833
Right.

291
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,708
Hey, Skuld. We're heading
over to the kid's store.

292
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,750
Wanna come with us?

293
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,041
What's the kid's store?

294
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,208
A candy shop.

295
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,125
They've got tons of
toys and candy there

296
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,166
and I'll be happy to buy
you some if you want.

297
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,000
Will you really?
Sure I'll go!!

298
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:51,083
Maybe Elementary School
isn't so bad after all.

299
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,041
Hmm?

300
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,375
What's going on down there?

301
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,458
How about we go do something
on the way home today?

302
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,625
Well, I'm afraid I don't have
any money on me today...

303
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,583
Actually, I'd like to have a
little word with you.

304
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,125
So that's how it's
gonna be, huh?

305
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,708
I uhm... I don't know what
Hild might have done to

306
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,625
upset you so much but I'll
be happy to hear you out.

307
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,500
So would you mind
just putting that down?

308
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,166
Keiichi...

309
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,541
It's all right. You don't
need to get involved in this.

310
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,000
Why don't you run on home?

311
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,625
I'll catch up with you later.

312
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,166
But I don't think...

313
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,500
I said go.

314
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,708
Hild?

315
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,458
All right. If that's
how you wanna play it.

316
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,083
And I was just starting
to get bored here.

317
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,916
I'll be impressed Urdie,
if you can last five minutes.

318
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,333
That's not too shabby.

319
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,166
If you keep
underestimating me like that,

320
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,291
it might prove costly.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,208
Ahh! What's going on the
breaks aren't responding?!

322
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,833
Oh no! Waaaahh!!

323
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,125
Are you all right, Keiichi?

324
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,750
Keiichi?

325
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,500
Oh, sorry.

326
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,875
I didn't think you knew my
first name since we just met.

327
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,875
I'm sorry, Mr. Morisato.

328
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,708
Oh, it's ok. You can call
me Keiichi, if you want.

329
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,583
Well, uhmm, actually...

330
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,750
Huh?

331
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,333
I, uhm...

332
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,083
Uhm...

333
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,166
You see...

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,125
I... I'd like to...

335
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,166
You see the truth is th--

336
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,333
Keiichi!

337
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,458
Oh, uh, hey, Hild!

338
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,000
Just what do you think you're
doing standing out here

339
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,250
talking to some other girl
behind my back, hmm?

340
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,041
Well, I fell off my bike.

341
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,625
Oh no! Are you all right?

342
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,083
I'm sorry, Belldandy.

343
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,083
She was just
too powerful for me.

344
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,791
Come on. We can't act
like this in front of her.

345
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,000
Why not just say it?

346
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,375
Tell us your true feelings.

347
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,916
Tell you my true feelings?

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,791
That's right.

349
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,583
You utterly hate me, don't you?

350
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,791
For taking the one you love the
most and making him my own.

351
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,625
And for turning him into
my own little plaything...

352
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey! Hold on!

353
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,833
A little boy like this...

354
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,000
Huh?

355
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,000
What are you doing?

356
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,791
You just hold still now...

357
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,291
No!!!

358
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,916
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,041
Those are your true feelings
and your true power.

360
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:54,541
Now, why don't you go ahead
and release those feelings?

361
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,333
Release all my feelings?

362
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,250
Anger, hatred, jealousy...

363
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,750
Stop suppressing it.

364
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,125
I want you to hit me
with all those feelings.

365
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,541
But I...

366
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,083
If you just release it, Keiichi
will come back to you.

367
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,083
And you can have
him all to yoursef.

368
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,500
Now, show me what you've got!

369
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,833
But I mustn't... I'm a goddess.

370
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,208
Release all the
emotion and power.

371
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,125
Let go and release everything!

372
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,666
But I mustn't!

373
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,458
I was wondering.

374
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,500
Do you like the snow?

375
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,416
I sure do.

376
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
It's pure and white

377
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:42,375
and I dunno; it just has a way
of making me feel peaceful.

378
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,875
And I think, that for some
reason or another,

379
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,125
it seems to suit
you really well too.

380
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,750
Huh?

381
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,000
It's called diamond dust.

382
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,416
It's beautiful, isn't it?

383
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,083
It is.

384
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,958
It can't be.

385
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,750
I don't believe it.

386
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,708
Hild?

387
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,125
I think we need to have a talk.

388
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,083
See ya later!

389
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:19,875
Hmm?

390
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,000
Huh? Big Sis?

391
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,458
Big Sis!

392
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,416
Oh Skuld!

393
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
What are you doing
standing out here all alone?

394
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,916
I may... I may...
have done something

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,958
I probably shouldn't have.

396
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,083
What happened, Big Sis?

397
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,958
Skuld...

398
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,458
Oh, Big Sis...

399
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,000
But why?

400
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,166
Because... you don't
really like me, right?

401
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,208
Maybe we could just be friends.

402
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,833
To think that a mere human
could have realized that.

403
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,791
That's Keiichi for you.

404
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,166
Hmm?

405
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,458
Hello, Urdie.

406
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,625
He'd do anything for Belldandy.

407
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,291
Place a call to the Almighty
in Heaven...

408
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,875
Protect her from the
peskiest of demons...

409
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,083
And go anywhere for her without
fear for his own wellbeing...

410
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,916
That's just the
kind of guy he is.

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
Well, that's too bad.

412
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,250
I have to say I was
really looking forward

413
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,375
to seeing Belldandy's
true feelings.

414
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,250
What? They aren't
obvious to you?

415
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,125
Her true feelings are
actually quite easy to see.

416
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,541
Huh?

417
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,208
Well, let's just say these
true inner feelings are...

418
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,500
Would you...
Belldandy, I... Uhm...

419
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,333
Uh-huh?

420
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:58,416
Would you... Would you like to
go visit the museum with me?

421
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,166
Does that mean
that you wouldn't?

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,708
Sure, I'll go.

423
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,208
Five years from now.

424
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,166
Huh? What?

425
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Hang on...

426
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,791
What the heck am
I doing out here anyway?

427
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,791
Five years? What the heck's
that supposed to mean?

428
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,083
What gives?

429
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,333
Where'd Big Sis go?

430
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,375
She and Keiichi decided
to go out for a while.

431
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,083
Just leave them alone, Skuld.

432
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,541
At least for today, ok?

433
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,083
It's amazing!

434
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,625
I wonder what color
this dinosaur was.

435
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,625
If I remember correctly,

436
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,208
I believe these were
originally brownish grey.

437
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,416
Haha! Is that right?

438
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,333
Huh?

439
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,125
Hey, Belldandy?
Do you like that snow?

440
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,375
Yes.

441
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,416
Then we should really
go visit my hometown.

442
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,416
Maybe sometime next winter.

443
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,625
Are you feeling ok?

444
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,125
You bet.

445
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,125
A long forgotten promise...

446
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,333
But she remembers,

447
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,750
hoping that it might
stil come true some day.

448
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:12,333
Next time, "Ah!
Everyone has a Destiny"

449
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,333
You've waited for me all
this time... haven't you?
