1
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,500
Well, let's go check it out!

2
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,583
Yeah!

3
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,125
Man, we're gonna eat
a whole lotta free food!

4
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,125
This is a pretty high class
end-of-the-year party

5
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,458
we've got ourselves invited to!

6
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,166
It's not a year-end party,
it's a Christmas party!

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,583
Holy cow, Sayoko's
house is enormous!

8
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,958
I'm getting' kinda
nervous going in now.

9
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,291
Oh, it'll be just fine...

10
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,333
After all, the invitation
did specifically say

11
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,208
it was okay for us to
bring guests along.

12
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,291
And besides, Miss Sayoko
is such a wonderful person.

13
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,458
Okay.

14
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,041
So you think we should
head in now, too?

15
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:18,958
Sure!

16
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,458
All right...! Time to eat!

17
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,375
That's Sayoko for ya...

18
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,208
She never said anything about
the party being formal attire.

19
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,625
I am sure she simply intended
the party to be come as you are.

20
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,791
Just what I'd expect of an
international conglomerate!

21
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,250
Hey, Keiichi...

22
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,250
Have you seen Tamiya
and Otaki around lately?

23
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,416
No, I haven't seen
them for awhile...

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,666
Our first target has
now been demolished.

25
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,041
Right...! Time to mount our
assault on the next cuisine!

26
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,375
Wait for me, Den!

27
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,958
Do they really have to be
like that ALL the time?

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,750
Hey! Aren't you gonna
drink that, Keiichi?

29
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,625
Hey, that's mine!
Get your own!

30
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,791
Aah...!

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,833
Ah! Urd, you have
the worst manners!

32
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,375
In fact, your crude
behavior makes it

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,583
embarrassing to be a goddess!

34
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,000
Ugh...

35
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,083
We greatly appreciate
your patience.

36
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,000
Miss Sayoko Mishima will now
be making her grand entrance.

37
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,000
Yep, she's as much of
a show-off as ever...

38
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,291
I would like to extend
a very warm welcome

39
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,041
to the Mishima Group's
annual Christmas party.

40
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,125
This is just a modest
party I'm hosting,

41
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,833
but I hope you all
have a wonderful time.

42
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,166
We have several varieties
of entertainment lined up

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,166
for your amusement
this afternoon.

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,125
So as the organizer
of today's event...

45
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,041
my hope is that you will all
thoroughly enjoy yourselves!

46
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,333
I doubt she actually organized
this whole thing herself.

47
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,208
Hey, why don't go on out there

48
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,791
instead of standing in
the corner like this.

49
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,291
Okay!

50
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,166
Now the real show begins.

51
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, Belldandy?

52
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,208
Huh?

53
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,666
Would you mind coming
up to give me a hand

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,083
entertaining the guests...

55
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,208
It'll help get
our party rolling.

56
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,875
I would be more than happy to.

57
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,125
Just as I thought...

58
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,625
Sayoko's cooking up
some kind of scheme.

59
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,208
If my helping out will allow
everyone to enjoy themselves,

60
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,208
I would be glad to help
out any way that I can.

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,458
Now I have her...

62
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,166
And I've got the
home field advantage.

63
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,041
That's right, everyone here
is already on MY side!

64
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,125
Today, you will taste
the bitter agony of defeat.

65
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,875
Well then, let's begin...

66
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,708
Naturally, they're all
her own relatives but,

67
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,708
I guess I have to give her
credit for going all out

68
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,625
like she has.

69
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:06,625
♪ One day I... woke up,
a brand new day... ♪

70
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,750
Yeah... exactly

71

the deep, blue sky, ♪

76

77

80
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,875
Oh, Big Sis...!

81
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,458
Right, next event!

82
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,708
Voila!

83
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,625
There!

84
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,500
Ooh...! Ah...!

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500
To the next event!

86
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,500
What are you doing getting
all friendly with it?!

87
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,041
Huh?

88
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,166
Why does this keep happening?!

89
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Why, hello there!

90
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,750
Hey, Belldandy.

91
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,875
You put that hand down...

92
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,791
She really is perfect after all.

93
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,666
Hm?

94
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,291
I said Belldandy's perfect...

95
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,333
Now wouldn't you
agree with me, Kei?

96
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,708
She's gorgeous...
has a great figure...

97
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,250
she's a talented singer...

98
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,666
she's sincere, gentle-hearted,
and everyone loves her.

99
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,916
And to think my brother
actually has a woman like that

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,166
all to himself...

101
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,208
You lucky dog!

102
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,625
How'd you manage
that, huh, Kei?!

103
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,333
She's absolutely right.

104
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
I never really
thought about it...

105
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,375
but I really do have
this incredible goddess,

106
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,250
Belldandy, all to myself.

107
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,791
Belldandy?

108
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,375
Yes?

109
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,125
Today's entertainment has been
a big success thanks to you...

110
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,083
So how about you and
I have a little toast?

111
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,208
Sure! I'd be glad to!

112
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,916
No, Belldandy, wait!

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, take it easy, Kei!

114
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,916
Will you please let
go of me, Megumi?!

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,125
Sayoko is definitely
up to something!

116
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
So, you mean you
don't wanna see?

117
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,458
See what?

118
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,000
See what Belldandy's
gonna look like

119
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,708
after she gets a
little liq-uored-up?

120
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,958
WHAA-?!

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh, Keiichi...

122
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,875
Wait, Belldandy!

123
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,166
Please don't do it!
You've gotta stop!

124
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
Cheers!

125
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,000
Ah...! That was very nice.

126
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,708
Then please have some more!

127
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,541
Thanks!

128
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,916
Belldandy, no!

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,166
Gin, rum, vodka, awamori...

130
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,750
I've got it all...

131
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,750
Now drink yourself into oblivion
in front of this whole crowd.

132
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,750
Make a fool of yourself.

133
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,916
Yes, just like you've
done to me so many times.

134
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,166
That one was very nice, too.

135
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,708
Just who the hell IS this girl?!

136
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,333
You little snake!

137
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,041
It's time for my last resort.

138
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,708
Spirytus, the world's
most potent liquor--

139
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,458
one-hundred
ninety-two proof,

140
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,375
ninety-six percent
alcohol by volume!

141
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,250
Even Belldandy will be
no match for this stuff!

142
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,916
Hey, watch where
you're falling, Sayoko!

143
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,458
Whoa! Sayoko, NO!

144
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:54,000
Ugh... I don't feel so good...

145
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,208
Are you all right?
Nothing went wrong at all?

146
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,833
Oh, no... I'm fine,
although I still don't know

147
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,666
too much about this
"liquor" stuff.

148
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,791
Oh, man... she can even
handle her liquor, too...

149
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,541
Here. I got her this
for her hangover.

150
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,166
I thought you guys had
better take it home with you

151
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,833
for in the morning... Bye!

152
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,500
Megumi...

153
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,083
Your little sister
always seems to be

154
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,083
looking out for you, isn't she?

155
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,875
She's just giving
me a hard time.

156
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,416
Well, here ya go...

157
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,833
It's some cola
for your hangover.

158
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,666
Then I thank you very much!

159
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,208
Although...

160
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,458
I guess you won't really need
it since you're not drunk...

161
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,000
No...

162
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,291
I have never tasted this kind
of drink before, besides...

163
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,791
Megumi got it just for me,
so I'm happy to drink it.

164
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,291
Okay, then?

165
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,583
Mm-hm.

166
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,833
But still, you already
drank all that liquor,

167
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,125
so don't push
yourself, all right?

168
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,166
I can't believe she's
never had cola before...

169
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,333
Ah!

170
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,333
Tasty?

171
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,291
Yes, this one is my
favorite of them all!

172
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,625
Yeah...? That's great...

173
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,541
Hey, Keiichi!

174
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,333
Uh, Hasegawa,
how trashed are you?

175
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,791
I am not a middle
school student!

176
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,000
A what?!

177
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
C'mon, I want you to
have a look... at these!

178
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,333
--GAAHHH!
--See, even I have boobs.

179
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,583
I'm just not very
tall, that's all!

180
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,583
I know I still have a
baby face, but check it out:

181
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,166
I DO have boobies...

182
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,833
Not only is she a crying drunk,
but she's all touchy feely...!

183
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,875
Huh? What's wrong?

184
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,875
--I think I get it now.
--Get what?

185
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,666
I think I better
just show you...

186
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,541
AAAAAAHHHH!

187
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,416
Huh...? Belldandy?

188
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,541
You poor thing!

189
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,666
You understand how
I feel, don't you?!

190
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,458
Could she be drunk...?

191
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,250
No way! On COLA?!

192
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,125
Oh, Miss Hasegawa,
you poor dear thing!

193
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,750
Is that how it works
with goddesses?

194
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,666
You really do understand...!

195
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,875
I am utterly miserable!

196
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,208
Aah...!

197
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,958
Let fortune smile on you.

198
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,375
I am so happy for you...
Miss Hasegawa.

199
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,500
Keiichi...! Look at me.

200
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
I've finally become
a real grown-up!

201
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,666
Hasegawa!

202
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,666
That is not what it
means to be a "grown-up!"

203
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,500
Did I just get hit in
the head with a sink?

204
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,125
Morisato!

205
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,625
What do I do now?

206
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,291
I guess Belldandy's cover
is finally gonna be blown!

207
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,666
--Good work, Hasegawa!
--Yeah, nice trick!

208
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,875
But no underclassman's
gonna out-do us!

209
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,000
You got it, Den!

210
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,250
They think it's part
of the entertainment.

211
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,708
I need to get
Belldandy out of here

212
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,958
while I still have a chance!

213
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,791
So what are we gonna do, Den?

214
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,208
Excuse me,

215
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,291
was there a young woman
standing here just a minute ago?

216
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,250
Yeah, there sure was,
but then she handed me

217
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,333
this bag of potato chips
and went outside.

218
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,666
WHAT?!

219
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,166
She did what?!

220
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,708
I've never heard of anyone
getting drunk off cola before,

221
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,083
but then I guess
it does sound like

222
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,041
something she'd do, doesn't it?

223
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,083
Well, in any case, I'm gonna
go try to find her right now!

224
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,416
Hey, Keiichi! Wait for me!

225
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,125
Keiichi!

226
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,750
Dammit...

227
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,583
I feel like I'm in a manga!

228
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,541
Meow, meow...

229
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,916
I see... Is that right?

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,875
Meow...

231
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,875
Oh, yes... Right!

232
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,500
You're very hungry, aren't you?

233
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
Let fortune smile on you.

234
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,000
Mew!

235
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,958
This has Belldandy
written all over it.

236
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,625
Hey! Knock it off, will ya?

237
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,250
I summon lightning!

238
00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:00,000
Now you've done it! Skuld Bomb!

239
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,791
Aaack...! Oh, crap...!

240
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,666
What the heck's going on here?!

241
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,666
At long last I have returned!

242
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,500
The wounds I received
from the Lord of Terror

243
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,500
were worse than I
could've ever expected,

244
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,625
so it took quite
some time to recover.

245
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:31,083
But now I am...
fully rejuvenated!

246
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,291
My disgrace can only be cleansed

247
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,375
when I have defeated
you, Belldandy!

248
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,958
Let fortune smile on you.

249
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,250
Waaaaaahh!

250
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,083
I apologize, Mr. Telephone Pole.

251
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,500
You were stuck standing
there for such a long time...

252
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,916
Please relax and
get some rest now.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,791
Belldandy, it IS you!

254
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,166
Mara, it's you!

255
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,625
Ah, that was your handiwork
just now, wasn't it...?

256
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,250
You sensed my presence and
launched a preemptive attack.

257
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,291
Exactly what I'd expect of a
First Class goddess like you!

258
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,791
However, I will be the
one who wins in the end!

259
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,625
Belldandy... I'll take you down!

260
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,625
Oh, Mara, you poor thing...!

261
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,875
So that is your
wish then, is it?

262
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,250
Don't call me a "poor thing!"

263
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,958
Let fortune smile on you.

264
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,208
Huh...?! What in the hell...
do you think you're doing?!

265
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:25,250
I was simply taken down,
exactly as you had wished.

266
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,750
Your happiness is
to be fulfilled

267
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,666
by my being taken down, correct?

268
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,000
Stop making fun of me!

269
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:37,208
I hate you sooo much Belldandy!

270
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,291
Oh, that Mara...

271
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,083
She was so overcome
with happiness,

272
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,541
it moved her to tears.

273
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,625
Waaah!

274
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,875
Look what you did to
my poor little Shiro!

275
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,041
I'm really sorry!
But I barely pulled on it!

276
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,125
Belldandy! Belldandy!

277
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,458
Don't tell me that
Belldandy's going around

278
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:07,500
spreading "happiness"
all over the place!

279
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,875
Eh...?!

280
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,250
Why on earth do
I keep having such

281
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,083
unbelievably
rotten luck today?

282
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,083
Huh?

283
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,125
Let fortune smile on you.

284
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,041
No, stop! Belldandy!

285
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,833
--What happened?!
--Hey, Mister...!

286
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,666
Huh?

287
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,208
Belldandy!

288
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,250
Mr. Keiichi, you poor thing!

289
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,791
Are you sure you're
felling all right?

290
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,583
I want to take away
your pain, Mr. Keiichi.

291
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,708
Here! It's the magician lady.

292
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,583
--She wants to talk to you.
--Magician lady?

293
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,500
So how's it going where you are?

294
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,916
Urd?

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,375
Well, it looks like you
managed to find her.

296
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,791
What's that...?

297
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
Belldandy is spreading
happiness all over the place?

298
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,625
Cut it out!

299
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,166
It's all right. No major
damage has been done yet.

300
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,541
The Law of Conservation
of Happiness dictates that

301
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,541
you will suffer misfortune
inversely proportional

302
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,208
to the good
fortune she bestows.

303
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,583
I get it now...

304
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,083
So that's why all those
things happened to me!

305
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,375
Essentially, a goddess's
job is to impart happiness.

306
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,666
Ahh! I'm, uh, pretty busy here,

307
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,333
so I'll leave Belldandy
in your hands! Ciao!

308
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,166
Wait, Urd, don't hang up!

309
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,791
OW...! Why's a stuffed
bear biting me?!

310
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,125
Please let go, Shiro!

311
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,458
Belldandy!

312
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,958
Ah... I can hear them...

313
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,166
I can hear the sorrowful
sighs of the people.

314
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,708
I must do something. I have to!

315
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,875
My heart yearns
for a soul mate...

316
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,625
I hear them...

317
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,916
This steep hill sure
is hard on me ...

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,125
I hear them.

319
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,750
Grr...!

320
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,375
I hear them!

321
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,666
Let fortune smile... on you all!

322
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,875
A plate of... sole...

323
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,875
So, I just got a... sole plate?

324
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,125
Now this is the life!

325
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:14,791
Woof, woof!

326
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,708
Huh? Ah?!

327
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,541
This sure is a heck of a
way to be granting wishes...

328
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,166
It looks like the
only question now

329
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,208
is whether I'll physically
be able to hold on

330
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,541
long enough to find
Belldandy... Although...

331
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,958
Oh, it's the dentures
I flushed down the toilet!

332
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,125
My VHS player works!

333
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,041
I can walk! It's a miracle!

334
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,708
Yeah... if I follow this trail,
I should be able to find her.

335
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,416
I can still hear
them out there...

336
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,833
I need to impart
even more happiness!

337
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,250
Belldandy!

338
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
Huh...?

339
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,500
Getting out for some fresh air
was definitely the right move...

340
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
It would certainly seem
that the goddess of fate

341
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,916
has not decided to
abandon me after all...

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,083
Oh, no...

343
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,083
I believe you are
confused, Mr. Aoshima.

344
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,416
I am not the goddess of fate.

345
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,666
I disagree! As far
as I am concerned,

346
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,833
you are the Goddess
of Fate, Herself!

347
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,041
I ask you now to grant
me your good fortune!

348
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,583
Huh? Did you say good fortune?

349
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,083
I certainly did!

350
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,958
Why would a respectable
person like myself

351
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,416
be treated in such a fashion?

352
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,958
I mean, can't you see that
my heart is in tatters?!

353
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, you poor thing!

354
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,833
Do you really mean that?

355
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,458
Of course...!

356
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,708
But isn't there anything I could
do that would ease your pain?

357
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,000
Jackpot!

358
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,083
Finally...!

359
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,000
How I've waited
to hear those words!

360
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,208
How I've waited for this moment,

361
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,416
when you become mine
in mind, body and soul!

362
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,458
Belldandy...!
I want to have YOU!

363
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,500
HUH?!

364
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,291
Essentially, a goddess's
job is to impart happiness.

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,458
C'mere, you!

366
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,916
That is the one thing
I cannot do for you.

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,708
Huh?

368
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,375
Huh?

369
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,916
What are you talking about?!
You said you'd do ANYTHING!

370
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,458
Mm... You see...

371
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,833
Since I have already made
a promise to Mr. Keiichi...

372
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,458
Ah...

373
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,750
Not Keiichi again!

374
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,125
So everything you just
said to me was all a lie!

375
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,250
Oh, no...

376
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,875
Truly, it is my wish
to bring happiness

377
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,916
to all creatures here on Earth.

378
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,208
Then why won't you
be mine, Belldandy...?

379
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,958
Can't you see I am in
the very pit of despair?!

380
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:39,333
Well, Mr. Aoshima, it is because
I have an even bigger wish...

381
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,000
My wish is to always be
together with Mr. Keiichi.

382
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,625
And, most importantly, that
wish is one which we both share.

383
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,041
That wish is the greatest and
most important wish of all.

384
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,833
I will never betray this wish,

385
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,833
no matter what anyone
else may ask of me.

386
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,958
But any wish other than that

387
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,958
would be perfectly
fine, all right?

388
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,625
Don't give me that!

389
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,166
You think I'm gonna go
along with that crap...?!

390
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,000
You're gonna take responsibility
for what you said!

391
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,333
--Oh, Mr. Keiichi!
--I had good fortune there,

392
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,208
and then bad fortune
there and then...

393
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,458
I had good fortune there,
then more misfortune--

394
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,375
What the hell are you doing?!

395
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,375
Uh-huh... That means I
still have one round left!

396
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,125
C'mon!

397
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Waaaaahh!

398
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,916
But why...?!

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,125
Because I've realized something.

400
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,708
Life's not perfect.

401
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:36,250
If it were, we wouldn't have
to run away from anything.

402
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,375
But at least we're holding
hands while we're running.

403
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,875
I'm afraid if I let go...
she'll vanish...

404
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:49,375
Even though I know all wishes
may not necessarily come true...

405
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,500
Someday...
I'll take this hand and...

406
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I think we should
be all right now.

407
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,875
Mr. Keiichi?

408
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,083
Huh?

409
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,041
I would like you to
tell me if you have been

410
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:14,041
suffering any misfortune today.

411
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,583
No, not at all...

412
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,916
Well, not any more than usual.

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,041
But the real misfortune
is that sooner or later

414
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,166
I'll have to let go
of this hand of yours.

415
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,583
Let fortune smile on you.

416
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,833
Oh...!

417
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,083
Uh, Belldandy!
Hey, Belldandy?!

418
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,958
I guess it's no surprise,

419
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,791
considering how much
of her power she's used.

420
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,500
There we go...

421
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:57,875
Ahh!

422
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,291
Huh...? What'd you say...?

423
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,375
You can't let go of her hand?

424
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,458
Well, all things considered,
that's no big deal.

425
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,625
Check it out!
I'm a grown-up!

426
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,500
Hey look, you guys.
I'm a grown-up!

427
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,416
No way! Tomorrow morning?! Uh?!

428
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,250
Tomorrow morning, huh...

429
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,791
Well, I guess
that'll be all right.

430
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,333
Their fated meeting
came suddenly.

431
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,083
And it was only an instant
before they had fallen in love.

432
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,041
But there is one who aims
to come between them...

433
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,291
Next time, "Ah!
Well-Matched Vibes of Love."

434
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,958
What?! Is that what she's into?!
