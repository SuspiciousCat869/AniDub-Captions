1
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,041
Welcome! And how can I help you?

2
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,666
Would you like me to warm up
this boxed lunch for you?

3
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,875
Uh yeah, sure. That'd be great.

4
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,958
And I'd like a sweet
roll, too, please.

5
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,625
I'm terribly sorry...

6
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,875
but they're still in the
oven and not ready yet.

7
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,083
But, if you'd like one of
our new soy flour rolls,

8
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,083
we've got plenty!

9
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,458
All right, I'll
try one of those.

10
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,708
Oh, great! Let me get you one!

11
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,625
Delivery!

12
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,875
Hey, good to see you!

13
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,916
I can't believe how many
magazines come out on Mondays...

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,541
It's a pain because
I gotta restock

15
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,958
all the boxed lunches then too!

16
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,416
Then I got a guy who orders a
sweet roll at a time like this.

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,291
What the hell is
he thinking anyway?

18
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,625
Oh, well, no point
grumbling about it...

19
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,125
This is after all just
a necessity for survival.

20
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,291
--Um, excuse me...
--Huh?

21
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,708
Is... my boxed lunch ready yet?

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,500
And if it isn't too
much trouble, Miss,

23
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm still waiting for
that soy flour roll, too...

24
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,500
--Aaack!
--Aaaahh!

25
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,250
Hey! You forgot to sign this!

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,541
You need you to sign
the receipt, Mara!

27
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,833
What a bunch of IDIOTS!

28
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,791
I am the Lady Mara, Demon
First Class, Unlimited License!

29
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,500
Why's the Office of Demonic
Affair's Number One employee...

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,083
doing menial labor at a stupid
convenience store...?!

31
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,416
Whilst only making
ten bucks an hour?!

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,375
And why is there a
twenty percent increase

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,458
for working the midnight
to six A.M. shift?!

34
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,875
Well, that is a whole dollar
and seventy cent increase

35
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,000
from the eight-fifty
an hour you started at.

36
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,458
Well, that's true. But you see,

37
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,333
the owner of the store told
me that I've been showing

38
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,041
a lot of potential
for advancement.

39
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,458
Could we expect any less from

40
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,166
the Office of Demonic Affair's
Number One employee?!

41
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,875
Aw, you flatter me.

42
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,083
Hey, and get this:
the owner said that

43
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,333
he could probably even let me
handle managing the place!

44
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:36,333
Congratulations on your
promotion to manager! Yay!

45
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,916
Hurray!

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,875
And please keep on bringing us
these delicious boxed lunches!

47
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,666
You just leave it to me...!

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,250
Hey! Hold on!

49
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,250
I was asking you how I ended up
like this in the first place!

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,500
Well, forgive me for saying
so, but it's because

51
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,250
you screwed up so many of
your missions, remember?

52
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,666
What did you say?!

53
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,333
...because our lousy
research and development!

54
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,916
That's exactly right!

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
And since you've learned
from your mistakes,

56
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,625
I want you to get to work
on your next invention!

57
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,333
With all due respect,
Lady Mara...

58
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,583
that's going to be
quite difficult

59
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,083
with the equipment we have here.

60
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,750
I think it may be best if
we return to the demon realm.

61
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,083
You imbecile...!

62
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,750
If I were to go back now,
I'd be a laughing stock!

63
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,750
And besides, the ruler of
demonkind wouldn't tolerate it!

64
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,958
Mm... You must mean
Lady Hild. Am I right?

65
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,708
Don't say that name out loud!

66
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,250
Just hearing it gives
me the total creeps!

67
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,458
Oh, man! Is she ever
scary or what?!

68
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,041
Enjoying the part-time job?

69
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,833
Oh, you bet! I'm totally
set from now on!

70
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,166
With hard work and dedication,

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,708
I could become the
manager in no time.

72
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,666
I'd just love to have
one of those boxed lunches

73
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,166
that you've heated
up for me, Mara!

74
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,791
LA... LADY HILD?!

75
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,750
Please accept my
humblest apologies!

76
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,833
This convenience store boxed
lunch isn't all that bad really.

77
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,666
I can't really say I'm all that
surprised you didn't notice me,

78
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
even though I've been
sitting right next to you

79
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,541
this whole time.

80
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,916
But, M'lady...

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,250
Oh, what's this...?

82
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,458
You see, I split off one
thousandth of myself

83
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,000
just before I went back.

84
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
Since I do have things I still
needed to take care of here.

85
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,541
Oh, well, that certainly
is interesting.

86
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,291
So, how's the expansion of
our shares coming along, Mara?

87
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,958
I sincerely hope you're
not going to tell me

88
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:14,458
you haven't made any
progress, now are you?

89
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:19,083
Um, well... Uh...

90
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,375
Are you sure it's all right

91
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,583
to let those goddesses
do whatever they please?

92
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,416
No, ma'am! Of course not!

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,666
First Class Demon,
Unlimited License, Mara...

94
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,791
I'd say I know your power better
than anyone, don't you agree?

95
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,208
Oh, yes, Lady Hild!

96
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,791
So if you really put
your mind to it,

97
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,958
you could beat those
goddesses, couldn't you?

98
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,541
Why yes, of course
I could, Lady Hild!

99
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,083
Then I believe it's about time

100
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,041
you showed those high
and mighty goddesses

101
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,125
why they should
fear you... Right?

102
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,791
YES, MA'AM!

103
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,416
I'm on it. I'll go
do it right now!

104
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,583
--Belldandy?
--Hm?

105
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,083
Have you seen my blue
jacket around anywhere?

106
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,666
Oh, yes.

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,833
I believe I washed it
for you yesterday.

108
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,416
Just a minute...
I'll go get it for you.

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
Oh, it's all right.
Don't worry about it.

110
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,125
I can just go get it myself!

111
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,625
--Darn right!
--Huh?

112
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,500
If you think you can make
Big Sis go fetch YOUR laundry...

113
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,666
So you plan to attack
them head-on... eh?

114
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,666
Right! When you really
think about it,

115
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,416
I am one of the
most feared demons

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,916
in all of the demon realm.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,291
When I get serious,
a mere goddess or two

118
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,291
won't stand a chance
of getting in my way.

119
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,416
Don't worry! Just leave
everything to me, Lady Hild!

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,666
Oh...? Well, whatever you say.
I'll just leave it to you then.

121
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,166
Hm! Just you watch,
you stinkin' goddesses.

122
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,708
Let's go, Octopus, Senbei!

123
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,291
Chu-chu!

124
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,625
You called, Milady.
And voila! Here I am.

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,708
SHAKKIN!

126
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,625
Let's do it!

127
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,750
Leave it all to Senbei, Milady.

128
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,291
You have nothing to fear!
And now it's showtime!

129
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,041
Huh...?!

130
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,000
Huh?!

131
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,500
It's been a while, so I totally
forgot about that thing...

132
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,583
Well, I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let a little thing

133
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,666
like that slow down
my rise to glory!

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,875
I say, this Japanese
wasabi is just sublime!

135
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,583
My word! What on earth
is this bizarre thing?!

136
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,208
Oh, no! My octopus!

137
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,541
Blimey, it's an OCTOPUS!
The so-called "devil fish"!

138
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,416
Hey! Give it back, you guys!
That octopus belongs to me!

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,291
--Oh, my God!
--Huh?

140
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,666
Surely its owner is the
incarnation of Death herself!

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,041
--C'mon!
--Let's jam, Pete!

142
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, Roger! You got it!

143
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:47,083
Oh, my... what beautiful music!

144
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,291
What'd they have to
do that for? Damn it!

145
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,708
If this is how it's gonna be,

146
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,500
then I guess Senbei's all
I've got left to rely on!

147
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,125
Senbei!

148
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,083
Shakkin!

149
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,083
Just leave everything
to me, my dear Mara,

150
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,625
and I'll make it look as easy
as taking candy from a baby!

151
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,666
I'm counting on you, Senbei!
Our target is right there.

152
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:14,208
Have no fear! She's no match
for my powers of bad luck...!

153
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,541
--Shakkin!
--OW!

154
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,750
Oh dear, dear, dear!
That's my bad!

155
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,916
You idiot! I told you,
she's the target, not me!

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,708
I am fully aware
of that, Milady!

157
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,833
Just a case of bad timing...

158
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,500
Ah - Shakkin!

159
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,458
Ahh!

160
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,583
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

161
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,583
You see, I have a chronic
case of hayfever...

162
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,541
What the hell are
you talking about?!

163
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,958
It's just a common
pollen-induced allergy.

164
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,750
You gotta tell me about
these things first!

165
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,083
Shakkin! Shakkin! Shakkin!

166
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,125
You had me worried there.

167
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,208
What is with you? Those
sneezes are totally faked!

168
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,791
When people sneeze, they
go "Ah-choo". "AH-CHOO!"

169
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,708
Why the hell do you
even say "shakkin"?!

170
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,291
That's the Japanese
word for "debt."

171
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,708
Do you have a demonic bank loan?

172
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,750
Were you affected by
the economic collapse?!

173
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,708
And why do you talk like
those funny rocker guys?!

174
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,875
I'll bet you're in cahoots
with them, aren't you?

175
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,291
Huh... I-I forgot about him.

176
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,000
YAAAAAH!

177
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,458
Oh, dear...

178
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,833
Banpei certainly seems to
have a lot of energy today!

179
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,291
I guess Mara really is
hopeless, isn't she...?

180
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,875
She's certainly not
gonna get anywhere

181
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,250
if she keeps up like this.

182
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,750
Guess I have no choice.

183
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,750
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

184
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,375
The situation seems to be
going from bad to worse.

185
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,666
Now what do I do?

186
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,666
Huh?

187
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
Hey! This is the
Heretical Pot...!

188
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,750
What the heck is
it doing out here?

189
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,875
Well, who cares
how it got here...

190
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,125
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for!

191
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,375
I gotta strike while
the iron's hot!

192
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,708
--All right, I'm heading out.
--Huh?

193
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,916
What time do you think
you'll you be back?

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,583
Oh, I really don't think
I'll be out that late...

195
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,416
Hyaah!

196
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,583
Mara?!

197
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,208
Say your prayers,
Belldandy! Take THIS!

198
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,708
Ah...! Keiichi!

199
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,958
--Are you all right?
--You fool! 

200
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,500
That was exactly what
I expected you would do!

201
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,375
Huh?

202
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,791
Ah!

203
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm gonna split your
personality in two!

204
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,250
Just like I did
with your sister Urd!

205
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,291
Okay... Let's just see
where this gets her...

206
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Belldandy!

207
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,041
Well, it seems as though
nothing has happened.

208
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,083
What?

209
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,916
WHAT THE HELL WENT WRONG?!

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,916
That is the Heretical Pot.
I'm sure of it!

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,541
There's no way you
shouldn't have been split!

212
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,541
What the heck's going on here?!

213
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,000
--You're so dense.
--Huh?

214
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,625
The Heretical Pot worked on me

215
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,666
because I'm half-goddess,
half-demon,

216
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,500
but there's no point using it
on someone like Belldandy.

217
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,583
Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?

218
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,708
Cause she doesn't even have a
split personality to begin with.

219
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,083
AAAAAAHHHH!

220
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,500
Aw... too bad for poor Mara.

221
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,833
Hey, listen...

222
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,625
I've been meaning to tell
you this for a while...

223
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,083
but you have
absolutely NO talent.

224
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,875
As a demon, you simply
have no talent whatsoever.

225
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,125
Surely, you must
realize that deep down.

226
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,791
Why don't you just give up and
go back to the demon realm?

227
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,958
You know, there's a line when
it comes to being offensive,

228
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,375
and you just crossed it!

229
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,666
You might not know by looking,

230
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,166
but I'm a Demon First Class,
Unlimited License.

231
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,500
I have exceptional skills,
my subordinates admire me,

232
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,708
and I'm gonna be manager at the
convenience store in no time!

233
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,958
I make over ten dollars an hour!

234
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,958
So telling me that I've got
no talent is just plain...

235
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,458
It's so very... just so very...

236
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,166
C'mon now, don't cry.

237
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,958
Oh, Mara! Well it certainly
sounds like things are going

238
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,458
very well with the
part-time job I got you.

239
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:37,375
Yeah. Thanks, Belldandy,
you were a real lifesaver!

240
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,708
We should have a celebration

241
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,333
in honor of your
promotion to manager.

242
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,458
Huh?

243
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,958
We'll have a nice
big hot pot tonight,

244
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,291
and it'll be tastier
if we all eat together.

245
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,416
Oh, Belldandy!

246
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,500
Belldandy may not have more
than one personality to split,

247
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,791
but I suspect that every goddess
has a hint or two of evil

248
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,333
somewhere deep down
inside of them.

249
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,833
Oh, well. I'm just glad I
decided to put her to the test.

250
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,625
Since she is the one goddess
that resembles him most of all.

251
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,791
This could prove to
be very entertaining...

252
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,791
So you see, there's
no need to cry.

253
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,125
We'll all enjoy a wonderful
celebration tonight.

254
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,500
Wow, I am STUFFED!

255
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,500
That Belldandy
is something else!

256
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,000
She sure can cook like
a First Class Goddess!

257
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,208
And it's a nice change from
eating those boxed lunches

258
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,916
all the time!

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,333
Man, those goddesses really are
a nicer bunch than I thought.

260
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,458
Tellin' me I can come back
over again whenever I like!

261
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,041
Welcome back!

262
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,208
La... La... Lady Hild! What are
you doing to my subordinates?

263
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,750
It's unfair for you
to be the only one

264
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,958
to have a hot pot tonight.

265
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,833
--So I'm making my own.
--NOOOOO!

266
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,291
I beg your forgiveness!

267
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
I'll never fail you
like this again!

268
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
Now don't get yourself
all worked up.

269
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,208
If you're as satisfied as you
seem, then I should be, too.

270
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,500
No, of course I'm not
satisfied, Milady!

271
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,791
But I thought you said you're
quite full at the moment?

272
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,416
Uh, well I, um...

273
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,833
Well, unfortunately,
I happen to be starving!

274
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,875
Lady Hild! Please give
me another chance!

275
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,041
I have a secret weapon that
I've been saving until now

276
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,000
and I humbly request your
permission to use it!

277
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,083
Oh, really?

278
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,958
Yes, really!
Look for yourself!

279
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,250
I've got it right here!

280
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,333
This is the ultimate
anti-goddess weapon:

281
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,208
the Devilish Divinity Vacuum!

282
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,833
Those goddesses are
the biggest threat to us

283
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,833
increasing our share, and with
this we can seal them all away!

284
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,208
All right. Try it out.

285
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,041
Huh?

286
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,833
I said give it a try.

287
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,916
AH... YES MA'AM!

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,541
Hm...

289
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,291
Just do it already!

290
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,750
Oh my!

291
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,541
Please, Lady Hild, get me out!

292
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,083
And just how might I do that?

293
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,916
Pour hot water over the lamp,
and rub it three times!

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
Not BOILING water!

295
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,458
Aw... fine.

296
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,708
Unfortunately, Mara,

297
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,083
there's one glaring flaw
in this plan of yours.

298
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,750
What...?! But you saw
that it sucked me in!

299
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,625
And who do you think is
going to put their lips

300
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,541
--to something like this?
--Huh?!

301
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,333
Oh, very well... If I must...

302
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
I guess I'll just have
to give you an idea.

303
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,708
You mean it, Lady Hild?!

304
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,750
One catch.

305
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,125
Yes?!

306
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,541
Get me some oden stew from
your convenience store.

307
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,458
I've wanted to try it for a
while now, Store Manager.

308
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,916
Aw, shucks!

309
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,875
--Don't laugh.
--Yes, ma'am.

310
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,583
Gimme a six...! Come on,
just gimme a six already!

311
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,041
Oh, boy... I don't know
what you're talking about.

312
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,250
Now hurry up and
play your next card.

313
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,625
Pass...

314
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,583
You can only pass
three times, remember?

315
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,833
I hate you, Urd!

316
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:48,875
Wait, Skuld!

317
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,958
She can be so
immature sometimes.

318
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,458
It's probably good we stopped.

319
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,833
I have some shopping that
I've been meaning to do today.

320
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,291
Can you get me the latest
issue of TV Afternoon?

321
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,541
All right!

322
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,875
Urd is such a big dummy!

323
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,958
I just don't believe this!
I'll never forgive her!

324
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,333
As long as she's around,

325
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,250
I won't be able to find
a moment's happiness

326
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,708
as long as I live!

327
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,375
This is all just
so unfair...! Huh?

328
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,083
Wow! It's SO cute!

329
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,500
I'll bet that Big Sis went
out and got this for me

330
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,958
to cheer me up and
make me feel better.

331
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,333
Oh, thank you so much, Big Sis.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,916
Okay, I'm heading out.

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,625
See ya later.

334
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,583
Hey, Skuld...
Sorry about earlier.

335
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,916
I promise that next time
we'll play Monopoly,

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,541
since you're so
good at that game.

337
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,500
So come on out, okay? Huh?!

338
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,458
No way! She's just a character.
She couldn't really exist.

339
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,500
I... I mean... Ah...

340
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,875
It can't be,
there's no way!

341
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,458
It must be some
kind of a trap...!

342
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,875
Get a hold of yourself, Urd!

343
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,375
No doubt this is Mara's doing!

344
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,541
Or if not, then maybe
she is behind this!

345
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,125
Aww...

346
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,250
No, I mustn't.
I mustn't...

347
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,166
Your plan is working
perfectly, Lady Hild!

348
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,250
What can I say...?

349
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,791
People just can't
help themselves

350
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,625
when they're faced with the
thing that they happen to find

351
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,666
the most cute.

352
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,958
But I never would've expected

353
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,833
Urd of all people
to fall for it!

354
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,166
You just don't get it
at all, do you, Mara?

355
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,333
Huh?

356
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,708
Love may in fact be
the greatest weapon,

357
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,541
but then it can also be
one's greatest weakness...

358
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,291
Especially if that
love runs quite deep.

359
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,500
--'Scuse the interruption!
--Huh?

360
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,208
You here, Morisato?

361
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,583
Well, we're comin' in anyway...

362
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,875
AH!

363
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,500
This... this is...

364
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,375
...an ever elusive
Messerschmitt engine?

365
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Morisato has some
nerve hiding...

366
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,500
Damn. Not the catch
we were looking for.

367
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,333
Patience, Mara. All in due time.

368
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:12,916
Uh, hello? Skuld, are you home?

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,333
Uh...!

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,375
I don't know... This is
starting to feel really wrong.

371
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,875
Look, it comes
with the territory.

372
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,708
You're supposed to
be a demon, remember?

373
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,250
--Hello!
--Huh?!

374
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,250
Hey, Kei! Are you
around or what?

375
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,625
Hey, what's this...?! Ah!

376
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,041
What a cute little boy!

377
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,625
What a cute scooter!
What a cute little kitty!

378
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,916
Damn it! What the hell is
talking Belldandy so long

379
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,375
to get back anyway?!

380
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,041
Well, she's certainly
been quite lucky so far.

381
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,250
Getting back so late
today of all days...

382
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,541
But then...

383
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,125
I'm back!

384
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,541
Man, I sure am hungry!
Hey, Belldandy...?

385
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,583
Huh?!

386
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,416
Chihiro, is that you?

387
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,291
Huh? Oh... don't
interrupt us right now.

388
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,500
B-But, Chihiro, wait! That's...

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,125
Mm... Ah!

390
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,458
She... disappeared!

391
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,583
Ah!

392
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,666
This is too weird. Belldandy
would never act like this.

393
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,000
And besides, what just
happened to Chihiro?

394
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,958
What did Chihiro
do to Belldandy?

395
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,583
And what the heck...
am I... doing?

396
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
I can't... do this.

397
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,541
Will you just kiss her and
get it over with already?

398
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,541
This guy is getting
on my nerves...

399
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,500
Well, if that's how
he's gonna be...!

400
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,583
It's no use, I can't
resist her! But... But!

401
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,500
But I...!

402
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,916
Get on with it already!

403
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,750
I don't think I've ever seen
such a wishy-washy,

404
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,125
indecisive little worm!

405
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,833
But, Lady Hild,
doesn't what we did

406
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,541
count as blatant use of force?

407
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,708
Mara, do you happen to know
what we say in times like this?

408
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,625
Yes! The ends justify the means!

409
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,916
Right!

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,166
I'm home everyone!

411
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,208
Uh!

412
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,791
Quick! Hide!

413
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,666
Urd? I brought you that issue
of TV Afternoon that you wanted.

414
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,000
Urd?

415
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,250
What's this?

416
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,250
Ah!

417
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,666
Ah...! Yes!

418
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,875
Ah...

419
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,083
It's so cute!

420
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,666
Here we go, at last!

421
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,208
YES!

422
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,833
What the...

423
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,625
Hey! What gives?!

424
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,125
I'll bet this is
some kind of antique

425
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,416
that Urd must of
bought recently.

426
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,375
But since it looks so dirty...

427
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,458
I think I'll just have to
clean it up for her, won't I?

428
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,000
It seems that it appears as just
an ordinary lamp to Belldandy.

429
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,708
I think the bigger concern here

430
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,000
is what she might try
to do with that thing.

431
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,875
I have a very bad
feeling about this, Mara.

432
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,083
That's hot water.

433
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,375
Yeah, it is...

434
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,750
Huh?!

435
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,750
I'm gonna get you all
cleaned up now, all right?

436
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,208
AAAH!

437
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,708
Aaaah...!

438
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,791
So cute! So cute! So cute!

439
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,958
Belldandy? Ah, yeah.
You're so cute!

440
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,208
Excuse me! But what are
you all doing here?!

441
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,708
What do you think
could've happened, Milady?

442
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,041
I'm guessing we managed to
overload that stupid lamp

443
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,500
with too many people.

444
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,208
What do you mean "overload"?!

445
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,125
Mara, where are you going?

446
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,166
Well, usually when there's
an overload of some sort,

447
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,791
it means that some kind of
explosion is going to follow!

448
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,333
--Mara!
--Yes?!

449
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,375
Why didn't you tell
me that earlier?

450
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,458
Oh, cool breeze,

451
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,875
I bid you to come forth
with your healing winds

452
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,125
and cure this
raging, furious soul!

453
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,583
Stop hitting me with those
nine-hit combos, you idiot!

454
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,166
Don't lie to me, you guys
are enjoying this. I know it!

455
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,750
--AAACK!
--I did it! Go! Get her!

456
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,916
You passed the test,
Belldandy.

457
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,916
It's so cute!

458
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,125
You were able to see
through to its true form

459
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,000
without being deceived.

460
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,875
Your kindness allowed
you to give yourself

461
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,708
so generously to it.

462
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,625
And your heart managed to
remain calm and tranquil

463
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,375
throughout it all.

464
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,000
This looks delicious.
Thanks, Belldandy!

465
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,500
It's always a pleasure
to cook for you.

466
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,666
Hey, Big Sis...

467
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,958
Those are all techniques
for showing love.

468
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,541
Mara might like to come over
tonight, so I made some...

469
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,291
But you know, Belldandy,

470
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,416
love can be the
greatest weapon...

471
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,791
it can, however, also be
the greatest weakness.

472
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,583
You'll understand soon enough.

473
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,208
This is great!
I gotta tell ya,

474
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,625
this is hands-down one of
the best meals I've ever had!

475
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,125
You say that about
everything she cooks!

476
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,875
Hey, that's not
true at all, Skuld!

477
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:30,083
Then give me a detailed
explanation of exactly what...

478
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,708
You're kidding, right?

479
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,083
I've summoned the
ultimate warrior

480
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,083
from the depths of
the demon realm!

481
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,708
Their goal is to
get between these two

482
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,375
and force her to
return to Heaven!

483
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,833
Next time, "Ah! The Love of
a Goddess Saves a Ninja."

484
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,333
Would you give this up already?

485
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,583
Oh boy...
