1
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,500
Ah, a date with
his girlfriend, huh?

2
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,125
Honestly, what's taking so long

3
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,208
for this relationship
to heat up?

4
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,791
Oh, Skuld, it's so sweet
that you like this stuff.

5
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,333
They go to the movies...

6
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,250
and out for a walk
in the park...

7
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,375
and then a love rival
suddenly appears.

8
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,708
Oh... I see.

9
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,625
Well, I guess it's
all for the best...

10
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,916
I've got to get the next one...

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,958
I'm home!

12
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,291
Huh?!

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,250
Ah...! Keiichi's home,
how wonderful!

14
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,166
Welcome home!

15
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,208
Listen...

16
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,750
Yes, dear?

17
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,708
Look, it's fine if you wanna
come greet me when I get home...

18
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,666
but this is a bit too much.

19
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,708
Why...? Is this
not to your liking?

20
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:19,958
Belldandy!

21
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,375
I see you were so hungry

22
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,416
you came running out
to meet us, Peorth...

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,416
I'll go make something
for you right away.

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,291
Belldandy!

25
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,958
You mean you two were together?

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,041
--Yes.
--This is...

27
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,416
You really are a
nuisance, aren't you?

28
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,541
I can see that Keiichi
has finally been able

29
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,625
to warm up to you, Peorth.

30
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,333
Eh... HUH?!

31
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,958
--Why, you...
--You've got the wrong idea!

32
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,458
So, if it's all
right with you...

33
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,000
I think it would
be a wonderful idea

34
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,000
for you to stay here
with us for a little while.

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,166
What?!

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,375
I... guess you're right!

37
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,958
All right, Keiichi...

38
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,083
Eh?!

39
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,291
I want you to give
in to your impulses

40
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,708
and tell me what your wish is.

41
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,500
Ah...! That tickles!
Cut it out...!

42
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,791
You look so happy, Keiichi!

43
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,583
I'm telling you you've
got the wrong idea!

44
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,000
I am fully prepared to remain
right here with you...

45
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,166
for as long as it takes
to hear what your wish is.

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,875
Well... I'd certainly
like to be able to

47
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,125
grant that wish for
you, Peorth, but I'm...

48
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,750
Huh?!

49
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,291
Oh! I can't believe
this is happening!

50
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,166
You're going to grant
MY wish, Keiichi?!

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,375
Huh?!

52
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,333
Wonderful! I can feel
your love, Keiichi!

53
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,958
You completely misunderstood!

54
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,166
I shall tell you...
what my true heartfelt wish is.

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,333
You've got it all wrong!

56
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:35,208
I'd like... to go on
a date with you tomorrow.

57
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,291
A... date?!

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,333
Ah...!

59
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,083
Ah...!

60
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,875
It's ten A.M. now...

61
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,750
I am waiting for him
at the water fountain

62
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,500
by the train station...

63
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:10,791
I have arrived at the appointed
rendezvous thirty minutes early.

64
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,500
I have arranged
everything to perfection.

65
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,166
For my research has proven...

66
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,666
that the way to guarantee
romantic encounters...

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,833
is by making plans for

68
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,541
indisputably
romantic situations!

69
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:26,458
We'll go enjoy a
romantic film...

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,000
So lovely...

71
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,041
Like your glistening tears.

72
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,625
Oh!

73
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,083
We'll drift through a world of
enchantment at the aquarium...

74
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,208
And that fish... is
called a "scribbled toby."

75
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,833
It's amazing...

76
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,666
And then, to a park
to watch the sunset.

77
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,000
Come back here, you!

78
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
Try and catch me!

79
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,625
I've got ya now!

80
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:59,083
And that night, when our
passion reaches its peak...

81
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,458
--Keiichi...
--Peorth...

82
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,625
It's a magnificent plan! And
there's not a single flaw in it!

83
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,958
Sorry! Did I keep you waiting?

84
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,583
He's here and he's
sorry for being late...

85
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,666
And then I... Right!

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,166
That's okay.

87
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,750
HUH?!

88
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,125
Uh... Hey.

89
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,750
Hi!

90
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,541
Wha... What is going on here?!

91
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,875
Well, it's a long story...

92
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,833
I thought that going
on a date was defined as

93
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,125
a man and a woman...
being alone together!

94
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,500
Yeah, well I think this
is more what you'd call

95
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,875
a "group outing."

96
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,416
Uh...

97
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,333
Well, of course
that's what it is!

98
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,291
If we're at all in
the way, we could just--

99
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,041
Yes, you certainly could!

100
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,541
Why don't you just
run on home now

101
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,666
and start getting dinner
ready or something, okay?

102
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,916
I guess that would
be for the best...

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
Actually, I think
it would be more fun

104
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,791
if we all went together!

105
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,416
Well, if you really
think so, Keiichi...

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,666
After all, there's no telling
what would happen to me

107
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,333
if I were left
alone with Peorth.

108
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,708
A "Group outing," he calls it!

109
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,625
What kind of excuse is that?!

110
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,791
Well, I won't let him lay
a finger on my Big Sis!

111
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:13,250
It was a pretty clever idea for
Keiichi to have come up with.

112
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,958
This could get interesting...

113
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,333
It's just no use...

114
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,000
If I get upset now,

115
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,291
all my preparations
will go up in smoke!

116
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,250
Huh?

117
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
Well, now that we've got
everything settled...

118
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,250
What do you think we should do?

119
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,250
Now you just leave that to me!

120
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,541
You see, I have a
meticulously thought out plan.

121
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:41,083
Now this is the correct
way to start off a date!

122
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,208
Oh...!

123
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,125
They're screening
this romantic film.

124
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm sorry...

125
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,583
but I don't think I
have quite enough money

126
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,958
to cover everybody's tickets...

127
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,708
And what exactly were
you planning on doing

128
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,583
on our date today, Keiichi?

129
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,708
I, um...

130
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,875
Excuse me...

131
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,708
Huh?

132
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,416
I received these tickets
from the newspaper people.

133
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,125
So why don't we just use these?

134
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,541
Whoa! Way to save
the day, Belldandy!

135
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,583
So I'll have to watch
out for her after all...

136
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,500
Curse you, Devil King Sauce!

137
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,250
I'm toast, Pastry Man!

138
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,541
It looks like...
I'm going to be eaten alive!

139
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,166
No! Don't be ridiculous,
Jelly Doughnut Girl!

140
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, this is
technically a film...

141
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,750
but it sure is a long way
from being romantic.

142
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,583
Keiichi...? Could we leave now?

143
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,500
Huh...?!

144
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,583
That was pretty
darn good, wasn't it?

145
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,250
It was so exciting!

146
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,708
Pastry Punch!

147
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,375
Bwa-ha-ha!

148
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,083
That old technique won't work
with the Devil King Sauce!

149
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,166
Grr...! Pastry Punch!

150
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,875
This is totally unacceptable...

151
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,916
Aagh! You got me!

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,416
We're going to the aquarium!

153
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,583
--C'mon!
--Hold on!

154
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,583
Looks like we lost them.

155
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,125
Excuse me...

156
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,166
Actually, I also received some
free tickets to the aquarium

157
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,291
from the rice vendor.

158
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,833
Uh...

159
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,916
And what on earth could
possibly be romantic about this?

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,291
It's shell is so hard
and it's body is so soft!

161
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,916
I think it's cute!

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,958
I do not have time
for all these people!

163
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
I have got to ditch them--

164
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,500
Peorth?

165
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,083
Huh?!

166
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,166
Thank you so much for organizing
an afternoon of fun activities

167
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,958
for all of us!

168
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,208
I think it's wonderful

169
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,583
that we're able to get
along so well together!

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,666
Peorth?

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,708
I see all these years haven't
changed you for the better.

172
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,375
Honestly... You're a
silly bothersome fool.

173
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,041
Peorth?

174
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,458
And now Storm of
Roses technique!

175
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,583
Peorth, no!

176
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,708
Whooaa!

177
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,583
Keiichi!

178
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,583
Belldandy!

179
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,458
Keiichi!

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,458
Hey... what the heck
has gotten into you?!

181
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,666
Are you okay?

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,541
What is it?

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,791
--All right... here you go!
--Ah, thanks!

184
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,500
Hey, Keiichi! Get away from her!

185
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,916
What're you doing?!

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,208
Oh, no you don't!

187
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,250
I'M gonna be the one
that sits next to Big Sis!

188
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,416
--Hey, get a grip!
--You're hungry, aren't you?

189
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,833
Move it!

190
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,708
Come on!

191
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,041
You have my thanks, Peorth.

192
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,333
What are you pouting
about over here?

193
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,791
Uh...

194
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,416
Do you really want to be
alone with Keiichi that badly?

195
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,833
Of course I do!

196
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,916
I mean, it is my mission,
in case you've forgotten.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,291
And that's the only reason?

198
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,958
Why... whatever are
you trying to say?

199
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,250
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

200
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,791
Oh, never mind.

201
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,833
I'm saying this direct
approach you're trying

202
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,958
will never work
against Belldandy.

203
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,833
She'd be able to find him in
a crowd of a million people...

204
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,833
or if you took him far away.

205
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,291
She would go to the
ends of the Earth.

206
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,750
Because that's the
way Belldandy is.

207
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,416
Keiichi!

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,708
I know that... all too well.

209
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,958
Mm...

210
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,208
Well... all right then.

211
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,666
If that's how it is,
then I'll change my strategy.

212
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,291
I knew she'd take the bait!

213
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,875
I can't allow her to do
anything out of my sight now,

214
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,458
not when this is just
starting to get interesting.

215
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,208
Pool tickets?

216
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,250
Oh... are those for the
indoor pool that just opened?

217
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,625
That's right, Skuld. Why don't
we all go there together?

218
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:58,125
Oh...! That just sounds
like so much fun!

219
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,583
Just you watch, Belldandy...

220
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,708
That's the spirit.

221
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,875
Come to think of it,
I'm a really lousy swimmer.

222
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,791
What the heck am I
supposed to do now?

223
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,916
Keiichi!

224
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
Keiichi!

225
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,416
You're totally
turned on right now.

226
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,750
Don't worry, that's good!
It's perfectly natural.

227
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,250
Stop ogling at my Big Sis with
that dirty look in your eyes!

228
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,291
Ah...

229
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:04,083
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

230
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:08,458
Even for a goddess, my looks
truly are extraordinary.

231
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,166
Keiichi definitely won't be able
to take his eyes off me now!

232
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,916
Huh?

233
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,291
You dress like that
all the time, Peorth,

234
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,416
so it's really not a big deal.

235
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,083
Yeah, that outfit's nothing new.

236
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:25,000
Fine then. Joke about it
now, while you still can!

237
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,208
Hmph! For I have already
discovered the crucial fact

238
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,291
that Keiichi doesn't
know how to swim.

239
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,625
I'll push Keiichi
into the water...

240
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,416
and then rescue him
just before he drowns.

241
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,166
After that, some mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation will be in order.

242
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,791
And once he's come to...

243
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,583
I'm sorry... I was
mistaken about you, Peorth.

244
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,708
Oh, Keiichi!

245
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,333
Yes, Keiichi...!

246
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,833
I shall soon set you free
from your terrible agony!

247
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,166
I was just wondering...

248
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,416
Are you going to be here
a little while longer?

249
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,458
Uh, well... yeah.

250
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,666
I'm going to buy some
drinks right now...

251
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,500
but would you be interested
in some swimming practice

252
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,833
after that?

253
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,541
Um, no thanks... I really
can't swim very well,

254
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,333
so don't worry about it, okay?

255
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,541
Oh, that isn't what I meant.

256
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,083
Ah!

257
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,541
You see... I really want to go
swimming with you, Keiichi.

258
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,458
You mean that? Sure!

259
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,708
Well, I'll go buy
us some drinks then.

260
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,916
I'll be right here!

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,208
Big Sis! I'm coming with you!

262
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,666
This is my chance!

263
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,333
Belldandy!

264
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,541
Keiichi?

265
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:36,958
Huh?!

266
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,208
Waah!

267
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,875
--Now all I have to do is...
--Keiichi!

268
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,708
Soar high O, Spirits of water!

269
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,166
Hm?

270
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,791
Aaaahhh!

271
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,166
Mm...

272
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,375
Uh?

273
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,041
Mm!

274
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,500
What do you think you're doing?!

275
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,333
I'm so sorry! When I
was rescuing Keiichi,

276
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,666
I accidentally drove the
water spirits out of control,

277
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,666
and I was afraid that the
spirits might have poisoned you

278
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,791
in the process...

279
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,416
I was just trying to extract
some of the water spirits

280
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,125
that were inside you...

281
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm just glad that
you're all right now!

282
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,541
Not again!

283
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,750
Let's do our very
best today, all right?

284
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,583
Belldandy.

285
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,333
I hereby challenge you...
to a Level Three Goddess Duel!

286
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,541
Huh?

287
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,875
Did... she say "A Level
Three Goddess Duel"?

288
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,041
Yes. Long ago, it was a contest
once practiced in Heaven.

289
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,375
However it has fallen into
disuse for quite some time now.

290
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,708
Why are you doing this, Peorth?

291
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,458
If you win, I am
prepared to return

292
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,958
immediately to the
Earth Help Center

293
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,791
knowing my license
will be suspended!

294
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,333
But, Peorth!

295
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,500
However, if I am the
winner of the duel...

296
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,041
you must allow me and Keiichi
to go on a real date,

297
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,708
where only the two
of us are present.

298
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,750
How stupid! There's no way
Big Sis will ever agree

299
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,375
to a dumb wager like that!

300
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,875
Very well then.

301
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,833
Huh?!

302
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,083
I accept.

303
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,416
But Big Sis!

304
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,291
Now, in accordance with
the time-honored rules,

305
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,125
we will begin the first match.

306
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,375
Each of you--
bring out your angels!

307
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,375
And, GO!

308
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,916
HUH?!

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,541
I guess this is why
the first match

310
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,833
has never been all
that popular...

311
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,833
The winner is... Belldandy!

312
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,750
That's my Big Sis!

313
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,833
Match number two!

314
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,250
The Fish-Smacking Game!

315
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,541
No...! I just can't do it!

316
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,375
Boo-yah!

317
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,958
My poor Big Sis...

318
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
The winner is... Peorth!

319
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,541
Well, kids... everything so
far has been a warm-up...

320
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,708
Now it's time for the real
show... The Meteor Strike!

321
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,041
The first one to hit
the target is the winner!

322
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,250
Did I mention that
this round's projectiles

323
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,000
will be actual meteors
hurtling towards the Earth?

324
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,791
Belldandy... I will
emerge victorious.

325
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,166
We shall see...

326
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,500
Wait a minute!
Did she just say "METEORS?!"

327
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,083
Yeah, so what's the big deal?

328
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,750
And begin!

329
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,208
If something like that
really fell on us...

330
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
Um, please excuse me...

331
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,875
Huh?

332
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,833
Peorth, it is you, isn't it?

333
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,958
Belldandy!

334
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,750
So you must be the one
who's going to be helping me

335
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,000
fix the bugs in
the subsystem, right?

336
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,791
I'm honored to be
able to work with you!

337
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,875
And it's an honor
for me as well...

338
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,250
But you should know,
I will not be outdone.

339
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,958
Let's do our very
best today, all right?

340
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,125
It's no use...!

341
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,958
I cannot determine
the bug's location!

342
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,041
It seems the bug has
merged with the virus...

343
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,708
creating a counter-current!

344
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,625
OHH!

345
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,375
Peorth! Peorth!

346
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,125
Peorth! Thank goodness...

347
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,416
The damage isn't all that bad.

348
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,125
But, what about the bugs?

349
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,541
It's all right now.

350
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,291
I was able to dispose of
them... thanks to your help.

351
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,041
Huh?

352
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,125
Thank you again for
your help, Peorth.

353
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,875
It was a total shock.

354
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,541
That I, of all goddesses, not
only allowed a bug to get by me,

355
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,958
but I actually passed out.

356
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,791
Even more shocking
to me, was the fact that

357
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,791
this event was recorded
as a team effort

358
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,083
between the two of us.

359
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,791
Why would she do that?

360
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,791
What made her want to
show me any sympathy?

361
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,916
Uh... Belldandy?

362
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,375
Are you all right?

363
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:51,375
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to
scare you like that, Keiichi.

364
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,708
That's the way Belldandy is.
I tried to tell you.

365
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,583
Well, I simply cannot
stand her arrogant,

366
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,500
hypocritical attitude
for one minute longer!

367
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,916
So you really were holding
a grudge against her.

368
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Huh?

369
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,000
I may not look it, but I happen
to be a system administrator.

370
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Peorth...

371
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:10,958
Huh?!

372
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,333
This is regarding that time

373
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,125
when you two were fixing
bugs in the subsystem, huh?

374
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,833
Isn't there something you want
to say to Belldandy about that?

375
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,375
Something you want to say?

376
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,708
Belldandy...

377
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,375
I don't understand why
you couldn't have just

378
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,875
taken credit for
that task on your own.

379
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,666
You probably meant well by it,
but I did not want your pity--

380
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,666
not then, and not now either!

381
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,750
Ah!

382
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,000
What is it?!

383
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm so glad that's all it is...

384
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,666
because you've made
an unfortunate mistake.

385
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,875
Huh?!

386
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,416
You see,

387
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,666
the reason I was ultimately
able to find the bug back then

388
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,083
is because it
had gotten inside you.

389
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,250
That's why that job
truly was a joint effort

390
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,250
between the two of us!

391
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,208
But... That's so...

392
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,333
Silly. Yes, get it now...?

393
00:20:55,416 --> 00:21:00,083
It means your petty, long-held
resentment was unjustified.

394
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,750
Oh, man! What a lame
reason to hold a grudge!

395
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,125
Oh, Peorth...

396
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,708
Belldandy...

397
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,333
this whole thing could end up
being a lot of trouble for us.

398
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,958
Oh, it's all right!
Don't worry.

399
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,500
Skuld will take
care of this mess.

400
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,416
What?!

401
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,958
Oh! Are you okay?

402
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,208
Peorth?

403
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,708
Heh. Looks like she dozed off.

404
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,875
Ah, I see. So that's
what that means...

405
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,875
Please, Skuld! Stop whining,

406
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,416
--and start helping!
--Aw, man!

407
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,541
Good grief, what
a piece of work...

408
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,333
Why don't we just
dump her over there?

409
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,916
We can't do that, Skuld!

410
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,875
Then stop complaining
about how heavy she is!

411
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,166
Oh, be quiet. It just
slipped out, that's all.

412
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,291
One little joke.

413
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,208
Ah, so she really is heavy then!

414
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:51,500
Going for a walk at a seaside
park and watching the sunset...

415
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,875
It's not quite what I
had in mind, though...

416
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,916
Well... at least
one wish came true,

417
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,958
so I guess I'll leave
it at that for now.

418
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,500
Thank you, Belldandy.

419
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,875
Hey Urd, how did you know
about that stuff anyway?

420
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,958
Ah, well, one time
I got into Peorth's files

421
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,625
purely by accident--

422
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,625
Hey! That's a major
violation of the rules!

423
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,666
It's water under the bridge.

424
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,000
Why is it I still remain
here on the surface world?

425
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,625
If you were only here
to grant a wish,

426
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,458
you'd have gone back already.

427
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,833
Next time, "Ah!
I Just Can't Say It."

428
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,833
Hey, Peorth, let me
finish talking, will ya?!
