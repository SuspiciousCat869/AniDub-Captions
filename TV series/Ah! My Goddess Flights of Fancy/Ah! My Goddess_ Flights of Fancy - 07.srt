1
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:44,083
It will... It won't.
It will... It won't.

2
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:51,333
Will... It won't.
It will... It won't.

3
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:55,208
A phone call most
definitely will... come!

4
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,541
But it's taking too long!

5
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,416
I've had it!
I can't take it anymore!

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,750
When?! When am I ever
going to get a phone call?!

7
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,333
How is it possible that I,

8
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,083
the Earth Help Center's
Number One goddess,

9
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,750
with my magnificent skills,
could not have any clients?

10
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,000
And yet...

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,750
This frustration will just make
me all the more enthusiastic

12
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,291
when I do.

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,416
Step right up...!

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,875
For I shall happily grant
your each and every wish!

15
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,875
Ah...

16
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,208
Is it too cold for you
to sit out here...?

17
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,833
Perhaps we should
go back inside?

18
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:53,500
Uh... No, I'm okay, thanks.
Anyhow... Take a look.

19
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,833
Hm...

20
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh!

21
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,958
They turned out so nicely.

22
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,791
I didn't think they'd
make her this happy.

23
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,083
I guess I have you to
thank for this, too, Megumi.

24
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,583
What's with you two?

25
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,666
You've been holding
hands all day.

26
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,625
Oh... Well, it's just that...

27
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,791
Hey, I thought you were busy.

28
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,916
What brings you
over here, Megumi?

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,250
This.

30
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,083
That's what... brought you?

31
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,041
Mm-hm... Actually, I just
bought myself a new one...

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,208
so I thought if I passed
this one along to you, Kei...

33
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,583
I can't afford to buy it.

34
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,833
If I recall, you don't
have a camera, do you, Kei?

35
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,875
So what if I don't have one?

36
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,625
Well, here we are with New
Year's right around the corner,

37
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,583
and you won't have any
pictures of your girlfriend

38
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,166
decked out in her kimono.

39
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,041
I don't think that's something
YOU need to be worrying about!

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,041
Maybe not, but I'm positive
that you'll miss not having

41
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,583
a single memorable picture
of the two of you together!

42
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,583
I'm just saying...

43
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,666
that a camera is a must-have
for a couple in love!

44
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,500
Uh...

45
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,666
So... whaddya say?

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,958
Eh?

47
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,583
Uh...

48
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,333
Right. I'm going to take one!

49
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,125
Jeez... Talk about a little
sister who really "cares"

50
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,666
about her big brother!

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,833
But that three hundred bucks
wasn't so easy to part with...

52
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,625
--Um, Keiichi?
--Hm?

53
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,666
Did you see this?

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,083
Ah! I'll bet Urd
took this picture...

55
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,625
But when did she get
a hold... of the camera?

56
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,708
Pictures are so nice,
aren't they?

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,791
When you sit here
looking at them like this,

58
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,291
it's more than memories...

59
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,208
you can actually feel the
warmth from those times as well.

60
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,458
Well, in any case,

61
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,041
what happened that time
sure was crazy, wasn't it?

62
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,916
Hasegawa did return to normal
size the very next morning,

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,875
but our hands were still stuck
and wouldn't come apart.

64
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,250
Well, at least we were
able to get them separated

65
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,541
the day after that.

66
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,291
Boy, if they hadn't
come apart then,

67
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:03,708
I can't even imagine what
Skuld might have done to me.

68
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm sure the reason our
hands wouldn't separate...

69
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,958
is because I had no
desire to let go of you.

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,875
I really... didn't either...

71
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:19,916
It's funny, isn't it? This is
all it takes to connect us.

72
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,833
The time has finally
come for you to test

73
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,666
the sharpness of my incredible
space-time-cutting chainsaw

74
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,291
affectionately called
"Texas Murder"!

75
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
I... think I get the idea
without the tests.

76
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,791
Oh, did you bring
that to help me out

77
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,166
with the gardening, Skuld?

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,750
Uh, I... don't think that's
what she's getting at...

79
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,041
All right, have you said
your prayers, Keiichi?!

80
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,041
Aaahh!

81
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,583
W-Wait a minute, Skuld!

82
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,500
Give all the excuses
you want in hell!

83
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,625
I think you may be
overdoing it just a bit.

84
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,625
Uh?

85
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,875
Urd!

86
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,416
Aaah! Look what you've
done to Texas Murder!

87
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,833
Honestly...

88
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,333
Poor Texas Murder!

89
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,916
Wow! These turned
out pretty nice.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,416
Well, it's only because
I had a great model.

91
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,250
No, it's because you're
a great photographer!

92
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,583
Aw, gee...

93
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,166
My poor little Murder!

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,041
That's not exactly
what I meant by that.

95
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,625
Hey...! I just realized!

96
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,791
We oughta show these
awesome photos to Megumi!

97
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,708
Lemme see, I think
Megumi's number is...

98
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,000
Ah, hello...? Hey, it's me.

99
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,041
Well, hello there!
Thank you for calling.

100
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,875
You have reached
the Earth Help Center!

101
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,208
Eh?

102
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,500
It's your lucky day!
You have just been approved

103
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,208
to receive personal
assistance from a goddess.

104
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,791
Now, kindly wait one moment

105
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,916
and I shall be there shortly to
discuss your individual needs!

106
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,375
So pleased to meet you!

107
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,500
I am here from...
the Earth Help Center...

108
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,666
Goddess First Class...
Second Category...

109
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,208
Unlimited License.

110
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,916
I am the goddess...
Peorth, at your service!

111
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,916
This can't be happening.
I actually called ANOTHER one?

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's been so long
since my last client,

113
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,083
I can't wait to get started!

114
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,541
I should strike a pose!
Maybe this would be better...

115
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,666
Perhaps I would look even sexier
in this position, like so...

116
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,208
I shall grant you whatever
it is your heart desires!

117
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,583
Come on, just tell me which pose
you think is best here, okay?!

118
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,125
Excuse me...

119
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,208
Have you by any chance come here
so you can grant me a wish?

120
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Oh, yes, yes, yes, YES!
That's correct!

121
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,875
I heard the cries of your heart

122
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,541
and have descended from
Heaven to fulfill your wish!

123
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,375
It's true! I shall
grant the wish

124
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,833
that is harbored deep
within your heart!

125
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,458
As it happens, I'm
pretty much covered

126
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,916
in the goddess
department already...

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,250
Huh?

128
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,083
Hey, Keiichi! If you're
on the phone with Megumi,

129
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,333
then remind her to bring over
the Great Space War video, okay?

130
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,041
Huh?!

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,208
Oh, and by the way...

132
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,000
Urd?!

133
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,291
Peorth?!

134
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,041
What in the name of heaven
are you doing here?!

135
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,750
I might ask the
same question of you!

136
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,916
Hey, Keiichi, would
you please tell Megumi

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,541
I need her to bring back
the galactic soldering iron

138
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,500
I lent her the other...

139
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,333
Huh?

140
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,708
PEORTH?!

141
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,333
Skuld's here, too?!

142
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,958
But-how-could-this-be...?!

143
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,125
Why are there already
TWO goddesses here?

144
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,791
What the hell is going on
in this place, huh?!

145
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
Well... actually...

146
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,208
Oh, Keiichi?

147
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,500
Do you suppose we ought to
make some reprints for Megumi?

148
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,333
Belldandy?!

149
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,541
Ah...! Peorth, it's you!

150
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,625
It's been so long...!
What brings you here like this?

151
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,666
What's the matter?

152
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,291
Would you mind dropping
the act, please?

153
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,916
Or perhaps maybe
you've forgotten

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,375
that your organization and
mine are bitter rivals.

155
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,000
Peorth, please.

156
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,083
It's been so long since
we've seen each other.

157
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,166
Regardless...

158
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,541
I'm only here because
he summoned me.

159
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:34,791
What?! Keiichi called her?
No, it couldn't be!

160
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,708
No, Belldandy, the thing is...

161
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,250
the phone connected me
to Heaven all by itself!

162
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,166
Hm! Now I get it.

163
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,583
Well, no matter.

164
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,583
All else aside, my job is
simply to grant his wish.

165
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,416
All right then...
let's hear your wish!

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,333
I shall grant you just one,
which can be anything you like.

167
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,750
Hm...

168
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,375
--No.
--Oh, come on now! 

169
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,583
I know what you
really want deep down!

170
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,291
Hm...

171
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,875
How about I just ask you
to go back up to heaven?

172
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,000
Secret technique.
Storm... of Roses!

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,291
Waaaahh! Ow! They're prickly!

174
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,208
I'm afraid I cannot tolerate
being made a fool...

175
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,208
And I certainly didn't
come all the way down here

176
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,541
to grant you such
an absurd wish.

177
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,500
This must be awfully
hard on you...

178
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,833
stuck with such an
indecisive client...

179
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,750
Well... At this rate,
I guess you won't be able

180
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,250
to return to Heaven
anytime soon, huh?

181
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,541
Oh, no.

182
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,916
Hm?

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You see, I already have
a contract... with Keiichi.

184
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,333
What did you say?!

185
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,041
Then why haven't you
returned to Heaven?

186
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,791
Surely your contract must've
been fulfilled by now, right?

187
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,958
You see, it's all
because of this

188
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,000
really unreasonable
wish that I made.

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,166
Unreasonable wish?

190
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,500
"I'd like for a goddess like you
to stay by my side forever"?!

191
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,791
You've gotta be kidding!

192
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:04,708
It's too much! It's so
funny I'm tossing flowers!

193
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,958
It's unbelievable!

194
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,833
She's seems to be getting
quite a kick out of this.

195
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,666
She's laughing at you,
Keiichi, if you didn't know.

196
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,166
Would you please shut up...

197
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,125
Hold on.
You can not be serious.

198
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,041
I'm sure that the
contract is registered

199
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,541
in Yggdrasil's system.

200
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,208
Why don't you try
doing a search for it?

201
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:34,250
So, it appears Keiichi's wish
really was registered in there.

202
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,291
The current situation
means it's going to end up

203
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,375
becoming a double contract.

204
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,000
Then that means our
contract is invalid?!

205
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
No, it's not.

206
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,625
As a matter of fact,

207
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,208
there aren't any regulations
regarding double contracts...

208
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,666
Because the odds of anyone
placing two such calls

209
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,958
are absolutely
astronomical to begin with.

210
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,833
Besides... a First Class deity

211
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,791
simply does not return
to Heaven empty-handed...

212
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,166
Not after being summoned
to earth to grant a wish.

213
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,500
But I told you,
I don't HAVE any wishes!

214
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,208
Nonsense. You are
simply not aware

215
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,333
of your own deep
desires at present.

216
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,708
Therefore, I am
not going back now.

217
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,166
Not until you have
told me your real wish.

218
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,708
And what the heck is
that supposed to be...?

219
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,166
Listen, Belldandy...
I don't want you to worry...

220
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,166
I'm sure I'll think up
some reasonable wish

221
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,166
and then she can
return to Heaven.

222
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,166
Oh... I'm not
concerned about that...

223
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
I'm sure it's going to be okay.

224
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,083
My, my...

225
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,875
It would seem that
Fate has led us both

226
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,791
to the same client, Belldandy.

227
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:57,541
But I'm sure I heard it... a
suppressed desire of the flesh.

228
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,791
And I'll do... whatever it
takes to grant... that wish...

229
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,375
This one is no good either...

230
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,250
"Please compile the results
of the experiment."

231
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,250
I guess I can't ask her for
help on that kind of stuff...

232
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,833
"Please turn this radio/cassette
player into a CD player!"

233
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,833
But I don't even have any CDs...

234
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,791
"Please let Rossi win the
Championship again this year!"

235
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,000
But that'd probably
make her angry...

236
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,833
I know...! How about "please
bring back the Betamax format!"

237
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,750
Damn... are these lame wishes

238
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,083
honestly the only ones
that I can come up with?

239
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,458
Keiichi's wish...

240
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,416
I'm making too much of this.

241
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,083
It'll be all right.

242
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,291
Keiichi!

243
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,291
Your dinner's ready!

244
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,708
Uh... I'll be right there!

245
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,083
Ah...

246
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,291
I guess this basically
means that I'm not unhappy

247
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,541
with the way my life
is going right now.

248
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,750
Oh, is that right?

249
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,750
The funny thing is, it doesn't
appear that way to ME at all...

250
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,708
I'm telling you it is that way!

251
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,375
Well, in any case, I'm very
sorry to have kept you waiting.

252
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,583
Please follow me.

253
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,666
Who the heck... is gonna
eat all this stuff?!

254
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,833
I have lovingly prepared
all of this just for you.

255
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,916
I'm sorry. But there's no
way I can eat this, Peorth.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,791
You see, Belldandy's already
got dinner ready for me...

257
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,458
No. You are going to
be eating this meal!

258
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,625
After all...

259
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:08,583
They do... want to be...
eaten by you so very badly!

260
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,458
So... please eat up...

261
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,333
and don't feel like
you need to be timid!

262
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,000
Aaahh!

263
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,791
I am so incredible!

264
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,958
That's the kind of technique

265
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,916
only a First-class
goddess could manage.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,041
What are you doing?

267
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,333
Huh?! Urd?!
What do you want?!

268
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
Can't you see I'm trying to
fulfill the divine obligation

269
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,833
that Belldandy has
apparently shirked!

270
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,708
Well, it looks to me rather like
you were torturing the poor man.

271
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,708
Ah...

272
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,708
Thanks for the meal.
It was delicious...

273
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,375
There! Did you see how
delighted Keiichi was just now?!

274
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,916
Listen.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,958
I don't think what you're doing
is going to have any effect.

276
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,958
Oh? And what do you
mean by that, pray tell?

277
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,333
Have a look.

278
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,666
Ah... Is this picture
supposed to mean something?

279
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,500
It's a nice shot, isn't it?

280
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,541
Are you just showing off
your younger sister or what?

281
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,083
That's not the point!

282
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,541
Belldandy's smile looks really
pure and honest, doesn't it?

283
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,708
Uh...

284
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,416
There aren't many
people who could make

285
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,625
a First-class
goddess that happy.

286
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,583
What does that have to do--

287
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,291
Look.

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,666
See.

289
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,666
--Oh, is that right?
--Uh?!

290
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,958
Nekomi Park sure is
a nice, big place.

291
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,833
I do hope we'll
have good weather.

292
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,666
I'm certain everything
will be just fine

293
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
as long as you're there with me.

294
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,541
You mean, as long
as you are with me!

295
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,958
Thanks again for the meal!

296
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,250
No way... After he ate all
that food just a minute ago?

297
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,541
That's just the kind
of guy that Keiichi is.

298
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,791
No matter how stuffed he is,

299
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,625
if Belldandy has
made food for him,

300
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,083
he can eat however
much is there.

301
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,916
In a way, he's
the ultimate softy.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,791
But then... it's because
Keiichi is like that...

303
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,041
that Belldandy readily
puts so much faith in him.

304
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,583
That's why nothing you do could
possibly make any difference...

305
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,583
as far as their
relationship is concerned...

306
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,416
Well now, I suppose
I'd better go

307
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,875
whip up some indigestion
medicine for Keiichi.

308
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,500
They have faith in each other?
I refuse to believe it!

309
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,791
Belldandy has not
fulfilled her obligation!

310
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,791
That is the only reason I
could have possibly received

311
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,666
a phone call from him!

312
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,708
And so...

313
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,625
By no means will
I ever be defeated

314
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,833
by the likes of Belldandy!

315
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:37,083
I give up... I've gotta
think of a wish quick.

316
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,333
I've gotta get her off my back.

317
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,958
--Oh, Keiichi.
--Huh?

318
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,958
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

319
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,541
Whoa, Belldandy!
What are you doing here?

320
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,500
You sure are being quite
forward today, huh?

321
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,083
If this has anything
to do with Peorth,

322
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,666
I've already thought of my wish!

323
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,791
AAAHH!

324
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,375
I was thinking it
would be really cool

325
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,250
if she could turn this bath into
a hot spring. Pretty cool, huh?

326
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,125
WAAAHHH!

327
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,750
Don't lie to me now, understand?

328
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,458
Surely that isn't what you
REALLY want, now is it?

329
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,833
What the heck are you
doing in my bathroom?!

330
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
Well that should be
perfectly obvious!

331
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,000
I came in here to wash
your back for you.

332
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,583
So please allow me
to provide you with

333
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,500
the impeccable service that
Belldandy could never offer you.

334
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,875
She doesn't provide
"services" like that!

335
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,583
You needn't be so shy, Keiichi.

336
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,000
I shall now give you a lesson

337
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,416
on what a First Class
goddess's techniques are like.

338
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,333
And it'll be up
close and personal.

339
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,666
Waah! Cut it out!

340
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,541
C'mon now! There's nothing
to be embarrassed about!

341
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,125
--Sorry!
--Oh!

342
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,875
I will see to it--
that no matter what--

343
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,958
I will be the one to grant
him that wish... not Belldandy!

344
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,083
It's over... I just
can't think of anything.

345
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,166
But that did feel
kinda nice back there...

346
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,208
If only it had been Belldandy...

347
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,875
Sorry to keep you waiting.

348
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,833
What is it this time?

349
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,208
I shall transform your
dull clothing into something

350
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,916
that's certain to
stir women's hearts

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,875
and drive them absolutely wild!

352
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,666
I'd rather that you didn't.

353
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,666
Here we go!

354
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,000
Ah! A lovely pink
silk nightgown!

355
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,666
Wearing this stunner
tonight is guaranteed

356
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,083
to make Keiichi a
love hunter for sure!

357
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,208
I'm begging you, please
change me back to normal!

358
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,125
Even though it
looks so delicious?

359
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,083
Just put me back
to the way I was!

360
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,625
What the heck does
she mean, "love hunter"?

361
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,708
If Peorth's really going
to be that persistent,

362
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,625
it's only going to make
me afraid of asking her

363
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,708
for any kind of wish at all...

364
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,333
On the other hand, if things
keep going on like this...

365
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,750
it's only going to be
a burden on Belldandy...

366
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,375
Well... time to call it a day.

367
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,083
I've got a bad
feeling about this!

368
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,416
He's a formidable opponent...

369
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,166
to have withstood all
my advances so far...

370
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,375
But... this time
will be different.

371
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,625
I will bring this
to a decisive end.

372
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,125
Come quickly, Keiichi.

373
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,000
I shall indulge you in
my true "customer service."

374
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,083
Now I have... no choice...

375
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,500
I think I'm gonna go take cover.

376
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,625
Belldandy? Belldandy?

377
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,541
Oh, Keiichi...! What are you
doing up at this hour?

378
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,291
Are you having trouble sleeping?

379
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,750
Well, Peorth has completely
taken over my room,

380
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,375
so I can't go in there.

381
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,375
Do you mind if I stay in here
with you for a little while?

382
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,125
Oh, no! Leave it to me.
I'll get her out of there!

383
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,458
No, that's all right.

384
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,416
It looks like she's
already fallen asleep.

385
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,958
I definitely can't let
her see Peorth like THAT.

386
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,916
Well, if she's
already fallen asleep,

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,791
why don't I make
you some black tea?

388
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,375
Thanks.

389
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,250
So have you... decided on the
wish you'd like Peorth to grant?

390
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,250
No... I'm having a pretty
rough time with that...

391
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,750
At first, I thought
maybe I'd have her

392
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,833
make this place
into a mansion...

393
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,583
but then I realized
that I actually like it

394
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,833
just the way it is.

395
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,791
Thinking up wishes
is really tough.

396
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,291
I was wondering if...

397
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,416
you thought the wish
you asked me for...

398
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,583
was really the right
one to ask after all?

399
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,500
Well, what made you ask
that, all of a sudden?

400
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,208
You being here right now...

401
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,083
seems to show that I made
right wish, doesn't it?

402
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,833
It may have seemed
like a joke back then...

403
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:38,541
but at the time it was the only
wish that came into my mind.

404
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:43,458
I really did feel that way.
From the bottom of my heart...

405
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,666
Oh, Keiichi...

406
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,375
So, you see, my wish has
already been granted.

407
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,041
Yes.

408
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,625
It's all right.

409
00:21:54,708 --> 00:22:00,166
'Cause I wouldn't have made...
that wish to anyone... but you.

410
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,750
Thank you, Keiichi.

411
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,541
Peorth...

412
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:27,583
Go on, you can come at
me from any direction!

413
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,125
Hic!

414
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,833
What's taking him
so long anyway?

415
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,166
Each of them has a genuine
desire to grant wishes.

416
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,291
But, in trying to accomplish
this by any means possible,

417
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,875
her feelings begin to waver.

418
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,333
Next time, "Ah!
I Want to be of Use to You".

419
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,333
Please, I'm begging you
to stop going overboard!
