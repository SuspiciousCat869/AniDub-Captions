1
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,625
Oh, no. Those poor flowers...

2
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,541
Oh, that's right...
I can't do it that way...

3
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,291
They should feel
much better now!

4
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,791
We'll both have to try
and do our best together.

5
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,083
I still can't believe
that Belldandy's license

6
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,958
has been suspended.

7
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,541
Oh, poor Big Sis...

8
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,666
I feel so bad for her not being
able to use any of her powers!

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,916
So I guess that means Belldandy
can't fly anymore either?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,291
Well, at least not
until next week.

11
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,750
What? Only a week?

12
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,791
Yeah, can you believe
a whole week...?!

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,750
Even if the Goddess Help Line
decided to reissue her license,

14
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,750
she'd still have to go
all the way back to Heaven

15
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,500
to take a refresher course.

16
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,500
Day after day, she'll be
forced to watch boring videos

17
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,500
then log hours of practice in
the spellcasting simulator.

18
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,833
It's such a pain.

19
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,541
But in your case, didn't
you have to do it for like

20
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,125
fifty years or something?

21
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,041
Yeah, but this is only
her first offense...

22
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,416
So don't worry about it.

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,250
Well... I guess a week
really isn't that long.

24
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,208
And besides, I doubt that she--

25
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,416
Oh! We should probably go soon,
so we're not late to class.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,958
Today is Professor
Kakuta's lecture, isn't it?

27
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,250
Uh... Oh, yeah...

28
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,833
Well, she doesn't seem to be
the least bit down about it.

29
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,625
Poor Big Sis...

30
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,541
Huh?

31
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,500
--Hey, Morisato!
--Hey, Morisato!

32
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,041
Uh... Hey, guys.
Long time, no see.

33
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,750
We have a little
favor to ask of you.

34
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,500
And what might that be?

35
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,500
We've got some stuff
we'd like you to hang onto.

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,833
Uh... stuff?

37
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, how long do you need
me to hang onto it for?

38
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,125
We need to leave it
here for a week.

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,541
Oh, sure... If it's
only a week, no problem.

40
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,583
Hey, everyone...!
He says it's okay!

41
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,916
"Everyone"?

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Aghh...

43
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:47,500
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

44
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,416
--Oh my!
--Thanks for your help!

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,916
The dorm's being remodeled,

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,208
and we were in a pinch for
somewhere to store our stuff.

47
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,750
Yeah, thanks a bunch.

48
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,291
And sorry to trouble you with
this little inconvenience.

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,333
--Nice guy, isn't he?
--You call this little?!

50
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,458
Oh, brother!

51
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,375
Now, look here, Keiichi!

52
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,250
So what do we do
with all this stuff?!

53
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,791
Hey, don't look at me!

54
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,833
It's not like any of you stood
up and said anything either!

55
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,583
Sorry, but Tamiya's
problems are your problems.

56
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,666
And who may I ask decided that?

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I did of course, just now.

58
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,500
You did, huh?
Well that's just great.

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,416
Well... I guess we can just
stick it in the main temple

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,041
if we have to.

61
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,916
Huh?!

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,416
Hey Kei! Sorry to bother you,

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,583
but I just bought a new
refrigerator, washing machine,

64
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,000
and kotatsu table, so...
could you store my old ones

65
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,333
until the garbage
collector comes?

66
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,125
Mm!

67
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,875
Hi there! I just got these two
rare bikes in good condition

68
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,208
for a steal at an auction,

69
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,083
but then realized, I've got
nowhere to put them.

70
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,583
Can I leave them here until
I've cleaned out my garage?

71
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,125
I'll come get them,
along with these boxes,

72
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,541
as soon as I'm done.

73
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,875
Oh!

74
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,958
It seems I've gone and
bought too many clothes...

75
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,958
and now my storage rooms are
full to the point of bursting.

76
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,375
Would you mind
hanging onto these

77
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,875
until we've completed
the new addition?

78
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,041
All right...

79
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,000
Just because they ask,
doesn't mean you have to take

80
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,750
EVERYONE'S stuff, you know!

81
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,750
I know, but...

82
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm sorry, Keiichi.

83
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,416
If I hadn't had my
license suspended,

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,916
I'd be able to shrink
all these things

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,458
so they wouldn't take up
quite so much room...

86
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:19,833
Oh, Big Sis... Don't worry!
Just leave everything to me!

87
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,625
So, do you have
some kind of plan?

88
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,708
First, gather all
the stuff in one place,

89
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,791
and then I'll tell you
the rest of the plan.

90
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,416
Oh. Why do I have a
bad feeling about this?

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Okay, the question before us is:

92
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,541
Why haven't we been able to
straighten this place up?

93
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,500
Because we don't
have enough room?

94
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,750
Correct!

95
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,583
So, therefore...

96
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,166
the solution is simply
to make more space.

97
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
But even the temple building
is almost completely full.

98
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,625
Mr. Morisato! Were you
listening to what I said?

99
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,500
I said that we're going to
need to make more space.

100
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,583
Make-more-space.

101
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,083
What the heck is that?!

102
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,833
It's my Space-doubler.
I'll show you how it works.

103
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,458
Magnification, on.

104
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,375
Then you simply increase the
function area by six times.

105
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,791
Confirm changes... And start!

106
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,208
Gaah!

107
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,291
What did you do, Skuld?!

108
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,791
The room just got a lot bigger!

109
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,583
Because I made more space.

110
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,916
"Made" more space...?
How did you do that?

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,458
I guess you could say I
took out an "advanced loan."

112
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,708
If you think about it...
One hour or two hours from now,

113
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,208
this will still be the
exact same space, right?

114
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,125
So I've effectively increased
the size of the present space

115
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,250
by sliding that
future space into it!

116
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,666
I can't say it totally get it,
but it's pretty amazing.

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,750
Well, in any case, we've got
ourselves some more room now...

118
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,000
All right, time for us
to start straighten up!

119
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,458
Hey!

120
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,458
They ran off. What a surprise.

121
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:12,375
Um, Keiichi... I'll try
and help out the best I can.

122
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,333
Thanks, Belldandy,
I really appreciate it!

123
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,958
Well, I guess I
should be grateful

124
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,291
that at least I've got
somewhere to put all this stuff.

125
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,291
--Keiichi!
--Huh?

126
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,541
So where... should
I put this... thing?

127
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,875
Whoa, careful!
Don't strain yourself!

128
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,583
Ahh!

129
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,875
Belldandy!

130
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,458
My powers... Oh, no! I mustn't!

131
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,541
If I use a spell
during my suspension,

132
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,375
my license will be revoked!

133
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm so sorry, Keiichi.

134
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,916
It's okay.

135
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,583
Eeeh!

136
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,125
Well, then!

137
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,208
I guess I better just go ahead
and move this box over here!

138
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,833
You're amazing, Keiichi.

139
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,375
Huh? Not really...

140
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,125
I think of you as
the amazing one.

141
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh, no... I've become
quite powerless

142
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,333
now that my license
has been suspended

143
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,583
and I can no longer
use any spells.

144
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,958
But even without any powers,
you always manage to be amazing.

145
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,416
Well, let's stop worrying
about who's more amazing

146
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,750
and just focus on
getting this stuff moved.

147
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,125
Ah... All right!

148
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,208
Except... we're already
running out of space again, huh?

149
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,250
Well, how 'bout we just
open up a little more room?

150
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,416
Let's see now...
I think it turns that way.

151
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,416
Is that how it went?

152
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,166
Uh... I think she said...

153
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,458
press the magnification
mode first,

154
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,250
and then the
function area, right?

155
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,375
Uh, which one is it?
Let's see...

156
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,541
Right! I think that
should set it...

157
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,708
What's wrong...? Isn't that it?

158
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,333
"Please select your options"?

159
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,833
I don't remember
anything like that.

160
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,791
Are you sure you're pressing
the correct button, Keiichi?

161
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,666
You see?

162
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,125
Oh yeah! You're right! Okay!

163
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:09,833
So then I just put the value
of the area ratio here...

164
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,416
Okay! Let's see
if this works!

165
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,208
AAHH!

166
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,791
Uh... Ah!

167
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,125
Ah!

168
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,166
So... Let's see if those
two're any further along

169
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,958
than when I last
checked on them.

170
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:28,750
Uh?

171
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,625
Huh...?! The whole room?!

172
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,041
Big Sis!

173
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,375
Hm?!

174
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,583
Waaaahh!

175
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:45,375
Belldandy! Keiichi!

176
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,958
It's no use.

177
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,541
It looks like it's been expanded

178
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,958
into an almost
infinite dimension...

179
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,791
There's no way your
voice can reach them.

180
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,666
"Infinite dimension?"

181
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,083
Uh...

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,250
Where the heck... is the EXIT?!

183
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,541
I never thought that
the Space-doubler

184
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,458
would go out of control.

185
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,375
Hey... can't you just
reset that thing?

186
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,458
Well, yeah, it's
possible, but...

187
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,666
you've gotta press UP, UP, DOWN,
DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT

188
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,458
and then finally
press the "set" button

189
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,500
twice before it will reset!

190
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,083
And can Keiichi do that?

191
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,708
I seriously doubt it.

192
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,083
All right, fine. I'll just
go in and do it myself.

193
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
--That won't work.
--Hm?

194
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,333
How exactly do you plan
to find them in there?

195
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,291
Big Sis is forbidden
from using her powers

196
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
while she's under
suspension. Remember?

197
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,666
And since she can't
use her powers...

198
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,666
we won't be able to
find any energy surges

199
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,541
to trace her by, huh?

200
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,916
If only we at least
knew where she was...

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,291
Well, it's not that we don't
know where they are in there...

202
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,541
Huh?

203
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,708
She's definitely in the
center of this space.

204
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,875
Because the Space-doubler
expands space outwards

205
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,041
from where it is.

206
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,500
Well, that makes things
easy, doesn't it?

207
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,750
Yeah. Assuming we could
find out where the center IS.

208
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,166
Huh?

209
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,666
You see... There's no way
for us to find the center

210
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,791
of this infinite dimension.

211
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,166
You also have to remember that
this is an emulated space.

212
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,541
If you got lost in this,

213
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,916
you'd never be able to find
your way back out again.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then... we might as well

215
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,333
not even know
where they are at all.

216
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,333
Isn't there anything we can do?

217
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,958
It's no use... We don't even
know which way we're going.

218
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,416
I guess there's no point in
walking around aimlessly then.

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,916
I guess not...

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,083
Is something wrong?

221
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,833
Well... I don't know
if it's because

222
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,875
you've been suspended
from using your powers...

223
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,208
but you look kind of worn out.

224
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,083
I'll be fine as long as
I know you're all right.

225
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,708
Oh, yeah, I'm doing great.

226
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
Besides, I'm used
to all the seniors

227
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,708
always putting me
through the ringer!

228
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,125
Oh, I see.

229
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,416
Well, if this is
the way it is,

230
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,833
I guess there's nothing
we can do. Ah...!

231
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
I mean it's not that
often we just get to

232
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,958
kick back and relax
together, right?

233
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,208
Let's just take it easy
and wait to be rescued.

234
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,291
Keiichi...

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,041
It's quiet, isn't it?

236
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,708
Yes, amazingly quiet.

237
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,500
So, you're not bored at all?

238
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,166
No... I really don't mind
spending time like this

239
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,625
doing nothing at all...

240
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,625
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

241
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,833
Actually... I'm starting
to think that maybe

242
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm the one who's bored.

243
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,208
Well, maybe we should
come up with something

244
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,666
to pass the time then?

245
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,208
Yeah, okay.

246
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,541
Let's think of something fun
that just the two of us can do.

247
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,083
Y'know... to distract
ourselves for a little while.

248
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,250
That sounds like fun!

249
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
So what does that
thing run on, anyway?

250
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,666
Batteries.

251
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,333
How long can they
keep it running?

252
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,583
About a week.

253
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,500
Even if we waited for
the power to run out,

254
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,666
Belldandy would be fine, but
Keiichi won't last that long.

255
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,625
I wouldn't be too
worried about Keiichi.

256
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,208
I'm sure he'll be fine in there,
no matter what happens.

257
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,666
And why's that?

258
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,500
Well, because Big Sis is in
there with him! Of course!

259
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh... of course.

260
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,541
Just because Big Sis
is suspended

261
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,750
doesn't mean she
can't use powers,

262
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,541
just that she's not supposed to.

263
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,875
So, despite the consequences,

264
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,625
she could use
them if she had to.

265
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,583
Well, since it's Belldandy
we're talking about...

266
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,708
I'm sure she would do it

267
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,083
if Keiichi were in
some kind of danger.

268
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
Even if it meant that she
would lose her license

269
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,000
as a first-class goddess.

270
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,500
Yeah...

271
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,791
Hm... a spice, huh?

272
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,208
Okay, lemme see... Oh, nutmeg!

273
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,625
Nutmeg? Um... egg...

274
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,583
Oh! Eggplant Souffle!

275
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,000
Nice try... but I'm not sure
that qualifies as a seasoning.

276
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,333
Oh, dear...

277
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,875
Maybe try thinking of things
that are less fancy.

278
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:00,833
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,375
All right...

280
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,375
Well, why don't we move on to
a different category then...

281
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,833
like animals?

282
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,041
Okay!

283
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,708
Just remember to keep
it simple this time.

284
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,500
I will!

285
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,875
So, have you come
up with anything?

286
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,083
Uh... I know...!

287
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,583
Why don't you make a machine
that'll advance time one week,

288
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,041
but only in this space?

289
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,125
Yeah, I suppose I could
build something like that.

290
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,208
But it would take me at least
six days to put it together.

291
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,333
Oh... Not much use in that then.

292
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,750
You said it...

293
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,166
Does it hurt, Keiichi?

294
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,083
No... not at all, really.

295
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,125
Well, I'm going to go in a
little deeper then, all right?

296
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,291
Mm-hm.

297
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,208
Now I want you to
stay very still for me.

298
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,958
Okay! It's all clean!

299
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,083
Now, let's have a look
at your other ear.

300
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,583
Huh? Oh, okay... Go ahead.

301
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,916
I've been wondering how long
this dimension might end up

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,750
staying the way that it is.

303
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,041
Probably not too much longer.
Maybe an hour or two...

304
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,500
Ah! I'm sure Urd and Skuld

305
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,708
will figure out a
way to get us out!

306
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,916
But, what if it turns
out to be longer?

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,625
What if we end up being stuck
in here for several days?

308
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,666
You might not be able to...

309
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,833
I'll be fine.

310
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,375
It's not like I haven't
been totally broke

311
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,666
and forced to go a few
days without food before.

312
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,958
So, I know I can at
least handle that much!

313
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,541
But... I don't think
I could handle it.

314
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:25,208
I just wouldn't be able to
bear it. To see you like that...

315
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,500
But, Belldandy...

316
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,583
I'm sure that I'd eventually use
my powers in order to save you.

317
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,250
Even if it meant losing
my license as a goddess.

318
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,958
I would do it in a heartbeat.

319
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,791
Do you really have such
little faith in me?

320
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,291
In times like these,

321
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,708
I want you to be able to trust
that we'll figure it out.

322
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,041
What do you mean?

323
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,375
We can't let ourselves get
discouraged. That's all!

324
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,083
I know someone
will save us.

325
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000
As long as we truly
believe in each other,

326
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,166
then the door will open
for us when the time comes.

327
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,541
You really are the most amazing
person I've ever met, Keiichi.

328
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,791
Huh?

329
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,666
I felt... so anxious before.

330
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,791
Until now, I've wanted
to get closer to you,

331
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,791
and I've tried to use my
powers as little as possible.

332
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:11,875
I really wouldn't have cared

333
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,291
if I had lost my
abilities altogether.

334
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,875
Or so I thought anyway...

335
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,708
Ah, Belldandy...

336
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,291
But, now...

337
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,041
it feels almost like I've been
stripped of a part of myself.

338
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,916
By having my powers
restricted for the first time,

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,875
I feel I'm able to appreciate
and learn about your strengths

340
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,041
all over again...

341
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,791
As well as my own
personal weaknesses...

342
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,833
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,875
I guess I figured we'd
be able to manage fine

344
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,333
for a week
or so out here...

345
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,291
but I didn't consider
how difficult it must be

346
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,750
for you to be
without your powers.

347
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean... I can just
stay the way I am now

348
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,625
without ever changing...

349
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,291
Y'see... No matter what happens,

350
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:52,041
I may never be able to truly
understand your pain, ever.

351
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,583
Oh, Keiichi...

352
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,333
That's why... from now on,

353
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,666
I won't ever take your
feelings for granted.

354
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,083
Belldandy, I'll always
be by your side.

355
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,791
Although, I have to say...

356
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,416
At the moment I
feel pretty useless.

357
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,458
Not at all! You couldn't
be any more encouraging!

358
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,500
Mm...

359
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,291
Be-Be-Be- Belldandy!

360
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,250
Ah!

361
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,791
Would you like to dance?

362
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,208
Huh?!

363
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,458
I know, why not make two
machines that can advance time

364
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,791
by three days each?

365
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,541
I could build each
of those in two days,

366
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,916
so that'd only be
four days altogether!

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,541
Keiichi can deal with
the hunger until then!

368
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,375
But Big Sis would
never be able to handle

369
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,166
seeing him like that.

370
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,875
You're right...

371
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,208
I can't use my powers...
but this much I can manage.

372
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,208
Hey, we danced like this
one time back at school.

373
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,875
When we were competing
with Sayoko. Do you remember?

374
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,375
I remember back then...

375
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,708
But I wasn't able
to dance very well.

376
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,416
You know, this reminds me of
the "folk dance" we used to do

377
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,833
during our field days at school.

378
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,500
Was it fun?

379
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,750
Yeah.

380
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,666
Hang on just a little
longer, Lysander.

381
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,083
Meow!

382
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,708
Hello!

383
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,250
I accidentally put my kitty's
food in with the packages

384
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,000
that I gave you guys earlier,

385
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,375
so I was kinda
hoping to get it back.

386
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,875
I afraid that now isn't
really a good time for that.

387
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,250
Meow!

388
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,083
--So where exactly is my stuff?
--Huh?!

389
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,166
Maybe if I just asked
Morisato or Bell they'd know--

390
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,041
I'm telling you that now
is not the time for this!

391
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,583
MEE-YOW!

392
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,250
--Hey there...! Morisato!
--Ah...!

393
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,791
The founder of the
Auto Club's here!

394
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
I'm warning you...

395
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,250
So, are Bell and Morisato
even home today or what?

396
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,166
WE'RE TELLING YOU THAT NOW
IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR THIS,

397
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,625
OKAY?!

398
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,333
Ah! Lysander!

399
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,416
Oh, Master Keiichi...

400
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,916
Your bath is ready, sir...
And the water is just right.

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,541
Good... Well, I guess
I'll go on in.

402
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,958
Would you like me to wash
your back for you, my liege?

403
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,875
More importantly, how is
my dinner coming along?

404
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,875
It is being prepared
as we speak, sir.

405
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,875
Then I suppose you may join me,
once you've finished with that.

406
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,250
Very good, sir.

407
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,250
Splish splash splish...

408
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,291
Ahh...!

409
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,875
♪ Oh, fishy fishy fish... ♪

410
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,583
--This feels great!
♪ Herring and tuna. ♪

411
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,583
♪ Oh, fishy fishy fish... ♪

412
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,125
If you'll permit me... I will
now wash your back for you.

413
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
Ah... this sure
feels like heaven!

414
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,333
This evening's main course...

415
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,666
...is a Scandinavian delicacy
known as surstromming.

416
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,750
Oh, boy! It smells great!

417
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,708
Hey, thanks for the meal!

418
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,958
Mm...! This is delicious!

419
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,791
It is a great
honor to hear that.

420
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,041
Ah, yes! Why don't
you have some, too?

421
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,041
It would be wasted on me, sir.

422
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,916
Oh, don't be modest.
Come a little closer!

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,333
Well, if you won't
come willingly,

424
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,916
I guess I'll just have to--

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,875
Ack!

426
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,666
[stomach growls]

427
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,708
Grr! I'm such an idiot!

428
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,750
I'm so sorry...!
I thought it might help,

429
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,666
but our pretending just
made you even hungrier

430
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,208
than you were before, didn't it?

431
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,625
No, that's not the
problem at all... I swear!

432
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,958
Hm?

433
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,250
Wait a minute...

434
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,583
The space is infinite
above and around,

435
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,625
but the floor feels
pretty solid...

436
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,708
I've got it!

437
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,458
The space is infinite
both out and up,

438
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,041
but it isn't "infinitely" DEEP!

439
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
In other words, the
space beneath the floor

440
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
might actually be normal!

441
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,041
Right...! This might be
the way out of here!

442
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,500
Keiichi, please wait!

443
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,666
Huh?

444
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,083
What happens if you're
wrong about this?

445
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,166
If we make a tear
in this dimension...

446
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,416
it might go through
to another world!

447
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah, but...

448
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,791
Ah...

449
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,083
Let's open it.

450
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,083
Huh?!

451
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,666
I think I'd rather
take my chances

452
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,041
and fall into an unknown world

453
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,333
than be stuck in this
infinite dimension forever.

454
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,000
I guess you're right.

455
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,916
Besides... it doesn't
matter where we end up...

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,666
...as long as I've
got you with me.

457
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,500
Mm...

458
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,750
Ah...

459
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,291
One, and a two, and a... THREE!

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,750
Huh?!

461
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,125
AAAHH! It is another world!

462
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,125
You've done it, Keiichi!

463
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,291
Lysander! Where did you go?!

464
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,166
Meow...

465
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,083
Ah! Lysander!

466
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,250
Oh, thank goodness
you're all right!

467
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,166
Well, it looks like Morisato's
not around, so I guess for today

468
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,500
you'll just have to put up with
the other cat food I bought.

469
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,791
Huh? Hey, wait a minute.
Isn't that Chihiro?

470
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,291
That must've been
her cat we found

471
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,416
when we crossed over
from the other dimension.

472
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,333
What if you make six machines
that shorten time by a day each?

473
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,041
Well, I suppose I could make
those in only half a day.

474
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,125
So that would take me
only three days total!

475
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,916
Oh, jeez... You know, I think
it's peaceful enough out here.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,791
Keiichi... I guess I do want
to remain a goddess after all.

477
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,833
I'm only going to have to be
without my license for a week.

478
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,750
But... I was wondering...

479
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,000
if it would be all right
if I still stay with you...

480
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,208
even if I can't use
any of my powers?

481
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, of course! You can stay
here for as long as you want!

482
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,083
But... Keiichi?

483
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,041
Huh?

484
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,666
Being human isn't so bad either.

485
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,666
My goddess powers are causing
Keiichi great misfortune.

486
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,375
What can I possibly do to help
her during her greatest test?

487
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,958
Next time: "Ah! Would it
be okay if I were a demon"

488
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,291
Even if... you
weren't a goddess...
