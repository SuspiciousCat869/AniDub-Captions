1
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,833
I, goddess who stands
at the seat of Order

2
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,208
over Heaven and Earth...

3
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,041
do command that you be released

4
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,000
from the Earthly ties
that now bind you.

5
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,833
Right. Now after you've
finished composing your spell,

6
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,666
you must focus all
of your attention

7
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,875
directly on the
object of your spell.

8
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,750
You'll then feel something
stirring deep within you...

9
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,375
And that feeling is
your power, Skuld.

10
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,416
My attention...

11
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,500
Oh!

12
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,458
Stirring within me... 

13
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,250
Ah!

14
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,958
Ah... It's actually floating!
I did it! It worked!

15
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,375
Look, Big Sis! Look!

16
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,875
Now, don't ever forget
that feeling, all right?

17
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,125
Mm-hm!

18
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,791
Good after-- Whoa!

19
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,333
Hey, Skuld! There's
something weird out here!

20
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,458
Now stop that, Banpei!

21
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,125
I don't know what I'm
going to do with him...!

22
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,333
--I'll be back in a second.
--Okay.

23
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,291
Are you okay, Sentaro?

24
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,291
So why is her power
working all of a sudden?

25
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,416
Skuld's feelings of
affection are providing

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,416
a source of strength
for her right now,

27
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
and those feelings are
what's causing her powers

28
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,500
to start working.

29
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:02,416
So that means...
Oh, I get it! Then she's...

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,541
Right. She is a girl, after all!

31
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,458
Whoa!

32
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,375
Well? Pretty cool, isn't it?

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,583
Yeah!

34
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,541
It was cool how your
sister healed my bruise

35
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,166
the other day, too...

36
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,458
It's like you guys are
magicians or something!

37
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,500
We aren't magicians, you
big silly, we're goddesses.

38
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,750
Uh... Goddesses? Hm...

39
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:37,041
Ah, I get it... People from
other countries are so cool.

40
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,583
Hm? Stop staring.

41
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,416
Uh, I wasn't looking at you,

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,458
I was just noticing
what you were doing

43
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,500
and it's kind of amazing!

44
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,458
Not to mention a little weird...

45
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,791
Huh? What's happening?!

46
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,833
Hey, aaah! Hey, you better
do what I tell you to do!

47
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,208
Whoa! It's gonna fall! Whoa!

48
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,708
Whoa!

49
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,333
You okay?

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,208
Um, uh-huh...

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,875
I guess I blew it, huh?

52
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,625
Huh?

53
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,291
Ah!

54
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,666
Ah...! I'm sorry!

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,041
No... I mean thanks.

56
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,291
Mm-hm...

57
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,875
--♪ La, la, la... ♪
--Huh?!

58
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,583
Singing...

59
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,833
♪ La, la, la... ♪

60
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:47,208
♪ La, la, la, la... ♪

61
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
So cool...

62
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,250
She's beautiful... Who is that?

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,750
That's Holy Bell. You see, all
goddesses have their own angel.

64
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,041
Um... An angel, huh?

65
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,625
Ah! So does that mean you
have an angel, too, Skuld?

66
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,750
Oh, you don't, huh?
Even though you're a goddess?

67
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,875
Don't be ridiculous!
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,125
Of course I have one!

69
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,541
That's awesome!
So, what's your angel like?

70
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,708
Please be born now, Angel!

71
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,666
Mm...?

72
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,250
I guess Big Sis must've
been right when she said

73
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,708
it wouldn't work unless
I use my own power...

74
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,916
But... I'm positive
I'll be able to do it now!

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,291
At least I think I can...

76
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,958
In any case, please, Angel...!

77
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,416
BE BORN NOW!

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,083
I already promised Sentaro
that I would show you

79
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,000
to him tomorrow!

80
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,458
Not enough power,
that must be it!

81
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,041
I'll use the magical
power amplifier

82
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,541
that I made before, and...

83
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,958
No! That wouldn't
be my own power!

84
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,625
That's right, it's an egg,
so what it needs is body heat!

85
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,666
Oh, please... Please!
PLEEEEEEASE!

86
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,458
What else? Let me see...
What else could I do?!

87
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,375
Hey, what's with all the
commotion in here, huh...?

88
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,125
Can't you practice your
magic a little more--

89
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,250
Huh?

90
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,791
Oh... I see...

91
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,208
Do you actually think you
can hatch your angel's egg

92
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,958
just because you have
a little power...

93
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,041
--I swallowed it...
--Huh?

94
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,416
I SWALLOWED IT!

95
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,625
Swallowed... the egg?

96
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,250
Mm-hm...

97
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,250
NOOOO!

98
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,458
Just come to my room...!

99
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,333
--NO WAY!
--And I'll give you a dose

100
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,958
of some medicine. An
extra-strength vomit inducer...

101
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,666
That'll definitely
make you cough it up!

102
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,166
Bad things always
happen to people

103
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,583
who takes your
weird concoctions.

104
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,916
This is all happening because
you did something stupid

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,916
without telling anyone.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,791
That's true...

107
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,291
Now, come with me this instant!

108
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,625
Please help me,
Big Sis! I'm in danger!

109
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,583
Something...
something inside me...

110
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,750
Ah! Skuld...!
Skuld...! Belldandy!

111
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,875
If the power of the angel egg

112
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,416
continues to spread
like this then...

113
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,875
Given the level of
her powers right now...

114
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,500
it's very likely that
they'll go out of control.

115
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,750
Yes. But if we're lucky

116
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,416
this could bring more good than
bad, and then perhaps she--

117
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,375
Nevertheless, Skuld's
in danger right now.

118
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,291
I think we should
plan to seal it.

119
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:24,541
But I'd still like to avoid
doing that if we possibly can.

120
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,750
Belldandy!

121
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,083
Skuld!

122
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,916
You must stay in control...!

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Try not to be
overcome by the power!

124
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,708
Mm...

125
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,166
Here it comes.

126
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,375
Once it's out, we'll seal
it before it can take form.

127
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,916
Belldandy!

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,583
Right!

129
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,458
Here we go!

130
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,750
Okay!

131
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,625
No, Urd! Not yet!

132
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,666
Uh?

133
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:37,166
An angel... But it's just so...

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,291
TINY!

135
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,750
How wonderful...!

136
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,333
It looks as though
she has decided

137
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,208
to favor Skuld with her power.

138
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,250
Uh...! Ah...

139
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,250
Boy do I feel pooped... Huh?
What's wrong, Big Sis?

140
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,666
Oh, Skuld, I'm so
happy for you.

141
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
Huh...? What for?

142
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,791
Just take a look behind you.

143
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,166
Hm?

144
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:09,291
Oooh! Big Sis!
It's an a-a-a-angel!

145
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,750
Not just any angel...
This one's yours.

146
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,375
So this is my...

147
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,458
Nice to meet you... Angel!

148
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,083
Huh?

149
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,708
Oh, thank you...

150
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,041
Wow...! So this must
be your angel, huh?

151
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,083
Yep! That's right.
Her name's Noble Scarlet.

152
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,083
Nice to meet you...!

153
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,083
She's a whole lot smaller
than your sister's angel was.

154
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,833
So what can she do anyway?

155
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,375
Huh...? Uh, what do you mean?

156
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,333
Uh...

157
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,166
Guess I shouldn't
have asked that...

158
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,166
Well, she's my angel,
so she helps me out

159
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,791
in all kind of different
ways every single day!

160
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,500
In fact, I'm gonna show you
exactly what I'm talking about!

161
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,250
Well, you don't have to
force her to do anything

162
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,416
just for me...

163
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Come on, Sentaro!
Come on, Noble Scarlet!

164
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,291
We're going out!

165
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,041
Here you go.

166
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,708
Now do your best.

167
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,166
Belldandy.

168
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,583
Huh?

169
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,500
Don't you think we should
have sealed her after all?

170
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,083
Well, the way things are now,

171
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,500
she doesn't appear to have
the power to get out of control,

172
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,875
and besides that,

173
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,416
she seems to be kind-hearted
and loyal to her master.

174
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,958
But that isn't what
I'm getting at...

175
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,583
Urd...

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,125
You're not still upset about
botching that up, are you?

177
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,083
It's not that big a deal, so
there's no need for you to--

178
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,541
Ah!

179
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,333
Ooh...

180
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,875
They kissed...

181
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
AAAHH! Ugh...

182
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,458
Man, I really wish that
thing wouldn't ring so loud!

183
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,375
--Skuld!
--Hm?

184
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,875
You have a call.
Sentaro's on the phone for you!

185
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,708
Huh?

186
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,458
Sorry to have you come out
here on such short notice,

187
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,166
but I was hoping you'd tune
it up for me one last time.

188
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,166
Right! Now it's perfect...!

189
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,875
So if you lose, you can't
blame it on the bike! Hm!

190
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,250
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go take it for a spin.

191
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,833
Sure!

192
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,166
Wow! It's perect!

193
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,375
Well, of course it is! I mean,
who do you think I am?

194
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,750
Skuld...

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,375
That's right! I'm Big Sis's
genius little sister...

196
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,250
--Hey...
--Hm?

197
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,666
I have a favor to ask you.

198
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,833
Huh?

199
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,791
I, um...

200
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,291
What's wrong?

201
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,333
I'd like it if... you would come
watch the race tomorrow...

202
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,750
and wait on top of the
last berm on the course.

203
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,500
Okay... but don't you want me
at the finish line instead?

204
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,916
Mm-mm.

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,583
That last berm is where
the dirt is piled the highest.

206
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,000
You can get a good view of
the whole course from there.

207
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,041
Okay.

208
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,500
If you'll wait there,

209
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,541
then I'll be able to see you
from anywhere, and then...

210
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,791
I'm sure I'm gonna win this!

211
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,458
Oh... yeah...

212
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,041
Mm...

213
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,291
Uh, well, then...

214
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,791
Ah!

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,541
Uh... I didn't mean to!
Th-That was just...

216
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,833
I'm, uh...

217
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,458
I gotta go!

218
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,375
What a rotten thing to do!

219
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Sentaro went home, and I
wasn't able to make him

220
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,125
a real promise about tomorrow...

221
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,625
And now he probably
thinks I'm a weirdo...

222
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,791
Even worse...
he might hate me now...

223
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:11,333
Stay away! Leave me alone!
Just get out of here!

224
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,916
I see... So that's
what happened.

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,375
And that's why she chased
you out of her room, huh?

226
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,041
You were just trying
to help Skuld out

227
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,833
in your own way,
though, weren't you?

228
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,166
You poor thing... Well,
I hope you understand

229
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,833
that she doesn't
actually hate you, okay?

230
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,833
Just give her some
time to calm down,

231
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,291
and try going back
to her room tomorrow.

232
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,291
Well, she probably shouldn't
go in there empty-handed.

233
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,833
What do you mean?

234
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,000
I bet the ice cream parlor's
probably still open right now.

235
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,833
Noble Scarlet...

236
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,083
It's the Kanto Junior
Open Regional Qualifier

237
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,416
short track finals!

238
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,750
Here are today's riders...

239
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,291
Riding for Dart-RS -
Number Two, Satoru Hakozaki.

240
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,750
Riding for Misaki-Sile - Number
Fifty-seven, Yoshikazu Yamane.

241
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,583
From Nekomi City,
riding independent--

242
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,708
Number Eighteen,
Sentaro Kawanishi.

243
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,416
With Team Genghis Khan--

244
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,333
I'm not mad at you anymore.

245
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,166
However... the next time
you butt in like that,

246
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,833
you're going right
back into your egg.

247
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,583
Mm!

248
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,041
Ah, ice cream...!

249
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,291
I'll bet that was Big Sis
or Keiichi's idea.

250
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:16,083
So... the next time that
Sentaro comes over... Mm!

251
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,625
Hm?

252
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,125
Nah, there's really no
need for me to go now...

253
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,041
Besides, I'm sure Sentaro
feels the same way I do,

254
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,208
so you can just stop
worrying about it, all right?

255
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,083
Uh?

256
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,416
Noble Scarlet? It's okay!

257
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
Oh, I'd better put that ice
cream in the refrigerator,

258
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,541
since I'm not gonna
eat it right now...

259
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,500
Uh...

260
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,041
And it's Sentaro
Kawanishi in the lead!

261
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,875
Will he be able to break
away from the pack?!

262
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,041
Close behind is Hakozaki in
second, and Matsumoto in third.

263
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,625
Will this be our
finishing order?!

264
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,916
Uh-oh! Hold on!
Number fifty-seven, Yamane,

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is starting to catch up
to the front runners!

266
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,416
He's really gaining ground!

267
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,083
Look at those kids eat up
that track, folks!

268
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,416
Aw, man... I shoulda
known she wouldn't come...

269
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,375
Oh, no! Something's
happened to Yamane!

270
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,958
Oh, no! How do I
get around this?

271
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,541
And an official is on the scene.

272
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,250
Is Yamane out for good, or will
is he able to get back up again?

273
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,291
Ahh!

274
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,833
Ohh! And Kawanishi's
also gone down!

275
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,041
The front fork's not bent.

276
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,208
Guess the wheel
hub's okay, too...

277
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,083
Now, lemme see...
The spokes seem to be--

278
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,083
--It's fine!
--Hm?!

279
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,166
We tuned up that
bicycle together!

280
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
That's why I said you'd
be sure to win the race...!

281
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,666
And that's why I won't
forgive you if you lose this!

282
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,416
Go get 'em, Sentaro!

283
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,791
She came after all...
Just you watch, Skuld!

284
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,833
I'll win with this
bike no matter what!

285
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,458
I mean... I have a goddess
and an angel behind me!

286
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,250
I can't lose!

287
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,958
One more to pass...

288
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,791
LET'S GO!

289
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,333
And now...

290
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,916
the winner of the MTB
Kanto Junior Open

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,333
Regional Qualifier is...
Sentaro Kawanishi!

292
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:36,583
--Yeah!
--Woohoo!

293
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,958
Mm...!

294
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,375
I guess...
I'll be heading home...

295
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,541
Huh?

296
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,916
Noble Scarlet?

297
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,416
I just... couldn't
help it earlier...

298
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,625
I didn't care if he
thought I was a weirdo,

299
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,208
I just didn't want him
to lose, that's all...

300
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,625
But anyway I'm glad,

301
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,750
because he won using equipment
that I help to fix up.

302
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,833
So it's okay, right?
Now let's just go home.

303
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,750
Huh...?

304
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,125
Uh...?

305
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,291
You're still here!

306
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,875
Mm...! Mm... uh... Ah...

307
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,166
She did it again!

308
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,333
Skuld?

309
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,041
Huh?! Um, yeah... uh-huh...

310
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,208
Thank you.

311
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,750
Huh?

312
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought it was all over for
me after I took that fall...

313
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,166
but I was able to win because
you came here to support me.

314
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,375
Mm... yeah?

315
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,083
And... you looked after
my bike for me, too,

316
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,250
which makes me feel like

317
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,750
I didn't really win
on my own, so uh...

318
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,125
So I... want you to have this!

319
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,083
Huh...?! But, Sentaro,
that's your award and--

320
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,708
But I want you to
take it, Skuld, please!

321
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,833
Uh... But I...

322
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,375
Uh, sorry to interrupt
your moment,

323
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,958
but we do still have some
awards left to present, so...

324
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,083
Ooh-hoo!

325
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,958
Sorry! I'll get out of your way!

326
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,500
I can't believe
that Noble Scarlet!

327
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,416
But I guess I'll
let it go this time,

328
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,458
since she did bring
me that ice cream.

329
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,208
Thanks for the support today.

330
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,458
No problem! I'm just
sorry I showed up late.

331
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:24,291
Oh, one other thing, Sentaro...

332
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,333
Congratulations!

333
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,083
Okay... Thanks, Skuld.

334
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,708
See ya later!

335
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,333
See ya!

336
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,041
Huh?!

337
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,708
Big Sis? Urd? What's wrong?

338
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,541
Huh? What is this?

339
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,375
That's Noble Scarlet, Skuld.

340
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,791
No!

341
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,416
The thing is... angels
show absolute obedience...

342
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,208
They always do what
they're told without fail.

343
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,708
It can't be... It isn't...

344
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,583
because I told her I'd send
her back to her egg, is it?

345
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,208
But why...? I told
her I loved her!

346
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,833
I said I wanted
us to be together,

347
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,875
and that I always
wanted her by my side!

348
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,458
Yes... and I'm certain that she
felt the same way that you do.

349
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,458
But to have an angel, one must
understand one's own weaknesses

350
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,500
and have the strength
to face them.

351
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,583
Then why?

352
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,708
Why didn't you
ever tell me this?!

353
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,375
It's not something others
can get involved with.

354
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,333
Because your angel is
a reflection of yourself.

355
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,000
But you know what?

356
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,083
If you'll just hold on to
these feelings you have now...

357
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,291
when you are finally
strong enough...

358
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm certain that Noble
Scarlet will come back.

359
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,583
Noble Scarlet!

360
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,666
I'm going out!

361
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,208
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Now let's go!

362
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,625
Okay!

363
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,666
Hang on...
Where's Noble Scarlet?

364
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,625
Ah... Well... we won't be able
to see her for a little while.

365
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,500
Huh? Why not?

366
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,125
She said that if I keep on doing
my best to become more mature,

367
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,041
she'll come back to
see me again one day.

368
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,666
All right! Well, I sure
hope we get to see

369
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,833
Noble Scarlet some day soon.

370
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,458
Mm-hm!

371
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,416
It's all because I
told her to get lost...

372
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,541
Don't worry about it.

373
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,708
We were all worried.

374
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,375
I'm sorry.
It was all my fault...

375
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,916
Next time, "Ah! I'm half
goddess, half demon?"

376
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,875
Some people are too
innocent for their own good.

377
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,333
Uh, who're you talking about?
