1
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,333
Three-twelve, and
another two-seventy,

2
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,666
plus one-twenty-five...

3
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,416
and that brings your total
to nine forty-one, Sir.

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,083
Right... and that'll be
out of ten dollars...

5
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,583
Here's your change.

6
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,083
And please visit us again soon!

7
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,625
Yeah... I-I will!

8
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:58,208
Next in line, please! I'm so
sorry to have kept you waiting.

9
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,625
Hey! I'm open.

10
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,208
Can I help the next
customer over here?

11
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,250
I made us some tea.

12
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,625
Hey, that's great...
thanks a lot.

13
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,375
Ah... I wonder if
it's going to make

14
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,541
the Almighty One
angry because...

15
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,041
I let a goddess like you
do all this kind of work.

16
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,125
Don't worry.
I'm sure it is fine...

17
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,083
Because being together with you
is something that I wished for.

18
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,416
And I think the way that
time flows from day to day

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,750
is actually quite
beautiful to see.

20
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,833
I am so glad that I came down
here to Earth to live with you!

21
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,958
It is thanks to you
that I am able to enjoy

22
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,833
seeing all these things.

23
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,500
Simply being here
together with you

24
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,041
makes it fun, Mr. Keiichi!

25
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,708
Thank you, Santa!

26
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,208
Man... I can't believe it's
Christmas time already...

27
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,125
Christmas time... 
what is that?

28
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,541
Each year on the night
of December 24th...

29
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,083
this guy named Santa Claus
travels around the world,

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,708
coming to every home and leaving
presents for all the children.

31
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,875
My, there certainly are
some wonderful people

32
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,125
living here on Earth,
aren't there?

33
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,416
Well, it's actually the
children's fathers or mothers

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,750
who leave the gifts...

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,750
So you mean that people
here on the surface world

36
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,666
call their parents
"Santa Claus"?

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
No... that's not what I meant...

38
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,791
It's just one of those things
we make a big production out of,

39
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,458
and most kids know the truth.

40
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,958
Oh, I see. So that is how it is?

41
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,333
Belldandy has been with
me for almost a year now.

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,916
And in all that time, I haven't
done a single thing for her

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,416
that a boyfriend should do.

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,625
Like buying her a
Christmas present...

45
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,458
But what on Earth would
make Belldandy happy?

46
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,750
Hey Mister!

47
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,208
Oh, hi there, Hijiri.

48
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,625
Looky, looky! I got
this from Santa Claus!

49
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,333
My, that is a very
pretty balloon.

50
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,208
Uh...

51
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,708
Hijiri... what kind of
Christmas present

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,625
do you suppose would
really make a girl happy?

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,291
I mean, besides a balloon.

54
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,875
A ring!

55
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,875
Whenever we walk by this
store, my Mommy always

56
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,083
looks in the window and says,
"Isn't that ring lovely?"

57
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,916
Oh, I see.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,166
Mommy's waiting
for me, so I gotta go.

59
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,541
See ya later! Bye-bye!

60
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,333
Belldandy?

61
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,583
Yes?

62
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,083
Do you like... these rings?

63
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,125
They are very pretty,
aren't they?

64
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,041
Okay...

65
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,958
So, that means you do like them?

66
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,041
Yes, I like them very much.

67
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,458
Is that so...

68
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,250
Why do you ask, Mr. Keiichi?

69
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,291
Um, well... I was wondering if
there's anything you might want

70
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,666
right now?

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,416
Anything I might
want right now...?

72
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,250
Well, let me think...

73
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,583
Ah...! Yes, there is!

74
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,875
What?

75
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,833
I can't believe she
actually gets excited

76
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,333
over something like that.

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,250
Well, you know...
It's typical Belldandy.

78
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,625
Thank you so much.

79
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,458
I had completely
forgotten we were out.

80
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,916
No problem. I'm just
glad it made you happy.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,416
But that's still not gonna cut
it for a Christmas present...

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,916
So, Keiichi...

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,208
What are you gonna get me for
a Christmas present, huh?!

84
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,541
What do you have on your
list this year, Skuld?

85
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,916
Although it should really
go without saying...

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,083
I want a monkey wrench,
ignition spanner set,

87
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,625
an electric drill,
and some cryo wire!

88
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,208
Now I'm sorry that I asked.

89
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,333
Hey! What's that
supposed to mean?

90
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
All right, all right. I'm sorry!

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,625
They're way too much
for me to afford...

92
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,458
Even though I really would
like to get one of these

93
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,916
for Belldandy...

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,291
--Buy it...
--Huh?

95
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,458
Buy the ring...

96
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,916
It's... talking!

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,333
Buy one...

98
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,541
It's like it's calling to me!
The way it's shiny...

99
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,166
The way it glitters...

100
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,250
That's right...! Now this
will definitely make her...

101
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,916
Yes, buy it...! Buy it for Urd!
You know you want to!

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,708
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,333
Uh-oh!

104
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,291
Seeing as how you're
agonizing here,

105
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,458
I thought I'd give
you some good advice.

106
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,875
I'm not "agonizing."

107
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
Oh, aren't you...?

108
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,208
That sparkly ring would look so
nice on her soft dainty finger,

109
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,166
now wouldn't it?

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
Yeah, it would...

111
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,500
You see, receiving a ring
from the one she loves

112
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,125
is the greatest happiness that
a girl could ever experience.

113
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,708
The greatest happiness?

114
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,333
That's right!

115
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,500
Uh... is it really?

116
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes. It's because
you can truly sense

117
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,125
the feelings of
the person you love

118
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,833
every time you put the
ring on your finger.

119
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,083
It's utterly divine.

120
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,208
Is that true, Urd?

121
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,041
Come on, you can trust me.

122
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,333
You're right...

123
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,166
I do want Belldandy
to be able to sense

124
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,916
my feelings for her in
the same way I can feel hers

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,666
through this sweater
that she made for me!

126
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,208
That's it then.

127
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,041
If you are bound together by
true love, that ring is a must.

128
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,458
You need to buy it
right this minute!

129
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,375
Yeah... let's do it.
I'll go buy it right now!

130
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,041
Come on, just go ahead and
splurge on it, Keiichi.

131
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
But just one of these
rings is equal to

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
four months of my
living expenses...

133
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,791
And here I just told
someone that it's

134
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,958
what's in a person's
heart that counts.

135
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,125
All right, if you think
she's not worth it.

136
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,250
Hey, it's Morisato!

137
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey, guys.

138
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,708
When did we ever teach
you to be the kinda guy

139
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,666
to stand around in
a place like this,

140
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,333
looking at ladies' jewelry?!

141
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,541
That's right!

142
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,375
You oughta break
a sweat with us

143
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,875
doing some part-time work!

144
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,416
Uh... I will!

145
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,791
Please help me get a job
wherever it is you're doing!

146
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,291
Uh... okay.

147
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,666
Aw, geez!

148
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,625
All I wanted was for you guys to
help me get some part-time work!

149
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,041
Don't' be ridiculous!
Everyone knows that

150
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,708
working aboard a fishing
boat is man's work!

151
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,250
You forge both mind and body,

152
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,041
and earn money
while you're at it.

153
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,916
Two birds with one stone!

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,208
All right, fine. But 
I just have one question.

155
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,333
I will be able to go home
right after this, right?

156
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, yeah, three
months from now...

157
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,250
Three months! It'll be
way too late by then!

158
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,833
So what? After we get back,

159
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,083
you'll be able to buy
ten or twenty rings easy!

160
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Somebody help me!

161
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,541
Oh, boy. He sure has
a long way to go...

162
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,041
I should've known it was a
mistake to rely on those two.

163
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,666
Just four days left
'til Christmas Eve.

164
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,416
I guess the only way
I can pull this off

165
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,791
is to find another part-time
job somewhere else,

166
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,208
but where am I gonna find one?

167
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,000
What are you trying to find?

168
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,541
Ah...! Nothing! Nothing at all!

169
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,250
Oh, okay then...

170
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,208
Well since I worked
the earlier shift today,

171
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,250
I'll go home ahead of you and
get dinner ready, Mr. Keiichi.

172
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,541
Uh... Sure...

173
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,375
Uh, wait just a
minute, Belldandy.

174
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,625
Yes?

175
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,333
I've got some stuff
I need to take care of,

176
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,291
so I'll be getting home late
the next three or four days.

177
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,791
All right.

178
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,666
I don't think we're gonna be
able to eat dinner together,

179
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,916
and I probably won't be able to

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,958
spend much time at the
house with you either...

181
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,625
Okay, I understand.

182
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Don't you even want to know why?

183
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,750
No, because I trust you.

184
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,291
You mean you aren't worried?

185
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,125
You are not going to be doing
anything dangerous, are you?

186
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,833
No, it's nothing like that!

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,416
Then there's no need
for me to worry.

188
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,333
Man, it looks like the only
sorta jobs that'll get me

189
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,666
that kind of fast money
are all pretty dreadful.

190
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,125
I guess making two thousand
bucks in only four days

191
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,333
might be asking too much.

192
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,541
"I trust you," huh?

193
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,500
So, you've made up
your mind, have you?!

194
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,416
What are you just
sitting around for?

195
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,875
Come on, kid! It's time
for you to go to work!

196
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,208
Huh?!

197
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,625
He's got some nerve
keeping secrets!

198
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,041
What could he possibly
be up to anyway?

199
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,333
I wonder...

200
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,916
And Urd isn't at home either.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,750
Those two are totally up
to something, I know it...!

202
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,083
Huh?

203
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,333
The miso soup has gotten cold,
so I'll go warm it up.

204
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,083
But Big Sis!

205
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,291
Please don't worry, Skuld.

206
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,500
I have complete
trust in Mr. Keiichi.

207
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,250
Hey, is there anything I
can help you with, Big Sis?

208
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,291
Why thank you very much, Skuld!

209
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,875
Would you like to chop up
these onions for me?

210
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,583
No problem!

211
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,750
All right. Knock yourself out!

212
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,333
Not tuna again.

213
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,041
Well, they say
the longest journey

214
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,083
begins with a single step.

215
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,083
I had a rather difficult
time finding you a job

216
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,583
that pays well, you know.

217
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,125
I'll bet you the Auto Club guys
tipped you off about this,

218
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,000
didn't they?

219
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,291
Hmph!

220
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,125
Go on, full speed
ahead to the ring!

221
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,708
Get a move on, Keiichi.

222
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,291
And be sure to give it your all.

223
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,583
Okay... I'll give it my all...!

224
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,708
Aaaachoo!

225
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,125
All that work, and only a
hundred bucks to show for it...

226
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,583
Stop whining!

227
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,708
I'm back!

228
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,041
Welcome home!

229
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,458
Whoa...!

230
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,416
I had a feeling you'd be
coming home right about now.

231
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,125
A total lie...! She's been
waiting the whole time!

232
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,125
Is that true, Belldandy?

233
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes, but please don't worry.

234
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,416
We goddesses exist
for the purpose

235
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,916
of bringing you
happiness, Mr. Keiichi.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,458
That is my responsibility.

237
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,125
Yeah, well, happiness for me

238
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,250
is getting to help
my big sister out!

239
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,416
Go ahead and eat your dinner
while it is still warm, okay?

240
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,833
Thanks for making this for me.

241
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,416
I'm gonna give it
my all tomorrow, too!

242
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,000
Here, take one!
Here you go. Thanks!

243
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,625
Have some of this, Mr. Keiichi.

244
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,250
Thanks a lot.

245
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,958
Please don't push
yourself too hard, okay?

246
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,041
Hey, don't worry about me.

247
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,541
I think I'm gonna
be just fine...

248
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,583
You know why Mr. Keiichi
has been coming home

249
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,416
so late every night, don't you?

250
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,416
I worried because
he seems so exhausted.

251
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,625
Please Urd...

252
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,333
was it something you
said to Mr. Keiichi?

253
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,208
Well, I certainly did help
the kid get fired up...

254
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,875
but what Keiichi's
doing right now

255
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,208
is entirely of
his own free will.

256
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,291
So maybe we should just
let him do as he pleases.

257
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,166
Right.

258
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,875
I trust him completely.

259
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,166
Man, I feel like I haven't
had a decent conversation

260
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,000
with Belldandy in days.

261
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,875
I wonder if she's mad
at me for going so far

262
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,958
to keep this a secret from her.

263
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,541
Are you all right?

264
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,500
Hey, Urd.

265
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,541
Yeah...?

266
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,958
Do you think it's wrong...

267
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,541
for me to be keeping everything
a secret from Belldandy?

268
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,208
Hang on, you do want to
surprise her, don't you?

269
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,375
Yeah... But, she's not
asking me any questions,

270
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,875
she's just waiting
patiently for me.

271
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,708
And now it's like I'm
starting to wonder if

272
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,916
this ring is gonna
even convey my feelings.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,625
Well if that's how you feel,
maybe you should just give up.

274
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,958
Hm?

275
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,125
Belldandy trusts you,
and she's waiting for you.

276
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,166
And you feel you need to
reciprocate that, correct?

277
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,333
Mm-hm...

278
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,625
True, money won't
buy someone's heart...

279
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,833
but it's your feelings for her
that have brought you this far.

280
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,541
If you've made up your mind,

281
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,333
then see this
through to the end.

282
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,625
You are a man, aren't you?

283
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,833
All right.
I'm gonna give it my all.

284
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,916
For Belldandy!

285
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,541
Ah...!

286
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,250
Are you all right?!

287
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,000
I did it!

288
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,666
If I add up what I've already
made to tomorrow's earnings,

289
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,583
it'll be enough! Thank you, Urd!

290
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,583
You're the one who
did all the hard work.

291
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,000
I only got you the jobs.

292
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,833
Well, that might be true...

293
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,333
but you definitely
helped me out a lot.

294
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,375
You can pay me back
after you get the ring.

295
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,208
You did a really
good job, Keiichi.

296
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,666
And I'm sure she's going
to be delighted with it.

297
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,000
Now, gather your courage and
tell Belldandy how you feel.

298
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,166
Right!

299
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,666
Big Sis? Big Sis!

300
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,333
Oh...! Yes, Skuld, what is it?

301
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,958
The miso soup has
gotten cold again.

302
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,750
Oh... so it has...

303
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,958
Well I had better go
and warm it up then.

304
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,666
Hey, I'm back!

305
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Sorry I'm so late
again, Belldandy.

306
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,708
Welcome home, Mr. Keiichi.

307
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,708
Belldandy...

308
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,750
Thanks again for
making me dinner.

309
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,875
Belldandy...

310
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,625
Yes, what is it?

311
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,708
I'm really sorry to have worried
you so much like I have...

312
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,875
But, I'll be done with all
of this tomorrow, okay?

313
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,125
I'm very glad to hear it.

314
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,500
You haven't said a thing,

315
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,958
even though I've been...
keeping secrets from you.

316
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,208
You have already told me

317
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
everything that you
were able to, correct?

318
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,833
Or have you possibly
been doing something

319
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,291
that you shouldn't have?

320
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,958
No, I haven't!

321
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,250
I see you've been wearing the
sweater I gave you every day.

322
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,708
Therefore, I am able to
rest easy every night

323
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,875
because I know you've 
worn the sweater yet again.

324
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,458
It is saying that our
feelings are still connected.

325
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,666
And so--

326
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,875
Eight O'clock!

327
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,416
Tomorrow night at eight!

328
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,833
I want you to wait for me in
front of the train station then.

329
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,375
At eight o'clock?

330
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,416
Yes, there's something there
I want to show you, Belldandy.

331
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,666
Right!

332
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,375
I did it!

333
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,208
Hey, you did such
a good job, kid,

334
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,541
I even threw in a little
extra for ya there.

335
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, thank you very much!
I've got it made!

336
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,583
Honestly, you're the
one who helped us out.

337
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,083
The end of the year's
always really hectic for us.

338
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,500
Let's get a move on, Keiichi.

339
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,083
Oh, right!

340
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,208
All right, Belldandy.

341
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,833
I'll be able to give
it to you really soon,

342
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,291
so just hang on
a little longer.

343
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,416
Wha?! It's gone!

344
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,166
And after I worked so hard
to earn enough money for it!

345
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,541
Are you sure this is the
one you wanted, Madam?

346
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,750
I guess.

347
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll... just put that
on my credit card...

348
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,375
AAAHH!

349
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,833
But, Sayoko, you don't
understand. That ring was...

350
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,250
What...?

351
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,875
Please don't tell me that
you've already bought it!

352
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,333
Yeah, and so what if I have...?

353
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,541
So that's it, is it?

354
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,958
Come on... Sayoko...

355
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,875
Please. I'm asking you to
let me buy that ring instead!

356
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,000
I see, so Keiichi would like to
buy a ring now, is that right?

357
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,458
Oh, wait!

358
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,041
Could it be you mean to give
it to me as a present...?

359
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,708
I'm so happy!

360
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,083
As if he'd really buy it for
a little trollop like YOU!

361
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,583
You see this...?
I'm begging you now.

362
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,291
I'll do anything
you want, please.

363
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,291
What the hell are you doing?!

364
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,500
Please, Sayoko!

365
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,625
Keiichi!

366
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,916
All right then.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What? You mean it?!

368
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,916
Not so fast...
There's one condition.

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,541
I want you to make up for
having spoiled my Christmas.

370
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,291
Look, Mommy! It's Santa!

371
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,125
So, why am I dressed
up like a reindeer?

372
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,583
I think it suits you.

373
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,125
Merry Christmas everyone!

374
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,750
It is Christmas time, so these
outfits make perfect sense.

375
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,291
You will shine them.

376
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,625
Are you really asking a goddess
to give you a shoeshine...?!

377
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,416
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

378
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's see...

379
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,750
Well, other than being a queen,
then perhaps I'm a devil, too.

380
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,833
So... what do you
want me to do anyway?

381
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,041
I think...

382
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,458
Waaah...! I lost
my balloon, Mommy!

383
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,500
I'll buy you a new
one, sweetheart.

384
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,791
Uh-uh! I like that one, mommy!

385
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,416
Why don't you go get it?

386
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,625
HUH?!

387
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,291
You're Santa, so you
should be comfortable

388
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,000
dealing with heights, right?

389
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,125
Now you're being unreasonable!

390
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,833
All right.

391
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,666
But... if I do get it down,

392
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,791
you'll let me have
the ring, right?

393
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,833
Fine! It's a deal.

394
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,541
I wonder where he is...

395
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,458
Please stop this, Keiichi...!

396
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,041
Why don't you just
let me get it for you?!

397
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,250
Mr. Keiichi!

398
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,458
Huh?!

399
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,458
It is too dangerous!
Please come back down!

400
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,916
Belldandy?!

401
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,583
Please come down now!

402
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,375
I'll be all right... Just wait
right there, Belldandy.

403
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,291
Be careful!

404
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,833
A little closer...
I've almost got it...

405
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,041
Ooooh!

406
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,375
Gotcha!

407
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,291
Hey, I did it, Belldandy...!

408
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,958
Whoa! AAAAHHH!

409
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,958
Oh, Spirit of the Wind who
summons the great tempest...

410
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,041
Air Bug Spiral!

411
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,375
Aaaahhh!

412
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,583
Oh... brother...

413
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,125
Mr. Keiichi!

414
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,000
Why would you ever go and
do such a reckless thing?!

415
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
The balloon...
It just flew away.

416
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,750
Huh?

417
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,583
I meant to buy you
a Christmas present,

418
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,000
but it looks like it's
not going to pan out...

419
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
after all that.

420
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,083
I am more concerned about you
than anything else, Mr. Keiichi!

421
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,125
I really did give it
my all this time

422
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,250
to try to show you
my feelings...

423
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,000
but, as usual, you ended up
having to save me once again.

424
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,791
I admit that it wasn't
going to be the same

425
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,750
as the hand-knitted
sweater you made for me,

426
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,083
but still, I was working
as hard as I could

427
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,333
to try and somehow give
shape to my true feelings...

428
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,500
but I've failed you again.

429
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,708
Mm-mm... it's not
like that at all.

430
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,750
You were working hard
and coming home late

431
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,500
exhausted every night...
because of me...

432
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,958
I want to be with you,
because that is how you are.

433
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,708
And that is why I love you
so much, Mr. Keiichi.

434
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,375
Here.

435
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,583
Huh?

436
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,041
That's... the ring...

437
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,833
Yeah, she decided
to give it over.

438
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,000
But she...

439
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,500
And in exchange,
she said she wants you to

440
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,666
provide some entertainment
at a party she's throwing.

441
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,458
HUH...?!

442
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,083
All right. Get on with it!

443
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,541
Is that...?

444
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,166
I thought it would
look good on you.

445
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,875
Oh, I love it!

446
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,958
Here, give me your hand.

447
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,708
All right!

448
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,666
Mr. Keiichi!

449
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,625
Hm? Snow?

450
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,250
Wow...

451
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,458
Thank you, my Santa Claus...

452
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,708
The goddess wishes for
happiness all over the world.

453
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,041
He wonders if it's okay for him

454
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,500
to have the goddess
all to himself.

455
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:13,208
Next time, "Ah! I Want to Fill
the World with Happiness."

456
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,541
Hey, lucky you, Hasegawa...
