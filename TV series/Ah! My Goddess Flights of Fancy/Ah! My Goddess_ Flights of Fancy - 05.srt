1
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm finally finished...

2
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,083
Great job!
You've done very well.

3
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,416
Hey Belldandy...

4
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,875
Sorry you have to come to
all my lectures with me.

5
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,250
There's no need to apologize.
I really do enjoy it.

6
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,500
Hm?

7
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,250
Because I learn so many
new things every time.

8
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,208
So I actually look
forward to coming to class.

9
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,958
Do you mean that?

10
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,291
You seem to be having fun, too.

11
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,916
Oh... do you think so?

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,958
Yes, I do!

13
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,500
But the reason it's fun
is because I'm with you.

14
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,375
Oh, Keiichi...

15
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,208
Yes, Belldandy...

16
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,541
Aahh!

17
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,750
All right, it's time for some
more fun with the Auto Club!

18
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,625
So let's all give
it our best shot!

19
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,041
For the Nekomi Tech
Auto Club! Oh, yeah!

20
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,291
Why do I have a bad
feeling about this?

21
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,625
If you got a problem with
your car or motorcycle

22
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,708
why don'cha let the
Auto Club handle it?

23
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,125
We are now
providing our expert...

24
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,708
Is the Club completely
broke again, Tamiya?

25
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,708
Yeah, and we gotta put
together a killer machine

26
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,583
in time for next
month's drag race.

27
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,625
C'mon, Morisato. Help us out!

28
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,416
Our rates are twenty to
thirty percent below average!

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,916
We'll get the job done...

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,583
This approach is driving
customers away...

31
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,958
We're good, we're fast,
and we're cheap!

32
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,041
What more could you ask for?!

33
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,333
Um, Keiichi?

34
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,916
Huh?

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,250
All we need to do is find people
who are having trouble, correct?

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,208
Well, basically, yeah...

37
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,125
Let me... try.

38
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,500
You'll find someone?

39
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,916
Ah...! Someone's having
trouble over there.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,291
Cool!

41
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,333
So you're saying you
can't open the door

42
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,875
because you lost the key?

43
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,166
Get it open it quick!

44
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,041
My event's gonna
start any minute!

45
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,291
This isn't exactly something the
Auto Club normally handles...

46
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,916
You wanna help people
in trouble, don't you?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,375
It's perfectly okay.

48
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,125
Please leave this
matter to the Auto Club.

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,541
Guys, that's a little, uh...

50
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,375
Not bad, eh?

51
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,083
I knew you'd be able to help!

52
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
I think maybe we'd
better stick to matters

53
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,041
that actually involve
cars from now on...

54
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,833
All right. Very well then.

55
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey. Someone slashed my tire.
I was wondering if--

56
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,416
Ah! It's you guys again!

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,166
Unforgivable!

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
--Let's do it, Dai!
--Right on!

59
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,625
Hey!

60
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,083
There ya go, pal.

61
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,125
Hey, it was no sweat, man...
Now, regarding our fee...

62
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,500
Like hell I'm paying you!

63
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,291
--Stop!
--Why, you...

64
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,958
Wait a minute!

65
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,416
Dammit... he gave me
the slip... Oh well!

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,750
I suppose Den can hunt him
down for the money later!

67
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,750
Or maybe we'll just
send young Morisato.

68
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,375
--Well, why not?!
--Huh?

69
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,416
Why not just leave this old
thing on campus, hm?

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,750
My car would have us there
in a flash--in style!

71
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,083
Come now, Satoko.

72
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,416
How long are you going to
drive that thing around?

73
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,458
I bought it when I was working
my very first part-time job...

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,208
so I'm kind of attached to it...

75
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,000
Look, it's simply
not appropriate

76
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,208
for a person of
your social status.

77
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,666
But it still works.

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,916
But, it isn't
working right now.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,125
Come. Stop this silliness
and let me take you home.

80
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,708
But, I...

81
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Say, how about I buy you a new
scooter on the way back, okay?

82
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,958
Huh?!

83
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,666
It's quite all right.
There's no need to thank me.

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,541
You see, it's no different
than if I were to go out

85
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,291
and just buy you an outfit.

86
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,666
And if you find
you don't like it,

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,291
I'll just buy you another one.

88
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,041
One a day, for three days
or ten--whatever it takes!

89
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,250
I could never let you do that!

90
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,708
Think nothing of it. Now...

91
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm telling you,
I really don't--

92
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,208
Geez... you've just got
some worn out spark plugs,

93
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,500
that's all.

94
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,333
This plug I've got's
the wrong number,

95
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,291
but the reach looks like
it's close enough...

96
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,958
What do you think
you're doing?!

97
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,458
I just finished telling her
that I'd buy her a new one!

98
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,750
You know, I have no respect
for people who just

99
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,916
toss out perfectly
good vehicles.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,833
Furthermore, I don't
buy that crap about

101
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,541
money being able to
solve all your problems.

102
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,083
I could fix this kind of stuff
until the cows come home.

103
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay! All done!

104
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,333
Aaah...!

105
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,791
Uh...

106
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,708
Uh, let's see if the
engine starts okay...

107
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,958
Ta-da!

108
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,166
That's great!

109
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,333
You take good care of
this thing, don'cha?

110
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,583
What a lucky bike!

111
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,208
Thanks so much for your help!

112
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,458
Aah...!

113
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,541
It's nothin' really.

114
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,333
I'm just doing my job as a--

115
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,000
an active member
of the Auto Club...

116
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,791
so don't worry about
it... See ya!

117
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,000
Please wait...

118
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,791
Well, I'm finally finished...

119
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,541
You've done very well.

120
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,791
Hey Belldandy...

121
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,625
I'm sorry you have to
come to all my lectures.

122
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,083
There's no need to
apologize. It's fun.

123
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,041
Because I get to learn
so many new things here,

124
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,541
I look forward to coming.

125
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,125
Really, you mean that?

126
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,291
Of course I do.

127
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,958
Lucky you...
Man, you got it made...

128
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,375
Otaki?!

129
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,666
Lucky. You're so darn lucky!

130
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,541
So lucky...! So lucky...

131
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,041
Otaki!

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,708
Here you go!

133
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,208
Thanks a lot...

134
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,041
Wow, you really did go all out
with the food today, huh?

135
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,541
I'm sorry...!

136
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,625
You said you liked it, so I
guess I got carried away...

137
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,000
Have I made too much?

138
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,708
Uh, no it's fine! I've had
quite an appetite lately...

139
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,125
I'm so glad.

140
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,291
I wish they'd take their
romantic comedy somewhere else.

141
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,166
So lucky...! So darn lucky!

142
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,541
Lucky you, Morisato, lucky you!

143
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,541
Um... Would you like to
have some, too, Otaki?

144
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,791
Please go ahead, if you'd like.

145
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,958
Uh, no thank you.

146
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,666
Huh?! What's the matter...?

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,625
You normally just
dig right into it!

148
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,583
You're a lucky guy, Morisato.

149
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,291
To have a girl who'll stay
by your side and all...

150
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,875
I'll have to take you up
on the eats some other time.

151
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,166
Wait, hold on a second, Otaki!

152
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,375
Huh?

153
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,208
Who is it? Door's open, y'know.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
Uh... So, what's wrong?

155
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,333
Don't tell me it
stopped working again?!

156
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,666
--Here!
--Huh?!

157
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,375
I made this to thank
you for yesterday...

158
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,083
I hope you enjoy it.
See you later!

159
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,541
Hey, wait! Hold up!

160
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,583
Could that have been
what I think it was?

161
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,750
Yes, I believe he's in
love with her, isn't he?

162
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,250
Huh?!

163
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,333
Y'know, that's what
I think it is, too!

164
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,208
That big furry whose
only interests

165
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,666
are machines and lucky
charms is in LOVE?!

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,083
I got it!

167
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,166
Huh?

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,041
Satoko Yamano:
Electronics Club member

169
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,916
and First-year Fine Arts major.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
Her dad's the
university president.

171
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,000
She's a good student, and
her meek, charming demeanor

172
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,125
has made her popular
among the upperclassmen.

173
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,083
Her measurements are 35-22-32.

174
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,791
Needless to say,
a far cry from my own...

175
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,125
But that doesn't mean...

176
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,541
My measurement are on par
with an eighth-grader's!

177
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,500
Delicious! Absolutely
fantastic, Satoko!

178
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,375
Ah...

179
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,875
Otaki?

180
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,708
Morisato, I've gotta
ask for your advice.

181
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,291
About what?

182
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,083
Uh, never mind! It's cool!

183
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,458
Are you sure?

184
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,375
Look, I said it's cool!

185
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,833
Let fortune smile on you.

186
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,625
Huh?

187
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,958
What the heck was that?

188
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,291
I am certain that your feelings
will come across to her now.

189
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,125
Hm? But, I'm not,
uh... I don't...

190
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,875
Something good awaits
you in that direction!

191
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,666
Something good, huh?

192
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,083
So, you say there's something
good waiting around here?

193
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,291
Look, there it is!

194
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,458
Huh?

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,708
You mean this lottery?

196
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,250
That's right.

197
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,250
But do you actually have any
tickets that you can turn in?

198
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,041
--Yeah.
--Huh?!

199
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,458
That's right. I've got some.

200
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,333
I still have 'em from when
I shopped here one time.

201
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,833
All right, you win!

202
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,750
Tickets for two to
the amusement park!

203
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,916
I can't believe I friggin' won!

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,958
But what the heck am I gonna
do with these things anyway?

205
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,833
Why don't you invite Satoko
to go along with you?

206
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,833
WHAT?!

207
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,666
Just to pay her back for the
lunch she made you, of course.

208
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,333
Oh okay, I get it!

209
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,083
So you are in love with her,
aren't ya, big guy?

210
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,208
But how do I go about
asking her to come with me?

211
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,333
It'll be fine.

212
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,416
Huh?

213
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,583
What'd we come to
the campus for?

214
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,208
Yeah, and what are we
doing at the Art Studio?

215
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,583
Why don't you go inside now

216
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,583
and try speaking to
Satoko in person?

217
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,833
Ah! There's no way
I can do that!

218
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,875
I'm sure it would show her
how you really feel about her.

219
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,291
Please, you must try to
have greater confidence

220
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,458
in your feelings.

221
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,500
Uh, I'll try...

222
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,750
I, um, uh...

223
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,375
Oh, it's you...

224
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,500
Yeah, hey there.

225
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,791
Um, lovely weather we're
having today, isn't it?

226
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,208
Ah... come on! Just get
to the point already!

227
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,875
The lunch box...

228
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,500
It was delicious!
Thanks a million.

229
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,125
I'm glad to hear that.

230
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,083
Uh... So anyhow,

231
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,625
maybe it's kinda silly,
but to show my thanks,

232
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,333
I was thinking, if you like,
maybe we could, uh...

233
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,833
What the heck?

234
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,208
Huh? I thought it
was right here...

235
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,291
You can do it, Otaki!

236
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,458
Uh...?

237
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,958
What's this?

238
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,500
I... won those in
a lottery downtown,

239
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,666
but I don't have
anyone to go with.

240
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,333
So, like, I don't know if
you'd be up for it or not,

241
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,041
but I was thinking maybe,
if you're not busy,

242
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,875
you'd want to come with me?

243
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,541
That's the place that
just opened, isn't it?

244
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,166
Of course... I would love to!

245
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,666
Really?!

246
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,791
Yes. If it's with you.

247
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,583
Thank goodness...

248
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,208
Kinda hot out today, isn't it?

249
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,125
You think so? I heard it's
supposed to snow tomorrow.

250
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,625
Really? Well, that's funny

251
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,541
cause I'm so hot
I can barely breathe!

252
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,041
Should we go try out
one of the rides then?

253
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,333
All we've done so far
is walk around the park.

254
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,583
Oh, yeah. You're right!
Now let's see...

255
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,750
Oh... brother.

256
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,333
Hey, Keiichi, why
the heck did I have to

257
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,708
come along with you guys, huh?

258
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,083
What do you expect
me to do about it?

259
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,291
He asked all of us
to come with him.

260
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,208
Well, that's easy
enough for you to say.

261
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,916
I mean, you did get to come
with Belldandy, after all.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,458
Morisato!

263
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,791
I don't know what
I'm doing here, man!

264
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,291
Stop stressing out!

265
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,958
Just try to find a fun-looking
ride for right now, okay?

266
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,500
That way seems like
it might be good.

267
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,833
--Huh?!
--Huh?

268
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,000
Head to your left.

269
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,666
Uh...? To the left?
Oh! That's the uh...

270
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,375
Oh, I see...
Do you want to go in there?

271
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,041
Um, well, I didn't really...

272
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,666
It looks like fun!

273
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,916
Huh?!

274
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,708
Meow!

275
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,083
Woof!

276
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,541
Okay, hold still now.

277
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,291
You know, Otaki, I really
do love this sort of thing.

278
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,375
Honestly, Satoko?! Because
I love this stuff, too!

279
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,625
Do you really mean that?!

280
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,125
Arf!

281
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,416
I've got a whole load of these
outfits back at my place.

282
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,833
You think I could
come see them some time?

283
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,000
Woof!

284
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,333
Okay, you two.
Just hold it right there.

285
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,125
They're really getting into it.

286
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,333
Yeah, and it looks like

287
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,625
she's just as much
of a weirdo as he is.

288
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,125
That was so much fun!

289
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,250
Yeah, so what do you
think we oughta do next ?

290
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,083
How about that one over there?

291
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,291
Okay!

292
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,333
So tell me, what kind of
turnout have you been getting?

293
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,875
We've been open two weeks now,
and we're operating at

294
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,708
eighty percent above the
forecast attendance level.

295
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,583
Superb... This is certainly
a fitting new business venture

296
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,166
for the Aoshima
conglomerate... Uh?

297
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,458
Hey! Let's go on
the merry-go-round.

298
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,375
And the tea cups
after that, okay?

299
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,125
Sure! You got it!

300
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,791
What are those two
doing here together?!

301
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,416
Is there something
the matter, sir?

302
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,125
Obviously! Stop the
merry-go-round at once!

303
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,333
Huh?!

304
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,916
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,875
But we had to close to conduct
some emergency maintenance, sir.

306
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,250
But it was working fine
until just a minute ago!

307
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,958
I'm telling you,
it's an emergency...

308
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,125
It's no big deal, Otaki.
Let's go to the next ride.

309
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,583
All right, Satoko...

310
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,041
You're closed, too?

311
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,750
Sorry, we have to conduct
emergency maintenance.

312
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,708
But doesn't this seem
a little weird to you?

313
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,416
We just need to do
some maintenance!

314
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,125
Don't gimme that crap!

315
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,458
Huh?

316
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,041
Well, there we go,
it's working now!

317
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,916
Just a little trouble
with the electronics.

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

319
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,083
C'mon, let's go ride it, Satoko.

320
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,083
Sure!

321
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,916
Why is that damn
thing working...?!

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,541
Get it shut down
or you're fired!

323
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,458
But I'm positive I sent them
the orders to stop it, sir.

324
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,458
Damn it!

325
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,500
Ya know, I was kinda worried
there for a minute...

326
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,791
It certainly does seem like

327
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,875
someone is trying to
interfere with their date.

328
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,083
Eh?

329
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,000
What the hell kind of
management system...

330
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,208
Toshiyuki?!

331
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,708
Oh, that's right.

332
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,041
This amusement park is part
of the Aoshima Conglomerate.

333
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,375
But why on earth would Toshiyuki
be getting in Otaki's way?

334
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,458
Because, unlike me,
Satoko is loved by everyone.

335
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,666
Huh?

336
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,833
Perhaps we should
go to the university.

337
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,625
Huh?

338
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,375
Is the date over already?

339
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,541
Please tell Otaki that
it might be a good idea

340
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,083
for them to go to
the campus now.

341
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,875
Uh... Sure...

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
Dai...

343
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,458
You live it up
for me, too, man...

344
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,708
So, you think this
looks all right?

345
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,833
It's totally adorable!

346
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm sorry to ask you to
come along to help me

347
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,666
with a project I
had forgotten about.

348
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,666
Ah, it's nothing! I'm glad
to be helping you out!

349
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,958
But you don't have to
single out only one of 'em.

350
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
I brought a bunch
along with me...

351
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,583
That's awesome...

352
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,875
It's actually really
inspiring to me.

353
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,708
I'm so glad you're giving
me a hand with this, Otaki!

354
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,916
You really mean it?!

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
Yes!

356
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,333
Ha ha!

357
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,666
Hey, Satoko...

358
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,791
you don't think that
I'm some kind of weirdo

359
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,125
or anything like that, do you?

360
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,083
No, I don't think that at all.

361
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,875
You've been great, and
if it weren't for you,

362
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,833
I couldn't finish
this project.

363
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,625
Oh, Satoko!

364
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,208
Ah ah! The model's
not supposed to move!

365
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,583
Yes, ma'am!

366
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,791
They seem to be
enjoying themselves.

367
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,958
Well, I guess you could say
our work is done here.

368
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,958
No freakin' way!

369
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,458
I am not going to keep letting
things go so smoothly for them!

370
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,500
Hey Belldandy, I'm sorry you
have to come to all my lectures.

371
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,666
But why are you apologizing,
Keiichi? I really do enjoy it.

372
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,166
Oh... do you really
mean that, Belldandy?

373
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,166
I do. And from
what I can tell,

374
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,916
you seem to be having fun, too.

375
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,416
Really... you think so?

376
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,583
Yes, I really do.

377
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,083
Oh, Belldandy...

378
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,458
Keiichi...

379
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,208
--Morisato!
--AAAHHH!

380
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,375
Satoko invited me
over to her place!

381
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,416
Wow! That's awesome, Otaki!

382
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,166
But I'm not used to doing
this kind of stuff, man!

383
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,250
Well, I'm certainly
not used to it!

384
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,291
But you have been goin'
steady with Belldandy

385
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,666
for a whole year, dude!

386
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,500
First, I think it would be a
good idea to come across

387
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,250
as clean-cut as
you possibly can.

388
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,125
Furthermore, you should behave
like a chivalrous knight,

389
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,375
a perfect gentleman.

390
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,000
Come across as clean-cut
and chivalrous, huh?

391
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,833
You got it, babe!

392
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,791
How about this? Satoko
thought this one was cool!

393
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,625
She said "like" a
chivalrous knight...

394
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,416
Hmph...! Then how about this?!

395
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,791
Hey Otaki.

396
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,000
Why don't you try something
a little more normal?

397
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,916
I really think Satoko would
like something like this more.

398
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,541
Are you positive this
getup will be okay?

399
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,333
Wouldn't the suit of
armor look better?

400
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,875
Listen! I'm telling
you it's fine!

401
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,791
When you arrive, give her this
bouquet of flowers, and say,

402
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,958
"thank you so very much
for inviting me to your home."

403
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,250
Now, do you think you
can remember that?

404
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,166
Thanks, Belldandy!

405
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,833
All right, then... I'm off!

406
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,666
I told you the
armor was no good!

407
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,541
Well, Satoko thinks it's cool!

408
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,041
This really sucks!

409
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,000
At this rate, he'll steal
Satoko away from me...!

410
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,791
What the hell am I going to do?

411
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,208
What are you doing?

412
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,458
Huh?

413
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,291
What on earth are you
doing back there anyway?

414
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,833
That's it! I have
a favor to ask of you!

415
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,333
A favor?

416
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,333
Man... that's one
big-ass house... Mm...

417
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,541
Yamano Residence.

418
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,958
Ah, right!

419
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,541
Thank you so very much for
inviting me to your home!

420
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,250
Um, this bouquet is just a token
I have to offer you, so I...

421
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,750
My, my, how thoughtful of you.

422
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
Satoko, you sound like
you might've caught a cold

423
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,833
or something, I... UH!

424
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,666
Ugh, I wonder if
this is gonna work...

425
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,541
Toshiyuki...? And Sayoko, too?!

426
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,958
What're you doing here?

427
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,375
Ah, I've been expecting
you, Sayoko...

428
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,666
Is this the young man you
wanted to introduce to me?

429
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,708
That's right, President Yamano.

430
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,958
President?

431
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,083
Aoshima, Four Wheels
Club president.

432
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,375
Oh, don't tell me--
you mean you didn't know

433
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:58,041
that Satoko's father is the
president of Nekomi Tech?

434
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,041
Otaki!

435
00:18:59,125 --> 00:18:59,916
Huh?

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,166
Satoko!

437
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,500
Oh, is this man here to see you?

438
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,708
Yes, Dad. This is Otaki,
from the Auto Club.

439
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,333
The Auto Club?

440
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,000
It's very nice to meet you.

441
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,208
Yes, the infamous Auto Club.

442
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,583
--Their poor reputation...
--What's that?!

443
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,500
was my reason for creating
the Four Wheels Club.

444
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,833
As a matter of fact,

445
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,625
that's what we're here to
talk to you about today.

446
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,083
Now that Nekomi Tech has
the Four Wheels Club,

447
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,750
don't you think we should
just disband the Auto Club?

448
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,583
What the hell are
you talking about?!

449
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,791
Oh, my. Perhaps we should talk
about its reputation on campus?

450
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,083
But if we take
that into account,

451
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,125
simply disbanding the club
may not be enough...

452
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,291
Otaki...

453
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,708
The situation's starting to
look pretty grim over there.

454
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

455
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,833
Because Otaki still has plenty
of good fortune surrounding him.

456
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,875
I'll be back in a minute!

457
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,500
Ugh... It smells like
something's burning.

458
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,625
Oh, no! I left the
food on the stove!

459
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,583
Huh?!

460
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,041
--Man, this is bad!
--Get some water!

461
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,500
Grease fire.

462
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,166
Aoshima, have you got a fire
extinguisher in your car?

463
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,708
How the hell should I know?!

464
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,666
Leave it to me to be without
my tools at a time like this!

465
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,583
Quick! Get me that water!

466
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,791
But you said water was no good.

467
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,083
I'll soak my coat and
throw it over the pot.

468
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,291
All we need to do is just
throw some water on there

469
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,333
and be done with it!

470
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,375
--No, don't!
--Shut up!

471
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,125
Aaaah!

472
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,500
Look out!

473
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,958
Satoko!

474
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,208
If this keeps up...

475
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,708
Sleep now, oh spirits of flame!

476
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,500
Let your power slip
into profound silence!

477
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,791
Aaah...!

478
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Oh... the fire's out...

479
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,041
You're not hurt, are you,
Otaki? Are you all right?

480
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,583
Yeah, I'm okay.

481
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,958
But, look... your back is...

482
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,125
Oh, I forgot.

483
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,958
Armor.

484
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,125
Thank goodness...

485
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,458
--I like you!
--Hm?

486
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,958
Now that's what I expect
of a Nekomi Tech student!

487
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,666
That's the kind of nerve
and decision-making

488
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,208
a mechanic needs to have!

489
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,166
On the other hand,
what about you, mister?

490
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,833
Back in my day, I never
let a car stay in the pit

491
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,000
for more than
thirty seconds, tops!

492
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,250
You mean you used to
work on cars, also?!

493
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,500
You're darn right!

494
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,791
In fact, they called me
"Ol' Magic Hands" Sho!

495
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,000
WHAT...?! You're the
legendary magic hands...

496
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,375
You mean a young kid like you
has actually heard about me?!

497
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,166
Yeah! I know all about you!

498
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,958
Hell, the 1975 'Suzuka 8 Hours'
is legendary in our circle!

499
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,416
Damn it all!

500
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,541
Looks like everything
here turned out all right.

501
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,916
Yes.

502
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,666
You've done very well today.

503
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,000
Hey, Belldandy...

504
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,916
I'm sorry you have to
come to all my lectures.

505
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,875
There's no need to apologize,
Keiichi. I really do enjoy it.

506
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,500
As long as I can be with you!

507
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,458
Oh, Belldandy...

508
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,333
Morisato!

509
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,791
What in the world do
you want this time?

510
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,000
--You've gotta help me!
--Ah, there you are, Otaki!

511
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,500
Check this out.

512
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,250
Now here's a good one for ya!
Just take a look at this!

513
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,166
I never would have guessed
that you're a collector, too!

514
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,625
No, really, that's
totally okay, sir!

515
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,875
Don't be shy, son.

516
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,833
After all, I'm going
to be your father soon!

517
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,250
Huh...?!

518
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,583
I'm so terribly sorry, Otaki!

519
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry my Dad's so pushy!

520
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,333
You're right, Satoko.
You talk to him about it.

521
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,541
After all, he is going
to be your husband!

522
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,916
Dad, stop it!

523
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
C'mon, Otaki. Try this one on.

524
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,666
Wait! Hold on a minute,
President Yamano!

525
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,666
It's not president to you, son!

526
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,916
Call me "Dad!"

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,625
Heeeelp meee!

528
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,416
There is someone who wants to
express her feelings for you.

529
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,916
However, those feelings
draw her towards darkness

530
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,791
before she even realizes it.

531
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,833
Next time, "Ah!
Is That Jealousy?"

532
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,458
Is this one of those
so-called "love letters?!"
