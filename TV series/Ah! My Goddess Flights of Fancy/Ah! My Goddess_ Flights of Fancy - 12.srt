1
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,625
Go get 'em, Pastry Man!

2
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,125
Oh...

3
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,166
Ah! We were just getting
to the best part!

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,041
This set's
practically an antique.

5
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,250
Let's see...

6
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,375
Y'know Skuld, sometimes
it's a good idea

7
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,666
to give it a break now and then.

8
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,208
So, what should we do?

9
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,041
The rerun of that samurai
drama will be on soon.

10
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,458
Waah! My Fangs of
the Inner Palace reruns

11
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,041
are the only thing that
make my life worth living!

12
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,125
Don't you think that's
exaggerating a little bit...?

13
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,500
I worry it might make Urd cry.

14
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,875
That is a possibility.

15
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,875
Plum blossoms...

16
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,583
Here, this is in return
for the gift you gave me.

17
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,208
Do you like it?

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,541
This ring can only be
found in the Northlands.

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,666
Hey...! You could at least
act a little excited.

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,375
Urd.

21
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,416
Yeah?

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,708
It's been on my mind
for a while now.

23
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,416
We can't continue like this.

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,583
Huh?!

25
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,833
I believe I'll be going
on a long journey.

26
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,250
But why now...? I mean,
this is so sudden!

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,958
You're a wonderful woman,

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,416
but I question whether
we should be spending

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,666
so much idle time
together, like this.

30
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,833
What are you talking about?!

31
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,375
Aren't you the one
who said to me that,

32
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,291
any time I spend with you is
time that shall not go to waste?

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,791
And I meant what I said,
but the thing is...

34
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,208
...that was then.

35
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,166
We must live each day
progressing toward our dreams.

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,291
That is why I am
going on a journey...

37
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,541
in pursuit of an eternally
romantic ideal.

38
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,708
Please understand.

39
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,375
I don't understand at all!

40
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,208
Farewell!

41
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,000
Ah... ah!

42
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,291
Hey, wait! You can't
fly, can you?

43
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,708
--AAAH!
--Troubadour!

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,166
I wonder why I'm
thinking about him now?

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,625
That dumb jerk who left me...

46
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,458
She's looking
unusually gloomy.

47
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,166
I'm afraid she gets like this
every year, around this time.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,958
Hey, I wonder if all
those plum blossoms

49
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,041
have anything to do with it.

50
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,166
You see, it's because
plum blossoms

51
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,958
carry a very special meaning
for our beloved Urd.

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,375
Oh, I didn't know that...

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,250
Looking back now...

54
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,625
it's a good thing
I broke up with him.

55
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,916
Well, enough about him...

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,708
I think it's just about
time for me to watch

57
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,250
those Fangs of the
Inner Palace reruns.

58
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,333
Hm?

59
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,250
This cloud of blossoms...

60
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,083
No, it couldn't be...

61
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,166
But there's... no mistaking it!

62
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,833
The plum tree spirit...

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,458
Troubadour!

64
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,333
I've been searching
for you... Urd...

65
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,291
Who is that?

66
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,625
Troubadour...

67
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:07,083
a plum tree spirit who
was once Urd's sweetheart.

68
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,250
But I heard they
broke up long ago.

69
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,875
Why would he be here now?

70
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,666
I have traveled
across great distances

71
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,625
and risked life and limb so that

72
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,041
we might once
again share our love.

73
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,500
You should leave.

74
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,125
Who do you think you are
showing up here now?

75
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,916
We were both... so young
back in those days.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,875
Hey, pal, I'm STILL young!

77
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,791
Yes, of course you are.

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:39,458
Your beauty is eternal... just
like... my feelings for you!

79
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:48,708
♪ Oh, Urd... my love!
Hear my song from above! ♪

80

I've told you before...

81
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,375
I can't stand that garbage!

82
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,458
AAAHH! Hey! Cut that out!

83
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,666
A man!

84
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,125
Keiichi...! Ah!

85
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,708
What is the meaning of this?

86
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,208
What, may I ask,
is a goddess

87
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,500
doing in the company
of a mere mortal?!

88
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,916
Excuse me, but I'd like to
know who you think YOU are

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
crashing into my home
all of a sudden!

90
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,125
You'd better watch
your tongue, boy!

91
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,875
You've got a lot of nerve
to speak to me so brazenly.

92
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,708
I think you're the one
who's got a lot of nerve,

93
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,416
to drop in on us without
even saying who you are!

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,041
All land is but a part of the
path I tread on my journey!

95
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,166
That's ridiculous!
Does being supernatural

96
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,041
entitle you to do
whatever you want?

97
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,375
Silence! You lowly human...!
Don't trifle with me!

98
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,833
Is that any kind of way
for a deity to talk?!

99
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,041
Right now...

100
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,166
I am obliged to stay
at this man's house.

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,500
What are you talking about?!

102
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,416
You're living under
the same roof as this man?!

103
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,041
Well, that's pretty
much what it amounts to.

104
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,416
Grr!

105
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
Hey...! What'd I do?

106
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,583
Unforgivable!
I will not tolerate you

107
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,500
associating with my Urd...

108

00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
That is enough!

115
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,291
AAH!

116
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Wow! She sure didn't hold back.

117
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,500
For cryin' out loud...

118
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,375
I realize he probably
comes off as a total flake,

119
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,791
but his songs of malediction

120
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,208
have an intensity on the level
of a First Class deity.

121
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,000
But, isn't this guy
kinda like your, um...

122
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,125
Well... Back in the past we...

123
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,083
we dated, but only
for a little while.

124
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,750
Oh, yeah? Wow! Tell us more!

125
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,750
It was only for a little while!

126
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,833
I guess it's not
so unusual, right?

127
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,875
I mean, nothing too
surprising about Urd

128
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,000
having had a
boyfriend or two.

129
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,000
More importantly...

130
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
I think you better watch
your back, Keiichi.

131
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,833
Huh?

132
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,416
He is the violent type...
and very jealous...

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
I wonder what became
of all the guys

134
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,583
who ever made a move on me.

135
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,666
I bet it's not pretty.

136
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,166
AAAAAHHH!

137
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,958
Troubadour's songs
of malediction

138
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,250
have made caterpillars
and scaly insects

139
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,333
burst forth from the bodies of
men who've made passes at me.

140
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,416
♪ Bugs and bugs and bugs... ♪

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,666
Well, in that case,
I'd appreciate it

142
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,750
if he'd peacefully withdraw...

143
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,916
Look, just don't say
anything careless

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,291
that would provoke him.

145
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,916
I don't think I've
made careless remarks

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,166
that I should worry about!

147
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,083
Troubadour is the kind
of man who won't stop

148
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,416
once he's made up his mind,

149
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Well, I guess the two
of you are a lot alike.

150
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,416
At least in that respect.

151
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,625
--Ugh...
--Keiichi!

152
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,625
Yeah, they really are alike.

153
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,125
Still, you haven't seen him
for a long time, have you?

154
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,583
I just think... Maybe you
should hear what he has to say.

155
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,875
--Oh!
--Aaah!

156
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,791
Ah...! He recovered!

157
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,500
Mortal...! I challenge
you to a duel.

158
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,250
And after I strike you down,
Urd will be mine!

159
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,583
If you think yourself a man,

160
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,458
you will accept my challenge
and fall gracefully!

161
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,958
So falling is a foregone
conclusion, huh?

162
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,458
I definitely believe
he's Urd's ex boyfriend.

163
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,291
Mm-hm...

164
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:14,291
Well, he certainly is very
passionate though, isn't he?

165
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,666
So tell me...

166
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,125
did you ever find that
golden nightingale thing?

167
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,333
Ah-ha... so you
remembered that? Good...

168
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,625
The golden nightingale...

169
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,083
It seems that it has
somehow lost its way

170
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,708
and wandered to Earth.

171
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,958
No kidding?

172
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,416
Then I found out that
you were on Earth, too.

173
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,708
Ah...!

174
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,375
If this is not fate,
then I don't know what is!

175
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,666
It's not fate at all.
It's coincidence.

176
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,250
So, go find your nightingale,

177
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,333
and get your butt
back to Heaven.

178
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
That was harsh.

179
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,458
C'mon now...
Don't be like that...

180
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,375
Perhaps one of my songs
would make you reconsider...

181
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,750
Not interested.

182
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,750
It's a song that you
told me you loved.

183
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,250
I don't remember that.

184
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,125
That cannot be...
Won't you please listen?

185
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,375
Forget it!

186
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,041
GAAAAAAH!

187
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,041

--You know what?
--Huh?

189
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,208
I'm not so petty
as to waste my time

190
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,333
staying attached to something
that I've already let go of!

191
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,041

194
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,166
My, that was a beautiful song...

195
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,166
If she'd only listen to it!

196
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,375
Poor Urd...

197
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,708
Of course it was
a beautiful song.

198
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,750
Huh?

199
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,875
But why won't it
get through to Urd?

200
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,666
Even though I love
her so much...

201
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,541
Well, you see, the thing is...

202
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,041
Urd hasn't seen you
for a very long time,

203
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,208
so I think it's just that

204
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,166
she has simply become
a little stubborn.

205
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,166
So try not to be
discouraged, okay?

206
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,333
You're saying I should show her

207
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,166
even stronger proof
of my love, right?!

208
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,958
That's right. I'm sure it will
convey your feelings to her.

209
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,375
All right! I need to
release a new single!

you is... infinite!

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,333
Y'know, he doesn't seem like
such a bad guy, I guess,

216
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,583
but it might be a problem

217
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,625
if he's gonna stay
around here, like this.

218
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,791
I suppose things will be pretty
lively around here, won't they?

219
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,416
I think they're pretty
lively as it is.

220
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,291
Hey Urd... why'd you
guys break up anyway?

221
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,916
That's not important,
just fix the TV...

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,750
and hurry up with it
already, will ya?

223
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,500
But I wanna know why!

224
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,875
If you don't tell me,
I won't fix the TV!

225
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,916
Oh, man... She really
eats this stuff up...

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,666
Tell me! Come on!

227
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,291
He found a dream beyond me...

228
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,583
That's all there is to it...

229
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,458
You see, I want a man...

230
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,500
who'll have eyes for me
only and nothing else...

231
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,333
Troubadour couldn't
be that for me.

232
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,875
But why didn't you
go along with him

233
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,708
to help him fulfill his dream?

234
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,250
Because... I was not a
necessary part of his dreams.

235
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,583
That's why.

236
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,666
Too bad I couldn't have been
rid of him once and for all, eh?

237
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,041
Maybe so...

238
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,875
Okay, it's all fixed!

239
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,875
It was just some solder that
came off the board, that's all.

240
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,625
All right! Nice work, kid.

241
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,458
And now, in the
spotlight this week...

242
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,291
The minstrel of
love... Troubadour!

243
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,750
Aaaaaaghh!

244
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,250
Thank you for coming
all the way from Heaven

245
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,458
to be with us tonight!

247
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,791
Well, without any further ado...

248
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,291
What's he doing
on a music show?

249
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,708
...which he will now
sing in Japanese.

was singing about?

right on-the-nose, aren't they?

Urd, you've gotta
do something...

I wanted to prove the
depth of my love for you!

274
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,375
And did you think seeing
you do something like this

275
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,708
would fill me with joy?

276
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,458
You mean you're not

00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,458
He's a traveler. He'll be fine!

321
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
Why don't you stop the tough
girl act and get back together?

322
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,666
AH?!

323
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
Hmm...

324
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,125
Urd!

325
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:19,958
Urd...

326
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,750
Time for a bath!

327
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,916
But she just took one before!

328
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,666
He's not the kind of
guy who'd just give up

329
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,541
and return to
Heaven now, is he?

330
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,958
What could he possibly be up to?

331
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,833
Does he really think
that I would just...

332
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,083
No way. He'd never...

333
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:40,791
Mm!

334
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,333
Eh...

335
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,208
What am I doing?
I just took a bath earlier.

336
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,333
What are you doing in here?!

337
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,125
Oh, well, no biggie.

338
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,458
Hey, Keiichi, how about I scrub
your back just this once?

339
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,708
Huh?! No, no, that's okay!

340
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,166
I mean, what if Belldandy
walked in on us right now?

341
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,041
Don't worry! It's not like
I'm going to do anything bad.

342
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,125
It's already plenty bad!

343
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,625
Is it?

344
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,708
Now, don't tell me a little
thing like this would cause

345
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,166
you and Belldandy
any kind of trouble.

346
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,666
Come on! C'mon...!

347
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,541
--Cut it out, Urd!
--Listen up...!

348
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,833
This time I will
capture your he--- Mm!

349
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,166
WAAAAAAAAAHH!

350
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,583
So that's how it is...?!

351
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,500
You ARE involved
with Urd after all!

352
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,083
I will not hear of this!

353
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,916
I knew something was wrong when
I realized you had no contract,

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,791
but still weren't
returning to Heaven!

355
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,375
How many times do
I have to tell you

356
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,000
to get a handle on that
jealousy of yours, Troubadour?

357
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,250
It's not jealousy...!
It's an expression of my love!

358
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
Prepare to die, mortal!

359
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, you idiot...!

360
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,541
--AAAAAGGHH!
--Keiichi!

361
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,583
♪ Bugs and bugs and bugs and
bugs and bugs and bugs... ♪

362
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,958
Keiichi!

363
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,208
Uh.

364
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,416
Uh...

365
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,625
Now the tables are
turned, my friend!

366
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,375
This is your comeuppance
for tricking Urd!

367
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,541
--Keiichi...
--Belldandy!

368
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:01,083
Just wait! The end of this
song... will be the end of YOU!

369
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,958
If only would've told me, Urd,

370
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,208
I'd would've have come
in to help Keiichi, too!

371
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,708
I didn't expect her
to go that route.

372
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,875
Please make sure you tell
me from now on, all right?

373
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,208
Please stop being
so mean to Keiichi...

374
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,791
My most Honorable First Class
Goddess, this man's misdeeds

375
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,750
are laid bare
before your very eyes!

376
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,041
I have complete faith in Keiichi
and no reason to doubt him!

377
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,500
Isn't that right?

378
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,791
--Ah, Belldandy!
--You two are something else.

379
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,791
I do not approve of this!

380
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,250
I will even defy the order
of a First Class goddess

381
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
as proof of my love!

382
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,500
We all know that I'm
a slave of my passions.

383
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,583
So sorry... but I'm going to
get rid of this man myself.

384
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,208
Take this, mortal!

385
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,291
Hey! Cool it, will ya?!

386
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,291
Uh?

387
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
Isn't this...

388
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,500
Ah...

389
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,875
Back when we
had only just met...

390
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,208
we exchanged some
very precious gifts.

391
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,000
So, you still had it
after all this time.

392
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,291
It wasn't my intention.

393
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,375
Well, you shouldn't have!

394
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,833
Because...

395
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,250
Because...

396
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,166
That is definitely...
against the rules.

397
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,458
Ah...

398
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,083
I did it!

399
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,458
This scroll contains the song

400
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,625
that will summon the
golden nightingale!

401
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,000
The seal on it can only be
broken for the very first time

402
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,291
with a heartfelt
tear of a goddess.

403
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,958
Taming the nightingale and
having control over its song,

404
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,791
is my privilege as
a plum tree spirit...

405
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,416
It's a dream I've held
for so many years...

406
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Really? Well, lucky you.

407
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,375
I couldn't have done it
without you, Urd...

408
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,750
You truly are a
woman among women!

409
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,500
You really were a
necessary part of my dream!

410
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
So, in other words...

411
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,416
you were just simply
using me, weren't you?

412
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
It's not like that, my love!

413
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,916
Depth charge, descend!

414
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,291
Yeeaaaaaagh!

415
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:30,333
♪ Laaaa... la, la, la! ♪
♪ Laaaa... la, la, la! ♪

416
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,375

417
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,666
How nice.

418
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,583
Yeah... So I guess
he really can sing!

419
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,375

420

421
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,541
Oh! There it is at last!
My golden nightingale!

422
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,958
Oh, how I've dreamed
of this moment!

423
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,416
Well, it looks like...
chasing after some goal

424
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,375
is what you're
cut out for after all.

425
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,125
Oh, Urd...

426
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,791
It's heavy!

427
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,833
--Eh...
--Oh, my!

428
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,375
It's huge!

429
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,291
Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!

430
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,833
I've never heard a
more beautiful voice!

431
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,041
It's so deep and robust!

432
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,166
Isn't it magnificent, Urd?!

433
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,708
Hard to say.

434
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,541
I think I'd much rather listen
to your singing, Troubadour.

435
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,291
I can't believe it!
Don't you understand?!

436
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,500
That was a compliment.

437
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,083
Aaaaahh! Wait! Come back!

438
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,083
Where do you think you're
going without your master?!

439
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,041
Get going.

440
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,791
Here, you forgot this!

441
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,791
It's irritating that your dream
means more to you than I do,

442
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,958
but I wouldn't want to
see you abandon your dream

443
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,208
and become a mere
shadow of yourself.

444
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,583
Ah...

445
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,708
I am sorry, Urd.

446
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,750
There goes a pretty
troublesome deity...

447
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,916
Hey Big Sis, are you just gonna
let him off the hook like that?

448
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,166
Well, this also shows the depth
of their love for each other...

449
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,416
--Right?
--Hm?

450
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,541
Yeah, yeah.
Let's just call it a day.

451
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,208
Hey, so didn't you really want
to go along with him or what?!

452
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,625
None of your business, kiddo.

453
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,166
Argh! What did I tell you
about calling me a KID?!

454
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,250
How stupid...

455
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,333
"To Urd, from Troubadour..."

456
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't believe he held
onto it all that time...

457
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,916
But I can't even use magic!

458
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,416
Or ride a bike!

459
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,166
I'm sure she'll realize
that being in love

460
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,541
gives a goddess power.

461
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,958
Next time, "Ah!
Let Those Feelings Awaken!"

462
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,750
Oh, so you got a boyfriend, huh?

463
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,333
Let's see if you can make
the step up into adulthood.
