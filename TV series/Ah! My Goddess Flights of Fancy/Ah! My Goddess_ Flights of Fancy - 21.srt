1
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,958
It's been three days now since
Belldandy returned to Heaven

2
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,625
to have her goddess
license renewed.

3
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,583
I'm home, everyone!

4
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,333
I'm so glad you're
back, Big Sis.

5
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,750
Here you go, Keiichi!

6
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,083
Oh, thanks, Belldandy.

7
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,416
So? What about your
goddess license?

8
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,708
I'm pleased to say I had it
reissued without any trouble!

9
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,541
It's making me nervous
having you all stare at me

10
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,875
when I try this.

11
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,083
Come on, Big Sis.
Just hurry up and do it.

12
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,708
And make it snappy!

13
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,375
Okay, I'll give it a try...

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,666
Mm...

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,166
O great spirits, Windinae...

16
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,583
I bid thee grant moisture
to the flowers of our garden.

17
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,541
Huh?

18
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,625
Huh?

19
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,666
Ah! This is terrible!

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,500
Why did the tree explode?

21
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,708
Well, it has been a while,

22
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,875
so maybe you made a
mistake with the spell?

23
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,666
But I'm sure I said it right.

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,125
Hey Belldandy,

25
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,375
let me have a look at that
new license of yours again.

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,041
The mark of a demon?!

27
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,291
How could this happen...?

28
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,791
I went and attended
the training course,

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,875
just like I was supposed to!

30
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,500
So, as you can see it is quite
dangerous to use magic

31
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,791
without the utmost
attention to your spell.

32
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,291
When casting an attack spell,

33
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,625
be sure to look to
your right, then left,

34
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,916
then once more to your right
before proceeding.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,416
Remember that at this point,

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,875
you should practice good
manners by loudly announcing

37
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,666
the name and type of the spell
you are about to cast.

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,416
Now, let's move on.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,541
Thank you so much for your help.

40
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,625
I'll be returning to Keiichi's
home now if that's all right.

41
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,000
Mm-hm.

42
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,375
Just try not to cause
any more accidents, okay?

43
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,416
Right!

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,333
Stop there!

45
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,750
Rewinding memory projector!

46
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:32,416
Found it! Now zoom in!

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,208
--Ah! Mara!
--Ah! Mara!

48
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,875
It figures.

49
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,583
So the mark on your
forehead changed

50
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,166
because of the
different license?

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
I didn't notice...

52
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,916
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,541
Well, aside from the mark... 
How do you feel otherwise?

54
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,708
As far as I can tell,
nothing feels any different.

55
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,250
Well, that's good.

56
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,791
What do you mean "that's good"?!

57
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,875
If you haven't noticed,

58
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,416
Big Sis has been
turned into a DEMON!

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,375
If the license office made
the mistake, can't she just

60
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,708
file for a new one and get
it changed back to normal?

61
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,333
I should probably file a
notice with them right away!

62
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,833
It's protected from
demons gaining access.

63
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,875
Then do you mind explaining
to me how Mara got into Heaven?

64
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,041
My guess would be that

65
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,083
she somehow had
something to do with this.

66
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,500
And who is "she"?

67
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,791
Mara could've gotten
in with Hild's help.

68
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,125
All right, listen up.

69
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,583
If you continue doing good deeds

70
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,083
and behaving
like a goddess,

71
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,250
then it's only a matter of
time before it destroys us all.

72
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,250
So then, what do you
think she should do?

73
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
She'll just have to
commit some evil deeds.

74
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,375
Like not separating trash,
making kids cry,

75
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,541
stuff like that.

76
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,333
Oh, I don't think
Belldandy would be able

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,458
to do things like that.

78
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,833
I was just kidding...

79
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,250
Of course she'd never be
able to do those things.

80
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,041
How could it
possibly take that long?!

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,541
So, what did they say?

82
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,625
 They said it would take at
least a month to fix things.

83
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,958
Why so long?

84
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,083
The central office
is always like that.

85
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,708
When I had my
license suspended,

86
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
it took them forever
to process things.

87
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,041
Unfortunately, they also said
I wouldn't be able to do it.

88
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,208
To do what?

89
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,125
They told me the
representative would have

90
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,625
to be at least 18 years old.

91
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,208
So you're going to have
to come with me, Urd.

92
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,666
That's why I hate dealing
with the central office!

93
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,541
Hye, can't we try contacting
the Almighty One directly?

94
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, we could, but
we'd just end up

95
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,666
waiting in line for yesars.

96
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,166
This all happened because I
allowed myself to be careless.

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,500
So I should really
be the one who goes.

98
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,875
Last I checked,

99
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,375
they don't usually let
demons through the gates.

100
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,500
Don't worry it'll
be okay, Big Sis...

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,583
Just leave it to us!

102
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,541
AAAAHH!

103
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,625
Her symptoms are getting worse.

104
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,375
We'd better get going, Skuld.

105
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,041
I swear I'll do
everything in my power

106
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,375
to fix this for you, Big Sis.

107
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,000
Now take care of things for
Belldandy,

108
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,708
and see to it that she won't
need to use any kind of magic

109
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,500
while we're gone.

110
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, okay.

111
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,833
You're gonna pay for it if
anything bad happens to Big Sis!

112
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,416
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,833
I'm so sorry about this.

114
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,000
I was so focused on
being a goddess again

115
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,791
that I didn't take the time to
properly examine the license

116
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,208
like I should have.

117
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,083
Well, there's no way you could
have foreseen that Mara

118
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,083
would be there to cause
trouble, right?

119
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,333
I mean, as long as we can avoid
any sticky situations where

120
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,541
you'll need to use your powers,
Urd and Skuld will take care of

121
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,583
the proceedings
and you'll be set.

122
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,458
Everything'll be just fine!

123
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,541
Right.

124
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,541
Huh?

125
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,916
Ah!

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,750
Ah...

127
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,041
I have finally
completed my training.

128
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,250
Hey, it's the priest!

129
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,708
Welcome home, Mr. Priest.

130
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,291
Lady Belldandy! It has
been quite some time.

131
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,375
I have returned at last, in
hopes of gaining

132
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,166
your approval of my Buddhist
power, which I have spent

133
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,833
extensive time honing through
ascetic training... Hm?

134
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,708
Villain! Who are you?!

135
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,541
OHHH! Such waves of evil energy!

136
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,125
How dare you attempt to
deceive me, foul spirit!

137
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,125
What have you done
with the real Belldandy?!

138
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,708
Abiraunken, sowaka! Hm!

139
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,416
AAAHH!

140
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,291
Ah! Keiichi!

141
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,208
This may be the work
of the demonic force

142
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,083
that is now active within me.

143
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
Could it be?

144
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,500
That I really have
turned into a demon?

145
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,333
If I can't find a way to turn
myself back into a goddess,

146
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,916
I might not be able to
stay with you any longer.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,083
It'd be far too dangerous.

148
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,916
This'll all be over
when Urd and Skuld

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,208
return from Heaven with
your new license.

150
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,666
All you need to do right now,
is just learn to rely on me.

151
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,958
Yes, I suppose you're right.

152
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,708
Aaah!

153
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,625
I'm sorry Keiichi.
This must be my fault too.

154
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,625
Aww, don't worry about it.
Changing a tire's no big deal.

155
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,791
I've got it all under control,
so don't let t get to you, ok?

156
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,291
Right...

157
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:47,250
Oh... Morisato, sorry man, but
now's not really a good time.

158
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,125
I see...

159
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,041
Sorry, Morisato.

160
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,916
No problem...

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,166
Sorry, Kei. I can't

162
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,875
Uhnn...

163
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,500
No luck here either, huh...

164
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,583
It's the demonic force...

165
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,708
Look's like it's begun.

166
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,791
Now that you've
accepted that license

167
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,666
you'll experience nothing
but enternal misfortune

168
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,833
unless you pledge your life to
live as a demon, Belldandy!

169
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,541
Yes, indeed.

170
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,708
Uh! Lady Hild!

171
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,416
I must admit I'm rather
impressed you were

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,666
able to hatch such a scheme.

173
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,166
Well of course I can!

174
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,750
I always strive to come up
with the most devilish scheme

175
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,958
in order to please
you, Lady Hild.

176
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,458
In fact...

177
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,000
Ahhh, Belldandy, how much
amusement will you provide me

178
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,666
with this time around?

179
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,250
Well, I fixed the flat but,

180
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,458
I think we should just
stay here for the night.

181
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,833
And I guess we'll
just figure out

182
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,250
the rest of this tomorrow then.

183
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,708
No matter how bad the situation,
you always manage

184
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,083
to stay positive
and not get frustrated.

185
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,333
Yah, but if you think about it.

186
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,500
This is nothing
if you compare it

187
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,166
to the stuff we've
been through before.

188
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,916
And anyway, it doesn't
matter where I am,

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,458
as long as I'm with you.

190
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,083
Besides, I would hate to imagine
what Urd and Skuld would do

191
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,208
to me if I were to let
anything happen to you.

192
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,250
Thank you, Keiichi.

193
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
Don't mention it, Belldandy.

194
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,125
Morisato!!

195
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:03,916
Oh, hey, guys!

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,291
This is an outrage!

197
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,541
I come back to get
something I forgot

198
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,041
and this is what I find?

199
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,791
You've broken the Iron Law of
the Nekomi Tech Auto Club

200
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
by having a lovers
rendezvous in the clubhouse.

201
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,583
You insolent scum!

202
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,000
You're outta the club!!

203
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,250
Auuugh!!

204
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,291
I'm so sorry.

205
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,666
Oh, heh, it's all right.

206
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,750
Now wait a minute!

207
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,291
Just how long do you plan
to keep us waiting?!

208
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,166
I'm telling you: It's
an emergency regarding

209
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,125
a goddess first class, second
category, unlimited license.

210
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,666
Well put!

211
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,583
What are you gonna do about it
if something happens to her

212
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,833
while we're standing
around wasting time?

213
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,333
I assure you that the
Goddess Assistance Agency...

214
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,833
What are those two
doing up here anyway?

215
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,166
All right, that'll be four
dollars and nine cents.

216
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,166
What the...?!

217
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
Is there something
wrong Keiichi?

218
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,958
My wallet's gone.

219
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,375
Uh...

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,208
Keiichi...

221
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,958
Maybe I should use a
spell in order to help us.

222
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,333
Probably not a good idea.

223
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,125
I promised Urd and Skuld
I wouldn't let you do that.

224
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, I suppose you're right

225
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,375
but I'm afraid if things
continue at this rate you'll...

226
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,333
What's this?

227
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,583
Huh?

228
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,791
Oh, hey! It's that manju
I had from earlier!

229
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,083
I guess you could
say that Heaven

230
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,958
hasn't forsaken us
after all, huh?

231
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,500
Oh no!

232
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,416
According to the date, it says
it's alread past expiration.

233
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,458
Ugh...

234
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,750
I'm so sorry...

235
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,166
Even the souveniers
I brought you can't help.

236
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,375
How is it possible that the
engine could have given out

237
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,291
today of all days?

238
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,250
Belldandy!

239
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,458
Why don't you run on ahead and
take cover under that bridge?

240
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,083
But I want to stay and help you!

241
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,458
I know how much this motorcycle
means to you Keiichi!

242
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,083
Belldandy!

243
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,208
I can't let you just sit out
here in the rain like this.

244
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,958
Besides, it's aboout
time I performed

245
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,750
some maintenence work
on this thing anyway.

246
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,916
This precious motorcycle
is a dear friend of ours.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
It has been with us
for a very long time

248
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
and helpful to us
in so many ways.

249
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,416
We just can't leave it behind!

250
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,791
Belldandy, don't!

251
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,125
You're not supposed to
use your powers, remember?!

252
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,125
Please...!

253
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,958
You've gotta stop!!

254
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,000
Ahhh!

255
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, no...

256
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm so sorry!

257
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,291
I'm sorry, Keiichi!

258
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,958
Hey, it's all right.
Don't worry about it, ok?

259
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,625
But all this, don't you see?
It's all my fault.

260
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,541
It's not your fault at all.

261
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,750
You just can't use your
powers like you're used to

262
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,375
because of that
demon license.

263
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,666
But soon you'll be back to
normal before you know it.

264
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,041
Hey! The rain stopped.

265
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's get outta here
and find some shelter.

266
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,708
Ok!

267
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,625
Keiichi!!

268
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,583
Ah! Keiichi!

269
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,375
He's got a high fever!

270
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,708
But why is that?

271
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,208
Why is all this
happening to us?!

272
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,833
I'm from the Goddess
Assistance Agency.

273
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm supposed to be
here to help him.

274
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,833
Not only am I failing to
be of any use to Keiichi,

275
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,500
but I'm actually a burden.

276
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,375
You're in quite the
pickle, huh, Belldandy?

277
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,625
Mara!

278
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,916
How could you possibly
do something so awful?!

279
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,833
Hmph! It's because I'm a demon.

280
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,291
Isn't that obvious?

281
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,666
Keiichi had nothing
to do with our quarrel!

282
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,541
How could you do that to him?

283
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,333
Don't be so naive!

284
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,083
You're the one who caused this
by trying to do good deeds.

285
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,916
But I was only trying to do what
I could to try and help Keiichi.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,375
Well you can still fix
this by sucking it up

287
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,833
and helping us to
expand our share

288
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,958
You're askig a first class
goddess to help a demon.

289
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,458
Yeah and if you choose to do it

290
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,500
the demonic path will allow
you to finally give Keiichi

291
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,333
all the happiness
he has long desired.

292
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:17,166
Ahhh... The demonic way
of life is truly wonderful.

293
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,666
Oh, Keiichi.

294
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,958
If you just commit
some evil deeds,

295
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,541
it will all come back to Keiichi
in the form of happiness.

296
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,291
Not such a bad deal
when you think about it.

297
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,750
Very well then.

298
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,958
From this point on,

299
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,375
I will allign myself
with the path of evil.

300
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,875
Good.

301
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,916
If I just commit
some evil deeds,

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
it will help Keiichi.

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,291
Something bad...
Something bad...!

304
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,000
Something extremely bad!

305
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,541
Hmm?

306
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,541
Whoa! Keiichi's fever
is going down!!

307
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,458
She must be doing
something evil.

308
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,666
For a goddess to
ignore traffic signals...

309
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,291
For a goddess to stand
a read without buying....

310
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,208
For a goddess
to draw grafitti...

311
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh! She must be doing
the most dreadful things!

312
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,583
There you go.

313
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
Just keep moving at
a nice, steady pace.

314
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,833
I forgot! I'm not supposed
to do any good deeds!

315
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,958
His fever's gone back up!

316
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,375
For a goddess to let herself
get blind, stinking drunk...

317
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,458
Uhh... Ah... Belldandy?

318
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,000
So you're finally awake?

319
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,291
Mara?!

320
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,500
You should be happy.

321
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,375
She has finally decided
to allign herself

322
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,416
with the forces of evil.

323
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,583
Huh?

324
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,458
Hey, that's right!

325
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,541
You're the one behind
all this in the first place.

326
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,250
Now give back
Belldandy's license

327
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,833
or you'l have to answer to me!

328
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,333
I'm sorry to inform you that I
put it through the shredder

329
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,583
a long time ago.

330
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,416
Wha... How could you do that??

331
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,208
Don't you realize how much
misery you've been causing her?

332
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,166
Well, I guess
that is a surprise,

333
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,750
considering that I've arranged
it so that the more evil deeds

334
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,500
she commits the happier
the two of you will be.

335
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,333
Are you saying you're not happy?

336
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,708
Sorry, but there's no wat the
two of us will ever be able

337
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,166
to find happiness that way.

338
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,416
Ah, but, you're wrong!

339
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,125
The only reason you're
feeling better now is

340
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,750
because of Belldandy's misdeeds.

341
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,208
She... commited evil deeds?

342
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,958
Well, let's just say she had a
change of heart and jumped sides

343
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,250
real quick when I told her it
would bring your fever down.

344
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,583
You...!

345
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,333
So that's how you persuaded
Belldandy to do it.

346
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,291
Well, that's just
the way we demons work.

347
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,250
We do absolutely anything
to increase our share.

348
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,375
Hey! Where are you going?

349
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,000
I'n going to stop Belldandy!

350
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,416
What's the point?

351
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,458
You'll only be plagued by
misfortune all over again.

352
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,958
Getting a fever... Getting
kicked out of my house...

353
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,500
I can deal with
that kind of stuff.

354
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,250
The truth is that for me:
Seeing Belldandy miserable

355
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,375
is the only misfortune
that I just can't stand for.

356
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,458
It hurts so much...

357
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,208
I had no idea that
doing bad things

358
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,375
would hurt so much inside.

359
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,208
I won't ever be able
to be a goddess again.

360
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,458
I'm so sorry.

361
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,166
You know, I might
actually feel pity for her.

362
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,500
Funny you should say that

363
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,958
cuz I'm feeling incredibly
guilty about this now.

364
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,541
You seem to be forgetting,
Mara, that you're a demon.

365
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,708
But you just said a minute
ago that you actually pity her.

366
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,916
Yes, you're right.

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,750
I do pity her and naturally

368
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,791
I'll help her once she can no
long bear the burden of it.

369
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,958
Then we'll give
the demon Belldandy

370
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,541
a special welcome
into our ranks.

371
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,291
Huh? Belldandy? Nah, she isn't
working any shifts today.

372
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,750
Huh?

373
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,791
You're looking for Belldandy?

374
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,291
I haven't seen her today.

375
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,083
Belldandy. Yes, she had
excellent attendence.

376
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,958
You should be more
concerned about your own.

377
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,791
Belldandy?

378
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,583
No she hasn't
been by here today.

379
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,083
Ooohh... So did you two get
into a fight yesterday?

380
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
Belldandy...

381
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,125
Huh?

382
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,041
Good. Thanks, Holy Bell.

383
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,166
I'm so glad to hear
Keiichi's fever went down.

384
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,541
But... I couldn't
possibly face him now.

385
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,375
And today, I'm pleased to
announce we're introducing

386
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,500
our latest model.

387
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,875
Make love calls to
that special someone

388
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,083
whenever and wherever you want.

389
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,583
Express your feelings
as often as you like.

390
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,125
Now you can send sweet
nothings back and forth

391
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,083
like a game
of love tennis.

392
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,875
Plus if you enroll right now,

393
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,500
we'll even throw in a
second plan at no extra charge.

394
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,708
Hey, you!

395
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,500
Huh?

396
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,375
Peorth!

397
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,583
We have a super sale
going on right now.

398
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,875
It was terribly rude of
you to ignore me like that.

399
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,333
Peorth, why are you
dressed in those clothes?

400
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,916
I cam down without
permission from my superiors,

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,750
so I've camoflagued myself
to throw off any pursuit.

402
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,125
Without permission?

403
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,291
Yes, and I did it for you.

404
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,041
You've got the best reputation
at the Goddess Assistance Agency

405
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,875
so I simply can't allow you to
go around spreading misfortune

406
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,666
for some silly reason.

407
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,916
But I had no choice.

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,125
Here.

409
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,916
Don't worry about signing up
for a service plan.

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,916
Just make a call.

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,541
What number should I dial?

412
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,250
Well the telephone number
doesn't really matter.

413
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,416
All you hve to do to reach
out and tuch someone

414
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,875
is think of the person you'd
most like to talk to.

415
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,208
If you do that,
the call will be heard

416
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,541
and your feelings
will get through.

417
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,041
Ahh... Belldandy. Where are you?

418
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,541
Huh?

419
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,000
Umm... Hello?

420
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,750
Uh... Uhmm...

421
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,041
Huh?!

422
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,166
Belldandy!

423
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,625
What I'm saying is that
your wish will be granted.

424
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:24,083
However, keep in mind that
you'll be allowed only one.

425
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,625
I'm...

426
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,875
What's wrong?

427
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,125
Have you forgotten the
passphrase this time?

428
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,166
You know...

429
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,208
My wish still hasn't changed.

430
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,708
But... I'll only
be a burden to you

431
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,166
now that I've
lost all my powers.

432
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,625
Just remember:

433
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,000
As long as we're together,

434
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,041
we'll be fine no matter what
trouble we might face.

435
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,416
And besides, I did say a
while back that it was ok

436
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,916
to rely a little more
on me, didn't I?

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,875
Oh, Keiichi...

438
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,125
Listen, I don't want you
to run off on me again.

439
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:59,333
I'd like for a goddess like you
to stay by my side forever.

440
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,875
Keiichi...

441
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,375
Huh?

442
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,958
Ah!

443
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,458
Hey, Skuld. Have a look at this.

444
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,916
Ah!!

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,916
Bis Sis's license has
changed back to normal.

446
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,666
It seems that your wish
has been granted Belldandy

447
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,875
and the bug that those demons
planted in the system

448
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,333
has been fixed.

449
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,041
In fact, I guess you could say,

450
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,166
it's as though that demonice
license had never been issued.

451
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,125
Peorth...

452
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,541
We'll just say that you
owe me one, all right?

453
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,583
Would you like
some more, Keiichi?

454
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,541
Sure! That'd be great!

455
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,416
Would you look at that?

456
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,833
Maybe it woulda been better,

457
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,583
if things hadn't been
fixed right away.

458
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,708
Tell me about it.

459
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,666
Well then...

460
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,833
Huh?

461
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,208
It has been quite a
while since I've had

462
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,916
a nice cup of tea from Earth

463
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,333
but I think I'll
be going back now.

464
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,916
What's wrong?

465
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,250
Aren't ya gonna hang around for
a while like you did last time?

466
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,958
Unfortunately, things
are going really well

467
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,541
at the Earth Help Center.

468
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,333
I'm very busy these days.

469
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,458
Uh, Peorth?

470
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,458
Hm?

471
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,333
You really did
save us this time.

472
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,291
Yeah, I guess there are times

473
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,791
when you actually
do come in handy.

474
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,041
I couldn't ignore it when I saw
you two crying like babies

475
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,250
at the reception desk.

476
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,250
What did you say?

477
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,333
Maybe I shouldn't
have saved her.

478
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll probably be
scolded when I return.

479
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,625
Peorth...

480
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,500
Would you mind not looking
at me with so much affection?

481
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,666
You see, I feel it is
imparative for both of us

482
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,333
that you continue to
be my rival, Belldandy.

483
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,916
You're right.
Thank you, Peorth.

484
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,916
So farewell for now.
I'll be seeing you.

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,916
Well, you now what
they always say...

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,041
What do they say?

487
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,625
"All's well that
ends well." I guess.

488
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,208
What the... Aww, crap...

489
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,375
It's like the freaking
calm after the storm.

490
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,333
Oh, Mara dear.

491
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,875
I'm sorry, my Lord, but
just wait till next time.

492
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,833
Keiichi Morisato...

493
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,708
I had written you
off as a spiless putz,

494
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,875
but perhaps I had
underestimated you.

495
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,541
Oh, Keiichi!

496
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,500
It's time to get up!

497
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,958
It's another
beautiful day outside.

498
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,000
Huh?

499
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,666
Oh my... Why good morning.

500
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,208
What is Hild doing with Keiichi?

501
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,916
But we've been going steady
for the longest time, right?

502
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,041
Ok, it's time to
bring Keiichi back.

503
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,625
Next time: "Ahh,
The Goddess's Confession."

504
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,000
A school bag, a uniform,
and a white coat.

505
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,458
Ok, but then who am I?
