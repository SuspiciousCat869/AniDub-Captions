1
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,750
Kei-i-chi...

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,458
Mm. Mm...

3
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,791
Oh, Keiichi...

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,000
Mm...

5
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,416
Wh-What is it?

6
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,291
Hello there, Keiichi.
Good morning.

7
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,625
W-What's going on?!

8
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,875
Isn't this to your liking?

9
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:03,791
Jeez! Do you have to be so noisy
this early in the morning?!

10
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,083
Belldandy doesn't ever do this
kind of thing for you, does she?

11
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,375
No! She doesn't! And I
don't want her to either!

12
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,291
Stop being so darn stubborn...

13
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,750
Make the right wish, and you
could have this all the time.

14
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,541
Oh, dear.

15
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,125
YOU'RE SO GROSS!

16
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,458
Uh?

17
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,166
Perhaps that was a little
over-stimulating for a child.

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,166
You know, if you keep
playing with toys like that,

19
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,416
you won't ever be able
to grant wishes...

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,041
You'll always be
completely useless.

21
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,791
These are not toys!
And I am not useless either!

22
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,083
Looks like we'll have to
continue this later...

23
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,125
as we've been so
rudely interrupted.

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,541
Grr... I can SO
do it, you big perv!

25
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,333
That's right. I am able
to grant people's wishes!

26
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,291
It's time to leave.

27
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,375
Huh?

28
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,833
So, you were up to
something again...

29
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,583
I believe I already told you
that it would be no use.

30
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,541
I am merely trying to
fulfill my obligation

31
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,291
as a First Class goddess.

32
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,250
Not that I'd expect a
Second Class goddess

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,791
like yourself to understand.

34
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,416
Now, if you'll please
excuse me, Urd.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,750
As a First Class goddess,

36
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,125
I don't have the time to
simply lounge the day away

37
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,458
like someone of
the lower classes.

38
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,875
Are you trying to pick
a fight with me...?

39
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,750
That's fine...
cause I'm up for it.

40
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,750
Peorth!

41
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,416
Hm?

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,541
What is it this time?

43
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,875
Right! Let's begin.

44
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,208
We're having a contest to see
who the most useful goddess is!

45
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,958
Mm-hm...

46
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,583
It'll just be a little game...
not like a contract...

47
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,916
If we did it for real,

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,416
I'd be suspended for
violating regulations again.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,250
Well, all the same,
the thing is--

50
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,833
You'll be the judge,
Keiichi. Just say yes.

51
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,083
Now, hold on...

52
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
As ridiculous as
this whole thing is,

53
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,875
I suppose I have no choice
but to accept the challenge.

54
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,750
I... don't exactly see
the point of this...

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,041
What's that...?! Go ahead
and make your wish!

56
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,875
You... don't listen...

57
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,041
All of you, stop it.

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,833
Will you please just
leave Keiichi alone?

59
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,375
Give me a break.

60
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,458
If you're so afraid that I'm
going to take him away from you,

61
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,708
then why don't you just

62
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,583
take part in this little
contest, too, Belldandy?

63
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,583
What?

64
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,416
Oh... how silly of me!

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,291
If you had the ability,
you would have already

66
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,291
granted Keiichi's wish
by now, wouldn't you?

67
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:30,000
But... I only... Uh...

68
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,833
Um, I need to get going to the
university right now, ladies,

69
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,208
so can we continue with this...
later, when I get back home?

70
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,208
WHAT?!

71
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,125
My teleportation spell will...

72
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,625
My transport gun will...

73
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,500
My dimensional
slide spell will...

74
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,375
TAKE YOU!

75
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,250
Aaaghhh!

76
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,791
Nothing beats a First Class
goddess' technique.

77
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,458
Quite charming if
I do say so myself...

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,500
My devices are the best
in the whole world!

79
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,958
Uh...?

80
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,708
The battle will be
decided on the campus!

81
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,666
Naturally!

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,541
You're both going down!

83
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,208
Oh, no...!
Keiichi's going to be...

84
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,041
It's no use following us.

85
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,291
If you come along,
you're only going to find...

86
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,583
that you're incapable
of granting his wish.

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,000
That isn't true! I...

88
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,333
You may mean to help Keiichi...

89
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:19,791
but I have to wonder if you
only cause him more trouble.

90
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,416
I'm right on the mark, aren't I?

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,250
Ever since that incident
between us so long ago,

92
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,958
what I have most hated
about you is your hypocrisy.

93
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,250
But, Peorth!

94
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,833
Just stay here and keep being
all wrapped up in yourself.

95
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,208
Then I will prove once and
for all that I am the one

96
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,208
who will grant Keiichi's
deepest heartfelt wish...

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,166
and not you.

98
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,583
Oh!

99
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,000
Keiichi...! That's not...

100
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,458
Not what?

101
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,791
Tamiya and the others broke
that bronze statue, and...

102
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,583
Whoooaaa!

103
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,708
Keiichi!

104
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,166
As I was trying to tell you,

105
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,791
they repaired it
with some wood glue,

106
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,333
but it's not really able to
support a person's weight,

107
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,000
so you shouldn't, uh...

108
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,750
--Guess I'm too late, huh?
--Ah-choo!

109
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,333
Ah-choo!

110
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,708
Oh, man! A cold bath sure does
get to you this time of year...

111
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,875
Hey, are you gonna
be all right?!

112
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:28,041
I'll go get you something
nice and warm to drink!

113
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,000
So cold, brr...

114
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,708
Sweater, come here!

115
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,125
Thermal Coating cartridge
is locked 'n loaded!

116
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,000
Anti-extreme-cold program,
"Summer Mode"!

117
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,625
Aaahhh!

118
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,625
Arrghhh!

119
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,250
Hey...! Wait...!

120
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,416
What's going on?!

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,083
What the hell?!

122
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,458
Ahh...! I... can't move!

123
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,166
Agh... It's so hot... Ugh...

124
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,000
Hmph! Well, I'm positive
my spell was perfect...

125
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,875
Just shows how Second Class
goddesses don't follow through.

126
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,166
What was that?!

127
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,291
You got a problem?!

128
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,541
Grrr!

129
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,958
What the heck is
going on here...?

130
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,666
Geez... I'm not sure
I even want to know.

131
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,708
I wonder why Belldandy
hasn't shown up yet...

132
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,000
I hope she's not still upset

133
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,208
about this whole
Peorth situation.

134
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,750
But how am I ever going to be
able to put her mind at ease

135
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,250
about this whole mess?

136
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,166
--K-Keiichi!
--Huh?

137
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,375
I brought you something warm!

138
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,708
Oh, thanks, Haseg--

139
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,250
Uh... Ah! AAAHH!

140
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,916
Uh. Uh...

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,666
Belldandy! I swear
I didn't see anything!

142
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,916
I might have known that's
the kind of thing he'd like.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,333
How perverted...!
But I'll still win!

144
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,916
The object of men's desires is
the mystery of the female form.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,833
Come then, let us
give him an eyeful!

146
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,708
GO!

147
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,583
What the heck?!

148
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,083
Keiichi!

149
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,083
Hasegawa!

150
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:12,000
Huh...? What's... happening?!

151
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,791
Someone help me!
I'm turning into the wind!

152
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,541
AAAHHH!

153
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,000
Becoming the wind...
Truly every man's fantasy...

154
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,500
That's not the issue here!

155
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,250
What on earth is going
to happen to him now?!

156
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,916
Wind magic never was in
my realm of specialty!

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,291
Then would you mind not using
magic outside that realm?

158
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,750
What has most likely happened

159
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,708
is that our spells have
interfered with each other

160
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,333
and, instead of
summoning the wind,

161
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,541
we have transformed Keiichi
into the wind itself.

162
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,500
So what will happen now?

163
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,208
Keiichi will fully
become one with the wind,

164
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,791
and never return to
his original form...

165
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,708
But in return, he can flip up
as many skirts as he likes.

166
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,916
AAAHH!

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,041
But, Urd...!

168
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,916
Hey... I'm just kidding!

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,333
Peorth, would you mind
canceling the spell?

170
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm already on it. But still...

171
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,791
I don't know if even
I will be able to solve

172
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,458
this complicated formula...

173
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,041
Uh... I'm disappearing!

174
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,708
Keiichi!

175
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,875
Whoa...!

176
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,250
Keiichi!

177
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,333
It's no good! I won't be
able to do it in time!

178
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,750
Keiichi!

179
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,875
Huh?

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,958
Ah...

181
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,541
--Belldandy!
--Careful, Big Sis!

182
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,250
It's all right...
I'm here for you now.

183
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,125
So come to me, Keiichi!
Come to me!

184
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,125
I'm sorry I took so long.

185
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,666
What did Big Sis do just now?

186
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,958
She managed to reassemble
Keiichi's particles

187
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,500
out of that
enormous whirlwind...

188
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,500
Even though she is an
expert with wind spells...

189
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,583
that was still quite impressive.

190
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,541
I can't believe
what she just did!

191
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,791
I can't believe she's capable
of such immense power...

192
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,666
I knew you wouldn't
get it, seeing as how

193
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,458
you only knew Belldandy
when she was up in Heaven.

194
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
And just what does that mean?

195
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,250
Well... I guess you'll just
have to face the facts.

196
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,958
What are you talking about?!

197
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,958
All right, all right, I lose!

198
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,916
C'mon Skuld...
We're going home.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,375
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Big sis!

200
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,833
Uh... Um, Belldandy?

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,750
Oh, Keiichi!
I'm so sorry about...

202
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,416
what my sisters did.

203
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,916
I couldn't...
get them to stop...

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,916
Hey, you don't need
to apologize for that.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But I...

206
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,166
Thanks so much
for coming, Belldandy.

207
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,583
It really means a lot to me.

208
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,541
Keiichi!

209
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,041
You're always doing
so much for me...

210
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,125
Don't you ever feel like I don't
do enough for you in return?

211
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,666
Not at all!

212
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,208
Just the fact that you want
me here makes me happy enough,

213
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,416
and it gives me the
strength to do anything.

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,833
Thank you.

215
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,000
No, thank you.

216
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
I don't get it at all...

217
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,541
What the heck IS it
with those two anyway?

218
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,833
But you know, it's
because he's like that,

219
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,583
that Belldandy puts
so much faith in him.

220
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,291
Well, in that case,
it's quite simple.

221
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,625
All I need to do

222
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,000
is make Keiichi's heart
belong to me and only me.

223
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,541
Yes, no matter what it takes...

224
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,291
I'm back.

225
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,125
Welcome home!

226
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,666
Uh...?

227
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry...

228
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,416
I forgot. You were gone as well.

229
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,750
Huh? I meant to say...

230
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,791
Welcome back to you?

231
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,875
Ah...! Yes!

232
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,125
I'm back, too.

233
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,375
What? What the heck was that?

234
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,666
What is with the insanely
sticky-sweet atmosphere?

235
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,416
Is Keiichi really
satisfied with this

236
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,083
elementary-school-level
lovey-dovey nonsense?!

237
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,541
NO...! That simply
cannot be the case!

238
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,333
After all, I confirmed
earlier that he does indeed

239
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,166
experience the normal desires.

240
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,375
As I suspected,
it looks as though

241
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,125
I'll need to become even
more aggressive with him.

242
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,708
"Giant X" enlargement potion,

243
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,958
"P-One-Zero" underwater
breathing potion.

244
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,583
As usual, nothing
but worthless junk...

245
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,458
But where did she put
the one that I need?

246
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,541
Ah...! Here it is!
"Seeds of love"!

247
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,625
But this is a vulgar drug,
which will make its user

248
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,083
fall in love with
anyone at random.

249
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,666
I shall improve upon this
concoction and make it fabulous!

250
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,875
I shall call it "Drop of Love."

251
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,375
Once taken, this elegant drug,

252
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,000
will make its user
fall in love with only me.

253
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:25,291
♪ Cleaning, sweeping, cleaning,
sweeping, so much fun indeed! ♪

254
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,375
Oh, my! Doesn't that
seem just blissful!

255
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,458
Yes, Peorth?

256
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,166
So have you made any progress
in granting Keiichi's wish yet?

257
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Well, I...

258
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,375
You make me ashamed to be to
be a fellow First Class Goddess.

259
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
What in Heaven's name have
you actually done for him

260
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,333
as a goddess?

261
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,083
A First Class
goddess is so named

262
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,416
because she can
grant all wishes.

263
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,458
That... is our
primary obligation.

264
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,916
You are therefore
neglecting your obligation!

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,083
Neglect? That's wrong. Ah...

266
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,458
I don't...

267
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,666
Spare me the excuses.

268
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,041
You see, I am quite
different from you.

269
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,125
I want to grant the
innermost wishes of his heart.

270
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,208
Obviously you don't.

271
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,541
I can't believe I'm sweating
so much in the winter...

272
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,583
Here.

273
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,791
Hm...? Okay...
thanks, I appre--

274
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,541
It's my pleasure, Keiichi.

275
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,500
--Uh...
--Uh?

276
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,250
Eh...

277
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,666
Oh, no! You must suspect me of
putting something in your drink!

278
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,041
How horrible!

279
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,416
That's what you were
thinking, isn't it, Keiichi?!

280
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,291
All right, all right,
I'll drink it!

281
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,583
Oh...? Really...?

282
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,208
Well, there definitely
wasn't anything in it.

283
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,625
Until now anyway...

284
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,750
When you open your eyes...

285
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,541
the only thing that you're going
to see, Keiichi, will be me.

286
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,208
Hang on...
What's he doing there?

287
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,625
Is something wrong?

288
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,416
Oh, no, Keiichi's just
taking a little break.

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,750
C'mon, let's go over that way

290
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,916
so as not to disturb
him, all right?

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,833
Hey, Peorth, hold on!

292
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:38,250
I hope I can grant every
single one of Keiichi's wishes.

293
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,750
Not because of my obligations
as a First Class goddess,

294
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,708
but because that's
what I want in my heart.

295
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,416
But...

296
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,875
Hello in there...!
I know that I'm a little late,

297
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,500
but I wanted to come
see the pictures!

298
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,416
And he's fast asleep.

299
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:05,000
You'll catch cold if you
go falling asleep out here!

300
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,250
Mm...? Megumi...

301
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,166
Uh-huh... Huh?!

302
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,875
Ah...?

303
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,500
I love you... so much.

304
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,000
I love you...

305
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,541
Hey, what's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

306
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,583
Oh, I get it! You're talking
about sisterly love, right?

307
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,583
No, not like that.

308
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,041
You see, I've finally noticed
your manly charms, Kei.

309
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,541
We can no longer be...

310
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,166
just "brother" and
"sister," understand?

311
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,166
NO! Let's keep being
just brother and sister!

312
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,416
Ah! B-But, Kei!

313
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,875
Are you telling me you don't
care about my feelings?!

314
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,000
There's nothing I
can do about them!

315
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,625
Come on, Kei!

316
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,583
Man...! What the heck
is going on with her?!

317
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,791
Geez, Keiichi!
Keep it down, will ya?!

318
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,583
I can't even hear the TV!

319
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,750
I'm sorry. You see,
Megumi's acting a little...

320
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,041
--Keiichi...
--Huh?

321
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,875
I love you.

322
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:58,708
What?

323
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,416
That boring haggard face...

324
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,750
and those dull clothes
that always look the same...

325
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,625
You're just so dreamy...

326
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,041
Uh... calm down, okay?

327
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,500
I love you, Kei!

328
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,666
What the heck's going on here?!

329
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,333
Oh, Keiichi?

330
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,041
The effect of the potion should
be kicking in right about now.

331
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,625
So come to me and tell me
your heart's greatest desire!

332
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,166
Ah...

333
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,750
Oh...! Keiichi!

334
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,375
It was you after all.

335
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,250
Oh... Keiichi!

336
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,958
Oh, Kei... I can't take it!

337
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,875
Your wish is my command,
Keiichi, and I mean every wish!

338
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,291
Somebody! Help me!

339
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,875
Hm...

340
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,666
No matter how many times I count
them, there's still one missing.

341
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,458
Somebody DO something!

342
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,791
Keiichi?

343
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,125
I might've known.

344
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,791
What the heck are you doing?!

345
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,416
Urd, is that you?
Please help me!

346
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,375
K-Keiichi?

347
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
AGH!

348
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,875
That was way too close...

349
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,625
Keiichi! I need you to
turn your head the other way.

350
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,333
Huh?

351
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,666
It would appear that Peorth

352
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,458
must've made you
swallow a Seed of Love.

353
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,875
Seed of Love? You mean...

354
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,375
This one was a little
different, though.

355
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,208
It seems she altered a Seed
of Love and turned it into

356
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666
a drug of sheer temptation

357
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,291
that makes anyone who
looks at you your captive.

358
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,250
Why would she make
something like that?!

359
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,833
She probably just blew it.

360
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,750
Not just any yo-yo can waltz
in and use those potions.

361
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,041
I can see that.

362
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,666
I'll make you an antidote,
so just wait there.

363
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,208
Okay! I'm counting on you!

364
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,083
I really don't want Belldandy 
to end up like this too...!

365
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,375
Huh?!

366
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,083
Whatever you do...
don't look at me right now!

367
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:46,791
Uh!

368
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,958
Uh...

369
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
I love you!

370
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,750
This is just great.

371
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,708
You've got a lot of
nerve barging in here!

372
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,875
Well, you're not taking
my Kei away from me!

373
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,666
Hmph! All's fair in
love and war, girls.

374
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,041
You said it!

375
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,541
And that is why I am not
going to hold anything back.

376
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
Hm?!

377
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,833
Keiichi?

378
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,333
Seriously... Belldandy,
don't look at me!

379
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:14,083
The Seed of Love that Peorth
made will only mess you up, too!

380
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,083
Keiichi!

381
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,708
Is it really so painful for
you to turn... and face me?

382
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,541
What?! What do you mean?

383
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,833
I still want to be here,
even if it is!

384
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,333
I still want to be
with you by your side!

385
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,750
Right now, I am unable
to grant the wish

386
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,125
Peorth says you have
deep within your heart.

387
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:43,625
The truth is I want to make
all of your wishes come true!

388
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,416
Not out of any obligation
as a First Class goddess,

389
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,583
but because I want to grant
them of my own free will!

390
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:56,750
But... would you still accept
me... even like I am...?

391
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,291
Would you... Keiichi?

392
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,833
Even if being with me...

393
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,291
would lead to something even
more difficult later on...

394
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,333
Belldandy! Please listen!

395
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,958
I have never experienced
any kind of real hardship

396
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,125
the whole time
I've been with you!

397
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,291
After all... as long
as you stay with me...

398
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,541
my wish has already
been granted, hasn't it?

399
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,708
Oh, no...! Our eyes met!

400
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,250
Huh...? Nothing happened...

401
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,666
Oh, Keiichi!

402
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,250
This light...
I can't explain it.

403
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,291
It feels so warm...

404
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,041
What am I...
What was I doing anyway?

405
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,666
I feel like I had a
bad dream or something...

406
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,666
Oh, man... so even I got
caught up in it, too.

407
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,000
Huh?

408
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,666
And where do you
think you're going?

409
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,250
Um... well, you see...

410
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,291
I just remembered
some urgent business.

411
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,791
Right...

412
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,041
Well, before you go, would you
mind telling me one thing?

413
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,541
It wasn't me...!

414
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,125
I did not go into your room,
or take any of your potions,

415
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,791
or try to monopolize
Keiichi's heart!

416
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,250
I never did anything like that!

417
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,666
How could you even accuse
me of such a thing?! Really!

418
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,208
Yes, yes. Of course.

419
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,416
You are a First Class goddess.

420
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,125
You don't know
how to lie, right?

421
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,541
Well, anyway...

422
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,208
For a minute there I didn't
know what was going to happen.

423
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,541
Oh yeah? Well,
how do you think I felt?

424
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,750
And now Belldandy's out like
a light because of all this.

425
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,000
Hey, Urd...

426
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,541
Why didn't the potion
Peorth gave me

427
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,083
have any affect at
all on Belldandy?

428
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,208
I think that should
be pretty obvious.

429
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,625
My potions aren't so
unromantic as to affect

430
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,750
a couple who really
do love each other.

431
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,250
--Oh...
--Mm...!

432
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,666
Hey, you know, I haven't seen
Peorth around in a while.

433
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,875
Ah, yes... well,
actually Peorth is, uh...

434
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,250
Honestly, you are SO quiet.

435
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:05,041
I really wish you wouldn't make
me do all of the talking here!

436
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,291
I mean, you and I are
already on very good terms

437
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,416
with one another, aren't we?

438
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,708
I'll do even more
for you, too...

439
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,125
Come on... tell me
what you want...

440
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,958
How I love that little,
round nose...! It's adorable!

441
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,416
And you have such a
charming little belly, too...

442
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, you lovely little
pot-bellied tanuki, you!

443
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,000
Tanook-ee-ookie-doo! I love you!

444
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,250
The truth is... It should
have been a fun first date.

445
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,750
In order to overcome the
burden of a past mistake,

446
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,583
the goddess takes
on an old challenge.

447
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:13,250
Next time, "Ah! The Goddesses
Go Head to Head on a Date."

448
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,208
Bringing down meteors is
going a little overboard here!
