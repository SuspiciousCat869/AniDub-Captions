1
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,250
These Japanese hot springs...
are just so nice...

2
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,375
You said it... And this
sake is great, too.

3
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,791
That's all you ever
care about, Urd!

4
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,375
Hm! Don't be so up-tight.

5
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,916
I mean, it's been so long since
we've had a nice bath together.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
And that's all thanks to Big Sis

7
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,083
winning us a free trip
to the hot springs.

8
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,291
Huh? What are you talking about?

9
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,000
Uh... You mean you didn't?

10
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,375
I'm afraid not.

11
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,083
Huh?

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,708
Oh, well... who cares?!

13
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:21,125
Oh, and by the way, Skuld, looks
like you've grown a little!

14
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,500
Hey, c'mon!
Wait a min-- stop it!

15
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,250
Urd, I'm serious! Big Sis!

16
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,250
Get her off me! Leave me alone!

17
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,625
What's a woman doing
in the men's bath?!

18
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,833
Mm...

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,916
--Mara!
--Huh?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,583
M-Morisato?

21
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,916
Uh... Uh...

22
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,416
Huh?

23
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,041
Are you okay, Keiichi?

24
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,000
Uh yeah, I guess
I'll be all right...

25
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,166
I can't believe a demon
would scream like that

26
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,375
over being seen
naked by a human!

27
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,750
I couldn't help it!
I was taken by surprise!

28
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,833
I mean, I never expected
to see the four of you here!

29
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,583
Mon Amour, what lies ahead in
life is shrouded in darkness.

30
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,916
No one knows what lies to
come at the end of the tunnel!

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,541
So much for be able to relax
and enjoy the hot spring.

32
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,625
--Way to screw things up!
--Are you serious?

33
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,375
You mean you weren't planning to
pull another nasty trick on us?

34
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,083
I'm taking some personal time...

35
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,875
I don't intend to
get into it with you.

36
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,375
Then how about a drink?
It's been a while.

37
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,541
--A drink?!
--Huh?

38
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,166
Hey, it's your day off, right?

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,208
We used to drink a lot
together back before

40
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,916
we were in this line of work.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,291
Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.

42
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, hey, Mara...

43
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,875
So those two used to be close?

44
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:53,625
Yes. I'm sure they
still are, too.

45
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,041
That's surprising!
I never would've guessed that.

46
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,541
I think maybe...

47
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,500
There's a connection
between them after all.

48
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,916
This reminds me of how
you put a bug in my drink

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,083
that one time.

50
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,583
Oh, yeah.

51
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,083
But that was in return for
the poison you put in my drink

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,125
that other time.

53
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,791
Are you sure those two really
have a close friendship...?

54
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,541
After that, we made up with each
other by exchanging flowers.

55
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,208
That's right, and we both put
exploding roses in the bouquets.

56
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,708
Well, it certainly seems to me

57
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,208
like we have a score
to settle after all.

58
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,083
Yes, it would seem so.

59
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,875
--Grr...!
--Grr...!

60
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,958
--Oh, I have an idea.
--Huh?

61
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,708
Well, what is it?

62
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,208
As long as we're here, we'll
forget about being "goddesses"

63
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,375
or "demons", and we won't get
into any fights, no matter what.

64
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,250
And if anyone breaks
this rule, then...

65
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,291
...she'll be severely punished!

66
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,666
Uh...

67
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,375
Jeez! I'm just being myself.

68
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,041
I don't even want to think
what the punishment could be.

69
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,708
Are we all agreed then?

70
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,291
--Agreed.
--Agreed.

71
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,208
Okay, then let's
all have some fun!

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,125
I used to go to the
firing range every day

73
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,833
to shoot away the gloom I
felt when you defeated me.

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,291
You'd be nuts to think
you can defeat me now!

75
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,916
Okay, next game!

76
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,416
Aw... too bad. You're only
about 99 million points

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,041
short of being able
to compete with me.

78
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,541
SEE!

79
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,833
I don't have time for
ridiculous games like this!

80
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,750
I've had it!

81
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,125
Oh, I see...

82
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,250
Are you saying you'd rather
settle things like THIS?

83
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,291
It would be a pleasure.

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,208
I guess violence is out of
the question, though...!

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,041
After all, nothing ever comes
from meaningless fighting!

86
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,583
Oh, yeah! She's right!

87
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,958
How about we have a nice, fun
game of ping-pong next, huh?

88
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,333
Hey, and there's always
karaoke, ya know!

89
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,458
Well, now that you mention it,
there's always mahjong!

90
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,041
Yeah, mahjong would be
great, or a nice game of...

91
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,416
Good grief, they've
got a lot of energy!

92
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,958
I guess Mara is a lot more
fun than I had expected.

93
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,583
Yes... she really is.

94
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,083
--Yeah! All right!
--Woohoo!

95
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,333
I wonder when the next time
we drink together will be.

96
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,666
Urd...! Hurry up, we're leaving!

97
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,458
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,583
Hey, I want the
window seat, Big Sis!

99
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,750
Take care, Mara.

100
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,958
Move over! I want to
sit next to Big Sis!

101
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,041
It ain't easy to
fake being drunk.

102
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,458
Ya know...

103
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,916
If only Urd weren't a
goddess and I weren't a demon...

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,416
then every day could be
like this. However...

105
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,791
Senbei!

106
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,666
At your service, and
refreshingly pleasant as ever.

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,708
Were you able to get me
a strand of her hair?

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
Oui, Milady...! I was
able to obtain one with

109
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,250
the greatest of ease in that
tres magnifique outdoor bath.

110
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:06,416
Well, well, well...
The fun is just beginning, Urd.

111
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,500
What are you going
to do about this?!

112
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,833
I was almost
finished with it, too!

113
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,583
Look, I already
told you I'm sorry!

114
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,250
All I did was trip over that
stupid bomb, and it broke.

115
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,041
It's not a "stupid bomb!"

116
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,333
It's a machine for reaching
stuff in high places!

117
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,541
Oh, is that right?

118
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,041
I guess that'd be a
necessity for you...

119
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,958
There they go again...

120
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,250
Sorry about that, kiddo.

121
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,833
I guess I can see
why you're so upset!

122
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,250
URD, YOU BIG JERK!

123
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,208
DON'T EVER SHOW
YOUR FACE HERE AGAIN!

124
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,250
Oh, are you going out?

125
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't handle being
around her right now,

126
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,916
so I'm gonna take off for a bit.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,416
See you later then.

128
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,958
Do me a favor and go console
our little sister, okay?

129
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,666
I just don't have
the patience right now.

130
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,125
Appreciate it!

131
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,083
Talk about irresponsible...

132
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,958
I mean she's the one who upset
Skuld in the first place!

133
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,500
--It's not that...
--Huh?

134
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,375
It's just that it's
Urd's way of showing

135
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,375
that she really cares about her.

136
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
You think so, huh?

137
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,666
Yes, I do.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,208
Thank you very much.

139
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,833
Hm...

140
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,833
That was pretty generous of me.

141
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,041
Uh!

142
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
Well, I guess I'll go buy some
ingredients for my potions

143
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,916
and head back.

144
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,333
Do it.

145
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,333
Sí! Just leave it to moi, dear.

146
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,208
Shakkin!

147
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,958
Talk about the oldest
trick in the book...

148
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Enka... music?!

149
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:53,708
So, how do you like
my cursed headphones?

150
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,916
Mara...

151
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,333
How careless of me...
Just... when I thought...

152
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,708
Now why don't we take a look
at tomorrow's weather forecast?

153
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,375
We should be having
a lot of sunny weather

154
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,458
all around the country.

155
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,791
--Hey, where's Urd?
--Not back yet.

156
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,291
Well, she's certainly
out pretty late tonight.

157
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,666
Probably just out
having fun somewhere.

158
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,000
Still, it's kinda weird for her
not to at least give us a call.

159
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't care if she
doesn't come home ever.

160
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,916
I guess it's all right...
I mean, Urd's a big girl.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,125
I suppose she can take
care of herself, huh?

162
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,958
Ah...! Look, I told you!
I'm not worried about her!

163
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,458
Oh... Keiichi! Something
terrible has happened!

164
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
You see... I found
this bag of ice cream

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,583
near the drugstore
while I was out shopping.

166
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,750
I could sense Urd's
presence still on it...

167
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,208
Huh?!

168
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,083
I'll try to call forth any
residual thoughts it holds.

169
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,958
Oh, spirits of earth and air
who watch over us always...

170
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,125
Hear my voice!

171
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,083
That was pretty generous of me.

172
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,833
So then, this really was Urd's?

173
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,333
Then did she actually
buy this ice cream?

174
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,541
--Ahh!
--Ahh!

175
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,458
Uh, w-what the heck was that?!

176
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,916
Look, it's Mara.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,916
I'll bet that she managed
to put her to sleep

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,333
by forcing her to
listen to Enka!

179
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,458
Huh?! You're saying she's
been captured by Mara?!

180
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,041
I'm afraid so...

181
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,375
How could she...

182
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,208
I mean, we had so much fun
together the other day!

183
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,750
Skuld!

184
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,458
Hey, Banpei!

185
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,458
Geez! Urd, you're such a pain!

186
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,750
You're always putting me
through all this trouble.

187
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,000
Uh...

188
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,833
Hold on...
What is going on here?!

189
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,541
Are you referring to your
current predicament?

190
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,625
Or are you referring to this,

191
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,458
which I cultivated using
a strand of your hair.

192
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,416
A clone of me?!

193
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,833
I see...

194
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,625
So that's why you palled
around with us at the resort.

195
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,416
Very good! You know, that's
what I like that about you.

196
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,583
How quickly you
pick up on things.

197
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,708
You're nuts if you think
you can get anywhere

198
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,083
with that half-baked thing.

199
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,541
Quite true...!

200
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,833
Right now, it's nothing more
than a mere soulless doll.

201
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,916
That is exactly why I
had to bring you here...

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,083
So that I could separate

203
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,500
your divine half
from your demon half...

204
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,333
and then transplant
it into HER!

205
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,625
Oh, please. As if...

206
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,750
Why not?

207
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,458
Because, Mara, even
you should know...

208
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,416
not even the Almighty One
could separate my divine half

209
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,208
from my demonic half.

210
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,541
Hmph!

211
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,375
Well, it just so happens
that I have obtained this.

212
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,875
Huh?

213
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,958
A legendary item which can
split and fuse personalities.

214
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,083
Gaze upon the heretical pot!

215
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,791
Mara, tell me...
Where did you get that?

216
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,541
From Hell's mail-order catalog!

217
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,041
Hey, I haven't seen you
around here before.

218
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,791
Ah, well, I'm new.

219
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,875
Is that so? Huh?!

220
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,958
Hey, wait! I never
ordered this thing!

221
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,958
But, that's definitely what
I got on the invoice here.

222
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,625
Well... I guess so...

223
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,041
Hey, thanks, we
appreciate your business!

224
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,666
So, what the heck IS this thing?

225
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,333
This is the legendary
heretical pot,

226
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,416
which I can use to split
and fuse personalities

227
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
however I please, and
which came mixed in

228
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,083
with a number of
items that I bought

229
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,458
through Hell's
mail-order catalog!

230
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,666
See how fortune smiles upon me
for all the good I've done!

231
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,333
Don't you use that ceramic
piece of junk on me!

232
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,625
Commence transplant!

233
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,833
Come on, baby... let's go!

234
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,041
The battery's run down, huh?

235
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Oh... please, Urd...

236
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,083
Don't tell me you
really did get caught.

237
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:28,250
I wish I hadn't told her
to never come back.

238
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,125
Oh, Urd...! Where the
heck have you gone?!

239
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,666
What are you doing here, Skuld?

240
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,458
Huh?! Urd, you're back!

241
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,083
I was so worried about you!

242
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,750
I thought Mara might have
sealed you away or something!

243
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,708
You silly girl... I assure you
that would never happen.

244
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,083
You see...

245
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,291
Huh?!

246
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,083
You're the one who's
going to be sealed away.

247
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,833
So, how do you like
being able to see

248
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,416
the stupid look on your face
while you're being sealed?

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,875
Why are you doing this, Urd?!

250
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,416
Is it because I told you
never to come back?

251
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,333
Not a bit... It's just that
I'm sick of you, that's all.

252
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,666
NO...!

253
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,958
It's too bad for you, Skuld.

254
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,500
Unfortunately, you
won't get the chance

255
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,500
to see Belldandy getting sealed.

256
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,416
Why'd you seal her away?

257
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,041
Because she's a nuisance.

258
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,708
That wasn't part of the plan!

259
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,125
Sealing the goddesses
was never my intention!

260
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,541
My real mission is to
increase demonic shares

261
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,875
by encouraging those who
are blessed by the goddesses

262
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,875
into accepting
contracts with devils,

263
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,916
which come closer fulfilling
human desires anyway.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,333
Hmph!

265
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,791
So basically, as long
as the goddesses go home now,

266
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,125
I'm good!

267
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,583
You're naïve - simple.

268
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,166
What's that?!

269
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,458
If increasing shares
is what you want to do,

270
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,083
then take the whole world!

271
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,041
What?!

272
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,750
Take over the whole world?!

273
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,416
Oh, how wonderful!

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,416
A free world
without law and order!

275
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,333
Truly, a utopia for humanity!

276
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,916
And you,

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,541
my lovely Mara, will
go down in history

278
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,625
as the greatest
of all demons...

279
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,416
You will be known
as the legendary one

280
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,541
who brought the whole
Earth under demonkind!

281
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,541
Besides... this is
such a simple seal,

282
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,833
even you could undo it
in a snap if you wanted to.

283
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,833
Ah, but I'm not authorized to.

284
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,416
The higher-ups would be...

285
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you really think anyone is
going to question the great hero

286
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,000
that conquered the world
that nobody else could?

287
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,291
The rest is yours to decide.

288
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,666
All right! I'm gonna do it!

289
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,583
Oh, yeah, baby!

290
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,000
What a moron.

291
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,208
Even though it is a simple
seal, only I can undo it.

292
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,333
I suspect I can make use of her
for a little while anyway.

293
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:59,625
Until I, Demonic Urd,
become the ruler of Earth.

294
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,916
Let's go! For the
glory of demonkind!

295
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,875
--Hip, hip, hooray!
--Hip, hip, hooray!

296
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,791
--Hip, hip, hooray!
--Yeah! Hooray!

297
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,541
--Banzai!
--Banzai!

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,083
I searched and searched, but
I still couldn't find them...

299
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,500
I'll bet Mara really has
gotten a hold of those two.

300
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,958
It'll be all right.
I mean think about it...

301
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,000
We don't have any proof
that Urd and Skuld

302
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,791
have been kidnapped by Mara.

303
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,333
But Keiichi...

304
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,250
Besides, my intuition
is usually spot-on...

305
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
in situations like this...

306
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,291
Uh... Sorry! I guess
that's not really something

307
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,375
I should be telling a goddess!

308
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,750
Well, thank you.

309
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,541
Uh...! Jeez... I'm sorry.

310
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,541
I can't think of
anything better to say.

311
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,041
No, really, it's okay.

312
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,916
I'll just go in and
make us some tea for us.

313
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,250
This is not good. I need
to get a hold of myself.

314
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,541
Why can't I say anything to
comfort her at a time like this?

315
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,916
That's pretty sad, even for me.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,625
--Urd, you're back!
--Huh?

317
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,375
Hey, you two. Welcome home.

318
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,625
Hey, Urd!

319
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:06,666
Oh... I'm just so glad
that you're all right!

320
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,833
Mara said she wanted
revenge on me

321
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,375
for the last time we hung out,

322
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,333
so she had me out drinking
with her all night.

323
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,458
Thank goodness.

324
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,083
I was so very worried
about you, Urd!

325
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,625
Oh, Belldandy. I'm so sorry.

326
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,208
By the way, has Skuld come back?

327
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,083
Oh, I guess not.

328
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,083
On the way home, I saw
Banpei just lying around,

329
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,791
so I brought him home.

330
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,541
I should go back out
and look for her!

331
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,166
Then I'll go with you, as well!

332
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,708
No, no, no! We want somebody
here in case she comes back.

333
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,833
You two wait here!

334
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,250
You're next... Belldandy.

335
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,708
Oh, where am I?

336
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,083
Let's see...

337
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,375
The last thing I remember

338
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,666
I had been tricked and
captured by Mara...

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,458
--Somebody! Please help me!
--Huh?

340
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,833
Oh, please!

341
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:13,208
Isn't this... a mirror
used for sealing souls?

342
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,833
It's just so sad...

343
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,583
It seems somebody has been
locked away inside of it.

344
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,833
It couldn't be...!

345
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:24,125
Key that locks the seal,
hear now my voice and respond.

346
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,125
I am the master of the seal...

347
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,291
I am the source of liberation.
Hear now my command

348
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,541
and release she
who is ensnared within!

349
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,083
Aaahh!

350
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,458
Hey, that really hurt!

351
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,583
Couldn't you have done
that a little-- huh?

352
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,166
Urd?!

353
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,708
NO! Don't seal me away again!

354
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,583
--I'm so sorry!
--Huh...?

355
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,375
Come again? WHAAAT?!

356
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,000
So then you're saying I was
sealed into that mirror

357
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,916
by your demonic half?

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,458
Yes...

359
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,500
Given how I was able to release
the seal with my own voice,

360
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,250
it's only natural to assume that

361
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,708
Mara succeeded in separating
my good and evil halves.

362
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,208
And that caused you...

363
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,958
such unbelievable
pain and hardship!

364
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,125
This... is kinda creepy.

365
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:19,291
Uh...! Wait a sec! So where's
the other you right now?!

366
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,375
--Belldandy's in trouble!
--Big Sis's in trouble!

367
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,833
♪ Black tea, black tea,
la la la la la... ♪

368
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:31,166
♪ Add a little milk, a touch
of sugar and a lemon... ♪

369
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,625
Keiichi's been sent away,
just as I was hoping.

370
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,833
The rule of evil shall begin
in the most unlikely of places.

371
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,583
--Oh, my!
--Waaahh!

372
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,583
You just couldn't wait
for the tea, could you?

373
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,916
Uh, right! I couldn't!
If I don't have some right away,

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,541
it'll only get cold, won't it?

375
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,041
That's true.

376
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,125
Wow, she really
caught me off-guard...

377
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,625
I'll get her this time.

378
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,916
Oh no. I almost forgot to offer
you some cookies with the tea!

379
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,083
Aaah...!

380
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
That was a close shave...

381
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,750
What's the matter? You okay?

382
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,125
Sure, cookies...
Yeah, I'd love some.

383
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,041
You mean the crispy,
sweet ones, right?

384
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,625
Sure...! I'll be right
back in a minute.

385
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,916
'Kay...! I'll be waiting!

386
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
Damn it, she is a
challenge after all.

387
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,666
She's been blessed with an
innate sense of bad timing.

388
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,500
But...

389
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,958
...this time she's
not getting away.

390
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,500
I almost forgot!

391
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,708
I have to remember to put aside
some cookies for Skuld, too!

392
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,583
Oh, hey! Are you
exercising, Urd?

393
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,166
Just trying to shed some
calories from the food earlier.

394
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,125
Oh, I see.

395
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,375
I've got to hand it to her...

396
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,916
She doesn't have a
shred of common sense.

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,541
--I'm home!
--Huh?

398
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,958
Ah! Keiichi!

399
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,625
No way...! He's back already?

400
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,250
Yeah, well... I forgot
to take my helmet.

401
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,333
Oh, dear!

402
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,500
Ugh...

403
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,958
I just can't believe
these two...

404
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,750
Just wait right here.
I'll go get it for you.

405
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,791
At this rate, my
plans'll be ruined.

406
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,833
Oh! Wait a minute...

407
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,541
I can use this to my advantage.

408
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,958
All I really need is an
opening to get at Belldandy.

409
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,458
Hey, Keiichi?

410
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,416
Huh? Yeah, what's up?

411
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,916
Do me a favor and close your
eyes until I count to three.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,750
Huh...? What for?

413
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,916
I was just thinking that
I'd give you a charm

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,250
that's going to help you
to find Skuld more quickly.

415
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:33,250
Hm? Oh, is that all?
Okay then... Let me have it.

416
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,041
Right... One...

417
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,708
He's so unassuming.

418
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,708
Two...

419
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,625
But it's going to cost him.

420
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,708
--Three...
--Mm!

421
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,583
Here you go, Keiichi. Ah!

422
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:54,250
Urd... What is this?

423
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,416
What are you doing?

424
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,208
What do you think you're doing?!

425
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:00,958
Ah!

426
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,625
Ah...

427
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,041
Belldandy! W-Wait!

428
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,666
Silly boy.

429
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,791
Why would Urd do such a thing?

430
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,625
Are you sure about this?

431
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,333
If this chaos continues, my
demonic half and I will both--

432
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:09,208
Even if you are overcome with
evil, you're still you, Urd.

433
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,416
Next time, "Ah! Shimmer
Without Fear of the Darkness."

434
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,291
Urd! I'll save you
no matter what!

435
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,208
Just forget that you're the
one who started all this...

436
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:16,791
Huh?
