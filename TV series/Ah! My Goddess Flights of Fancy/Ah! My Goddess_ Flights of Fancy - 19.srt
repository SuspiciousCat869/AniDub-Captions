1
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,583
So you're the
ultimate warrior, huh?

2
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,916
After lengthly investigation
and research,

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,625
I've finally arrived
at this truth.

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,958
According to this video,

5
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,208
the ninja master is the
world's ultimate warrior!

6
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,333
Legs the speed of
gusting winds...

7
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,666
Eyes that see through the
blackest darkness...

8
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,250
And the willpower to endure even
the most perilous situations!

9
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:15,166
Come forth and awaken, ninja
master! Kodama the Bedeviler!

10
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,375
Now go! Ensnare
Belldandy and her friends

11
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,416
into a melting pot of chaos!

12
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:49,416
We are born of the darkness
and ultimately we return to it.

13
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,041
And that... is the
fate of the ninja.

14
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,625
It seems like such a cruel
and sad law to live by!

15
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,000
Huh?

16
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,541
I wonder if that was a mouse...

17
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,166
I'm sorry I have
so much work to do.

18
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,750
But unfortunately,
I have no choice

19
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,708
but to get it all finished
by this weekend.

20
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,166
Because if you don't, you're
going to fail the class, right?

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,750
Uh. As a matter of fact, yes...

22
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,833
But the good news is I was
able to find this thing

23
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,500
just abandoned on
the side of the curb.

24
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,583
So, thanks to this computer,
I've made up a lot of ground

25
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,250
sorting this data.

26
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,166
It is a bit unusual
though, isn't it?

27
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,416
How is it possible

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,125
that someone would just
leave it sitting there?

29
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,125
I can't help wondering if the
owner is worried about it...

30
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,791
Well, not likely.
Considering it was thrown away.

31
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,958
Huh?

32
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,125
It's because newer
models keep coming out.

33
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,458
See, the reality is that
every two or three years,

34
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,000
everyone just goes out
and buys a new one.

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,958
I guess they just wanna keep
up with the newest technology.

36
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,500
I believe that this machine
found its way here

37
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,500
because it still
had so much to offer

38
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,291
and was destined to
come to you. In fact,

39
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,083
I think it's very happy to be
able to help you with your work!

40
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,333
Oh! You really think so? Hm?

41
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,666
Ah! The paper is jammed!

42
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,708
Oh, I'll get it!

43
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,750
This seems like something
you'd read in a manga, huh?!

44
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,541
What's my problem?
It's only her hand...

45
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,208
It's not like I've never
touched her hand before...

46
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,750
Only... her hand...

47
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,750
--Huh?
--Huh?

48
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,833
Ahhh! The printer!

49
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,333
I'm so sorry, but I wasn't
able to block it in time!

50
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,791
Oh, sorry about that...!

51
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,666
I guess my hand must've slipped!

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,458
You call that a "slip of
the hand," Skuld?!

53
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,416
Did you really think I'd let
you two get so warm and cozy

54
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,625
--that easily?
--What's that?

55
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,041
Oh, nothing!

56
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:50,958
Hm...

57
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,625
Hey, what's all that ruckus?

58
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,750
Keiichi picked up a bomb
with his bare hands

59
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,666
and blew himself up.

60
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,000
Not too bright!

61
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,125
Look, if you want to play
then go somewhere else!

62
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,791
I'm up against a deadline here,
and I'm REALLY busy right now!

63
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,208
Nyaaaah!

64
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,375
This is what you get for
trying to monopolize Big Sis!

65
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,458
Urd! Skuld!

66
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,041
How could they, of all people,

67
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,291
be giving my master
such a hard time?

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,625
Well then, it's time to go in.

69
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,416
But first, I suppose I'd better
do something about my size.

70
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,166
I will give you
an excellent taste

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,416
of the skill the ninja
master possesses!

72
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,333
Is it morning already?

73
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,625
Uh...?

74
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,666
Why, hello there.

75
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,875
AAACK! Who the heck are you?!

76
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,791
Oh dear. And you were
so great last night, too.

77
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,166
AAAHH... I've never
seen you before!

78
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,625
I was only joking.

79
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,208
Huh?

80
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,166
The truth is, I'm actually a new
goddess who's been sent to you

81
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,708
from heaven in order to
bring you good fortune...

82
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,375
Now! Come to me.

83
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,125
That's it...

84
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,791
This will be the end of your
relationship with Belldandy.

85
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,666
My master will be
absolutely delighted!

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,958
Huh?

87
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,791
Hey! What's with the tail?

88
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,458
Aaack! How are you able
to see through my magic?!

89
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,916
Are you a ninja?!

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Well, of course I'm not!
Now show me your true form!

91
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,958
Reveal yourself!

92
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
--What is it this time?!
--Stop it! Not there... Oh!

93
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,583
Good morning, Keiichi!
Are you ready for breakfast?

94
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,208
Ah.

95
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,625
Here's my chance!

96
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,416
Belldandy!
I am stealing Keiichi.

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,708
Your absurd
sub-elementary-school-level

98
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,458
romance with him is over.

99
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm afraid you no longer
have any purpose here!

100
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,083
Keiichi!

101
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,416
Does this mean you don't want me
to stay here with you anymore?!

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,458
Do you truly feel that I am
no longer of any use to you?!

103
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,833
It's a lie, isn't it...?

104
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,458
Please tell me that this
is all just a horrible lie!

105
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,291
It's a lie! I swear!
She just made all that stuff up!

106
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh, thank goodness!

107
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,708
Are you saying that you don't
even have the slightest doubt

108
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,333
after walking in
on us like that?!

109
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,250
I've decided that as long as
I live here with Keiichi...

110
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,208
I will trust him,
no matter what happens

111
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,083
or how terrible the
circumstances might seem.

112
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,666
Hm!

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,208
Ah!

114
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,333
I've heard enough
of your nonsense!

115
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,916
This absurd romance of yours is
even below kindergarten levels!

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,125
Nevertheless...
I've been exposed,

117
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,333
so I'm left with no choice.

118
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,708
This is the sacred
law of the Ninja...

119
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,583
It would be a disgrace
for me to return alive.

120
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,416
Wait, it would be a disgrace
to return to where Mara is?

121
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,208
What? How could you have known?!

122
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,791
Whaddya mean? It's obvious.

123
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,208
Mara's the only one who would
pull a crazy stunt like this!

124
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,666
Mm-hm.

125
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,000
If I've revealed that,
then I truly have no choice!

126
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,958
Now that you've said
my master's name...

127
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,333
you will have to die with me!

128
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,166
I would've liked to
see the conclusion of

129
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,000
my favorite TV series...

130
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,791
Aaaahh...!

131
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,666
Stop you fool

132
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,541
or you'll be caught in the
blast and blown to pieces.

133
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,375
Uh!

134
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,291
What am I saying?

135
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,875
Gggh...

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,666
What happened?

137
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,416
I sealed the explosion by
putting up a shield around it.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
But more importantly...

139
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,041
Why would you do such a thing?

140
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,625
Well, it's just...
my mission was...

141
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,875
If you were to die, I think
there are people for whom

142
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,875
it would cause a
great deal of sadness.

143
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,750
But even if that were true...

144
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,208
Ninjas are born of the darkness
and ultimately return to it!

145
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,416
From this point on,

146
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
I can no longer continue
to live as a ninja!

147
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,458
--Ms. Kodama.
--Yes, ma'am?!

148
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,125
As a Goddess, First Class,
Unlimited License...

149
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,875
I hereby command you to not
throw your life away in vain!

150
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,958
Because all creatures
born into this world

151
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,750
have not only
the right to live...

152
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,833
but also an obligation to live
out their lives to the fullest.

153
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,500
But if I can no longer continue
to live life as a ninja...

154
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,208
then what was the point
of having been born

155
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,041
in the first place?

156
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,166
Uh?!

157
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,291
I think... it was so that
you could come here.

158
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,083
Ah... My Liege!

159
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,750
Aw, man...

160
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,333
What's taking her so long?

161
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,416
Kodama...

162
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,875
Ms. Kodama?

163
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,083
Uh?!

164
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,000
I was just wondering if
something was wrong?

165
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,916
Oh, no! Of course not,
Lady Belldandy.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,666
I think maybe I just felt
a little chilly, that's all.

167
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,625
Oh, dear!

168
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,041
Perhaps I should go find Urd

169
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,708
and see if she might have
some medicine to help you.

170
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,833
Ah..! No, that's okay, really!

171
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,916
You see, I already have
some of my own medicine!

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,375
You do?

173
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,791
There's no way

174
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,125
I'm gonna take any of that
woman's crazy concoctions!

175
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,291
Please take care of yourself...

176
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,916
Because colds can be tough
to get rid of sometimes...

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,375
Let's go back inside and
I'll make you some tea.

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,875
How could such simple words be
filled with so much kindness?

179
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,041
My heart is
overflowing with warmth!

180
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,958
Heartwarming, heartwarming...

181
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,000
I can literally see the
warmth emanating from her!

182
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,416
You're as incapable of hiding
your emotions as ever, Kodama.

183
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,458
Did you really think you could
forget your duties as a ninja,

184
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,291
and assume an ordinary
life with these goddesses?

185
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,833
You'd first have to defeat
every last one of us...

186
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,208
or vanish from this world

187
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,958
before you could ever
escape our law of blood.

188
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,250
Oh, my! Who are you?

189
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,083
No way! I didn't even
detect her presence!

190
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,833
How could I have been
discovered by such a buffoon!

191
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,166
Huh? An assassin?!

192
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,708
Hyah!

193
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,125
Hikari! What are
you doing here?!

194
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,791
Maybe she wasn't a friend
of Kodama's after all?

195
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,541
Traitors...

196
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,416
Death unto traitors!

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,375
Unto those who break the Law!

198
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,458
Kodama the Bedeviler,
the deserter...

199
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,500
...must die!

200
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,375
Hikari the Flash...

201
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,791
She's a ninja master who was
made at the same time I was!

202
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,666
But this is the
fate of the ninja.

203
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,541
To survive, one mustn't
consider who the opponent is...

204
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,666
only how to defeat them!

205
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,333
It seems poor Kodama can't
keep up with my blazing speed!

206
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,125
Try this on for size.

207
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,333
Do you really think that

208
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,041
brute strength will
be enough to defeat me?!

209
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,708
Aaaahh! Stop it!

210
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,250
Hold it right there, Kodama!

211
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,333
Or this man might soon find
himself to be without a nose!

212
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,708
Now then, unless you want
him bleeding to death,

213
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,750
I suggest you drop
all your weapons.

214
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,333
You seem to be a little
confused, Hikari.

215
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,541
Lady Belldandy is
the only one I serve

216
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,458
and the only one I must protect.

217
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,208
So slice away if
you really want to.

218
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,166
Which is what I would
really like to say,

219
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,125
but it would only cause
Lady Belldandy immense sadness.

220
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,375
Is this satisfactory for you?

221
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,791
Where did you have all
those things hidden?

222
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,250
Wait a minute!

223
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,875
I'm afraid you'll have to
lose all your armor as well.

224
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,458
Fine by me.

225
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,375
Very good.

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
Now stay right there... okay?!

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,791
And prepare to die!

228
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,750
--Yes! I finally got her! Huh?
--Kodama!

229
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,333
A dummy? Damn!

230
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,541
She used her
substitution technique!

231
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,791
Huh?!

232
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,666
Her arsenal of weapons
were just a distraction

233
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,041
to make me overlook
that one knife!

234
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,458
I've been fooled by Kodama's
trickery from the very start!

235
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,083
I've been defeated!

236
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,041
Special technique,
Desert Needle!

237
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,750
Stop this!

238
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,708
Yes, my liege!

239
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,125
I thought I told you,

240
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,291
you are not permitted to
throw your life away, Kodama...

241
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,750
Remember?

242
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,541
Regardless of whether or not
you feel it is justified.

243
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,583
Okay?

244
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,083
Yes, my liege!

245
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,333
Huh?

246
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,791
I don't believe this...!
How can I allow myself

247
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:27,291
to bow before someone
who isn't my master?

248
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,875
But then...

249
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,000
perhaps there is something to
serving an even higher power.

250
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,416
They should've been
back by now...

251
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,166
I beg of you, Lady Bell...

252
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,916
Please forgive me for
being so small-minded...

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,625
I finally understand
how trivial I am.

254
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,708
Please allow me to stay here
in exile along with Kodama!

255
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,291
Hikari...

256
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,333
I do not expect you to forgive
my foolish actions and behavior.

257
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,166
However... as recompense
for my indiscretions...

258
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,291
I ask that I may be
allowed to serve you...

259
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,333
Huh...?

260
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,750
Oh, my alarm...

261
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
Huh? Oh, no!

262
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,583
Ah! Kodama?
Kodama, wait for me!

263
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,166
So... You think they're
gonna be all right?

264
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,750
I do...

265
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,500
It seems to me that those two
know exactly what they're doing.

266
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,750
Mm...

267
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,375
But then... why do
I feel as though

268
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,041
there's an alarm going
off inside of me as well?

269
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,916
Damn you! The Floral
Daze Technique?!

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,125
That was a close one!

271
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,166
I came way too close
to missing this show.

272
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,333
So that's what your
alarm was for, huh?

273
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,666
All right, listen up!

274
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,583
My favorite show,
Mr. Holmes, is on at five

275
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,125
and I have to watch it.

276
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,291
How unfortunate.

277
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,416
This program isn't
over until six o'clock.

278
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,625
You two are new here, and
you just barged in on us,

279
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,416
so you don't get to
choose what we watch.

280
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,208
That doesn't matter.
I was here first,

281
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,166
so I'm gonna watch
it through to the end.

282
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,250
Or would you rather we leave
it up to a majority vote?

283
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,166
Majority vote, huh?
Okay, fine with me!

284
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,458
Now who wants to
watch Mr. Holmes?

285
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,541
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

286
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,833
--Huh...
--Hm...

287
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,791
Okay... Who wants to watch
Ninpu Kamuri Gaiden?

288
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,750
I DO!

289
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,166
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

290
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,708
Hey, Urd. I'm gonna watch
Record of the World's Inventions

291
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,833
at five-thirty. Huh?

292
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,791
Then I guess you can watch it on
another TV in a different room.

293
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,125
No way!

294
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,041
This is the only color TV
we have in the house.

295
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,291
Well, unfortunately,

296
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,708
we've already claimed
this room for our own.

297
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,541
Then we'll just have to
decide by majority vote!

298
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,458
I was hoping you'd say that.

299
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,708
Okay, who wants to watch Record
of the World's Inventions?

300
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,291
Oh, brother. Not again...

301
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,958
This program has
been brought to you

302
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,333
by the following sponsors.

303
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,083
I'm so glad I got to see
this episode again...

304
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,375
Hey, Kodama?

305
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,041
Hm? What's up?

306
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:48,000
I've got a snack if you're
hungry. Here, you have it.

307
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,875
How heartwarming!

308
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,375
Here, we can each have half!

309
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,458
Uh, all right then...

310
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,750
Somehow it almost kinda feels
like the old days, doesn't it?

311
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,250
Uh-huh!

312
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,416
Well, I don't care what
anyone else thinks,

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,458
but I just don't
trust that girl.

314
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,875
I have to admit that
I share your concern.

315
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,791
Hikari does seem to be
harboring some ulterior motive.

316
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,041
Frankly, I don't really care

317
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,916
what her and her
friends are up to.

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,666
I just wanted to watch Record
of the World's Inventions!

319
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,708
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

320
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,250
And just what is that
supposed to mean, huh?!

321
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,416
In any case, regardless of
what the truth might be...

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,166
it's not Hikari's fault.

323
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,333
Whoever sent her here
is the one to blame.

324
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,708
Each of us has both a light
and a dark side within them.

325
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,333
Even knowing where
she comes from,

326
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,041
I must believe in the
potential of her light side.

327
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,500
I do understand how
you feel, Belldandy.

328
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,875
But what would you do if you let
anything bad happen to Keiichi,

329
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,625
like it almost did today?

330
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,000
If it comes to that...
then I will protect him...

331
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,250
Even if it costs me my life.

332
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,333
Looks like the drug
has taken effect.

333
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:10,625
Before we were transformed,
we were just two young lab rats.

334
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,333
Our relationship spans
beyond our species

335
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,125
and even beyond
a simple friendship.

336
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,458
I even remember a time when
you split a roach in half

337
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,083
and we both shared it.

338
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,166
Here, Kodama.

339
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,041
You can have the
hind leg, if you want.

340
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,291
That's all right, Hikari.

341
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,458
Why don't you just
go ahead and eat it?

342
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,916
Oh, Kodama...

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,416
If only you hadn't broken
the ninja code and deserted

344
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,458
then things wouldn't have
turned out like this!

345
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,500
At least I can offer
you a quick death.

346
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,375
Here, we can each have half!

347
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,333
Even though a ninja is
forbidden from having emotions,

348
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,291
I can't help feeling
that my poor skills

349
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,416
weren't the only reason
I couldn't kill you.

350
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,958
The truth is that I've been
hesitant from the very start.

351
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,416
So you were still on guard and
didn't eat the doughnut, huh?

352
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,833
I shouldn't be surprised.

353
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,166
You truly are a
first rate ninja.

354
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,875
No, I'm a failure...

355
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,583
A failure, a deserter, and
a disgrace to the ninja clan.

356
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,500
Plus, I had planned
to let you kill me.

357
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,833
I figured that if you didn't...

358
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,583
the master would probably
kill you for failing.

359
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't say that...

360
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,791
Please, Kodama...

361
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,666
It seems you have
failed, Hikari!

362
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,375
I know that voice!

363
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:29,333
The failure of your duties are
a disgrace to the ninja masters.

364
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,791
Aren't you...

365
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,875
I am extremely disappointed
in both of you.

366
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,000
I will be reporting the
course of all recent events

367
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,708
back to our master.

368
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,375
Now, sit back and listen to
the melody of your demise!

369
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,625
Go forth!

370
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,833
Destroy the traitors
and their friends!

371
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,625
Hey, stop them!

372
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,500
What's going on?!

373
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,208
Whoa there! Where do
you think you're going?!

374
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,416
Get off me! Stop it!
You jerks! NO!

375
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,250
Damn! I knew Hikari
was up to something!

376
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,416
If that's how she wants
to play it... Depth--

377
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,833
No, don't!

378
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,125
If you use such a high output
summoning spell, Urd,

379
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,916
then Keiichi could be...

380
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,833
Hey, Keiichi! Are
you all right in here?

381
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,041
--Keiichi!
--Keiichi!

382
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,250
Those born of the darkness
ultimately return to it.

383
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,416
Mmm! I can't hold
on much longer...

384
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,666
Keiichi! Keiichi!

385
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,250
Ah... I'm done for...
Now I'm hallucinating...

386
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,750
Oh, Keiichi!

387
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:06,416
I swore I'd protect you,
even if it cost me my life!

388
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,416
I promised...

389
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,125
...and I will...

390
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,166
--Belldandy!
--Big Sis!

391
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,958
--Aah!
--Ah...!

392
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,708
She's summoning
some kind of spell.

393
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,791
It's the most powerful
purification spell...

394
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,916
Ultimate Demon Destruction!

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,166
Belldandy, don't!

396
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,250
If you use that spell, then...

397
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,625
Aaaahh!

398
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,541
--Belldandy!
--Big Sis!

399
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,500
Keiichi!

400
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,250
Her seal managed to absorb the
majority of the spell's power

401
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,750
before it broke.

402
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,000
It seems that you almost did
throw your life away there.

403
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,833
Oh, Belldandy...

404
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,708
Even after all the
times you've told me

405
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,250
not to use such
high-power spells.

406
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,250
And don't think that
sweet little face of yours

407
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,916
makes it all right! Okay?

408
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,916
All right, you three...

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,458
Have you managed to get your
fill of fighting yet, or what?

410
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,333
As ninjas, the three of us
are bound by a law of blood!

411
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,750
In order to escape this law,

412
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,833
we must either vanish
from this world...

413
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,875
or we can just kill
each other instead.

414
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,750
It has to be
one or the other.

415
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,416
Is that so? But then...

416
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,083
since all three of you are
here right now... together...

417
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,166
Hm? Ah!

418
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,541
Right. There is a third
option, if you want it.

419
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:50,208
What is this crap?! I can't
believe what I'm reading!

420
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,333
Dear Master...
we three ninja masters...

421
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,708
hereby declare... our desertion.

422
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,458
Hm...

423
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,541
Hey, Big Sis!
There's a letter for you!

424
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,125
Huh? That's weird.

425
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,000
According to this, it says it's
from the Goddess Help Line...

426
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,208
Hm...? So, what does the
letter say, Belldandy?

427
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,041
It says we regret
to inform you

428
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,375
that your goddess license
has been suspended.

429
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,458
Hm?

430
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,083
WHAT?!

431
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,500
Well, it figures, right?

432
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,666
The two are thrown
into infinite space...

433
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,666
You're still not perturbed,
even now, are you, Keiichi?

434
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,208
Next time...

435
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,708
"Ah! It Doesn't Matter Where,
So Long As We're Together."

436
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:12,750
Because I'm with you.

437
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,541
Just keep your
distance, Keiichi!

438
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,208
You need to do more
than just be with her.
