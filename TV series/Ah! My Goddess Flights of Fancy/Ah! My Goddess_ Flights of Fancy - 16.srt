1
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,250
What is this?

2
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,333
What's going on?

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,583
What just happened?

4
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,875
It's not a dream or an illusion.

5
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,916
I trust Keiichi, but...

6
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,958
but I... I don't know what
Urd's feelings really are!

7
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,625
What about... what
about my feelings?

8
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,500
Your innocence is
your fatal flaw.

9
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,458
You're the same as he is.

10
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,708
At the very least I can
take some pity on you,

11
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,750
my little sister, by
having you sleep on and on

12
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,541
in tranquility... for eternity!

13
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,500
Look out, Big Sis!

14
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,916
Don't let her fool you!

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,375
She's an imposter!

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,333
But how can there be two Urds?

17
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,291
Skuld, what do you mean
she's an imposter?

18
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,500
Uh, well strictly speaking

19
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,208
they're both technically
the real Urd, only...

20
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,416
Now look here, Urd.

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,916
I don't know what you
think you were doing

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,125
pulling a stunt like that,
but if Belldandy gets upset...

23
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,708
Uh... am I seeing things?

24
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,500
Are there really two Urd's?

25
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,666
What did she divide,
like a cell or something?

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,291
Hold on, lemme think here.

27
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,375
Maybe she has a long
lost twin sister,

28
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,166
and they've just
finally been reunited.

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,166
No, no, it's not like that!

30
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,333
That is my Demonic half

31
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,000
which Mara managed
to separate from me!

32
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,958
Huh?

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,875
This is getting to be a pain.

34
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,625
Mara put a pretty
half-assed seal

35
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,875
on my other half, didn't she?

36
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,416
She's right you know.

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,333
I had Urd restrained with
a program that only works

38
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,000
on Half Goddess
Half Demon hybrids.

39
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,583
So if her Divine
side were isolated,

40
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,291
the seal would lose its effect.

41
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,041
A fault, an abnormality,
a blunder,

42
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:42,458
unbelievable and
unforeseen, oh yeah!

43
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,916
Depth-charge, or some
very nasty medicine.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,166
Which is to be your
pleasure, dearies?

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,916
Now that Urd is in her
fully Demonic form,

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,041
I wouldn't be surprised
if she uses her power

47
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,625
without any restraint.

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,541
So I'll leave the
rest to you, Senbei.

49
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,291
Nein, nyet, no way Jose,
that's not fair,

50
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,291
if we're going down,
we'll go down together!

51
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,000
Ah, they'll find us,
you numbskull!

52
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,791
I know you are, but what am I?

53
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,166
This is a safe
assumption, come...

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,916
I guess they'll be
getting the depth charge

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,250
and the nasty medicine later.

56
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
It can't be.

57
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,458
If Mara was able to
separate the Divine

58
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,750
and Demonic halves of Urd,

59
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,000
which is something even
the Almighty One Himself

60
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,500
couldn't do, then the
Demonic half of Urd

61
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,416
would possess the most
awful, evil powers.

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,541
If her power continues unchecked
and goes out of control,

63
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,458
the sheer magnitude
of that energy

64
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,541
will collapse upon itself,

65
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:40,333
and devastate everything
in the surrounding area.

66
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,083
You must go back to how
you were right away Urd!

67
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,375
If you don't, then I'm
afraid your body will...

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,041
My voice!

69
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,875
Hey, what's the
matter? Belldandy?

70
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,375
Did something happen
to Urd's body?

71
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,333
That information
has been protected!

72
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,500
The separation of Demon
and Divine falls under

73
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,250
"topics of special
significance"!

74
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,875
This leaves me no choice.

75
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,958
Ha ha, how do you like that?!

76
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,291
Oh great.

77
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,791
Now we don't know which
one's the Good Urd!

78
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,416
Please don't be fooled
guys, I'm the Good Urd!

79
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,208
Don't listen to her,
I'm really the Good Urd!

80
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,791
That's not enough
for us to go by.

81
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,833
Now this is the kind of
thing where you find out

82
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,333
by looking into their eyes.

83
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,791
I just saw something
really creepy!

84
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,458
If you are the real one,
then you should know

85
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,458
where Keiichi hides his
dirty magazines, right?

86
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,666
Yes. You see, after Peorth
found them, he moved them

87
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,208
to the third drawer of
the desk in his room.

88
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,708
Well then what about
the chocolates he got

89
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,291
from Belldandy last year?

90
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,208
He thought they were
too good to be eaten,

91
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,958
so he stashed them away in
the treasure box in his closet.

92
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,125
When did you look into that?!

93
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
What does Keiichi do
before going to bed?

94
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,666
He kisses a picture
of Belldandy goodnight.

95
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,333
Be quiet!

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,416
Okay, what does he do
in front of the mirror

97
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,250
when he gets up each morning?

98
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,416
He touches the cheek that
Belldandy kissed and grins.

99
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Next question?

100
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,875
Hey, wait a minute! Why is it
all private stuff about me?

101
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,875
And both of you are
the real one, anyway.

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,708
Hm. I've got it now!

103
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,750
Wha?! Hey, what was that?!

104
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,666
You're the Demonic Urd,
I knew it all along!

105
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,416
That's not nice at all!

106
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,666
You know perfectly well
I'm the Good Urd!

107
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,708
Sorry, but you can't
fool us anymore.

108
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,750
Because you see, the Good Urd

109
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,875
has a mark right here
that I put on her!

110
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,708
Hah. Not too shabby.
Well, for a kid at least.

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,791
Huh?! For a kid?!

112
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,750
You called me a kid again!

113
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,125
No Skuld, stop!

114
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:10,083
Even if she is a Demon,
Urd is still your sister.

115
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,833
Whatever happens
we cannot allow Urd

116
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,250
to lose that half of herself.

117
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,083
Because if she does...

118
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,166
Both Urds will be destroyed.

119
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,625
Yes, that's right,
I am indeed your sister.

120
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,625
And that is exactly why you
won't be getting rid of me.

121
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,208
However...

122
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,375
I have no problem
getting rid of you!

123
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,958
--Help me sister!
--Please, Belldandy!

124
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh Spirits, heed my
wish and my command.

125
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,708
Protect these innocents
and shield them from harm!

126
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,416
But you know I really
have to wonder.

127
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,916
Can you hold up as well
through another round?

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,916
Will you release your seal then?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,041
You can't do that
while you're chanting

130
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,916
your defensive spell, can you?

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,333
Stop it Urd! Please, stop!

132
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,791
Now, be a good sister and
become one with the heavens!

133
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,458
Depth charge!

134
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,916
Explosive electro shock blast!

135
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,041
It can't be! That was
an upper level two spell.

136
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,500
Even more advanced than
the depth charge descent.

137
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,458
Yes, it was.

138
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,166
It's true that those three
can't get rid of you.

139
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,166
However, I cannot allow you
to get rid of them either.

140
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,416
Even if that means becoming
only half of my former self.

141
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,333
Even if it means that
I must lose everything.

142
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,708
Hah, fine with me.
Give it your best shot!

143
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,833
But you're the one
who's going down, not me!

144
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, well we'll see about that!

145
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,833
Ahhh!

146
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,958
Stop it Urd! Don't do it!

147
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,416
Huh? Huh!

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh man!

149
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,625
What's the matter?

150
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,291
You look like you're moving
pretty slow over there.

151
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,541
This is bad.

152
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,291
At this rate they'll all
get caught up in this!

153
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,666
Aahhh!

154
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,791
You must stop this!

155
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,416
Skuld!

156
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,875
Keiichi!

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
As long as you've got
someone to protect,

158
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,041
you'll never defeat me!

159
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, let's do it.

160
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,750
Bring it on!

161
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,583
This is...

162
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,916
Not good!

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,291
Here comes a big one!

164
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,666
Bye bye.

165
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,041
What the?!

166
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,333
Huh?

167
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,666
What's... happening?

168
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,041
Could it already be... starting?

169
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,375
Why does... my body feel so...

170
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,958
Oh crap!

171
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:58,416
I knew you were behind
this all along, Mara!

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,791
Anti-Mara missile....

173
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,000
FIRE!

174
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,166
She got away.

175
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,666
Poor Urd.

176
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,250
She couldn't withstand
her own power.

177
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,708
It's because that body
of hers, unfortunately,

178
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,791
was produced... artificially.

179
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:48,708
What is this?!
What is this pain?!

180
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,250
Uh, milady Mara,

181
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,833
isn't the situation
getting a little... bad?

182
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,041
At this rate, Urd's not
gonna last much longer!

183
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,666
Come on Senbei, it's time to go!

184
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,125
Go? But where are
we going, milady?

185
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,041
Just come with me!

186
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,166
You two!

187
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,708
Yes?

188
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:15,458
Do something about this pain!

189
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,958
Ugh. My body.

190
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,791
I must get my real body!

191
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:28,083
Well I guess that outta do it.
Banpei should be all right now!

192
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,458
I can't believe Urd has
such amazing abilities

193
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,958
when there's no
restrictions on her power.

194
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,625
Unfortunately there's
a lot more to it than that.

195
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,583
It appears that since that
body of hers is artificial

196
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,166
it just can't meet the demands

197
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,208
of casting such
a powerful spell.

198
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,708
Are you saying she's
some kind of a clone?

199
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,250
That is why

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,541
I am certain that the Demonic
Urd will eventually return.

201
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,625
To try and take back my body.

202
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,750
Oh, Urd, but...

203
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,125
At this rate the Demonic Urd
will go out of control.

204
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,250
Belldandy?

205
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,958
What's wrong, Big Sis?

206
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,625
It's no use. I simply
can't say the words!

207
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,583
You mustn't strain yourself.

208
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,166
But... Urd.

209
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,541
This falls under "special
significance", doesn't it?

210
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,791
Uh, "special significance"?

211
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,500
Listen Belldandy;
all you have to do

212
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,416
is shake your head 'yes', okay?

213
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,250
My Demonic half
will eventually go

214
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,833
completely out of
control, won't it?

215
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,875
And then it will
unleash the kind of power

216
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,458
that could destroy the Earth.

217
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,000
That's it, isn't it?

218
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,208
Plus, the loss of control over
her own power will destroy her.

219
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,791
Even if it is her
real body she uses.

220
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,333
Urd, wait!

221
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,208
I already had a vague suspicion.

222
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,000
You see throughout
my whole life,

223
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,833
the Good and Evil
halves within me

224
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,083
have always been
in constant conflict.

225
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,958
I have one last question: do
you suppose that it's possible

226
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,000
for light to exist
without darkness?

227
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,000
I thank you, Belldandy.

228
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,333
Hey! What's that
supposed to mean?

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,708
Mara!

230
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,875
I think she's hurt!
We have to help her quick!

231
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,208
Just forget about that.
This is more important.

232
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,458
Take this.

233
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,125
I can't believe I'm
about to say this but...

234
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,166
I want you to use
this to save her.

235
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,791
Urd's lost it.

236
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,500
If she keeps on using
her power like that,

237
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,541
the replica body won't last.

238
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,666
You've got to do something!

239
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,625
Has she already begun
to go out of control?

240
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,166
The truth is... that I
can't afford to lose her.

241
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,875
Because... I haven't
beaten her at Breakout yet.

242
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,208
Sayonara, everybody.

243
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,208
If she really does
self-destruct,

244
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,083
who knows what repercussions
it will have on this Urd.

245
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:05,291
So please, I'm begging you.
Just save her!

246
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,291
When she said 'Light
without Darkness',

247
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,583
does that mean that she...

248
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:17,166
Please Urd, you mustn't
destroy the Demonic Urd!

249
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,708
I don't believe it!

250
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,166
Whether she's Good or Evil,
she's still just as stubborn!

251
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,375
I'm sorry, but my power simply
wasn't enough to stop her.

252
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,958
Hold on.

253
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,291
This is no time to be getting
depressed and down on yourself.

254
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,750
If you wanna help Urd, then
tell us the separation program

255
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,458
you used to divide them.

256
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,833
We can use that to come up
with a unification routine.

257
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,375
Oh, right!

258
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,458
And you, the little
guy over there!

259
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,458
Go inside and gather all
the parts that look like

260
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,958
they might work in a
'Urd-Fusion Machine.'

261
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,166
Gotcha! Yes ma'am!
Your wish is my command!

262
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,583
We're going to save Urd,
no matter what it takes!

263
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,458
Besides, I still
need to get her back

264
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,583
for always getting to
choose what we watch on TV!

265
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,250
My body...

266
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,750
If I just had my real body!

267
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,250
And where do you
think you're going?

268
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,583
If I'm not mistaken,

269
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,750
it's this real body that
you're after, isn't it?

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,833
Wow, she's already forgotten
her original objective.

271
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,208
I guess that's
just the way I am.

272
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:43,791
It's no use, I need to get
her to use more of her power.

273
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,166
I'm not really sure what you're
aiming at, but I'm over here!

274
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,916
Before she goes
completely out of control,

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,083
I need to push her to the
point of self-destruction,

276
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,333
beyond the limits
of that cloned body!

277
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,208
There they are!

278
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,458
Hurry up, or
she'll be done for!

279
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,000
All right, hang on!

280
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,541
Jeez, that Urd is such an idiot.

281
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:10,166
Why does she always have to go
so overboard with everything?

282
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,166
Damn! Come back!

283
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,791
Still no good.

284
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,291
Yes, that's it, just keep
using more of your power!

285
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:34,750
How about... this?!

286
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,250
Just a little more!

287
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,625
So. I guess that's it for me.

288
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,708
Still. That had to have
depleted a lot of her energy.

289
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,916
The rest is up to them.

290
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,166
That's...

291
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,166
I've got you Urd!

292
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,166
Forget about me.
I'm fine. Just hurry!

293
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,708
Don't worry about her.

294
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,541
From now on, I just
need you to do as we say.

295
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,333
If we can get her to use
just a little more power...

296
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,875
we might be able to get my
Demonic half to destroy herself.

297
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,375
But we can't do that!

298
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,958
Skuld...

299
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,625
We can't do it, because we're
going to save the both of you

300
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,791
no matter what!

301
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,708
Just this once...

302
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:32,416
I just wish you'd listen
to me, just this once!

303
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,708
All right, I will.

304
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,041
I guess I can't call
you a kid anymore.

305
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,375
So have you got that?

306
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,666
Lure the Demonic Urd
to this marker.

307
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,416
We'll figure out
what to do from there.

308
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,500
Where could she be hiding?

309
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:53,291
You can't hide forever!
Come out here with my real body!

310
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,125
There she is, down there.

311
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,041
What is that?

312
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,375
Hmm.

313
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,125
Come down here and get me,
you cloned pile of junk!

314
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,375
The real me is right
here waiting for you!

315
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,166
What, done running?

316
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,541
Are you ready to give
that body over to me?

317
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,458
How about you?
How are you feeling?

318
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,041
You must be hurting
all over, huh?

319
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,708
That'll be taken
care of real soon.

320
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,125
As soon as I get my
body back that is!

321
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,791
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

322
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,041
I think perhaps it might be time
for you to get yourself ready.

323
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,875
Ready for what?

324
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,625
Ready to go back to Heaven.

325
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,500
All right then. I see how it is.

326
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,916
In that case, we'll see
who's destined to die!

327
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,916
Activate!

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,708
Hah, oh please!

329
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
I was wondering what
kind of silly contraption

330
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,625
you'd rigged up.

331
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,708
And there's another one!

332
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,750
No way!

333
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,166
That's just the kind of thing
I'd expect from Skuld.

334
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,583
Talk about truly pathetic.

335
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,958
So are you out of ideas now?

336
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,791
Looks like you're the one
who's going down after all!

337
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,833
So hand over that
body right now!

338
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,458
Wha?

339
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,375
What is this?!

340
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,625
All right!

341
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,250
So, how'd you like
the Urd-Eater I made?

342
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,833
It kinda looks like something
out of a B-grade Horror movie.

343
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,375
All right now Urd.

344
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:36,125
We're gonna reunify you two,
so get in on the opposite side.

345
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,916
--I can't do it.
--Huh?

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,791
My Demonic half
tried to kill you.

347
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,583
If I were to go back
to the way I was before,

348
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,708
I'll have that Evil
inside of me.

349
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,541
I just can't go back
to being that person.

350
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,541
I'm so sorry... for everything.

351
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,666
It's all right.

352
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,166
The truth of all of this is

353
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,458
that the Demonic Urd never
did truly want to kill us.

354
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,166
The Demonic Urd with
her unrestricted power

355
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,500
should have been able to cast as
powerful a spell as she wanted.

356
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:08,625
And yet, all she cast was a
depth charge descent spell.

357
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,375
That's because she intentionally
suppressed her own power.

358
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,416
Even when you were
completely overrun by Evil,

359
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,250
you were still the same old Urd.

360
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,416
So you can go back to being
the big sister we all love.

361
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,916
So are you two all
set in there, Urd?

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay then. Commencing
reunification.

363
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,541
So, are you sure
this is really gonna

364
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,375
put her back to the way she was?

365
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,416
It'll be all right. We must
have faith in our little Skuld.

366
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,750
Please go back to
being your old self.

367
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:08,583
Hey guys, I'm back
to norm-- Whoa, hey!

368
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,375
Oh, Urd! Welcome back!

369
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,625
Oh Urd, it's good to see you!

370
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,250
Well, it's good to
be back. Thanks guys!

371
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:26,166
Oh, how beautiful!
Such gorgeous, adoring sisters.

372
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,625
Come on. I think it's
time we left, Senbei.

373
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,166
Stop right there!

374
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,500
You had a lot of nerve to
run off and abandon me earlier.

375
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,541
So, you value that heretical
pact more than me, do you?

376
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,583
What?

377
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,250
Come on, we're gonna
drink up a storm!

378
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,041
Mara, you're getting off
your butt and coming with us.

379
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,916
But if we're going
to drink, what I'd like

380
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,583
is some of that yummy
tea Belldandy made.

381
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,750
What are you talking about?

382
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,375
When you're pooped,
there's nothing like

383
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,375
the highest quality,
unprocessed Saki!

384
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,583
What happened to her?

385
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,000
It's kinda like there are
two Urd's in one body now!

386
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,375
Hey Skuld I don't get it,
why are the Demonic

387
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,666
and the Divine
personalities still separate?

388
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,916
Mara!

389
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,541
Didn't you put the routine
together properly?

390
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,791
Now that you mention it,
maybe there actually was

391
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,750
a problem with some of the
parts that Senbei brought you.

392
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:18,333
Perish the thought; I carried
out my task to utter perfection!

393
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,416
Come on! Let's go
back, Belldandy.

394
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,083
Back to our home!

395
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,541
Sure, let's go!

396
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,875
Jeez, how did this happen?!

397
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,166
Urd's not gonna be a
Demon anymore, is she?

398
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,458
I'm going to be a Goddess,
through and through.

399
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,750
That may have been
my aspiration.

400
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,041
Next time... 'Ah! The Chair
of Demonkind Descends!'

401
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,333
That's Urd's mother?!

402
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,833
Nice to meet you!
