1
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,500
Ah-choo!

2
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,291
Ah...

3
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,333
It's starting to get
pretty cold, huh?

4
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,666
Yes, it certainly is.

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,208
These poor weak humans are so
susceptible to the elements.

6
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,000
In fact, he might
even catch a cold

7
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,916
wearing such light clothing.

8
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,375
You say you want to take
a few days off from class,

9
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,791
starting tomorrow?

10
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,041
Yes...

11
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,541
Well, with the grades
you get, I don't think

12
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,416
taking a few days off
will set you back too much.

13
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,458
Well, all right then.

14
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,916
Okay... time to get started...

15
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,708
Christmas time...

16
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,375
[chattering]

17
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,250
...a time when I, the
Queen of Nekomi Tech,

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,166
shine my brightest.

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,208
Miss... Mishima!

20
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,458
That's right.

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,708
They all want to
be chosen by me!

22
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,583
But why... isn't
that fulfilling...?

23
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,208
Deep down, I'm unsatisfied.

24
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,791
What in the world could a
woman of my means and status

25
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,000
possibly be lacking?

26
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,958
What's up, Sayoko?

27
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,750
Good morning, Keiichi...!
What the...

28
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,666
Hey, Kei! What's up?

29
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,125
Good morning.

30
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't tell me Belldandy's
given you the cold shoulder.

31
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,833
Aw geez! Are you gonna
start giving me that, too?

32
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,416
Well, that is what everyone
on campus is thinking!

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,041
Hey, give me a break.
It's only been two days!

34
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,875
But you two are so close,
that it makes people talk.

35
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,708
So, you're still all
hot and steamy then?

36
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,041
Give it a rest, will ya?!

37
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,958
Ooooh! You're so scary!

38
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,791
I've got it!

39
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,458
Now I know
exactly what to do

40
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,791
to fill this emptiness
I've been feeling.

41
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,666
There is but one
man on this campus

42
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,833
whom I've been unable
to conquer...

43
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,333
Keiichi Morisato...

44
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,791
I now have my sights
squarely set on you...

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,833
and my heart will surely be
content once you are mine!

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,666
Honestly, Big Sis, when are
you gonna be done with that?

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,208
I'll be finished soon.

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,291
Aw... But all you've
been doing lately

49
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,416
is knitting that stupid thing!

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,333
I'm sorry, Skuld.

51
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,791
I'll tell you what.

52
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,666
When I'm finished, I'll make
you some ice cream, okay?

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,250
Belldandy... surely
you must realize

54
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,375
a goddess among
goddesses like you...

55
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,583
could make a hand-knitted
sweater in an instant

56
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,458
if she used her powers.

57
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,083
I call on you to dance,
my beloved yarn.

58
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,125
Entwine and mingle
together to become one!

59
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,083
Ta-dah! Uh-oh...

60
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,750
Who the heck would wear that?!

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,291
I'LL show ya how it's done!

62
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,291
This is the fully automatic
hand-knitting machine,

63
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,875
Amigo Zero-One!

64
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,416
With this little number, you'll
have your sweater lickety split!

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,875
"Fully automatic" would mean it
isn't HAND-knitted, you know...

66
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,583
Just shut up and watch!

67
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,333
Switch on!

68
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,541
All done!

69
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,583
What the heck is she doing?

70
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,958
Knitting is not just about
simply "making" something.

71
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,000
You knit so that
every single stitch

72
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,791
will give warmth to the
person who wears it.

73
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,208
There are all these
feelings and memories...

74
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,666
that go into a
person's knitting.

75
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,250
I suppose I'll never be able to
understand that kind of stuff.

76
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,833
But it sure does look... warm.

77
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,583
Why, thank you! Mm...

78
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,750
Hey... why are you keeping
this sweater a secret anyway?

79
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,250
Because...

80
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,291
that way it can be
more of a surprise

81
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,416
...for Mr. Keiichi.

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,041
Huh?

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,583
Is something wrong?

84
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,416
Well... it's just that
you've definitely become

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,166
much more like an ordinary human

86
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,875
since you came to
the surface world.

87
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,333
You think I've
become like a human?

88
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,541
Oh...!

89
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,916
I'm home!

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
Mr. Keiichi!

91
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
Welcome home!

92
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,416
So she's planned a surprise...
for our little Keiichi, has she?

93
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,250
Why does everything always
have to be so complicated?

94
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,333
Ha! So you got dumped
by Belldandy, didn't you?

95
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,083
Why would you say that?

96
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,458
Aren't you upset?!

97
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,958
Look, you've got it all wrong.

98
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,166
Is this seat taken?

99
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,791
Hm? Sayoko?

100
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,541
Sitting alone and bored, huh?

101
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,875
Looks like you're in the
same boat right now, huh?

102
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,583
Mm! It's not the same!

103
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,625
Anyway, it's getting pretty
close to Christmas, isn't it?

104
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,541
Wouldn't you like to
spend a wonderful evening

105
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,166
on the town with me, Keiichi...?

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,583
We could rent out a Five-star
hotel and have a gigantic party

107
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,750
or take luxury liner on
a cruise around Tokyo Bay.

108
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,583
It'd be a letdown to be alone
on Christmas Eve of all nights!

109
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,250
I'm flattered that you'd be so
concerned about me, Sayoko,

110
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,458
but uh... don't worry
about me. Really.

111
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,125
Ah...! What do you mean?

112
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, Belldandy has been
with me for nearly a year now,

113
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,166
and she's gone to an awful
lot of trouble for me

114
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
on more than one occasion...

115
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,541
so I figure it's
only right to give her

116
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,125
some time to herself
for a change.

117
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,833
It sounds like you sure have
a lot of trust in her...

118
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,750
But I am curious
what she's doing

119
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,250
with all this "time to herself."

120
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,125
Now you don't suppose...

121
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,791
she's off doing something
like what we're doing.

122
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,375
I guess I never really
considered that possibility.

123
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,166
Ah...! I was only
joking, obviously!

124
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,500
Because if Belldandy really
were that kind of girl,

125
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,791
then I wouldn't have to go
through so much trouble to...

126
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,416
Uh...!

127
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,208
You actually do trust Belldandy
not to do anything like that,

128
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,791
don't you?

129
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,416
Hey, ya know something, Sayoko,
that's what I like about you.

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,583
Belldandy's always putting
everyone else's needs

131
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,125
before her own,

132
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,791
so I'm happy that she's finally
doing something for herself.

133
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,166
On top of that, it's
always a lot of fun for me

134
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,458
to try to imagine Belldandy
as I've never seen her before,

135
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,291
like doing whatever
it is she's doing now...

136
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,083
He's... boasting about her?

137
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,083
Keiichi of all people...?

138
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,500
That's why...

139
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,333
you don't have to worry, cause
it's really not that bad

140
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,750
for me to be on my own
for a little while.

141
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,000
Actually, things are probably
much tougher for you, Sayoko,

142
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,083
since you always have so many
people around you all the time,

143
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
and I'm sure you're
constantly having to take them

144
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,750
into consideration, right?

145
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,916
But I'm positive that Belldandy
and I are gonna be just fine.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,125
Oh...! I haven't said
anything offensive, have I?!

147
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,375
Mm-mm...

148
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,083
Oh, it's almost time
for my lecture!

149
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,375
Huh?

150
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,583
I appreciate your concern.
I'll see you later.

151
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,541
Sayoko made me realize that
it's what's in a person's heart

152
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,416
that counts, ya know?

153
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,333
Hmph! Some "man."

154
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,666
You wouldn't have a chance of
drinking me under the table

155
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,750
in a million years.

156
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,208
Really...

157
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,000
These men truly are an utter
waste of my valuable time.

158
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,250
What a snooze!

159
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,000
Men are just way too dull!

160
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,583
How could a guy turn a girl down
after having her go so far?

161
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,250
Is that normal?!

162
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,583
Uh, hey... are you
listening to me or what?

163
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,541
Sheesh!

164
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,541
What's he mean "it's a
person's heart that counts?"

165
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,708
What the hell would
I know about that?

166
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,416
After all, no one's ever said
anything like that to me before.

167
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,833
Why...?

168
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,416
Why do the words and the
smile of a pathetic guy like him

169
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,333
have the power to
make a queen like me

170
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,541
feel like such a
piece of garbage?!

171
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:14,541
Keiichi, you damn stinkin' jerk!

172
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,458
What is that?

173
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,291
It looks like it's a person...

174
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,333
Sayoko?!

175
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,750
Ah... it's Keiichi!

176
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,125
Oh man, she is
totally plastered.

177
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,166
You're gonna catch a cold if
you sleep out here, Sayoko!

178
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,041
Keiichi!

179
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,041
Waaaahh!

180
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,250
Hey! I'm all over Keiichi...

181
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,291
Now hold on... Sayoko!

182
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,250
Hey, listen. You know what?

183
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:52,333
I never... told you this
before, but I really...

184
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,291
Huh?

185
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,625
Oh... this is bad...

186
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,916
NOOO!

187
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:08,125
Uh... How on earth
did I get here anyway?

188
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,500
Mm... Ah, my head
is killing me...

189
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,958
Guess I drank a little too much.

190
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,000
Hm...? Is this...
Keiichi's place?

191
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,125
Hm?

192
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,041
He never ceases to amaze me...

193
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,208
Don't worry, Mr. Keiichi.

194
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:30,208
This sweater shouldn't
take much longer to finish.

195
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:37,583
Oh, brother! So that's what
she's doing in there, huh?

196
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,625
But I don't understand
why she looks so happy

197
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,041
to be knitting a sweater.

198
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,833
I'm finished!

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,375
I've woven my feelings
into every single thread

200
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,250
of this sweater.

201
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:57,916
And I hope that it will keep
Mr. Keiichi nice and warm.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,833
Mr. Keiichi.

203
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,916
Hey, Big Sis.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,208
You were looking for some
wrapping paper, right?

205
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,916
Just look! I found
some that's perfect!

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, thank you very much!

207
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,458
I'll use it to wrap
Mr. Keiichi's sweater in.

208
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,500
Hey, come here a second!

209
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,041
Is something wrong?

210
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,750
Oh, what's her problem now?!

211
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,291
Geez! At your age you should be
able to zip up your own clothes

212
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
in the back,
for cryin' out loud!

213
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,125
There's nothing wrong...
I'm just touchy feely.

214
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
--Gasp!
--Hm?

215
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,291
It's gone! Vanished!

216
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,875
Mr. Keiichi's... sweater.

217
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,541
AAH! And she's gone, too!

218
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,666
But why...?

219
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,041
She's gonna pay for
stealing your sweater!

220
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,791
Well, we are not yet
certain that she did.

221
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
Come on...

222
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,500
it's not like that sweater
walked out of here by itself.

223
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,666
But, Urd...

224
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,791
There was only one
person near that sweater

225
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,416
when it disappeared...

226
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,583
And she vanished before we
even knew that she was gone.

227
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,916
She's right!

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,166
I can't think of anyone
else who could've done it!

229
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,166
Miss Sayoko is not a bad person.

230
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,583
But still!

231
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,125
You've gotta face the facts...

232
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,333
Ah...!

233
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,541
I have an idea!

234
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,791
The birds might
have seen something.

235
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,708
Tell me... what did you see?

236
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,708
You say a dog ran
away from here

237
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
with the package in his mouth?

238
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,625
Did the bird say why a dog
would've taken the sweater?

239
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,000
All he told the bird

240
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,708
was that the package had
a delicious smell about it.

241
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,458
A delicious smell, huh...?

242
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,250
Stop right there.

243
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,875
I get it now.

244
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,583
The dog was attracted to the
scent of the wrapping paper

245
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,416
and made off with the package.

246
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,291
That's right!
It's the dog's fault!

247
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,333
Sorry but... whose fault was it?

248
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,583
Sorry, Big Sis!

249
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,958
I'll be sure to give you
your full punishment later.

250
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,166
I've got to find it!

251
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,833
Belldandy!

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,458
It's only knitting.

253
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,958
I should be able to do it...

254
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,625
It's not like he'd be
happy about something...

255
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,291
with no feeling in it.

256
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,000
I wonder if he could ever
be happy about something

257
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,375
I knitted for him.

258
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,916
Ahh...!

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,833
N-No, stop!

260
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,416
Hand-knitting nowadays
is just plain silly!

261
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,166
That's right!
If I find their price,

262
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,000
anyone will wag their
tail like a dog for me!

263
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,166
Hello, there's something
I'd like you to make for me

264
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,958
on short notice.

265
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,833
No, don't worry about the cost.

266
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,083
Surely you're like most guys.

267
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,041
You are, aren't you, Keiichi?

268
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,791
Excuse me, I have a
question if you don't mind.

269
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,375
Have you seen a
package like this?

270
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,791
Meow...

271
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,166
Oh... Yes, I understand.
And I certainly do thank you.

272
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,458
Excuse me, Mr. Sunfish.

273
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,708
Have you seen a
package like this one?

274
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,458
Thanks...
Thanks anyway.

275
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,541
I thank you...

276
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,333
Keiichi.

277
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,833
Hey Sayoko...
Are you feeling better?

278
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,750
I am. Thanks to you.

279
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,125
That's good to hear.

280
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,791
Boy, sure was hard to
get that smell out though!

281
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,958
What does that mean?

282
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,875
Oh, never mind.

283
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,375
I see...

284
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,208
It looks like I was a huge
burden on you yesterday, huh?

285
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,041
Oh hey, don't worry about it!

286
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,916
And besides, Belldandy was
the one who took care of you.

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,291
Oh... I really don't recall...

288
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,791
How about I repay you by
treating you to a banquet

289
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,875
of French Court cuisine
aboard a luxury liner?

290
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,208
Actually, I can't
have dinner with you.

291
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,625
Why not?

292
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,708
So you're saying that you
don't want to eat with me?

293
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,250
It's just that
I'm sure Belldandy

294
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,750
already has something
waiting for me.

295
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,333
Hey, you should eat
with us sometime!

296
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:59,333
She's a great cook!

297
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,333
You just... keep going
on about her...

298
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,708
All right then, could we do
something besides dinner?

299
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,291
Well... I guess so.

300
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,666
Let's go then.

301
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,750
Come on, already!

302
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,000
All this searching
and still nothing...

303
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,458
But, I will not
give up my quest!

304
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,416
Because that sweater...

305
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,291
contains all of
my deepest feelings.

306
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,000
Please accept this as
a token of my gratitude.

307
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,083
I never would have
guessed that retro car shop

308
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,250
was run by the
Mishima conglomerate.

309
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,583
Thanks to you, I got to see
their prized collection

310
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,166
of rare model cars.

311
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,000
It's my father's
hobby, you know.

312
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,000
That's where I got those
model cars from that time.

313
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,958
Yeah, that was a pretty
terrible thing you did

314
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,541
to torture me back then.

315
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,750
Well, my father really chewed me
out because of that incident,

316
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,416
so cut me a little
slack, will ya?

317
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,666
It's fun just to walk along
with him like this...

318
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,083
And it... gives me this
strange kind of feeling.

319
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,000
Hey, Keiichi...

320
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,500
How do you think
the two of us look

321
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,958
to other people right now?

322
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,708
Hmm. Good question...

323
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:19,250
Probably like a queen
and her servant, I guess.

324
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,333
Hey... I was only joking around!

325
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,666
Seriously though, I guess we
look like a couple of friends.

326
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,708
You think so?

327
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,541
Y'know. A lot has
happened between us,

328
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,666
but now I feel like we can
just be normal with each other.

329
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,583
And a lot of that is due to
the fact that I met Belldandy.

330
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,416
Otherwise, I'd be the same,
old guy I used to be...

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,750
and I probably wouldn't
even be able to

332
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,958
walk around with you like this.

333
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,208
What's with this guy anyway...?

334
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,083
He doesn't have the slightest
clue as to how women feel.

335
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,583
Hey, Keiichi...

336
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,833
What's up?

337
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,291
I'd be honored if
you'd accept this gift...

338
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,125
It's a Christmas
present from me to you.

339
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,833
I see...

340
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,208
But isn't it a waste
to give this to me?

341
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,958
But why? It's a high
quality cashmere sweater!

342
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,916
You'd never be able
to afford one of these

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,583
with the part-time
wages you make!

344
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,500
But I... still can't accept it.

345
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,541
I don't understand.
What's the big deal anyway?

346
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,041
It's just that...

347
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,541
I feel like it's what's in a
person's heart that counts.

348
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,125
So, are you saying my
heart doesn't make the cut?!

349
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,208
Look, it's not like that.

350
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:35,541
It's just that your heart is
closed off to others, Sayoko.

351
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,250
I don't know if it's
because I'm around Belldandy

352
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,791
so much of the time...

353
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,583
but I think I can sense
those things about people now.

354
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,958
So I think you ought to
give that Christmas present

355
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,958
to someone who you can really
express your feelings to.

356
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,000
Does that make sense?

357
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,458
I see...

358
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,500
Fine! I give up then!

359
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,333
Honestly, I just can't hang
around with you men at all!

360
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,083
What morons...

361
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,833
Sayoko...

362
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,208
Wha...?

363
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,291
I found that next to the road...

364
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,958
I was thinking
I'd just toss it...

365
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,958
but I'm giving it to you!

366
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,000
And if you tell me you
won't take this either,

367
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,458
I'll beat some sense into you!

368
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,666
But, isn't this...

369
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,041
Just take it...
and wear it home.

370
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,166
You'll understand later.

371
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,958
I'm sure... that she's
still looking for it...

372
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,125
Hurry up and go on home!

373
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,625
Okay...

374
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,416
Miss Sayoko!

375
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,458
I certainly do hope that you're
feeling better this evening.

376
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,875
I was so worried about you.

377
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,125
I guess you've been searching
this whole time, huh?

378
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
Well... never mind...

379
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,000
Your feelings are getting
across to him right about now.

380
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,875
Are you talking
about the sweater?

381
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,708
So, I take it
you know about it?

382
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,208
Yeah... After all,

383
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,041
I'm the one who stole it from
your house to begin with.

384
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:11,041
To tell you the truth. I wanted
to throw the damn thing out.

385
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,375
But I...

386
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,916
just couldn't do it.

387
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,375
The reason is that...

388
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,458
you are simply not
that kind of person.

389
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,041
Oh, can it, will ya...?!

390
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
Don't hand me that crap, okay?!

391
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,291
I don't want to hear it.

392
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,750
Okay...

393
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,166
--Belldandy?
--Yes?

394
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,083
I am the heiress Sayoko Mishima.

395
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,458
And I'm... Queen of Nekomi Tech.

396
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,958
So tell me...
who in the hell are you?

397
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,416
I am a Goddess First Class,

398
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,625
Second Category,
Unlimited License.

399
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,708
I am Belldandy.

400
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,541
Oh...

401
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,125
Well then... I suppose
I should just tell you...

402
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
I hate your guts.

403
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,333
Well even so... I shall
still love you, Miss Sayoko.

404
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,541
And now, if you'll excuse me...

405
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,041
What a liar...

406
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,333
You're no goddess,

407
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,416
knitting a sweater
for Keiichi like you did...

408
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,250
I don't believe it.

409
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,458
You're just an ordinary girl.

410
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,375
Hello everyone, I'm home.

411
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,416
Oh, look! It's Big Sis!

412
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,083
Hey, c'mon, Keiichi! Hurry up!

413
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,083
Welcome home, Belldandy.

414
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,541
It's good to have you back.

415
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,541
Ah! My feelings...
They came across to you!

416
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,583
They did!

417
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,916
I'm so glad!

418
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,666
Your feelings came
across all right...

419
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,916
Thanks for everything,
Belldandy.

420
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,416
And you know what...
This sweater is nice and warm.

421
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,416
It's all right.

422
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,041
Because I am the
Queen, after all.

423
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,833
Keiichi... if you think that
I've given up on you,

424
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,083
then you are sorely mistaken.

425
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,833
One of these days,
I'll get even with you...

426
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,875
And I'll make you
regret humiliating me

427
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,791
like you did today.

428
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,208
He tries so hard to return the
feelings of his goddess.

429
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,625
The goddess believes in him,

430
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,625
and continues waiting all alone
for him to come home.

431
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:13,583
Next time, "Ah! I Offer These
Feelings on Christmas Eve."

432
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,125
It's what's in a person's heart
that matters most... isn't it?
