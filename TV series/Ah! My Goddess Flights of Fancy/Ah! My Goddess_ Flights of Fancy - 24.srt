1
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,291
All right. Here I go. 

2
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,708
I win!

3
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,500
A complete hand!

4
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:22,000
I still can't believe I was
beaten last night by Belldandy.

5
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,583
Up in Heaven, I'm ranked number
one in customer satisfaction...

6
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,000
and yet, my luck is
still no match for hers.

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,791
Hey, I'm gonna take
the bike out for a spin.

8
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,625
Okay!

9
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,083
Well, back to work...

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,208
I suppose I should wrap
up my other assignment.

11
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:44,208
My most challenging
mission yet...

12
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,458
I don't know if I can take
another hellish night like that.

13
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,291
But then, that's what
every night has been like

14
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,583
around here lately.

15
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,833
Keiichi?

16
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,250
Hm?

17
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,458
I have a little question
I've been meaning to ask you.

18
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,875
What's that?

19
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,083
I was wondering--if you
don't mind my prying too much--

20
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,208
if you've ever made a point of
telling Belldandy you love her?

21
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,458
Huh?

22
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,333
What the heck kind
of a question is that?!

23
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,375
I've been watching
you for a while...

24
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,500
and what I've observed, while
I've been here on my mission...

25
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,791
IS THAT YOU'RE
NOT EVEN CLOSE

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,166
TO BEING ASSERTIVE
ENOUGH WITH HER!

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,791
This situation is
simply unacceptable.

28
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,291
I will not return to Heaven
and leave you two like this,

29
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,541
in a state of utter disgrace.

30
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,625
Of course not.

31
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,500
Don't patronize me.

32
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,375
Okay.

33
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,041
No, it's not "okay."

34
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,958
Well, Keiichi...

35
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,541
Well, what do you
want me to say?

36
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,041
All right, listen up!

37
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,458
You need to be more proactive--

38
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,500
We're gonna be late for work,

39
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,000
If we don't get
going soon, Keiichi!

40
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,208
Belldandy!

41
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,208
Sure, I'll be right there.

42
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
Just let me get
the bikes started.

43
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,916
All right, that sounds great!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,416
Uh?

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,708
Aaah...?!

46
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,750
Think you've gotten
away from me, do you?

47
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,875
I know deep down you
really do want my help

48
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,125
in telling her
you love her, right?

49
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,791
Hello, Whirlwind Auto Parts.

50
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,416
Oh, yes, we're open today.

51
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:24,416
Yoshihara mufflers?
Yes, we have those in stock.

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
And right now, we can install
one for you at no extra charge.

53
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,166
I can't believe Peorth asked me

54
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,458
if I've told
Belldandy I love her!

55
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,375
I mean, it's obvious I do...

56
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,250
but whether I've actually
said it to her, well...

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,750
Belldandy...

58
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,583
Yes, Keiichi?

59
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,250
I do love you.

60
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,041
Ah... Eh...

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,250
Hey Morisato, what's wrong?

62
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,958
I love you, as well.

63
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,000
Belldandy...

64
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,333
Oh, Keiichi!

65
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,708
Why does this have
to be so difficult?

66
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,041
What's with you?

67
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,333
--AAHH!
--Don't tell me that you're--

68
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,041
I certainly hope that he's
not in any way contagious!

69
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,666
Yes, please do.

70
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
Well, thank you very much.

71
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,625
Would you two like me
to make you some tea?

72
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,125
Yeah, thanks a lot!
Sounds great, Belldandy.

73
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,083
Chihiro?

74
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,166
What's up?

75
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,625
I was wondering...

76
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,500
I know you're, like,
tough and all that, but...

77
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,375
do you suppose a girl
would be happier if a guy

78
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,666
actually told her he loved her?

79
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,083
Look, Morisato.

80
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,625
Uh-huh?

81
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,875
I don't think I could handle you
confessing your love to me.

82
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,666
I don't think I could
handle it either.

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,083
I get it...

84
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,291
You probably assume that
since the feelings are mutual

85
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,250
it's perfectly fine to
leave it unspoken, don't you?

86
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,916
Well, yeah...

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're so naïve.

88
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,833
Uh... what do you mean by that?

89
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,208
You see, the thing is...

90
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,041
Sometimes girls
feel uncertain.

91
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,625
So, even though
we might know it,

92
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,875
it's reassuring to
hear it, as well.

93
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,333
When you can take all those
feelings you have bottled up

94
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,000
and express them in words...

95
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,375
It's worth far more than any
gift you could ever give a girl.

96
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,750
I see... So, I guess that's
really how it is, huh?

97
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,750
Now that you seem to get it,

98
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,666
why don't we put
it into practice!

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,833
--Oh, Bell...!
--Yeaaagh!

100
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,208
Yes?

101
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,958
So it seems Morisato
here says he's got something

102
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,541
really important that
he wants to tell you.

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,625
Something really important?

104
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,750
What is it, Keiichi?

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,208
Well, you see...

106
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,625
Yes?

107
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,791
Um... well, you see...

108
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,250
Yes?

109
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,458
Well, I, um...

110
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,250
How should I put it?

111
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,291
Actually, I...

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,875
OH, ENOUGH ALREADY!

113
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,916
So, Bell...

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,875
Yes?

115
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,291
Do you love Morisato?

116
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,208
I love him very much!

117
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,500
Of course!

118
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,250
So. What about you, Morisato?

119
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,291
Well, yeah, sure,
of course I do.

120
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,500
Of course, you say?

121
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,458
Uh, I...

122
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,083
"You"?

123
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,375
Are you feeling
all right, Keiichi?

124
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,750
Um... well I... feel kinda...

125
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,750
I'm heading over to the DMV!
I'll be back later!

126
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:57,000
But today's Sunday, so
the DMV should be closed...

127
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,208
What a friggin' coward...

128
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,208
I'm gonna give him an
earful when he gets back!

129
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,833
He truly is a coward.

130
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,416
Well, I guess some drastic
measures are in order,

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,583
if he's ever going to be
cured of his cold feet.

132
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,750
You did a wonderful job today!

133
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
Yeah, you, too!

134
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,750
Morisato.

135
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,083
Yes?

136
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,083
I was wondering...
You are gonna say it, right?

137
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:24,916
Uh...

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,291
You will do it.

139
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,750
Right.

140
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,875
He loves her, huh?

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,250
How many years has it been
since anyone's told me that?

142
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:50,083
"I love you". A phrase
you hear everywhere...

143
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
It contains such simple words,

144
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,875
and yet, such great meaning.

145
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,583
And this city... is filled with
"I love yous".

146
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,208
"I love you". "I love you".

147
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,583
What could be holding me back

148
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,416
from telling this person who
means so much to me...

149
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,541
...that I love her?

150
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,083
Right now... I really feel
like I could say it to her.

151
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,458
Right this moment...

152
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,791
Gnngkkk!

153
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,875
What's wrong, Keiichi?

154
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,541
I thought I could do it...

155
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,416
I'll make us some tea while
you put the motorcycle away.

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,750
Sounds great.

157
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,208
After all that I still couldn't
bring myself to say it.

158
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,875
I'll just have to give up.
It's clearly not my thing.

159
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,333
Hello! I am so glad to see
that you're home, Keiichi.

160
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,458
Ah...

161
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,458
Hm?

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,166
AAAH!

163
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,250
AH!

164
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,291
Uh... What the... heck was that?

165
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,666
Oh, come on!
What are you so afraid of?

166
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,416
It's not as if I'm going to

167
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
take advantage of you
or anything, Keiichi.

168
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,416
So then, what are
you doing here?

169
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,916
I should think that
it is quite obvious.

170
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm here for your training.

171
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,166
My training?

172
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,500
That's correct...

173
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,083
I want you to imagine
that I'm Belldandy.

174
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,416
So, why don;t you practice
saying "I love you" to me.

175
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,583
I'm not really so sure
those words should be

176
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,875
thrown around so easily,
you know.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,458
That's just my
humble opinion, ok?

178
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,333
You see the reason
you think that

179
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,375
is because you've set a rev
limiter on your heart, Keiichi.

180
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,166
It is because you know the 
the infinitely deep meaning

181
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,166
that's implicit in the words "I
love you."

182
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,166
And that's why I'm going to
break this limiter for you.

183
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,875
Once that's done, you'll be able
to accelerate those feelings

184
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,083
of yours at any time you want.

185
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,583
A "rev limiter", huh...?
Maybe she's right.

186
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,500
All right, fine. I'll do it.

187
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,833
Good.

188
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,791
Now try turning on the
accelerator to your heart.

189
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,750
Lemme see here...

190
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,541
I love you. AAAGH!

191
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
Oh, no, no...
that won't do at all!

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,541
The words are a melody.
The thought is a song.

193
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,583
Ah...

194
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,833
You have to put
more feeling into it

195
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,083
in order to shake her heart.

196
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,500
If that melody in your heart
can come across to me

197
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,750
then it will shake
my heart as well.

198
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,958
Go ahead... Let's see if you
can shake my heart, Keiichi.

199
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,041
I...

200
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,125
That's it. But you can
do better than that.

201
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,333
I love you!

202
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,416
That's good, but I'm
still not shaking yet.

203
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,166
I love you!

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,333
Give me more!

205
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,500
I love you!

206
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,375
With more intensity!

207
00:11:55,458 --> 00:12:00,833
Yes... I want to send her the
message... with my own words!

208
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,166
Belldandy...

209
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,791
AI really do want
to say it to you.

210
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,875
I LOVE YOU!

211
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,041
That did shake me! But still...

212
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,833
he'll need to do better
than that in order to tell her.

213
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,500
You're still not there yet!

214
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
That simply wasn't
good enough, Keiichi!

215
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,458
All right then!!

216
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,458
I love you!

217
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,625
That's no good!

218
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,500
I love you!

219
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,416
Not even close!

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,291
I LOVE YOU!

221
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,166
Not there yet!

222
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,291
I LOVE YOU!

223
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,666
With more oomph!

224
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,541
I LOVE YOU!

225
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,416
Once more!

226
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,708
I LOVE YOU!

227
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,000
EVEN MORE!

228
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,125
Keiichi, I got the bath
all ready for you.

229
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,416
I LOVE yrwhhg...

230
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,916
Wait, Belldandy,
it's not what you think!

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
Come baaaack!

232
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,791
Well, now.

233
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,291
Things are actually
starting to get

234
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,708
kind of interesting around here.

235
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,750
Wait! This is all a
misunderstanding!

236
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,375
Belldandy, please come back!

237
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,000
Looks like you've gotten
yourself into a bit of a fix.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
I'm not in a fix.

239
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,250
Oh, really? Is that so?

240
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,916
You don't have any
major concerns

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,083
regarding a possible
misunderstanding?

242
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,583
Uhm... Urd...

243
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,750
You weren't by any chance
spying on me again, were you?

244
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,000
Why, I'm just a little
cupid, that's all.

245
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,333
And I'd be glad to offer
you advice anytime.

246
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,291
All you need to do is ask!

247
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,000
"I love you."

248
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
That's what you
want to say, right?

249
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,291
I love you... Ai shiteru.

250
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,000
Je t'aime. Wo ai ni
Ich liebe dich.

251
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,291
Chan rak khun.
Ti amo. Te amo.

252
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,750
Anh yêu em. Sarang ha yo.
Ya lyublyu tyebya.

253
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,083
Where did you learn
to say all that Urd?

254
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,958
It doesn't matter in how many

255
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,416
different languages
you can say it.

256
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,208
What matters most is that is
comes from the heart.

257
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,500
And I understnad that saying all
that can be a pretty tall order

258
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
for such a shy
guy like yourself.

259
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,958
Why do I get the feeling that
you're enjoying this?

260
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,000
That hurts.

261
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,416
I'm simply concerned about you,
Keiichi. That's all.

262
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,958
And that's why I have prepared
this wonderful spell booster.

263
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:28,958
AAAH!

264
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,458
Don't listen to
her nonsense Keiichi.

265
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,708
If you eat this,

266
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,041
there's no telling what might
happen to you.

267
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,875
Excuse me, but it's a little
rude to insiinuate

268
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,250
that my potion is a
questionable substance.

269
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,875
Then maybe you should
give it a try yourself.

270
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,041
Ah!

271
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,583
Now, how about you
kindly show us exactly

272
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,041
the kind of potion this is.

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
Uhhh.. Urd.. Are you feeling ok?

274
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,208
Why, hello there. You're such
a naughty girl, Peorth.

275
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,625
AAAAHHH!

276
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,333
C'mon now...
give us a little kiss.

277
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,333
Whoa, wait a minute!
Now, hold on!

278
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
Oh, Peorth, darling...

279
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,375
I knew it would have
some awful effect!

280
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,500
Hey wait!

281
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,250
Geez, I was only kidding.

282
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,083
That's not the kind of
effect this potion has!

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,333
Good grief!

284
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,708
That Urd is always meddling in
other people's affairs!

285
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
Aren't you always
doing the same thing?

286
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,125
Details... Details... Now
come and have a look at this.

287
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh?

288
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,666
It's Belldandy...

289
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,208
Peorth?

290
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:02,916
Hm?

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,166
I was just wondering,

292
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,583
but why are you so
concerned about me anyway?

293
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,916
Don't you know?

294
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,541
It's because I'm a goddess
and it's part of my job.

295
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,208
And I take great
pride in my duty

296
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,958
of trying to make
you mortals happy.

297
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,000
Huh?

298
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,750
Because there's an
aura that surrounds you

299
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,750
and it simply can't
be left alone, Keiichi.

300
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,458
I have an aura that
can't be left alone.

301
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,583
yes, even as we speak,
it's showing itself again.

302
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,041
And I really can't allow it to
be neglected like that.

303
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:37,083
Whooooaa! AAAAHH!

304
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,666
Yes!

305
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,750
Keiichi, it's you...

306
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,083
Man, she really takes
things too far sometimes.

307
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,125
Uh...

308
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,416
Uh... I, um...

309
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,541
Uh?

310
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,750
What the...

311
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,041
I don't know what
you're hoping to accomplish,

312
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,208
but don't think for a second

313
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,583
I'm not onto your little
scheme, Urd.

314
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,250
I'm not gonna let
you fool me again.

315
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,583
Now tell me what it
is you've given him.

316
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,500
Don't worry.
It's nothing dangerous.

317
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
You said it yourself, remember?

318
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,916
Simply saying "I love you"

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
won't be enough to convey
the true message.

320
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,250
Especially when it's a guy like
Keiichi we're talking about.

321
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,125
Therefore... I've created the
ultimate 'Spellbooster,'

322
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,708
which only amplifies the effects
of the words, "I love you."

323
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,875
I don't know Urd. That sounds
pretty dangerous to me.

324
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,708
You see... What you saw earlier
between me and Peorth was...

325
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,416
It's perfectly all right.

326
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,250
I gues I was just a little
surprised, that's all.

327
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,375
It was some kind
of practice, wasn't it?

328
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,458
Well... I guess
you could say that.

329
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,250
I have to admint that I was
a little jealous though.

330
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,875
Huh? Why were
you feeling jealous?

331
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,416
I suppose it's because hearing
"I love you" from someone

332
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,541
sounded so nice and
I wondered what it'd be like

333
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,041
if it was said tome.

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,500
And how special it'd be if it
happend to be coming from...

335
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,000
...someone like you.

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,125
You see, the thing is...

337
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,666
sometimes girls feel uncertain.

338
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,333
It's not what it
looked like though.

339
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,375
Well, I way just practicing

340
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,666
so that I could
tell you I love you.

341
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:51,291
I love you. I love you. I love
you. I love you. I love you.

342
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,833
Huh? Belldandy?

343
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,208
WHOA!

344
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,625
What happened?!
Did he fianlly say it?

345
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,791
Hey, Belldandy!

346
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,583
What's going on?
Are you feeling all right?

347
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,166
Huh?

348
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,291
AAAHH!

349
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,916
You dirtbag! What have
you done to my big sis?

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
You better have a
good explanaion

351
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,250
or you're in for
a world of hurt.

352
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,375
It's not like that.

353
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,916
I didn't do anything!

354
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,375
I didn't do anything except say
"I love you."

355
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:31,625
I love you. I love you. I love
you. I love you. I love you.

356
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,208
Whoa whoa whoa!!

357
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,625
What is going on here?

358
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,208
Well, that's a bit odd.

359
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,083
I wonder why the effect
is so pronounced?

360
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,333
Clearly, it's because of the
intensive training I gave him.

361
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,500
Urd! Peorth?!

362
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,125
I should have known.

363
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,291
Don't tell me you
two are behind this.

364
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,291
I assure you I had nothing
to do with it whatsoever.

365
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,708
You just said
that it was thanks

366
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,958
to the training you gave him.

367
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,500
You've got a lot
of nerve blaming me,

368
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,708
when we all know it was that
weird potion you gave him.

369
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,333
Would you care to explain
what is so weird about it?

370
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,083
Hey, I'm just telling
it like it is.

371
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,333
Hah! Well, I'D say your
"intensive training"

372
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,125
is what's realtlt "weird."

373
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,500
EXCUSE me?!

374
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,333
Hey, if it's a fight you want,
I'll give it to you.

375
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,958
Stop with this
"I love you" business

376
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,666
or you're going to kill us.

377
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,166
I love you... I love you... I
love you... I love you...

378
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,083
Uh-oh. Sorry. Please help.

379
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,291
I don't get it.

380
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,666
What do they find
so entertaining

381
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,833
about toying with me
anyway?

382
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,083
Huh?

383
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,708
Mm...

384
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,208
Hey, Belldandy. You ok?

385
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,791
Yes. I feel fine.

386
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm relieved to hear it.

387
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,416
I have to admit, for a
while there, I wasn't so sure.

388
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,791
Somehow...

389
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,958
Huh?

390
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,250
I felt like I could
sense your feelings

391
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,000
running right through me

392
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,916
but it was hundreds of
times stronger than normal.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
It surprised me a little...

394
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,375
but it made me very
happy at the same time.

395
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,500
The words "I love you"
truly are wonderful.

396
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,708
Don't you think, Keiichi?

397
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,750
Mm-hm... In fact, I'd say
I couldn't agree more.

398
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,458
Peorth trained me for this.

399
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,625
But... I just wasn't able
to bring myself

400
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,250
to tell you properly before.

401
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,666
I know...

402
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,791
Keiichi.

403
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,833
Hm?

404
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,000
You see, the thing is

405
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,458
I didn't come to until
just a moment ago.

406
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,833
So, would you mind...
telling me once more?

407
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,958
And this time around,
I know I'll be ready for it.

408
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,833
Because those are
the words I wanna hear

409
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,666
from the one I love most.

410
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,250
I guess I really ought
to thank Peorth.

411
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,708
Huh?

412
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,000
It's because of her

413
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,041
and the crazy training
she put me through

414
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,583
that I finally got the courage
to say the words, "I love you."

415
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,000
Belldandy!

416
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,750
Now I'll never
be able to say it!

417
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,208
This time for sure...

418
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,458
This time you won't
catch me off-guard...

419
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,250
We really can't leave
this guy alone, can we?

420
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,291
You said it.

421
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,375
He really has no skills
whatsoever.

422
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,958
You think I'm gonna let him tell
my big sis that he loves her?

423
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,083
I wonder if Morisato
was finally able to tell her?
