1
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,500
Wow... that's pretty cool!

2
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,833
I can also do this.

3
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,791
Ah... ah... ah... Ah-choo!

4
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,833
Hey! What the heck
was that for?!

5
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,375
Just wanted to wake
you from your trance.

6
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,625
But I wasn't in any
trance, you meanie!

7
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,125
Well then, what were
you thinking about?

8
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,500
Well... I...

9
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,791
Hm?

10
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,416
Same as always.

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,083
You simply can't muster
any power at all, can you?

12
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,291
Lay off!

13
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,625
Now, now...

14
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,791
Fine then...!

15
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,458
No big deal that I
can't use any "powers"

16
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:23,500
as long as I've got
Tatsundo Number One here...

17
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,125
Hey, what the heck
are you doing?!

18
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,958
Hey! C'mon, Skuld!
Cut it out, will ya?!

19
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,208
Ah!

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,416
Hey, Big Sis! Welcome home!

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,041
Hello, Skuld! It's a
lovely day, isn't it?

22
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,458
I bought you some ice cream.

23
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,833
You did?!

24
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,083
I'll should have this
ready for you soon, okay?

25
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,958
So why don't you go in
and wash your hands.

26
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,166
Mm-hm!

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,250
All right then,
I'll be in the living room.

28
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,500
Big Sis looks like she
really enjoys that...

29
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,583
I wonder if riding
a bike would be fun.

30
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,500
I think... I'd like to
learn to ride one, too!

31
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,458
Hm... When you turn this crank,

32
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,375
the power is transferred to
the rear wheel via the chain...

33
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,958
And when you grip the lever
connected to the handlebar,

34
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,583
it pulls on a wire,
which engages the brake.

35
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,000
I get it!

36
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,875
And it has springs underneath
the seat to make up for

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,583
the lack of shock
absorbers, huh?

38
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,250
This joint could have
been thought out better,

39
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,166
in my opinion, but still... it's
a simple and logical design.

40
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,625
You wanna learn
to ride a bike?

41
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,500
Uh!

42
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,666
No, that's not what I was
trying to say at all...!

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,750
I'm not jealous of you
or anything like that.

44
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,333
Oh...?

45
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,500
Not you, too, Big Sis...

46
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,583
As a matter of fact,
I was examining this bike

47
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,916
purely out of
scientific interest.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,833
So make no mistake then...

49
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,166
Well, of course!

50
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,958
After all, you don't even
know how to ride a bike.

51
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,375
AAAAAAAHHHH!

52
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,916
Hey...! What's your problem?

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,375
I guess this means
that you CAN ride one?

54
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,958
Of course I can.

55
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,083
Unlike certain
other individuals...

56
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,750
In fact, Skuld, there isn't
anything that I can't do.

57
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,541
You're lying!
And it's so obvious.

58
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,125
All right. What'll
you do if I can ride?

59
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,541
I'll give you ALL
of the ice cream

60
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,958
that Big Sis just bought
for me, that's what I'll do!

61
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,041
You sure about that?

62
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,625
Uh... Um... Huh...

63
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,750
Ooh, this looks SO delicious!

64
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,125
Thanks!

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,958
Mm... Very yummy...!
So rich and creamy! I love it.

66
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,458
What is wrong with you?!

67
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,875
Don't get so cocky just
because you can ride a bike...!

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,125
I could do it if
I really wanted to!

69
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,875
Oh, yeah?

70
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,916
Okay, then if you can't ride a
bicycle in three days time...

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,958
then you've gotta do three laps
around town on a tricycle.

72
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,208
That's fine with me...!

73
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,166
But if I can do it, then
you're gonna hafta ride

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,708
three laps around
town on a unicycle!

75
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,708
So, is it a deal?!

76
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,666
AH! She went for it?!

77
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
A goddess means what she says.

78
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,666
But since it's you we're
talking about here,

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,083
I figure you'll lose
interest in no time.

80
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,458
Just relax.

81
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,916
If you start practicing
right away, you'll be fine.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't brush it off like that

83
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,125
just 'cuz it's someone
else's problem!

84
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,208
Don't you see that my
life is on the line?!

85
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,875
I'll be glad to help you.

86
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:19,041
Let's practice so that we
can both go riding together.

87
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,416
Yeah! Okay, Big Sis!

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,750
Now wait a minute...

89
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,375
Let's do our best.

90
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,666
Having Big Sis on my side

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,833
makes me a hundred times
more confident...!

92
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,500
Now victory is as good as mine!

93
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,500
I think I'm gonna be sick...

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,000
It's amazing. Her mood
changes at the drop of a hat.

95
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,666
Now, let's take our time
and not rush this, okay?

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,708
Okay, Big Sis!

97
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,041
And I'm certain...

98
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,250
that you'll be able to
ride that bike in no time!

99
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,041
All right... Ready?

100
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,958
Uh... what are you doing?

101
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,416
Huh?

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,375
There's no need for you to
hold onto my bike, ya know.

103
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,375
Riding a bicycle
is a trivial feat

104
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,500
for such a great genius
like me, the incredible Skuld!

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,208
Oh, no!

106
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,625
Ya see that...?

107
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,958
These are my special
pro-active elbow protectors!

108
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,208
As long as I've got
these... I... Ahh!

109
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,875
AHH! Whoa... What the?!

110
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
Well, at least I was
on the right track

111
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,916
with these protectors.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
Hm... if these aren't
able to restore my balance

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,083
once I've lost it,
then I might need...

114
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,375
Why not just keep practicing
like everyone else does?

115
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,416
That's it! All I need is to
attach some support wheels

116
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
to the sides of the bike!

117
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,250
Well, that's all right,
but usually...

118
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,041
those are what they put
on bicycles for little kids.

119
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,208
Okay, fine then...!

120
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,583
I'll just have to go
all out next time!

121
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,875
So, as you can see...

122
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,416
I've added a gyro-equipped
auto-balancer system

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,041
and beefed up shock absorbers.

124
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,416
I also gave it more power

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,916
so it'll be able to cope
with the additional weight!

126
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,125
This time it's perfect!

127
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,333
I think you need
to have a license

128
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,541
to drive something like that.

129
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,958
Don't worry about it...

130
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm sure I'll manage
just fine without one.

131
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,208
Look Skuld, the issue
isn't whether or not

132
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,958
you can manage
without one...

133
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,166
WHOA...! Please stop!

134
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,541
AAAHH!

135
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,625
Whaddya know...
She's actually still at it.

136
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,958
Just keep it up...
Keep it up, okay?!

137
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,583
All right, get on with it!

138
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,333
Ooooh! I just know that I'm
never gonna be able to do this

139
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,916
without any help, you guys!

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,750
It'll all be fine...
Because, you see, Skuld...

141
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,375
riding a bicycle is
such an enjoyable thing!

142
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,458
Yeah, Big Sis?

143
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,500
I want you to give
this your best effort

144
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,166
so that we can ride
our bikes together.

145
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,333
Now wouldn't that be wonderful?

146
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,083
Yeah... It sure would...
I want us to do that, too!

147
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,916
Let's give it our
all then, okay?

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,458
You bet! I can do it
because you're on my side!

149
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,000
Hey! What the heck're
you gawking at, Keiichi?

150
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,833
Just prop me up like
you're supposed to!

151
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,625
Yes, Ma'am...

152
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,333
Watch where you put
your hands, mister!

153
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,916
What else am I supposed to do?

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,666
There's nothing else
I can hold on to...!

155
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,666
All right, now just face
forward and steer the bike.

156
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,000
Fine...!

157
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,291
But if you try anything...
you are in for it, pal!

158
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,250
That's it. Push those pedals!

159
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,083
Now relax your shoulders
a little bit more.

160
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,333
Ah! Ah! Where'd you-?

161
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,708
Keep pedaling!

162
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,666
Just keep going, Skuld!

163
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,791
Well, that's a lot easier
said than done, ya know!

164
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:31,083
Please, Big Sis! Help me! Ahh!

165
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,541
Big Sis... you didn't help me.

166
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,125
Are you okay, Skuld?

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,916
You aren't hurt, are you?

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,291
That's a relief! Now...
Let's try it again.

169
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,458
That was really good
for a first try,

170
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,583
so you'll do fine the next time.

171
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,958
Um... okay.

172
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,333
Guess it was just
my imagination.

173
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,541
Maybe I did let go of
the bike a little too early.

174
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:02,375
Well, make sure you
hold it right this time!

175
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,541
Keiichi...
You understood, didn't you?

176
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,708
Yeah... That was my plan,
too, right from the start.

177
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,208
Thank you, Keiichi.

178
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,000
Aaaaahh!

179
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,250
Sorry about that!

180
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,291
Ow, ow, ow...

181
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey, Big Sis...!
You didn't help me...

182
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,458
Come on now, let's
give it another try.

183
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,083
Mm-mm... There has to be
some kind of mistake...

184
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,125
Aaaaahh!

185
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,208
Big Sis not
helping me is simply...

186
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,416
She wouldn't do that.
She wouldn't be that way!

187
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,708
You really have
improved quite a bit

188
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,708
since you first started today.

189
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,666
He's right...
You should get back on.

190
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,916
Why? Why won't you help
me at all, Big Sis?!

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,166
Because...

192
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,541
you need to learn how to
ride a bike on your own.

193
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,375
Big Sis... falling
down hurts a lot!

194
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,250
This is really hard for me!

195
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,750
You still need to
give it your best shot.

196
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,625
But, Big Sis...

197
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,375
Then I'll just put that
auto-balancer back on after all!

198
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,166
And then I can--

199
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,750
That won't do at all.

200
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
But why not?

201
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,875
Because I want you to learn
how to do this on your own.

202
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,958
You see, bicycles are one of
the few things you can ride

203
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,500
that allow you to interact
directly with the dancing winds.

204
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
Sometimes the winds are rough,

205
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,916
and other times they're
gentle and calm.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,958
And you'll come to
know how its density...

207
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,291
varies with the
ever-changing seasons.

208
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,833
For example... it's spring now.

209
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,791
The breath of life, which was
at rest during the icy months,

210
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
begins increasing
little by little.

211
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,666
Life emerges everywhere.

212
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,708
And that's why--

213
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,166
--But I can already do that!
--Uh?!

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,000
I can feel the breeze
and see the scenery...

215
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,041
without riding a stupid bicycle.

216
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,250
But this is a different
sort of experience.

217
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,000
It comes from being able to
interact with your own body.

218
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,875
But I don't care about that!

219
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,791
Please listen...

220
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,291
You don't get it!
You can ride perfectly fine...

221
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,916
so you don't understand
how it feels for me

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,708
to keep falling off that dumb
thing over and over again!

223
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,333
I'll be able to ride
as soon as I reengineer it.

224
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,333
I'm not asking for
any more than that.

225
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,125
I'm through with this!

226
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,166
Maybe we were a little
too hard on her?

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,916
We weren't. Skuld's greatest
difficulty is that...

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,666
she relies on technology
to do the work for her,

229
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,833
just like she's doing now.

230
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,333
But she must learn...

231
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,916
that the true pleasure
is all hers to enjoy

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,458
once she can get
beyond the pain.

233
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,750
Oh, brother...

234
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,375
She gave up, just like
I thought she would.

235
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:49,166
Big deal. What's so
great about bikes?

236
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,333
I don't see why Goddesses need
to be able to ride bikes anyway!

237
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,416
Ah...!

238
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
Amazing...

239
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,333
Huh...? Waaahhh!

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,208
Ah...! Hey there! Are you okay?

241
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,291
Yeah, I'm all right, thanks.

242
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,333
I just jumped a little too high.

243
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,666
No, I was actually
talking about your bike!

244
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,875
Huh?

245
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,458
Oh, no... it's really beaten up!

246
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,875
That doesn't affect
how it rides.

247
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,750
Then I feel sorry for the bike
if that's what you think!

248
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,291
Just leave it over there
when you're done with it.

249
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,583
Okay!

250
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,333
The chain looks
a little bit loose...

251
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,791
I'll just tighten it up.

252
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,458
Wow... that's pretty cool.

253
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,166
You need to keep it
tuned up properly.

254
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,125
You've gotta take better
care of it, okay?

255
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,791
You really like bikes, don'cha?

256
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,541
--I hate them.
--Huh?

257
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,958
Jeez, she sure can be a
major pain in the neck...

258
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:25,083
And all because she can't
ride a bicycle... Hm?

259
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,333
That should be better now.
See how it feels.

260
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,666
Sure!

261
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,708
It's way more responsive!

262
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,166
I'll bet!

263
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,083
Since the chain was loose,
the maximum amount of power

264
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,333
wasn't being transferred
like it should.

265
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,625
I didn't know it would
make such a difference!

266
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,708
Amazing... He's like the wind!
I wish I could do that.

267
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,125
Yeah. It's definitely better!

268
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,750
Well, of course! I mean,
who do you think I am?

269
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:04,166
Who you are...? Oh yeah,
I never did ask your name.

270
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,708
Sorry... My name's Sentaro
Kawanishi. What's yours?

271
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,916
My name is Skuld!

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,875
Okay...! Well, Skuld...
Thanks a lot.

273
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,333
Huh...? What's that for?

274
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,625
What's it for?
'Cuz I appreciate it...

275
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:26,041
And it's what you do when
you meet someone... right?

276
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,916
Uh, I don't know.

277
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,125
Well... it's not as if
I was fixing your bicycle

278
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,000
especially for you or
anything like that.

279
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,583
I was simply...
concerned about it...

280
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,125
So don't get the wrong idea.

281
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,708
I won't. But thanks to you,

282
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,583
I think I might be able to win
the race that's coming up soon.

283
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,833
A race?

284
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,583
Mm-hm. You see, it's right
around the corner,

285
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,750
and it's a pretty big deal, too.

286
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,708
Oh, okay... Well, the
gears are pretty worn,

287
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,958
so we'll have to take
care of them, as well.

288
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,083
Okay.

289
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,666
I was wondering...

290
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,166
Uh-huh?

291
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,083
So, is it true? Do you
seriously hate bicycles?

292
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,666
So you're fixing
a bike even though

293
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,625
you don't know how
to ride one, huh?

294
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,500
What're you doing here?!

295
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,500
Even if you do fix it,
you won't be able to ride it.

296
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,833
How sad.

297
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,375
Oh, be quiet!

298
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,583
What the heck are you doing
snooping around here anyway?!

299
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,125
I won this yummy popsicle,

300
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,250
and I was just on my way
back from getting it.

301
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,875
Fine...! Then go back home
with it already, would ya?!

302
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,750
Yes, Ma'am!

303
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,875
I'll be getting that
tricycle ready for you,

304
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,833
so hurry up and come
home soon, all right?

305
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,375
Well... I think
you oughta go get

306
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,250
YOUR unicycle ready instead!

307
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,916
You mean... you can't
ride a bicycle?

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Ah!

309
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,875
If she loses him as a coach,

310
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,291
she really will be
riding that tricycle.

311
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,083
C'mon, Skuld.
I know you can do it.

312
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,291
I see...

313
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,541
So that's why you left
and came here, huh?

314
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,416
Yeah, my big sister wasn't
really helping me and...

315
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
falling down hurts a lot...

316
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,583
Of course falling down
is gonna hurt, silly!

317
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,500
But people like
you and my big sis,

318
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,208
who already know
how to ride a bike...

319
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,000
wouldn't be able to
understand how I feel!

320
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,375
Just look! See all
the bruises I've got?!

321
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,541
Ah!

322
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
Huh?

323
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,791
Uh?!

324
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
Hey! What's the deal?

325
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,416
I'm sure I've got just as many
bruises as you, if not more!

326
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
But, still!

327
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,791
I think what makes bikes so much
fun is that they can fall over,

328
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,083
but you ride them
so that they won't.

329
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,458
It's not any fun
to ride something

330
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,958
that doesn't fall over.

331
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,250
What's the point in that?

332
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,458
What are you talking about?

333
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,541
That doesn't make
any sense at all!

334
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,625
It doesn't?

335
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,625
Not really!

336
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,125
Well, don't worry
about the details.

337
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,375
Have you got some time now?

338
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,541
I guess so...

339
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,041
Okay... then hang
out with me for a while!

340
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,083
Huh?

341
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,750
Uh-huh...

342
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm back.

343
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,333
Welcome home, Urd.

344
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,666
Say, do we happen to have
a unicycle lying around?

345
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,375
Huh?

346
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,708
Oh, and another thing...

347
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,125
Skuld was wondering if
you'd like to join her...

348
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,333
for a bike ride...

349
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,333
I'm telling you it doesn't
matter how many times I try!

350
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,083
You can do it!
All you gotta do is pedal.

351
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,166
But I...

352
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,333
Don't worry about it...
Okay, off we go!

353
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,333
C'mon, Skuld! Pedal!

354
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,708
But I can't do it!

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes, you can!

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,166
Whooaaa!

357
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,708
Yeah, that's it...!

358
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,500
Engine output, eighty percent...
Engine... Number One, fire!

359
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,791
"Engine Number One, fire...?"
What does that mean?

360
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,833
Who cares...
I'm riding a bicycle!

361
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,708
All right!
Here comes the slalom!

362
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,708
Aaahh!

363
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,125
That was SO awesome!

364
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,083
Well? Having fun?

365
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,333
Yeah, this IS fun!

366
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,291
Would it... be all right...

367
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,125
if we went a little bit farther?

368
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,333
Sure. But you know what...

369
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,125
It's more fun to
ride on your own!

370
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,041
Hey, what the heck do
you think you're doing?!

371
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,458
Don't give up now!
Keep pedaling!

372
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,583
What...?! But... I can't...

373
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't look back!

374
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,000
But I...

375
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,541
If you keep on
relying on others,

376
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,791
you'll never learn how
to ride on your own!

377
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:06,000
Just keep pedaling!
It's okay if you fall.

378
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,541
I can do it!
I can ride a bicycle!

379
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,916
Way to go! You're doing great!

380
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,333
It's true. Riding on your
own really is amazing!

381
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,083
Ah?!

382
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,958
But this is a different
sort of experience.

383
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,750
It comes from being able to
interact with your own body.

384
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,541
I get it now.

385
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,791
I understand what she
was trying to say.

386
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,041
I'm gonna take your bike
for a little spin, 'kay?

387
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,000
No problem!

388
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,875
Huh?

389
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,625
I'm sorry about before, Big Sis.

390
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf!

391
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,375
I won't give up on
things so quickly.

392
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,875
And I won't rely on so
much gadgets to help me.

393
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,291
I'll give it my all...

394
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:05,708
until I'm able to
do it... on my own.

395
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,916
Big Sis, I think I'll
give up this turning over

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,916
a new leaf thing after all...

397
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,541
I can't go any farther...

398
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,000
Big Sis!

399
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,791
Urd said that she was
down by the riverbank...

400
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,625
Hey, Big Sis!

401
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Skuld!

402
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:02,791
Oh, Big Sis... I finally did it!

403
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,958
You were able to find
the true path after all.

404
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,666
I'm so glad that
you were finally

405
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,875
able to understand
what a pleasure this is.

406
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,458
Now stay still
for just a moment.

407
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,166
Mm-hm.

408
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,583
There.

409
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,666
Hey... It doesn't hurt anymore!

410
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,500
--Sentaro...
--Huh?

411
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,958
I can give this back to you now.

412
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,958
--Ah... I um...
--Hm?

413
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,583
I just...

414
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,875
Yeah?

415
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,333
Uh... Thanks a lot.

416
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,791
What's that for?

417
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,416
I appreciate it...
or whatever...

418
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,125
You did the same thing, right?

419
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,875
Oh, right!

420
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:01,708
Uh... well I... I'm gonna
go practice my riding!

421
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,833
Ah!

422
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,458
Oh, Skuld...

423
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:25,083
Caring about people is what
gives goddesses their strength.

424
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,000
Could it be?

425
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,208
Ooh, look! It's my angel!

426
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,666
I guess this means you're a
bona-fide goddess now, huh?

427
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,958
So? What can she do?

428
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,708
Um, well, she uh...

429
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,750
Next time, "Ah!
My Darling Cupid."

430
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,916
I wonder if she's made
any moves on Sentaro.

431
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,083
I hear they rode
together to the next town.
