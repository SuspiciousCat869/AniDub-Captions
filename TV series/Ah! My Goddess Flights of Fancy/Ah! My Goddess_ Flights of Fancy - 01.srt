1
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,625
Most people...

2
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:43,500
live their entire lives
in search of happiness.

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,958
Goddesses sometimes
bestow a little bit

4
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,500
of that happiness
to a selected few.

5
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,750
What's more...

6
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,750
a goddess can also
find her own salvation

7
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,250
through that special
person's smile.

8
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,250
And this... is the
story of a man

9
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,916
who accepted the love
of one such goddess.

10
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,833
I have returned at last...

11
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,541
Eleven months and
three days have passed

12
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:28,375
since I left this place in order
to further my ascetic training.

13
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,333
It was all so that I might
be able to bring happiness

14
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,333
unto people as
Miss Belldandy does.

15
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,375
Focused on that thought,
I continued with my journey.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,500
Seeking out songs to
cleanse people's hearts,

17
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,875
I went to every place
where songs could be found.

18
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,000
And now...

19
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,000
at long last I have returned

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,083
to report what my
training has yielded.

21
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,833
My word, the place certainly
is in excellent shape!

22
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,291
I'm sure the temple is pleased
at how things have turned out...

23
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,083
Well, I suppose I should
go say hello now.

24
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,875
What's going on here?!

25
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,458
There is no way
I am going to put up

26
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,708
with any of your nonsense today!

27
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,833
Now hold on!

28
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,666
What on earth are
you talking about?!

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,500
Gimme a break, will ya!

30
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,750
It's not fair!

31
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,666
You're always making
fun of my inventions!

32
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,375
Well, I'll have you know
that I'm plenty helpful

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,333
to Big Sis, so there,
you big meanie!

34
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,458
What a disgrace!

35
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,166
Quarreling before
the image of Buddha!

36
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,833
Well, she's the one
who carelessly spilled

37
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,291
the precious "love at
first sight" potion

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,750
that I had
painstakingly prepared!

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,166
Oh, yeah?!

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,125
Well, who's the moron who
annihilated my lawn mower

41
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,041
by dropping depth
charges on it, huh?!

42
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,125
I command both of you--

43
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,000
stop this dreadful
bickering at once!

44
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,916
Clearly, what you
two lack is love!

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,833
Therefore, listen
to my song of love,

46
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,875
which I shall
now perform for--

47
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,333
I summon lightning!

48
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,416
Banpei Scud, go!

49
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,750
Cut it out!

50
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,250
For cryin' out loud,
what the heck are you

51
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,875
ranting and raving
about over there?

52
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,375
Yeah! For a stranger,
you sure have been making

53
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,666
an awful lot of noise
in our garden, mister!

54
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,625
Just who do you think
you are, little girl?!

55
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,166
This is MY temple! And that
insolent manner of yours

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,166
is going to corrupt
your heart, young lady!

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,291
Now then, be still and listen
my song, and afterwards,

58
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,875
you will cast aside
all your skepticism--

59
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,208
AAAHHH!

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,041
I have failed...

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,666
There is still
much more to learn.

62
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,625
I cannot yet face Miss Belldandy
after such an incident!

63
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,875
I shall resume my spiritual
training immediately!

64
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,083
Some acquaintance of Big Sis's?

65
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,500
Beats me.

66
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,583
Here you are!

67
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,208
Thanks.

68
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,708
That was a huge crash earlier.

69
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,416
Are you sure everything's okay?

70
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,333
Yeah, it was probably
just Urd and Skuld

71
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,708
battling it out yet again...

72
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,625
They take sibling rivalry
to a whole new level!

73
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, but that is simply because
those two get along so well.

74
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,708
You know, just like
you and Mr. Keiichi!

75
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,750
And what the heck
was that about, Kei?

76
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,791
You know, there simply
aren't many sisters like me,

77
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,833
who care so deeply for
their older brothers!

78
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,208
If that's the case,

79
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,041
then I wish you'd keep
your distance a little more.

80
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,916
So you're trying to
say that my being here

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,250
is keeping the two of you
from being all alone together,

82
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,000
isn't that right, Kei?

83
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,625
Oh, of course that's not true.

84
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,041
The more the merrier
I always say!

85
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,916
You know what, Kei?
I really pity you.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,666
Mister Keiichi?

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,625
It's hard to believe,
but it's been

88
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,291
almost a year since you
came to this old temple.

89
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,041
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,333
It is also difficult to
believe it has been so long

91
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,291
since Keiichi and I made
our contract with each other.

92
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,708
There's a "contract?!"

93
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,958
Oh...?

94
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,416
So there's some kind of
financial arrangement

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,208
that keeps you two together?

96
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,041
I think you've got
the wrong idea.

97
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,291
You see, the contract
Mr. Keiichi and I are bound by

98
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,708
is a heavenly one.

99
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,000
Belldandy, you're so weird.

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,166
Belldandy and her companions
successfully terminated

101
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,291
the Ultimate
Destruction Program.

102
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,166
As for the data lost in
sealing the gate of Hades,

103
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,583
all has returned to normal,
save for five percent,

104
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,458
which was unrecoverable.

105
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:59,000
My, Mara certainly made a mess
of things with that program...

106
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,375
Almighty One?

107
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,875
What is it?

108
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,250
In this case, the Goddess
Help Line registration file

109
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,291
was among the areas
that were damaged.

110
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,666
And so I wondered...

111
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,500
will Belldandy
still be permitted

112
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,541
to remain on the surface world?

113
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,875
You are referring
to her contract?

114
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

115
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,333
Because of the Lord
of Terror fiasco,

116
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,708
the time one can spend on the
surface world is now limited.

117
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,500
Hence, Belldandy must eventually
return to her duties here.

118
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,041
I shall contact him personally.

119
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,208
You are dismissed.

120
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,916
Understood.

121
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,166
We've got Professor Kasahara's
lecture today, right?

122
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,166
Yes! I'm really looking
forward to it.

123
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,166
Oh, hey... you guys going out?

124
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,875
Yeah, we're going to class.

125
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,041
Ooh! Then I'll come with you!

126
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,083
Hello. Morisato residence.

127
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,875
HUH?!

128
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,708
What do you mean it's...
"you"? Who is this?

129
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,125
Wha...?!

130
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,333
--THE ALMIGHTY ONE?!
--WHAAAT?!

131
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,041
Are you a party to the contract?

132
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,166
Uh... Yes, sir!

133
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,541
He... called for Keiichi?!

134
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,750
How come?

135
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,375
Regarding your contract,
I apologize but,

136
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,875
as it was destroyed,
I cannot allow the goddesses

137
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,416
to stay on Earth for such
an extended period of time.

138
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,125
I know the Lord of Terror
incident was difficult for you,

139
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,791
so I have decided to
grant a short moratorium.

140
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,375
Therefore, I suggest you
find some sense of closure,

141
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,291
if possible.

142
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
That's not such an easy
situation to deal with

143
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,666
out of the blue...

144
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,583
Even if it was the
Lord of Terror's fault,

145
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,125
they were still the ones
responsible for losing the data,

146
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,250
so Keiichi's not
to blame at all!

147
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,083
But since the Almighty One
contacted me directly,

148
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
there's not much
I can do about it...

149
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,333
So what are we gonna
do now, Big Sis?

150
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,750
He has not stated that we need
to return heaven immediately.

151
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,875
And besides, I am
not the only one

152
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,750
working for Heaven's
Goddess Helpline.

153
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,208
There are many others,
so I do not believe

154
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,583
they are in danger of being
shorthanded anytime soon.

155
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,916
If you say so...

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,333
But still, it doesn't make
any sense to me how it's

157
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,916
possible Keiichi's wish was
the only one that got deleted.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,208
Unless someone erased something
along with the Lord of Terror.

159
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,375
What's your problem?!

160
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,916
Are you trying to
blame ME for this mess?!

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,916
Who's the one who got
possessed by the Lord of Terror,

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,625
and seemed to enjoy destroying
the whole town so much, huh?!

163
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,250
Now that's something
I wish had gotten erased.

164
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,541
Well, it's not going away!

165
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,625
I have found some
fragments, but I'm afraid

166
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,916
the damage to the essential
voice data is extensive.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,458
If I can restore this data,

168
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,458
it may be possible
to play it back.

169
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,750
So, I take it that the
contractor's original pact

170
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,041
is required?

171
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,666
Correct.

172
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,416
Contact him immediately.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,333
Right. I'll connect the call.

174
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,500
Hello?

175
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,083
What? You say you
can recover it?!

176
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,583
Simply put, what it means
is that they're going to

177
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,625
reenter Keiichi's wish
into the system...

178
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,458
so that his file
can be reinstated.

179
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,000
And that's okay with you,
isn't it, Keiichi?

180
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,208
Yeah, of course it is!

181
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,500
Are you ready?

182
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,625
Well then, why are you so tense?

183
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,708
Relax. This should
be a piece of cake.

184
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,666
Uh... yeah...

185
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,958
Just stay cool...
I've gotta stay cool!

186
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,250
Voice monitoring
has been activated.

187
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,833
Please proceed.

188
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,375
Right... Okay. Uh, uh...

189
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,291
C'mon! Hurry it up already!

190
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,083
I'm trying to, Urd!

191
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,666
I'd like for a
goddess... like you...

192
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,333
to stay at my side forever.

193
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,833
Well, that oughta do
the trick, right guys?

194
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,375
The system was unable
recognize your response.

195
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,916
Please repeat.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,916
I'd like for a goddess like you
to stay at my side forever!

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Isn't that what I said before?!

198
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,458
Unable to recognize.

199
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,208
It is likely you have
mistaken one or more words.

200
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,750
That's impossible...

201
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,250
Geez! How could
you have forgotten

202
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,166
your own wish, you big dummy?!

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,583
But I'm positive
I said it right!

204
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,291
I wish I could live
with a goddess like you!

205
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,875
I wish I had a
girlfriend like you!

206
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,333
I wish I could eat some
of your home cooking!

207
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,625
Do you want to go to
the museum with me?!

208
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,416
I'm impressed you
rattled all that off.

209
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,250
Responses unrecognized.

210
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,083
I wonder if the system
is so damaged

211
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,708
that voice recognition
isn't possible?

212
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,083
Hm? Ah, Belldandy...

213
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,416
don't you have the
passphrase recorded?

214
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
I do...

215
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,208
So...? What's the matter?

216
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,333
The passphrase has
been protected...

217
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,083
which means that even
I am prevented from

218
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,583
speaking the code words aloud...

219
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,125
And he said it incorrectly.

220
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,333
There's this memory
restoration hammer...

221
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,875
And my memory
restoration potion.

222
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,791
So which would you prefer?

223
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,125
Hold on a second! I'm trying
to remember it right now!

224
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,958
Then let us help you
speed up the process.

225
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,583
Yeah! You're really
the lowest of the low

226
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,500
to have forgotten your
agreement with Big Sis!

227
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,166
Maybe getting hit by
a few depth charges

228
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,250
would help you out?

229
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,000
Or how about Banpei's
special attack!

230
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,791
Listen, before you do
any of that stuff...

231
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,958
That is enough!

232
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,666
Please try to put yourselves
in Mr. Keiichi's place!

233
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,416
Perhaps it's time we left
for school now, Mr. Keiichi.

234
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
Huh?

235
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,708
You're going to class
at a time like this?!

236
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,291
In troubling times, a change
of pace is often helpful.

237
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,708
Right, Mr. Keiichi?
Wouldn't you agree?

238
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,541
--Uh-huh...
--Uh-huh...

239
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,125
I think it is best not to
worry about it too much.

240
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,875
It was certainly
no fault of yours

241
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
that the contract was deleted.

242
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,291
Given that, the
first internal...

243
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,875
Well, yeah. But even so...

244
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,916
that wish I made is the
only reason that you and I

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,666
can come to class
together like this

246
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,541
and go to work together and
all the other stuff we do...

247
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,875
Thanks to the wish you made,

248
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,041
we can always be together
like we are right now,

249
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,375
is that what you mean?

250
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,916
Exactly...

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
so the fact that the wish is
so important, and I forgot it...

252
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,291
What have you forgotten
now, Morisato?

253
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,666
I didn't see you there!

254
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,833
Um, it's just that

255
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,458
I don't know what
the combustion rate is

256
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,333
in this internal
combustion engine!

257
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,833
What did you say?!

258
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,708
You're in the Auto Club,
and you don't know

259
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,791
a basic thing like that?!

260
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,833
You're a disgrace
to the Auto Club!

261
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,166
You oughta be
ashamed of yourself!

262
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,750
We should give you some
intensive study right now!

263
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,916
Prepare yourself!

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,375
But I've, uh, gotta
go to work after this!

265
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,125
An engine's capacity
is the displacement...

266
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,375
I apologize, but you'll
have to excuse us.

267
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,458
Mr. Keiichi and I have
to get to work now.

268
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,708
Come on, Mr. Keiichi,

269
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,000
we have to get ready or
we'll be late for work.

270
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,833
I see you've returned.

271
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,458
Well, I won't be able
to solve anything

272
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,208
if I stay down on the surface.

273
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,750
Seriously, can't you just
get into the main system

274
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,166
and retrieve the code?

275
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,625
That would constitute
a very serious crime!

276
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,208
We can't afford
to be reckless...

277
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,833
We're already pushing it with
what we're doing right now.

278
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,166
That's funny, I came back here

279
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,250
with every intention
of pushing things.

280
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,416
Hello and welcome!

281
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,666
So you would like me to warm
this up for you, correct?

282
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,000
No problem at all!

283
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh, Spirit of Fire,
heed my call!

284
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,916
You are a heavenly blessing.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,666
Bring warmth to this man's food!

286
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,791
There you are!
Thank you for your patience!

287
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,791
Please come again!

288
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,083
But why...
Why did you do that?

289
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,583
Because you said you wanted us

290
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,541
to be alone together,
Mr. Keiichi.

291
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,083
The truth is...

292
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:36,416
we might not have very much time
left for us to be together.

293
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,250
So when I thought
about that, I...

294
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,541
I see.

295
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,125
We're back.

296
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,250
What's all this stuff for?!

297
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,750
It leads into Skuld's room...

298
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,875
If this is how it's gonna be,
then I'll just hafta

299
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,083
hack into the core and swipe
the code from my Big Sis's file!

300
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,916
Once my "Hello,
Hackman" is complete,

301
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,333
nothing will be impossible!

302
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,166
What's she doin' in there?

303
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,500
Whatever it is...

304
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,791
I'm sure it's because
she's concerned about you.

305
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,750
And maybe I can get
Big Sis to become

306
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,666
disgusted with that
slob, Keiichi...

307
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,708
and then she'll praise
me and say things like,

308
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,708
"Oh, what a wonderful job
you've done, my beloved Skuld!"

309
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,875
"Concerned," huh?

310
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,458
All right, I'm almost done!

311
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,625
Here you go.

312
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,333
Thanks, Belldandy.

313
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,583
Is there something wrong?

314
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,791
Uh... no, it's nothing...

315
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, thanks for the meal!

316
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,750
It seems like...

317
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,250
She's always putting
on a smile for me...

318
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,333
so I guess I should do the
same for her, shouldn't I?

319
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,416
Because seeing
Belldandy smile...

320
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,833
is what I want the most.

321
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,375
Especially with the
way things are now...

322
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,875
Belldandy?

323
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,291
Yes?

324
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,333
It's Sunday, and
the weather's nice...

325
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,875
So I was just wondering if maybe
you'd like to go out with me.

326
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,208
I'd love to. Where do
you think we should go?

327
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,625
Um... Well, I...

328
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,708
haven't really figured
that part out yet...

329
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,958
I was hoping that we
could go on a date.

330
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,333
Because I want to treasure

331
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,291
the rest of the time
that we spend together.

332
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,458
Sure!

333
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,166
All right then, I'll go
make some lunch for us!

334
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,291
Okay.

335
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,625
Well, this is what
I wanted, but suddenly

336
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:46,166
the fact I called this a date
has made me a little nervous.

337
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,458
I mean, do I honestly
have that kind of courage?

338
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,125
No... I decided that
this was going to be a date.

339
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,166
That much, at least I can...

340
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,166
Is something the matter?

341
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,125
No, of course not!
Nothing's the matter.

342
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,416
Well, should we get going?

343
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,833
Uh, Mr. Keiichi?

344
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,500
Mr. Keiichi?

345
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,041
Uh...?

346
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,916
I've just realized that today
is the very first time that

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,458
you invited me
on an actual date.

348
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,541
Since our time together
might be limited,

349
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,083
we should try to make
the most of this day.

350
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:24,333
Well, I guess it'd be
pointless to force it.

351
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,333
Oh, brother...

352
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,375
Couldn't they at least
hold each other's hands?

353
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,708
Are you positive it's
okay to be doing this?

354
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,625
Don't worry. It's fine!

355
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,208
Honestly, all we're doing here

356
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,500
is gathering
Keiichi's voice data...

357
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,000
What a beautiful view!

358
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,166
Belldandy really does look
best when she's smiling.

359
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,750
And she does seem to
be enjoying herself.

360
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,583
Mr. Keiichi!

361
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,041
Thanks, that'll be
six dollars, please.

362
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,958
Oh, damn!

363
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,083
I already used up all
of last month's earnings

364
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,458
to buy gas for today!
I'm such a loser!

365
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,791
Here Mr. Keiichi...

366
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,541
Why don't you let me
pay for it this time?

367
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,041
I couldn't! The guy's
supposed to pay for stuff!

368
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,458
Please, I have not used
any of my recent earnings,

369
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,958
so why don't you let me
pay to for it this time, okay?

370
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,166
Thank you very much!

371
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,500
Well, looks like you
talked me into it.

372
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,250
Good!

373
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,333
Over here!

374
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,666
Wait up!

375
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,916
Here you go.

376
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,625
Man, I have to say, it sure is
nice to eat lunch outside

377
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,500
in a place like this.

378
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,041
So, how do you like it?

379
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,750
Mm... delicious!

380
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm so glad!

381
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,541
Um, so... Are you
having a good time?

382
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,625
Why, of course I am.

383
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,875
It sure would've been nice if we
could've had a lot more dates

384
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,583
just like this one,
don't you think?

385
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,458
Yes, I agree. It would've.

386
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,041
How about we head up and
check out the observation deck?

387
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,958
It'll be an even
nicer view than this.

388
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,958
Sure!

389
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,625
Let's go!

390
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,291
Couldn't I just...
at least hold her hand...?

391
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,541
Mr. Keiichi!

392
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,250
Is everything all
right up there?

393
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,208
Sorry...! I'm coming!

394
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,625
Oh, no!

395
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,750
Waaaaahhh!!!

396
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,125
Spirit of the Wind,
heed my call.

397
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,416
Gather at my command,
and save him!

398
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,750
You are safe!

399
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,333
Thank you, Belldandy,
you really saved me.

400
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,666
Well... Don't do it again.
You really scared me.

401
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,708
Oh, it was nothing at
all, really! I'm fine.

402
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,708
Please excuse us.
Let's go, Belldandy!

403
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,791
Okay!

404
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,375
You've really been such a great
help to me this past year...

405
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,958
But in return...

406
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,500
I haven't really done
anything for you,

407
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,500
and I have to say,
today is no exception...

408
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,500
No, it's not like that at all.

409
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,458
I know you have always tried
to be considerate of me

410
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,541
and have kept me
in your thoughts.

411
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,041
Your kindness is enough
to make me forget

412
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,541
that the reason I am
here is because of

413
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,125
a contract from
the Goddess Helpline.

414
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,333
In that case... I hope you know

415
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,916
I really do want to be
with you forever, Belldandy.

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,166
I feel the same.

417
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,625
Then I think...

418
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,541
as long as we feel this way...

419
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,000
we'll should be
able to be together.

420
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,125
And... if you do go back...

421
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,083
we'll be able to
meet again some day.

422
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,958
I believe you're right.

423
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,583
This does'nt mean that
we'll never be able

424
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,208
to see one another again.

425
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,666
Because...

426
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,833
if there is ever a time when
you have a need for me...

427
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,291
then I think my feelings
will be able to reach you

428
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,875
no matter where you are.

429
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,625
Because my feelings...
will never change.

430
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,125
Belldandy?

431
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,875
Yes?

432
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,083
You know something...?
I was just thinking...

433
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,250
That I'd like for a goddess...

434
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,958
like you, to stay
by my side forever.

435
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,500
I would like that as well...

436
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,666
Reaction commencing!

437
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,291
Whoa!

438
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,208
You see, it is just like I said!

439
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,416
It worked! Voice recognition!

440
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,458
Voice data confirmed.
Contract is approved.

441
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,125
We did it!

442
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,875
All your snooping did
just the trick, Urd!

443
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,791
Hey Lind, thanks for your help.

444
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,375
No need for thanks.

445
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,541
After all, I have
done nothing here.

446
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,375
Yeah Urd, and you yourself
did even less than that.

447
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,625
What was that for?

448
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,291
Nothing! I was only kidding!

449
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,875
Well, then, I guess
I'll be heading

450
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,916
back to the surface world.

451
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
Mr. Keiichi...

452
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:31,333
Here's to us, and our
continued life together!

453
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,333
Belldandy...

454
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,250
You bet.

455
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,625
Here's to us.

456
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,083
You know...

457
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,041
I shall always be here...
by your side.

458
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,500
Uh... Yeah.

459
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,916
I've noticed that coming
back to this temple

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,666
is really is relaxing.

461
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,666
That's because all the time
we've spent together here

462
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,500
is so special to us.

463
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,541
As well as the time we will
spend here in the future, right?

464
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,208
Belldandy...

465
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,583
WAAHH!!

466
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,875
How could you go and make
a waste of the machine

467
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,500
I made especially for you?!

468
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,958
Even Heaven itself can't take
its eyes off you for a second...

469
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,500
I hope that their
relationship will develop

470
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,541
a little bit more now.
Good luck, Keiichi.

471
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,500
So then you DID intend to
pull something, didn't you?!

472
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,166
Aaah! Stop it, Banpei!

473
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,708
Mr. Keiichi!

474
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,500
A goddess who gives
her heart and soul

475
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,750
for that special person.

476
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,083
The image kindles the fire

477
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,750
of a certain queen's
smoldering heart.

478
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:13,000
Next time, "Ah! The Beleaguered
