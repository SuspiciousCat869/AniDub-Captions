1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,250
Thanks for the meal!

2
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,333
Sure... I hope you enjoy it!

3
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,375
Wow, this grilled
yellowtail is delicious!

4
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,166
Do you really think so?
That's wonderful...

5
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,250
I had hoped you would
really like it, Keiichi!

6
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,416
Of course I like it!

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,250
I mean, the food you make always
tastes fantastic, Belldandy!

8
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,250
Well, thank you very much.

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,041
I'm not just saying
that to flatter you.

10
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,458
--It really is delicious!
--It's okay, I believe you.

11
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,875
There they go again...

12
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,916
Even the miso broth is great!

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I mean, it seems as if you
always know exactly what dishes

14
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,458
I like the most somehow...

15
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,000
Keiichi!

16
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,333
The food I've prepared is most
certainly superior to hers!

17
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,875
Here, open your mouth...
it's delicious!

18
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,208
Hey, it's good!

19
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,916
Well, of course it is, silly!

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,458
Uh...? Uh!

21
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,541
Say... "ah"!

22
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Isn't that yummy?

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,500
And I'm sure it
tastes even better

24
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,083
when I feed it to
you, now doesn't it?

25
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,750
Uh... Huh?

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,166
So, does it taste good?

27
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,583
Uh...

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,541
Open wide!

29
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,083
You can try...

30
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,666
Peorth...!

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,000
You've been reading my issues of
Dobon again, haven't you...?!

32
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,041
Huh?

33
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,166
What do you want?

34
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,250
You perverts!

35
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,666
Skuld! This it's
not what you think!

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,708
Keiichi! What is
that supposed to mean?

37
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,791
Come on now, open wide!

38
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,875
Please! Just cut it out, Peorth!

39
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,666
Come on Keiichi... say "ah"!

40
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,250
This is all your fault
for being spineless!

41
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,000
What...?

42
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,166
Don't give me that
lame "what" routine.

43
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,625
Huh...

44
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,875
Keiichi...

45
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,708
Don't tell me that you
actually enjoy having

46
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,791
Peorth all over you?

47
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,750
That's not what
I'm saying at all!

48
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,208
Well then... Why don't you
just send her home already?

49
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,583
Don't you care about
Belldandy's feelings?!

50
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,666
Huh?!

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,583
What do you mean?
Of course I do.

52
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,750
Have you already forgotten...

53
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,416
about the wrath of
her "jealousy storm"?

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,083
If you keep this behavior up,
she might explode again...

55
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,833
Now... Is that what
you really want?

56
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,000
Uh...

57
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,958
So what's next...?
It's all up to you now.

58
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,625
Excuse me... I'll be right back.

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,708
Go right ahead.

60
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,166
What a piece of work...

61
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,541
Oh, no...

62
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,583
Oh yeah, a jealousy storm
is brewing, all right.

63
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,750
That's it!

64
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,041
Even if it might
be a little late...

65
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,458
What we need to do is
organize a fun party

66
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,583
to welcome Peorth so
she feels more at home!

67
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,083
I'll get things
ready right away!

68
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,208
What the...?

69
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,583
So that's what she
was upset about?

70
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,666
Hey, it's good!

71
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,250
Well, of course it is, silly!

72
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,166
Say... "ah."

73
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,125
Oh, now I get it...

74
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,333
That's what I did
wrong the other day!

75
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,666
All right then, I won't
make the same mistake twice!

76
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,500
Next time I'll be sure
to get it right, and--

77
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,416
Hold on! What's this
supposed to mean--

78
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,166
"to be continued next month"?!
But I don't wanna wait!

79
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,458
I wanna know what
happens right now!

80
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,875
You see, the reason I was
ultimately able to find

81
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,083
the bug back then is because
it had gotten inside you.

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,250
That's why that job
truly was a joint effort

83
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,583
between the two of us!

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,541
Belldandy... You...

85
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,708
Peorth.

86
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,083
Huh? That's a rather
grave expression...

87
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,666
Is something the matter?

88
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,333
Is it about your wish?

89
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,750
Please answer me...

90
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,375
Can you just tell me what
you want me to wish for?

91
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,791
My, that's a strange
thing to ask.

92
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,166
Shouldn't a wish be something
that you, yourself,

93
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,916
personally desire?

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,875
Well, it should be,
but I just...

95
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,833
To begin with, a wish
can only be entered into

96
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,416
Yggdrasil's systems when spoken
by the recipient of that wish.

97
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Sadly, my own desires in this
matter are entirely immaterial.

98
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,583
You're probably right.

99
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,250
Nevertheless...

100
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,416
We won't get anywhere at
this rate, now will we?

101
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,375
I suppose I'd better
give you a little hint.

102
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,791
What's the hint?

103
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,791
I want you to go into your
bedroom, and take a look

104
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,708
at what's inside your
middle desk drawer, okay?

105
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,791
My middle desk drawer?

106
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,083
What is she talking about?

107
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,791
But... this is a...

108
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,250
Peorth!

109
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,875
Did you find it already?

110
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,083
Yeah...

111
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,458
What kind of "hint"
is this supposed to be?!

112
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,458
Ah, yes... that's it all right.

113
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,041
Would you just tell me what the
heck this is supposed to mean?!

114
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,458
It means that you're going to
have to start being much more

115
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,666
honest with yourself,
that's what it means.

116
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,833
Huh?

117
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,125
It can't be...

118
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,416
Are you saying that the
reason you've come here

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,458
is to fulfill my "desires"?

120
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,416
You mean to say you didn't
figure that out 'til just now?

121
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,250
Well... never you mind...

122
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,166
As long as you understand
how everything works now...

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,333
So! Go right ahead and
lay that big wish on me!

124
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,333
No way.

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,166
What the heck is that
supposed to mean?!

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,708
Forget it.

127
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:10,375
I'm not interested in anything
that doesn't involve love...

128
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,083
You mean you're
really not interested

129
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,125
if love isn't part
of the equation?

130
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,625
Right...

131
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,833
You're saying you don't have
any love for me, aren't you?

132
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,125
Well, isn't it obvious?

133
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,625
Very well then. If you insist
on putting it like that...

134
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,125
Huh?

135
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,833
Keiichi... I am so very
deeply in love with you.

136
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,833
So, tell me...
did that help at all?

137
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,125
Peorth, what are
you talking about?!

138
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,000
Huh?

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,541
I remember Belldandy saying that

140
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,958
goddesses aren't supposed to
have the ability to tell lies.

141
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,583
I think Urd and Skuld can,

142
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,166
since they're Second
Class goddesses...

143
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,125
but there should be any way that
a First Class goddess like you

144
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,833
would be able to do that!

145
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,166
Please just tell me
what's going on?!

146
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,875
You've somehow been under
the wrong impression...

147
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,125
Well... that's
that then, huh...?

148
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,541
Come on now, Keiichi,
let's hear that wish, okay?

149
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,750
Huh?

150
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,500
Well?

151
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,166
All right...

152
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,541
I want you to...
fulfill my every desire...

153
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,833
Is that what...
you want me to say?

154
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,208
Whoa, wait! That's not my wish!

155
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,291
No, that's not it!

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,041
Congratulations.
Your wish has been accepted.

157
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,375
Good news, Keiichi...
it was accepted!

158
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,958
Huh?

159
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,375
Now... the time has come for
me to grant you that wish...

160
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,000
Aahhhh!

161
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,083
You're not getting away
from me, Keiichi.

162
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,666
I hope Keiichi finds this meal
as delicious as the last one.

163
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,583
Belldandy...

164
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,833
What's the matter, Keiichi...?
You seem so distracted...

165
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey, Big Sis, have you
seen my issues of Dobon?

166
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,666
What is the matter
with you, Keiichi?!

167
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,791
Look, you've got the
wrong idea, Skuld!

168
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,625
We just ran into
each other by mistake!

169
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,291
It was an accident! I swear!

170
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,916
Uh... Huh?

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,333
I finally caught you,
Keiichi... Uh!

172
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,833
You're not getting away.

173
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,166
You're the one who took my
issues of Dobon Manga Monthly,

174
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,625
--aren't you?!
--Hm?

175
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,041
I was just getting to the
good part in Miracle Micky!

176
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,958
Damn, that boy certainly
is quick on his feet...!

177
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,333
Ah!

178
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,708
That'll do nicely.

179
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,958
Jolt the earth...

180
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
Move ahead, faster
than the wind...!

181
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,541
Hurry onward... as if
soaring through the sky!

182
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,833
GO!

183
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,208
You had better not
underestimate me!

184
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,666
Gimme a break...

185
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,333
Well, we got away from
there pretty darn fast...

186
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,333
but I don't know where
I'm gonna go from here.

187
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,125
--Keiichi?
--Huh?

188
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,916
Did something happen
between you and Peorth?

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,875
I mean, there must
be some reason why

190
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,625
you're having to
run away from her.

191
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, it's just that
my wish got kinda...

192
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,833
What about your wish?

193
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,375
Ah...

194
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,875
Did something happen
with your wish?

195
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,000
No way! Absolutely
nothing happened!

196
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,625
Keiichi! Behind us!

197
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,791
What?! No way!

198
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,333
Keiichi...!

199
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:58,208
There's no point in running.
I will satisfy your passions!

200
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,500
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

201
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,708
Oh, Keiichi!

202
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,208
I already told you--
that wasn't my wish!

203
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,625
What's going on?

204
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,875
Uh, I'll explain
it to you later.

205
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,875
Well, in the meantime,
I'll get us away from Peorth.

206
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,375
Gazing intently
upon small stars...

207
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,208
I listen carefully so I
can hear their whispers...

208
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,958
All ye who twinkle unite,

209
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,791
and invite this into
your tiny world.

210
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,500
Aaaahhh!

211
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,000
She won't be able to catch
up to us for a while now.

212
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,791
Well, Belldandy's certainly
outdone herself this time...

213
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,500
Hey, you did it!
Nice job, Belldandy!

214
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,416
Hey! W-What's wrong?

215
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,375
Oh, I'm nearly out of gas.
We have to stop for--

216
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh no! I didn't even think
about bringing my wallet.

217
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,750
I guess we'll just have
to pull over... Damn...

218
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,708
That Belldandy...!

219
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,125
I can't believe she'd have
the nerve to interfere!

220
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:09,875
In fact, that is precisely
what I hate about her so much!

221
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,958
So... what do I do now?

222
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Is this the extent of a
First Class Goddess' powers?

223
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,000
What are you doing here?

224
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,333
In case your wondering...

225
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,375
You'll probably find those
two at the university.

226
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,625
Huh?

227
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,708
But why... Why are you
telling me this, Urd?

228
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,250
Let's just say it's
for Belldandy's sake.

229
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,958
I don't know if
you've caught on,

230
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,666
but even she can be pretty
difficult to deal with.

231
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,875
Don't worry. You've known
her for some time now.

232
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,666
You'll know what to do.

233
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,208
Well... Good luck!

234
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,875
Wait, Urd...

235
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,875
All right then...
Time to go hunting.

236
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,125
So, what are we gonna do now?

237
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,166
--Um, Keiichi...
--Huh?

238
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,791
What was this wish that you
were talking about earlier?

239
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,416
Uh, well you see, it's, uh...

240
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,333
You're going to have to start
being more honest with yourself.

241
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,041
She's right...

242
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:25,083
If I claim I didn't
want that, I'd be lying.

243
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,583
And I believe it's what
Belldandy wants as well.

244
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,791
It's not as though she's

245
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,583
deliberately avoiding
it or anything.

246
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,416
But there's something that's
making her keep her distance.

247
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,958
Even when there's love...

248
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,583
Or is there not
any love at all?

249
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,541
Keiichi?

250
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,333
Belldandy...

251
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,875
If I... ever wished...

252
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,041
If I ever did...

253
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,125
Is that... really my wish?

254
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,583
Is it?

255
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,583
Uh, Keiichi?

256
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,125
Uh-huh...

257
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,416
I was wondering about Peorth's
cooking. Was it really good?

258
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,250
Hm?

259
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,666
Be honest with me...

260
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,666
You thought her cooking tasted
better than mine, right?

261
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,250
Belldandy...

262
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,708
No, not at all! Your cooking
was incredible. Delicious.

263
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,041
But you...

264
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,000
The only reason
I ate Peorth's food

265
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,625
is because she was
forcing me to...!

266
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,708
It wasn't like I
enjoyed doing that!

267
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,708
It was good though, wasn't it?

268
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,250
Uh... Um, well, yeah...

269
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,791
I understand.

270
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,250
But I'm trying to
say that yours is...

271
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,208
Belldandy?

272
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,958
Just say it already!

273
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,458
Ah...

274
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:01,958
Don't tell me that...
she's jealous!

275
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,458
She's jealous of Peorth?!

276
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,583
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

277
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,708
No way...

278
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,291
Oh, Keiichi... What am
I supposed to do...?

279
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,875
I just don't know
what I should do.

280
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,791
Belldandy...

281
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,833
I've finally tracked you down!

282
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,208
Why, Peorth...?

283
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,791
Why on earth are you running
Keiichi down like this?!

284
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,041
Running him down?

285
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,125
I'd say you're the one
who's doing that!

286
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,208
Huh?

287
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,625
It would seem
impossible, Belldandy,

288
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,208
but I believe you've
forgotten that Keiichi is a man.

289
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,375
Haven't you?

290
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,458
If you're only here
because it's your duty...

291
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,333
then I feel sorry for Keiichi.

292
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,833
--Peorth!
--Could it be...

293
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,541
You're not aware that you're
still a First Class Goddess?

294
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,625
Just stop this
right now! I won't--

295
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,625
Do you have any idea
why I was summoned

296
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,291
down to Earth
in the first place?

297
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,375
Huh?

298
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,791
Even if it was caused
by a mistake...

299
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,750
I have traveled down here
to the surface world

300
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,333
in order to grant a wish.

301
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,041
I am here to grant your
wish, Keiichi Morisato.

302
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,916
Belldandy...

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,666
You were asking
Keiichi whether or not

304
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,833
something had happened earlier
between the two of us.

305
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,375
Well, Keiichi told me his wish.

306
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:24,833
He said that he wants me
to fulfill his every desire.

307
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,416
Belldandy! It's not true!

308
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,166
Peorth made her report to Heaven
before I could get the chance

309
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,916
to finish talking
to her about it...!

310
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's all a big mistake!

311
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,708
Belldandy! Please wait!

312
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,541
Belldandy!

313
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,125
Belldandy...

314
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,416
It's not just my duty.

315
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,708
If it were, it wouldn't
hurt so much...

316
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,375
But I...

317
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,833
All right, Keiichi...

318
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,625
--Why don't we get started...?
--Stop it!

319
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,041
I want to...

320
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,791
Come on, Keiichi...

321
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,041
--Cut it out!
--I will grant what you desire.

322
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,666
To tell you...

323
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,500
Belldandy.

324
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
It's true that I
might have desired it

325
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,166
somewhere deep in my heart...

326
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,916
And it's even possible
that's the reason

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,041
why my phone call went through
to Peorth in the first place.

328
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,041
But then...

329
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:37,166
That was actually because...
I love you, Belldandy.

330
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,708
And you're the one...
I want to be with forever.

331
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,083
Because of who you are...

332
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,083
Belldandy!

333
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,916
I'm glad...! Because
I love you, Keiichi!

334
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,583
Belldandy...

335
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,458
I really love you!

336
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,333
What are you doing?

337
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,541
Peorth here.

338
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,500
Yes, I've completed my mission,
and I'm ready to return.

339
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,500
Peorth?!

340
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,333
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

341
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,250
Y'know, it's a real
shame for you, Keiichi...

342
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,166
You see, I am famous
throughout Heaven

343
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,708
for providing the
very best in services.

344
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,458
Uh... Peorth!

345
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,750
Ah!

346
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,083
Do you mean...
you did all that...

347
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,208
just to get me to
say what I did?

348
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,541
--Belldandy.
--Huh?

349
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:53,208
So you know, that's something
I do truly detest about you.

350
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,458
But then again, it's
also the reason why

351
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,791
I could never truly hate you.

352
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,083
Ah!

353
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,916
--Oh, Peorth.
--Peorth, wait!

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,250
And in case we should
never meet again,

355
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,541
it's been an absolute pleasure
fulfilling your request.

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,625
Peorth!

357
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,583
Was this to repay me for the
mistake you made about me?

358
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,916
Was it?

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,416
Or is it because...
you really do love Keiichi?

360
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,250
Ahh!

361
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,333
Aaaaahh!

362
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,583
They're gone!

363
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,125
My issues of Dobon Manga
Monthly are all gone!

364
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,125
Ran Ran and Best Friends
and everything else!

365
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,208
Hmm... Oh, no!

366
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,458
What am I going to do about
getting the next volume?

367
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:29,000
I really did want to
fulfill his wish after all.

368
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,250
Everyone has tried to go back
at least once in their lives.

369
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,541
But a single-minded
passion brings new inspiration

370
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,791
to hearts that are
about to give up.

371
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,416
Next time, "Ah! Catch Your
Dream With Your Own Hands."

372
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,666
Why are seniors so afraid of
the Auto Club's first manager?
