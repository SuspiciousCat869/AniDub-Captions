1
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,416
You almost had them, Mara.

2
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,333
But, as always, you managed
to blow it at the end.

3
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,958
Now then... where do you
think we should go from here?

4
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,916
Insolent fool!
Do you not see my head?!

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,041
Your head?
Are you the Renegade Priest?!

6
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,375
Aw, who gives a damn?!
Get 'im, boys!

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
♪ Aaaaah. ♪

8
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,416
I'll punish you on behalf
of the great Buddha!

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,958
♪ Aaaaah. ♪

10
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:18,625
Oh! Such beautiful singing.
It just washes over my heart!

11
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,791
All right, you guys!
Let's get it on!

12
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,583
Such barbarous behavior...
It's just so uncivilized.

13
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,791
We should place greater
emphasis on love.

14
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,250
Love is somethin' that can only
be truly won through combat!

15
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,541
Why it almost seems as though,

16
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,791
we now have a fourth
sister, doesn't it?

17
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,916
Aw jeez, it was bad enough
when we just had one of her!

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,208
Not to mention, it's not
too much fun watching TV

19
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,416
when she keeps switching
back and forth like that.

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,750
Hey, do something!

21
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,208
Uh.

22
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,500
Why are you staring at me with
such a funny look on your face.

23
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:53,958
Um, come fix this TV.
Uh, Sk... Sku... Tiny.

24
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,166
HEY! WHO ARE YOU CALLIN' TINY?!

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,541
And why are you
sounding out my name

26
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,375
like you can't remember it?!

27
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,625
Sku... Your name's
Skuld...! Yeah.

28
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,291
Um...? What's wrong with you?

29
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,291
Uh, nothing - it's nothing!

30
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,916
Hey, wasn't Mara supposed to dig
up some information about that

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,541
"heretical pot" she used on Urd?

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,125
Hey, Belldandy?

33
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,500
AAAAAHHH!

34
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,750
Whatever that was, it sure
didn't sound too good.

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,708
I guess I must've forgot to
turn on Banpei's safety switch.

36
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,291
Uhhhh...

37
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,583
Well, I have to say,
that totally sucked!

38
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,458
Hey! This was all your
fault to begin with,

39
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,250
so stop crying about it!

40
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,625
So, did you manage to
find any information?

41
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,875
Well, that pot got mixed up in
a mail order that I had placed,

42
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,583
so the original sender and its
origin are both unknown.

43
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,416
Therefore, trying to track it
didn't get me anywhere...

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
What were you thinking using
such a questionable item

45
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:44,833
in the first place?!

46
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,375
Now, just hang on a minute!

47
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,375
It's not like I haven't given
this any thought after all.

48
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,666
Oh yeah?
Then where'd it come from?

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,125
Regardless of its origin...

50
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,916
that heretical pot
is without a doubt

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,208
an item of legendary proportion.

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,833
Frankly speaking, it's not
something a First Class goddess

53
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,000
or demon would be
able to master.

54
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,166
However, if we were
talking about someone

55
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,125
even more powerful than that...

56
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,125
Wait a minute.
Are you trying to say that...

57
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,750
Someone more powerful
than we are...

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,000
In other words,
the Almighty One.

59
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,791
Or... possibly even the...
ruler of demonkind...

60
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,833
So who is this
ruler of demonkind?

61
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,250
Don't you dare take the
name of our ruler in vain,

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,708
you insolent human!

63
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,916
The ruler of demonkind
is the ultimate authority

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,166
over all demons.

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,666
It's our equivalent of
heaven's Almighty One!

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,666
Oh, Urd...

67
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,875
Tr... Trou-ba...

68
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,625
My, my! I'm surprised to see
you out here all by yourself.

69
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,500
Who are you again?

70
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,833
WHAT?!

71
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,416
Well, I see you're still
your old, sarcastic self.

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,916
You may have
beaten me last year,

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,250
but there's no way it's going
to happen again this year.

74
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,333
You remember that!

75
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,583
Ah... I really admire how

76
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,458
energetic and full of
vitality that Sayoko is.

77
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,625
Ah! SAYOKO, that's right!
She's Sayoko!

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,000
Now that I think about it,

79
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,708
she really was a lot of fun
to toy with, wasn't she?

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,750
Oh, well if it isn't Urd!

81
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,958
So, what brings you here today?

82
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,125
Uh, I, um...

83
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,333
Oh! I just happened
to be passing by...

84
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,333
Mr. Tamiya, Mr. Otaki.

85
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,666
Mr. Tamiya?!

86
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,541
M-M-Mr. Otaki?!

87
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,666
I'll go get a doctor right away!

88
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,791
Huh?

89
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,833
Just take it easy,
we'll be right back!

90
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,500
I guess I have some pretty
good friends, don't I?

91
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,583
Yeah... You sure do.

92
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,625
It was a sunset just like this

93
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,333
when I was here with that boy...

94
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,625
Don't tell me that you've
forgotten about Shohei as well?

95
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,583
Oh, you're right! That's it.
His name was Shohei!

96
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,666
Well, I guess it's about time...

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,333
I'll count on you to
take care of the rest.

98
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,375
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

99
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,708
Your soul is being
drawn steadily closer

100
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,375
towards the divine.

101
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,833
At this rate...

102
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,791
My demonic half will disappear.

103
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,458
And when the demonic
side is gone,

104
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,083
a new goddess will
be born in its place.

105
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,375
Sure sounds great, doesn't it?

106
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,833
Great?! To abandon
all the memories

107
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,833
of the days we spent as
a hybrid goddess/demon...

108
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,625
All the people we met...
and the bonds we've made?

109
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,333
Well, it's just...

110
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,250
Tell me the truth...
You're scared, right...?

111
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,333
Of losing all these memories...

112
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,458
And especially of
losing that special bond

113
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:10,166
that you carry with...
that person.

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,208
Kinda funny to say
this to myself,

115
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,458
but you have a
lousy personality.

116
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,000
But I AM you. Remember?

117
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,583
Is that true?!

118
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,375
At this rate, I'm afraid
that the demonic side of Urd

119
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,958
will disappear completely.

120
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,250
No way!

121
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,916
What exactly what makes
you so sure about that?

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,333
Don't you remember...
what Urd was like earlier?

123
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,041
What she was like?

124
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,000
Uh!

125
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,625
Yes... the memories of her
demonic side are disappearing.

126
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,625
So I guess that means
Urd will eventually become

127
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,791
one hundred percent
goddess, doesn't it?

128
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,166
Not really such a bad thing,
when you think about it...

129
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,708
Well, yes, but...

130
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,041
It just means the end of some
dumb goddess, who'd actually

131
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,458
hang out with mean-spirited,
capricious demons.

132
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,833
I really don't see what
all the fuss is about!

133
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,375
Stop that!

134
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,458
I don't want that to happen!

135
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,875
If Urd really does
become like Big Sis,

136
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,083
then I won't have
anyone to fight with.

137
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,208
We can't let that happen!

138
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,625
Are you sure there isn't
anything we can do for her?

139
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,416
Maybe we can ask
the Almighty for help,

140
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,333
like you were saying earlier?

141
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,916
Mm-mm... I afraid
that wouldn't work.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,291
The Almighty One could probably
restore Urd's personality.

143
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,208
Maybe even back to its
original state from before...

144
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,791
But then...

145
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,958
It's more likely the Almighty
One would take this opportunity

146
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
to rewrite Urd's programming

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,208
and make her a full-fledged
goddess instead.

148
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,333
So I guess it's hopeless, huh?

149
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,250
I can't believe you guys
have already forgotten

150
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,708
what I was telling you earlier!

151
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,166
Huh?

152
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,125
But I'm honestly a little
reluctant to say it though.

153
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,666
I'm afraid that's
the only option left.

154
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,833
You came back!

155
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,750
You see, it's like Mara said...

156
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,583
There's only one person...

157
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
who has power equal
to the Almighty...

158
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,875
and might be willing to
work out some kind of deal,

159
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,666
depending on how
we approach her...

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,375
You're right.
She could probably do it.

161
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,375
Who is "She"?

162
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,041
The ruler of demonkind...

163
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,750
...named Hild.

164
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,291
Well, it would appear that
we've found our answer...

165
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,625
My demonic half says that
she doesn't want to forget...

166
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,958
...her memories as a
half-goddess, half-demon,

167
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,166
and especially not
that certain someone...

168
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,791
I really feel I should do what
I can to respect her wishes.

169
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,166
I suppose that makes
me a terrible goddess?

170
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
No, Urd.

171
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,916
Well, then I'll just
leave the rest to you.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,083
If I stay concealed, it will
temporarily halt the progression

173
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,708
towards full divinity.

174
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,083
Thanks for everything,
my other half.

175
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,791
Well, I'll go call her.

176
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,708
Right!

177
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,375
So is it really
that easy to just

178
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,916
pick up the phone and call her?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,250
How should I know?!

180
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,458
What are you guys acting
so freaked out for anyway?

181
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,833
Hey! Just shut up...!

182
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,250
You should consider
yourself lucky

183
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,958
that you don't have to know.

184
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
Uh! Hello?

185
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,333
Mm-hm... it has been a while.

186
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,333
Well, this is probably the first
time I've ever called you.

187
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,708
An old friend of hers?

188
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,916
No, I don't think it's quite
like that... You see...

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,125
Huh?

190
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,958
You must know about
what's happened, right?

191
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,666
Come on, don't play dumb.
I KNOW you know!

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
Huh? Wha...?!

193
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,416
Wait just a minute!
But we're not ready to...

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
Hello?! Hello?! Uh!

195
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,916
What happened?

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,250
She said she's coming over.

197
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,458
--Huh?!
--What...?!

198
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,041
The ruler of demonkind
is coming here now?!

199
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,625
That's right.

200
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,875
What would you expect,
she IS my mother, after all.

201
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,000
Amazing...

202
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,625
She's here.

203
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,208
You mean that
she's... Urd's mother?

204
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
Huh...?

205
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,583
Oh, Urdie!

206
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,958
It's been far too long!

207
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,791
Couldn't you have at
least tried to arrive

208
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,250
a little more quietly?

209
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,500
Oh, but I was holding back
my power as much as I could!

210
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,958
After all, I'd normally blow
a little town like this away

211
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,541
without even breaking a sweat!

212
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,416
Is she really all that powerful?

213
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,625
Yes. All the jewelry she
wearing on her hair and arms

214
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,166
are probably to
seal her powers.

215
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,666
What?!

216
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,708
If that's indeed the case,
then her true power must be--

217
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
So you're Belldandy?

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,458
And that means
you must be Skuld?

219
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,916
Yes...

220
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,083
You two look just like him!

221
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,166
Hild is... Urd's mother...

222
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,125
Is she really the
ruler of all demonkind?

223
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,750
It's very nice to
meet you, Miss Hild.

224
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,125
And I suppose
you're Keiichi Morisato?

225
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,541
She's just like Urd...

226
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,333
She doesn't seem to listen
to anything you're saying.

227
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,333
Ah, c'mon. I'm not that bad.

228
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,083
I have to admit, I really
like guys like you.

229
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,125
Now, tell me, Keiichi...
what kind of desires

230
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,541
lie behind those unassuming
eyes of yours, huh?

231
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,750
I would just love to find out.

232
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,916
So... How 'bout you
tell me the whole story

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,791
as to why I've come here?

234
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh, and no trying to run
away now, my dear Mara.

235
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,583
Perish the thought, Lady Hild!

236
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,458
I would never dream of
doing something like that.

237
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,291
Hmm...

238
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,708
Fusing a goddess
and a demon, huh?

239
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,541
Though it's true there's
nothing I can't do,

240
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,125
it would be a pain.

241
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,708
And this does seem like a good
opportunity to choose just one.

242
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,250
I have no such intentions.
I am half-goddess, half-demon.

243
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,166
And anything other than that
just wouldn't be me anymore.

244
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,083
I don't mind returning
you to how you were,

245
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,625
but what if I had you
come back with me

246
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,458
to the demon realm
once I've done it?

247
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,250
Huh?!

248
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,000
I thought you'd say that.

249
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,791
Even if I am half demonic,
I'm still a goddess

250
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
and therefore belong here.

251
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,750
You see, it's something I take
a great deal of pride in.

252
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,166
And so I cannot agree
to that condition...

253
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,958
no matter what.

254
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,291
Hm...

255
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,041
Hey! Do you really
think you're in a position

256
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,416
to set terms
around here?

257
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,041
That weird doo-dad
from the demon realm

258
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,000
caused this whole mess
in the first place!

259
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:07,916
You're the one who's...

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,041
...to blame?

261
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,083
Ah!

262
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
Even if that artifact
were somehow

263
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,541
related to the demon realm,
why should it bother you?

264
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,708
With the sole exception
of killing each other,

265
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,875
anything goes in the battle
between gods and demons.

266
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,875
Meaning that I then bear
absolutely no responsibility

267
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,375
in this matter.

268
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,916
One could argue that you're
in fact the one to be blame

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,416
for this situation,
having fused Urd back together

270
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,625
using that poorly
built contraption...

271
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,375
But since it was my dearest
daughter making the request,

272
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,875
I thought maybe
I'd help her...

273
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,250
with a few minor conditions.

274
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,375
Would you mind easing up
a bit on my little sister?

275
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,750
Just what I'd expect from
the ruler of demonkind--

276
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,583
she can strike fear in one's
heart with a single glance.

277
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,291
Okay, let's do this...

278
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,166
We'll just forget about
Urd coming back with me.

279
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,000
But as an alternative...

280
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,833
It seems to me that
it would be only fair

281
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,958
if you were to grant me
one little wish, Urdie.

282
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,041
What kind of wish
did you have in mind?

283
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,125
--That's-a-secret.
--Mm!

284
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,458
But then if you just decide
to tell her to go with you,

285
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,500
she won't be able to refuse!

286
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,833
Ahh!

287
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,458
Not too shabby...

288
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,166
But that's really all
you've got, now isn't it?

289
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
Would you care to
try again, Hild?

290
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,875
That's all right.
I think I'll pass.

291
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,208
Huh?!

292
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,500
I'd hate to make you have
to overexert yourself.

293
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,583
Well, then...

294
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,125
Keiichi...

295
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,125
I'm afraid we can't have you
underestimating us demons,

296
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,583
now can we?

297
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,208
So this will have to be
a formal contract...

298
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,625
and we demons make very certain
we honor all our contracts.

299
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,416
So... you're saying that trust
is essential in doing business?

300
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,583
Exactly...! Oh, I just
love intelligent men!

301
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,375
We demons will gladly
accept anyone's wish,

302
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,708
so long as we're
compensated in full.

303
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,958
If one were to desire the
destruction of this world...

304
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,708
Well, even that's not
out of the question.

305
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,125
No way!

306
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,666
Of course, the wishes we
grant are in direct proportion

307
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,958
to what's offered in return,

308
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,708
so I think that
might be a bit much.

309
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,708
But as long as something
is given in return,

310
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,208
we'd do it any time.

311
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,208
Went off on a tangent
there, didn't I?

312
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,000
So, Urdie, what
do you want to do?

313
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,166
Okay. As long as whatever
this wish of yours is

314
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,083
doesn't damage my
pride as a goddess.

315
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,166
Oh! I assure you it won't!

316
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,125
I swear in the name
of the Almighty.

317
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,041
That makes it even
more untrustworthy!

318
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,208
Do you really think
we can trust her?

319
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,083
I think it will be fine.

320
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,291
Demons, like goddesses, take
contracts very seriously.

321
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:51,958
And besides...

322
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,000
Besides what?

323
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,541
Oh, Bell dear.

324
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,583
Hm?

325
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,333
Would you come
over here for a sec?

326
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
Coming!

327
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,125
What is it, Hild?

328
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,166
That Keiichi's
quite a guy, isn't he?

329
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,833
There aren't too many
who can stand up

330
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:11,375
to the ruler of demonkind
and say how they truly feel!

331
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,166
If you don't mind...
would you give him over to me?

332
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,000
No, I won't.

333
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,291
Well now, you're more
straightforward than you look,

334
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,791
aren't you?

335
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,000
I was wondering if I might
ask you a question, Miss Hild?

336
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,916
Lemme guess...
About why he and I split up?

337
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,458
Not that.

338
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,166
I was curious as to why you were
waiting for Urd to call you.

339
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,333
It's not like I was
waiting exactly.

340
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,958
I see. Well, if that's the case,

341
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,791
then I guess that's
all right too.

342
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,041
You really are just
like him, Belldandy.

343
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,458
Just like that part I
always hated about him.

344
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,416
Well... don't go worrying
yourself over it

345
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
because I'm only doing
what's best for Urdie and me.

346
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,458
Do you really think so?

347
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,333
Yes, I do.

348
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,000
Hey Urd, so what's the deal?

349
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,416
Do you like totally
hate your mother?

350
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,958
Well, it's not exactly a matter

351
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,916
of whether I love
or hate her...

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,375
All righty then...
Shall we begin?

353
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,958
Hm!

354
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,625
I hate to admit it, but she is
quite a sight to behold.

355
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,666
Raising such an
incredible field of magic

356
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,208
in just the blink of an eye...

357
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,458
C'mon! Don't go gushing over
a little old thing like that!

358
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,166
After all, you're the
one who'll be doing

359
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,458
all the rest of the
work from here on out.

360
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,916
What "work" is that?

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,083
You think I'm
going to chant

362
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,791
all five hundred twelve
verses on my own?

363
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,958
You're gonna have to help me
out with all the divine parts!

364
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
Wait a minute!

365
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,625
Don't tell me that you
don't know how to do it!

366
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,666
Daughter of the one and
only ruler of demonkind...

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,750
and you can't even help out

368
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,708
with the divine part
of the circle!

369
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,208
Oh dear Almighty...

370
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,916
All right, fine. I'll do it!
Just cut that out, will you?

371
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,250
Huh?

372
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,041
Skuld?

373
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,208
Belldandy, you too?

374
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:07,250
We're going to help you get
through this, Urd. Don't worry.

375
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,416
You guys are the best.

376
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,625
Okay, let's give it a shot.

377
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:27,708
♪ Aaahh... ♪

378
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,375
Good, good, it's working.

379
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,625
Damn! I can't keep up
with this divine part!

380
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:46,208
♪ Aaahh... ♪

381
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,250
I guess this was
worth doing after all.

382
00:19:54,333 --> 00:20:01,291
♪ Aaahh... ♪

383
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,541
I'm finally back
to my true self.

384
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,791
Now then...

385
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,291
Uh?

386
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,666
Since I've kept up my end,
are you ready to hear my wish?

387
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,000
All right, go ahead.

388
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,000
I want you to
call me "Mom"!

389
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,250
Forget it.

390
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
Fine, then I'm
changing you back!

391
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,291
Oh Urd, you do
understand, don't you?

392
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,458
How Hild really feels about you?

393
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,208
Yeah, I think I have a pretty
good idea about that.

394
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:54,958
But, then, don't you--

395
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,625
No way.

396
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,208
That is exactly the reason why

397
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,458
I can't have any
love for my mother.

398
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,875
But Urd!

399
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,083
If I were to love her...

400
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,791
...my soul would be pulled
over to its demonic side.

401
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,958
And since allowing
that to happen

402
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,166
would conflict with my
pride as a goddess...

403
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,541
There's no way I'll say it!

404
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,625
--All right.
--Ah!

405
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,875
We'll just say the favor
was on me this time.

406
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,875
You silly girl...

407
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,875
It's a shame you had to take
after me in that regard.

408
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,166
Mm...

409
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,416
Oh, Moth...

410
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,208
...eaten old hag.

411
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
It seems like I did a lousy job
bringing you up, didn't I?!

412
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,791
You're forgetting that you
didn't bring me up at all!

413
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,041
Remember, darling, now
that you owe me one...

414
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,083
I will be back
one day to collect.

415
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,291
I don't recall
owing you anything.

416
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,500
Right... Well, we'll just see
about that, dearest daughter.

417
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't worry. I'll be seeing
you again, my little Urdie.

418
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,791
Hopefully, not for
a very long time.

419
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,041
You goddesses are
ruining with my plan

420
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,708
to increase our demonic share!

421
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,375
So she decides to set them up
with an old-fashioned lamp.

422
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,916
But what kind of powers
could it have?

423
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,583
Next time, "Ah! Do Demons
Have Any Dignity?"

424
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,625
Oh, how cute!

425
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,083
Your wish is my command!
