1
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,458
Morisato...

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,291
Can you hear me?

3
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,666
Morisato...

4
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,583
Are you there?

5
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,875
Who's there?

6
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,750
Is that you, Keima?

7
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,750
I mean, Hotarunosuke.

8
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,875
What is "fate"?

9
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,958
Ever since I met Belldandy...

10
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,625
I've wondered that
from time to time.

11
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,583
Maybe the dream
I had that night...

12
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,875
is a sign of something to come.

13
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,541
--Keiichi?
--Hm?

14
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,958
Are you up?

15
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,500
Yeah...

16
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,333
Good morning, Keiichi!
Did you sleep well?

17
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,291
Morning, Belldandy...
Uh, yeah, I did. Huh?

18
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,000
Hey, wait a minute. That's--

19
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,708
I came across this when
I was doing some cleaning

20
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,875
and going through old boxes.

21
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,250
It's my grandfather's journal!

22
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:08,500
Oh... So his name was
Hotarunosuke, huh?

23
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,166
He certainly was more
handsome than you.

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
Oh, put a lid on it, will ya?

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,500
Who's that girl in
the picture with him?

26
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,291
Hm... The photo's a little worn

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,083
so I can't make
her out very well...

28
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,750
Maybe it's my grandmother...

29
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,791
Hm?

30
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,875
A map.

31
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,958
Hey! There's something
written on it.

32
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,000
"My life's luster has been
left here at this location."

33
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,708
It's... it's a...

34
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,750
What does that mean?

35
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,625
--All right, Keiichi...
--Huh?

36
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,291
I'd say we're ready to go!

37
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,708
What? Go where?

38
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,041
Whenever there's an X on a map,
it obviously means that

39
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,041
there's buried treasure
somewhere, silly!

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,083
Clearly a magnificent
adventure awaits us all!

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,250
You guys watch too
much television.

42
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,750
Look, the Auto Club's camping
trip is right around the corner,

43
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,208
so I don't have
the time or the money

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,250
to go on a treasure hunt.

45
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,125
Oh, boo! You're such
a bore, Keiichi!

46
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,416
Say what you want, but it's not
going to make any difference.

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,458
--Oh, Mo-ri-sa-to!
--Huh?

48
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,375
Hey!

49
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:06,000
Eh?

50
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,583
Eh?!

51
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,291
And so, let the Nekomi Tech Auto
Club's Power Up Camping Trip...

52
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,083
...begin!

53
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,500
YEAH!

54
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,166
So, why'd you decide to
come camping too, Chihiro?

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,500
Well, isn't it obvious...?

56
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,458
Because it looked like
a lot of fun, of course.

57
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

58
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,750
What's wrong?
You don't think the sponsor

59
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,875
who generously funded
this trip should attend?

60
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,291
No, I don't think that...

61
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,833
Well, thanks...
I'm very glad to hear it.

62
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,875
This sure is a stylish mansion.

63
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,125
Yeah, it's great! I heard
the owner was actually

64
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,541
an acquaintance of my
grandfather's. So when I called,

65
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,666
he said he would rent
the place out cheap to us.

66
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,333
Hey Belldandy, do you feel it?

67
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:51,583
Yes, I do... I feel a
definite presence here.

68
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,291
There's something... in there.

69
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,833
Uh, hello...? Anyone here?
It's Keiichi Morisato...

70
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,791
There is something here.

71
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:11,125
If it's a demon...
I'll take it down!

72
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,166
Hm?

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:20,416
I've been waiting for you.
Welcome to Honda Manor.

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,291
I'll be your host.
My name is Chieko Honda.

75
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
I'll be taking care of you.

76
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,708
Uh... come again?

77
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,083
Oh. Well thank you
very much, Ms. Honda.

78
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,791
Uh, yeah!
Thanks for your help.

79
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,333
Huh?

80
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,583
Oh, Master Morisato!

81
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,750
HUH?!

82
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,000
You remembered our
promise, didn't you?

83
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,583
Oh, thank you.

84
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,583
Um, I'm sorry but I really don't
know what you're talking about.

85
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,041
Uh...

86
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,125
Morisato!

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,583
You scum.

88
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,958
Well...

89
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,166
You're quite the little stud,
aren't you, Keiichi?

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,166
And when you already have
my big sis... How could you?!

91
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,958
No! You've got the wrong idea.
I swear, this is some kind of--

92
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,000
AAAAAAHH!

93
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:11,708
No, It can't be. I just don't
see how that could be posible.

94
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,458
Have you really forgotten
about our promise?

95
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,125
What promise have
I forgotten about?

96
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,833
I'm pretty sure this is the
first time I've ever met you.

97
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,041
The first time we've met...
Then you've forgotten me, too?!

98
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,541
I'm sorry, but I
just don't think that

99
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,625
you and I have ever met before.

100
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:30,041
Oh, I'm terribly sorry!
Are you all right, Keiichi?

101
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,916
Excuse me, but can
you please tell me

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,375
what your relationship
is to that girl?

103
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,916
Well, um... Our
relationship is, uh...

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,541
Regardless, it doesn't matter,

105
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,083
whether you can
remember it or not

106
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,291
the two of us made a promise
to each other a long time ago!

107
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,875
Uh... I'm kind of
at a loss here...

108
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
Morisato!

109
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,875
It's time for us to start
the Auto Club meeting.

110
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,458
Aren't you guys finished with
your lovers' quarrel yet?

111
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,666
I don't know if that's
what you'd call it.

112
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,458
Look, it's already
getting dark outside,

113
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,708
so why don't we just leave
it at that for today?

114
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,250
Then I shall get your dinner
ready for you right away.

115
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
I can help you prepare it
if you would like.

116
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,750
That's not necessary!

117
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,916
That girl is a remnant.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,916
I know...

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,833
I realized that
as well just now.

120
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,875
Then why aren't
we doing anything?

121
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
There's something that
concerns me about her.

122
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,083
Hold on!

123
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,041
--Hm?
--Hm?

124
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,708
So what exactly is a remnant?

125
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,208
When someone departs this world

126
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,416
and leaves behind a strong
emotional sentiment...

127
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,833
those feelings can take
on a physical form.

128
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,250
That's... what a remnant is.

129
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,625
So... So you're saying
she's a ghost?!

130
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,166
Well... yeah...
something like that.

131
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
I'm going home!

132
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,291
The Auto Club's Camping Trip
meeting is now called to order!

133
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,625
Take it away, Dai.

134
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,791
Right. Number thirty-six, Otaki,

135
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
will now sing you
his greatest hits.

136
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,958
YEAH!

137
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,458
Hoo boy...

138
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:11,458
♪ The blood in my veins
is the vaseline of my soul. ♪

139
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:17,791
♪ I'll put my life on the line,
put the pedal to the floor. ♪

140
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,041
No, master, you mustn't!

141
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,416
Oh no, it's okay.

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,458
[chattering]

143
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,875
Hey, over here!

144
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,958
Woohoo!

145
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,250
Are you all right?

146
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,625
Huh?

147
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,333
You know, you've had an
awful lot to drink tonight.

148
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,666
Maybe you should
take a little break?

149
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,875
I just can't remember,
no matter how much I try.

150
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,375
Are you positive
it was really me

151
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,291
that made some kind of promise
with you a long time ago?

152
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,500
Huh?!

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,125
Where did you get
a copy of that photo?

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,791
But that's impossible.
Who are you...?

155
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,000
Was is just my imagination?

156
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,791
Hey, Belldandy...!
Are you listening or what?

157
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,958
Yes.

158
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,500
I was saying...

159
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,875
...that I finally decided
to open my own shop

160
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,833
and live my life
the way I want to.

161
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,416
These are good... Here!

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
You want one?

163
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,791
All right, thank you.

164
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,458
The seasoning in
these potatoes...

165
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,458
Hey, Morisato, where are you?

166
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,958
Are you, like,
makin' out with Belldandy

167
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,125
in some closet or
somethin''? Hic!

168
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,208
You've had a little
too much to drink...!

169
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,708
You just saw Big Sis
with the others

170
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,916
at the party a minute ago!

171
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,250
Huh?

172
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,125
AAAHHH! YEEEAAAHH!

173
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,958
--Huh?
--Huh?

174
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,875
Oh, no! That's Skuld!

175
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,916
I can't find the remnant
or Keiichi! Come on!

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,041
Right!

177
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,375
[cheering]

178
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,083
We never should've let
them out of our sight.

179
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,166
Be on your guard... She might
try to possess Keiichi.

180
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
She wouldn't!

181
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,625
Don't be so naïve!

182
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,541
A remnant will do
almost anything it takes

183
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,791
to achieve its goal.

184
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,708
Skuld! Miss Hasegawa!

185
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,666
This is the room, isn't it?

186
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,791
Thankfully, they're
only unconscious.

187
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,250
My unbinding spell
isn't working.

188
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,458
Hey! Open this door!

189
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,958
We know you're in there!

190
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,708
Give it up, and come
out here right now!

191
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,125
It's no use.

192
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,583
That door will not open.

193
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,750
Now then, I need you to think
back and remember that day...

194
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,875
Try to remember the promise
we made to each other.

195
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,208
Listen... You must
fulfill your promise.

196
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,625
AAH! They're ghosts!

197
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,125
Oh, look who's talking!

198
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,500
AAAH!

199
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,041
Urd! Since remnants are
different from demons...

200
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,250
the usual anti-demonic
programs won't work.

201
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,958
Please... Grant me the wish
that you once promised.

202
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,250
If you don't, then I'll
never be able to let you go.

203
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,833
Stop this...!

204
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,958
I know it's hard to believe, but
he's not who you think he is!

205
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,625
STOP IT!

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,541
That is Keiichi Morisato
that you're holding!

207
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,625
I assure you,
he's not Hotarunosuke,

208
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,166
who I know you've been
waiting for all this time!

209
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,333
That doesn't matter
to me anymore...

210
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,166
I can't wait any longer.

211
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,500
My encounter with
Master Hotarunosuke...

212
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,958
lasted for only
four summer days.

213
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,875
I met him while I was being
treated for an illness...

214
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,791
and he made a promise to me.

215
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,250
Even when I was on my sickbed...

216
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,583
that promise gave me
strength and hope.

217
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:38,458
When I eventually left
this world... I still waited.

218
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,458
And then... after so
many years had past...

219
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,791
he finally came to see me.

220
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,791
Even though it's a
different time, I knew...

221
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,125
that it... was fate.

222
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,958
Please tell me...

223
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,458
What was the promise
you that made long ago...

224
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,458
with Hotarunosuke?

225
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,375
Uh...? What happend?

226
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,375
I must have drank way
too much last night.

227
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,458
Good morning, Keiichi!
Did you sleep well?

228
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,541
If you don't mind...

229
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,000
there's something I'd
like you to have a look at.

230
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,333
What would you want to show me
down here in the basement?

231
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,458
Huh?! Aren't you...

232
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,750
And isn't this a...

233
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,083
A Brough Superior!

234
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,291
But then... what's it doing in
a place like this...? Huh?!

235
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,708
It can't be!

236
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,291
Yes.

237
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,083
It seems that it broke down and
was left here many years ago.

238
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,083
This motorcycle once
belonged to your grandfather.

239
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,583
And as for her...

240
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,625
It would mean a great deal
to me if you could repair it.

241
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,708
In fact, I don't even mind
if you keep this motorcycle

242
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,416
after it's been fixed.

243
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,541
But... before you take it away,

244
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,250
I was hoping you'd give me
a ride around the lake...

245
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,583
if it wouldn't be
too much trouble.

246
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:19,083
Since that was the promise
Master Hotarunosuke made to me.

247
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,833
You've waited decades...
just to take that ride...

248
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:27,208
This whole time... you've just
been waiting here, haven't you?

249
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,500
Because I knew you'd
return someday...

250
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,750
Maybe I can fix it.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,250
Whoa!

252
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,041
That freakin' bike is...

253
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,583
...the so-called
"Rolls-Royce" of motorcycles!

254
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,750
It's the legendary
Brough Superior!

255
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,291
All right...!

256
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,166
We can use this bike to help
rebuild the Auto Club finances!

257
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,083
This bike's a treasure that's
definitely worth repairing!

258
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,916
I can see these guys are
gonna be a bit of a problem.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,291
Um, excuse me!

260
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,458
Huh?

261
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,750
Please don't take
this the wrong way...

262
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,291
but I need to repair
this bike on my own.

263
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,250
What'd you just say?!

264
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,833
Morisato, you little rat!

265
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,208
Don't tell me you're thinking
of hoggin' it all to yourself?!

266
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,541
Quiet!

267
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,208
So. Why exactly do you
feel the need to

268
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,458
fix this bike all by yourself?

269
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,041
Well... That's a little
hard to explain,

270
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,916
but I just have to
do it that way.

271
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,041
I guess you could
say it's my fate.

272
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,500
It's your fate, huh?
Well, there's no arguing that.

273
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,291
Tamiya! Otaki!

274
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,791
Oh!

275
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,291
My chronic abdominal spasms!

276
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,041
Are you okay, Den?!

277
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,875
C'mon, this way.

278
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,875
What? What was that?!

279
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,250
Wait a minute... where was
he hiding all that stuff?

280
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,291
Morisato.

281
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,375
Huh?

282
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,291
Just about every
motorcycle from that era

283
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,500
was like a unique
model unto itself.

284
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,083
They've got a lot of
peculiarities, so watch out.

285
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:55,875
I will.

286
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,208
Well, see ya later.

287
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,958
Uh... Thanks again
for your help!

288
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,208
How long are you
gonna sulk over this?

289
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
Well, it's totally
embarrassing for a goddess

290
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,083
to let herself faint after
seeing a mere remnant...

291
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,791
You gotta keep your chin up
and not let it get to you.

292
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,000
After all, you may
be a mighty goddess,

293
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,708
but you're still just a kid.

294
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,541
SHUT UP...! I TOLD YOU
NOT TO CALL ME THAT!

295
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,333
I HATE YOU, YOU BIG DUMMY!

296
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, yeah...

297
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,750
So. How's he doing?

298
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,541
I was thinking... there's
still one thing I don't get...

299
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,541
How did you figure out
that there was a connection

300
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,875
between her and
Keiichi's grandfather?

301
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,416
Because of the seasoning
on her yummy potatoes.

302
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,750
"Potatoes"?

303
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,666
I noticed it in the flavor
of the boiled potatoes

304
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,041
she served us.

305
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,458
It was exactly the same
as the seasoning recipe

306
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,708
that Megumi had once given me.

307
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,708
So they had the unmistakable
"Morisato flavor"?

308
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,000
I suppose...
But I was also tipped off

309
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,208
by the map and photo, as well...

310
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,041
That's just like you.

311
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,500
Oh, my, my... Aren't you
just a little bit worried?

312
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,291
At this rate, she'll steal
Keiichi from you in no time.

313
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,875
It's all right.

314
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,958
The truth is, I think I might
understand how she's feeling.

315
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,750
Keiichi and I might someday
be separated, as well.

316
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,333
Belldandy!

317
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,083
C'mon, RUN!

318
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,875
We're going for one more lap!

319
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,125
I'm gonna croak!

320
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,333
Man, those two
are totally spent.

321
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,541
I can't believe they're
still standing...

322
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
Just leave me alone!
I don't want to!

323
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,166
Aw, c'mon, Skuld!

324
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,708
Hey, you don't have
very many channels here.

325
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,916
You're interfering
with my cleaning!

326
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
The laundry dryed
quite nicely today.

327
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,500
Here. Why don't you
take a little break?

328
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,500
Why should a goddess
have to do push-ups?

329
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,750
And then next you
add the heavy cream.

330
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,791
Oh, I see...

331
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,250
This one here is
far more efficient.

332
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,791
--Hm...
--Ah...

333
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,208
It seems that this
part is hurting.

334
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,875
Uh-huh...

335
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,666
Well, I'm all done.

336
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,125
Now we'll be able to take
it for a ride tomorrow.

337
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,375
Thank you for all
your hard work.

338
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,625
Hey, I was wondering...
Can I ask you about something?

339
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,000
Sure, what is it?

340
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,666
Well, I think that my
grandfather, Hotarunosuke,

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,958
really did want to
come back here, but,

342
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,166
for some reason, he
just never was able to.

343
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,458
And because of that...

344
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,125
you ended up waiting
around here for him

345
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,333
for so many decades.

346
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,833
Do you ever think it
would have been better

347
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,583
if you guys had never
met in the first place?

348
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,458
When I was sick in bed...

349
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,458
I did feel some
resentment towards him.

350
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,083
I wondered why he
didn't come visit me.

351
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,625
But in spite of that,
I couldn't stay angry.

352
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,291
Because I still felt that
meeting Hotarunosuke

353
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,125
was still the brightest
moment of my entire life.

354
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,875
So you see...

355
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm sure it's better
to have met him

356
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,250
and suffered this fate...

357
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:12,416
than to have passed him by
and never known him at all.

358
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,291
I guess I'll know
after tomorrow's ride

359
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,500
whether or not I was right.

360
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,916
Well, we'll be back
in a little while.

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,125
All right.

362
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,916
Be careful, okay?

363
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,791
Well, there they go at last.

364
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,125
Uh-huh.

365
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,958
All right... Well, have a look.

366
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,125
Mm.

367
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,791
The soft breeze...

368
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,625
The pleasant hum
of the engine...

369
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,375
And the scenery from a
completely different perspective

370
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,958
than when you just
walk along the road.

371
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,708
This is what you wanted
to show me, isn't it?

372
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,416
Back when I feared
the shadow of death

373
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
as it loomed so near.

374
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:19,375
The trees. The earth. The sky.

375
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,125
And myself...

376
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,500
We all share a common
fate in how we'll be

377
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,500
swept away in an
instant on this breeze...

378
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,750
And yet... That's
the very reason...

379
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,583
I'm so happy I got to meet you.

380
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,916
On this breeze that blows
only here and now...

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,375
Master Hotarunosuke...

382
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,916
Thank you, Keiichi.

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,250
Huh?

384
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:52,333
For being so patient with
me and all my demands.

385
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,291
Oh, it's not like that!
I mean, well... Huh?

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,375
Farewell...

387
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,791
I think that's what
she whispered to me

388
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,750
at the very last moment.

389
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,958
--Our treasure...
--Oh, Den!

390
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,833
C'mon you two, stop crying!

391
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,833
Are you really just going
to leave that thing here?

392
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,250
Yeah.

393
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,500
Y'see... I think I saw a
bit of myself in the situation

394
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,416
she was faced with.

395
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,833
There might come a time when
I'll be just like her...

396
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,791
When I'll have to wait
patiently for Belldandy

397
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,125
to return to me from heaven.

398
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,625
Oh, Keiichi...

399
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,666
That's why I want
to leave it here...

400
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,000
For her...

401
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,375
I promise that I won't
keep you waiting

402
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,791
for years and years like that.

403
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,333
Well, that's a relief!

404
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,208
But I have been
wondering what I would do

405
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,958
if that ever did happen.

406
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,000
What do you think you would do?

407
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,833
I guess I'd just...
keep working on my bike,

408
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,916
and hope you would eventually
come back to me someday.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,208
And then... if we were
able to meet again...

410
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,041
I guess I'd at least be able
to take you for a ride.

411
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,458
We could ride all
around Nekomi...

412
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,416
the place where I met you...

413
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,291
and so many others...

414
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:20,208
Keiichi... I'm so
glad we came here.

415
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:25,125
And so... in the basement of
the old hotel on the hilltop...

416
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,916
you can still find a
Brough Superior motorcycle

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,375
continuing to sleep
the time away.

418
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,541
That's right. I'd be glad
to tell you any time...

419
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,500
letting the melody carry
my infinite feelings to you.

420
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,000
But I...

421
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,583
Next time: "Ah! The Song of
Love That Shakes the Heart"

422
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,666
I love you!

423
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,250
--I l-l-lo...
--Oh, just spit it out!
