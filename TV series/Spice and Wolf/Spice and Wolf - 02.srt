1
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,625
[HOLO] Just look
at my ears and tail.

2
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,083
Can you not tell that
I am a very proud wolf?

3
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,458
Not only can my ears hear
disaster, they can detect lies.

4
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,458
Many have been
helped with their ability;

5
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,000
in fact, I could not even
count the number I have saved.

6
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,458
When people speak
of Holo the Wise Wolf,

7
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,125
they are referring to
none other than me.

8
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,416
I really hate fleas.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,916
[LAWRENCE] Yeah... Well...

10
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,250
You do have a fine
coat of fur.

11
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,458
Thank you.

12
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,083
I like that you
appreciate my tail.

13
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,375
You must be a very good
judge of character.

14
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,583
Yeah... You
would say that.

15
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,791
Oh. You shall get
a bath as well.

16
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,333
But it will start with
the top of your head.

17
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,958
[GATEKEEPER] We should
thank God for our meeting today.

18
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,958
Thank you. Please come in...

19
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,833
Who's this?

20
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,458
My wife.

21
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,708
She has some
bad burns on her face.

22
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,333
[GATEKEEPER] Oh, I see.

23
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,333
Let me take care of
our drenched goods,

24
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,666
and then I'll
come inside.

25
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,583
It's raining pretty
hard out there.

26
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,791
Yes, but it feels so
cooling on my burns.

27
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,583
Holo, what should
I do about the wheat?

28
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,166
What do you mean
what should you do?

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,583
It's just I don't know if
I should thresh it or not.

30
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,125
I feel like I should
leave it alone.

31
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,333
Well, that's if
what you say is true..

32
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,291
if you really do dwell
within the wheat.

33
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,708
[HOLO] As long
as I am alive,

34
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,750
what you do to
the wheat does not matter.

35
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,666
It will not go bad
or wither away.

36
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,583
Now, if it should be consumed,
or become kindling,

37
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,083
or should it be ground down
and mixed in with the soil,

38
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,791
I shall likely disappear, 

39
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,416
but threshing
will not be a problem.

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Then I'll put
the grains in a bag

41
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,625
after I thresh it and
you can hang on to it.

42
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,208
I figure you
want it with you.

43
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,583
I do...

44
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,708
Would it be possible for me
to wear it around my neck?

45
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,833
Your neck?

46
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,916
Can... Can
I keep some?

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,166
I was thinking...

48
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,291
It would be nice to find
newer markets for wheat.

49
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,250
Crops from certain places 

50
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,041
grow well because that
is where they belong.

51
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,791
It would only
wither elsewhere.

52
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,750
Trust me.

53
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,083
You would be
wasting your time.

54
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,541
The rain was
a waste, too...

55
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,541
You may have gotten soaked
with all of it,

56
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,875
yet still...
you stink.

57
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,083
Hey!

58
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,458
[laughing]

59
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,500
I believe you to be a
decent enough looking man.

60
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:23,208
Why do you not take
care of yourself better?

61
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,541
Excuse me...

62
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,458
but it doesn't seem to be
affecting my business.

63
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,958
That may be due
to your beard.

64
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,916
It does look
nice on you.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,250
Oh, so there is something
about me you like?

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
But I think it
would look better

67
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,875
if it were a
little longer...

68
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,291
If the whiskers
were different.

69
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,000
Maybe something
like this.

70
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,916
[howling]

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,333
[laughing]

72
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,500
Lawrence the Wolf...

73
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,416
That would be funny.

74
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,875
[LAWRENCE] There
are people in there.

75
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,250
So please try
to act normal.

76
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,708
I am Holo
the Wise Wolf.

77
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,291
I have been traveling in
this form for a long time.

78
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,875
Do not worry
about me.

79
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,500
Although I would
have never thought

80
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,000
to hide my face,
not because of a burn.

81
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,666
It is an interesting
notion, however.

82
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,916
Oh?

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,791
What would you
think if it were real?

84
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,250
Well... Such a burn
would be proof of myself.

85
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,041
As my ears and tail are, 

86
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,166
I would think
this is a face

87
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,375
which belongs to
none other than me.

88
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
I guess that's true...

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,666
[NOBLEMAN] I see... So you
came from Yorenz, then?

90
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,833
Yes, I picked up salt there

91
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,375
and got some of their best
marten for an exchange.

92
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,500
It was really a
nice deal, actually.

93
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,291
Right, but it seems
to me like it would be

94
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,500
a pain to go back
to Yorenz from here.

95
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,458
That's the beauty of it,
I don't have to go back.

96
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,041
You don't?
Why not?

97
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,541
When I purchased salt from
a trading company in Yorenz,

98
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,875
I didn't initially
pay for it there.

99
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,458
I had actually sold some wheat

100
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,791
in a different town to a
branch of the same company

101
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,875
where I got the salt.

102
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,000
The transaction was
that instead of receiving

103
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,750
a payment for the wheat,

104
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't have to
pay for the salt.

105
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,666
In other words, two separate
sales transactions 

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,458
were completed without
exchanging any money.

107
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,083
Nice.
Very unusual.

108
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,500
It's a system
we like to call

109
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,875
"exchange transactions"
which was invented by merchants

110
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,958
who were
dealing with people

111
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,958
in several different
locations.

112
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,375
[NOBLEMAN] I own
a vinery in a town

113
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,458
not far from here
called Perenzzio.

114
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,000
I'd never
considered paying

115
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,166
my business transactions
in this way.

116
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,125
Should I be learning
this technique, too?

117
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,833
[LAWRENCE] No, I
think you are fine.

118
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,916
This is simply a way for
us to avoid the risk

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,750
of having all of
our money stolen

120
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,791
while we are traveling
back and forth.

121
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,416
If you are a
lord who owns a vinery,

122
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,250
all you have
to be careful of

123
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,583
is not letting the traders
get your price too low.

124
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,625
[NOBLEMAN] That's true.

125
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,958
I end up fighting with
them about it every year.

126
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,250
I feel for you.

127
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,416
Craft Lawrence...
is that right?

128
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,416
When you come to
the Perenzzio area next time,

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,458
by all means, you have
to stop by my house.

130
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,250
We will welcome you.

131
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,625
Yes. Thank you.

132
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,500
Now, we should probably go,
my wife seems to be tired.

133
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,750
Well, then...

134
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,083
I hope that God will
bring us together again.

135
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
[ZHEREN laughing]

136
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,000
Mister, you're really good.

137
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,791
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

138
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,833
I'm just a merchant.

139
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:23,916
Yeah, right.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,916
I had my eye on
that couple, too;

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,916
but I couldn't get
anywhere close to them.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,291
But you, Mister
"Just a Merchant,"

143
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,875
you made it
look so easy.

144
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,750
Tell me something.

145
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,875
How'd you do it?

146
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,125
When I first started, 

147
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,875
all the peddlers looked
like monsters to me.

148
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,875
Funny thing,
most of them

149
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,333
are actually
still monsters.

150
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,125
You gotta try harder.

151
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,416
Thanks.

152
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,333
It's nice to know somebody
understands how I feel.

153
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,916
Hey, it's nice
to meet you.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,666
My name is Zheren.

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,833
I'm Lawrence.

156
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,041
And I'm a rookie in case
you hadn't noticed.

157
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,541
So I'm guessing
this is your wife?

158
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,791
Yes. Holo.

159
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,791
You don't normally see a
peddler with a wife.

160
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,000
Why is she all covered up?

161
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,125
What, don'tcha think
she's pretty enough

162
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,833
to be seen by
other people?

163
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,625
No, that's not it at all.

164
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,041
Meeting you today has
to be the will of God.

165
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,958
And because of that, 

166
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,000
I think you should let
me take a look at her.

167
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,000
What?

168
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:16,833
[HOLO] A trip
is the most fun

169
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,833
before one sets out on it.

170
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,000
With dogs, the bark

171
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,958
and not the bite
is more frightening.

172
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,916
And women are
almost always prettier

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,833
when they are
shrouded in mystery.

174
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,791
I could never be as
pretty as you imagine,

175
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,583
and I would never do
something like that to you.

176
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,416
Would it not be
better to imagine?

177
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,750
Oh, yeah, you have a
pretty good point there.

178
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,000
She does have a way 

179
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,250
of putting things into
perspective sometimes.

180
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,791

be heaven's guidance

to the two of you.

182
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,708
So knowing that, do you think
you might be willing to listen

183
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,750

amazing opportunity?

187
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,500
Oh! Is that
goat cheese?

188
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,750
Hold on a sec.

189
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,333
Why?

190
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,500
Is this the wheat?

191
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,125
It is, and I put a
leather string on it

192
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,333
so you can hang it
around your neck.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,291
[HOLO]
Thank you.

194
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,041
But forget about
the wheat right now,

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,291
food comes first!

196
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,583
Hold on a sec!

197
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

198
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,708
There's the leather
string and the bag.

199
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,541
And don't forget, I got
the cheese as a treat,

200
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,916
so I had to donate a lot
of money to the church.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,958
You had better be
ready when I bill you!

202
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,875
Are you finished,

203
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,083
or did you have
something else?

204
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,000
No.

205
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,500
I already know
all those things.

206
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,000
Vegetables grown
by humans

207
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,708
taste better
than leaf buds.

208
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,791
I also like the idea
of cooking them!

209
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
Don't eat them
all at once.

210
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,125
That was frightening.

211
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,541
I find human throats
to be very narrow.

212
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,750
It is vexing!

213
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,250
Yeah, um...

Get used to chewing.

215
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,625
Well, so you know...

216
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,250
Wolves do not
have any cheeks.

217
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,333
We cannot take
the time to chew.

218
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,416
I could tell.

219
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,083
It has been a long time
since I have choked,

220
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,250
but I remember
doing so on a potato.

221
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,208
Perhaps I do not do
so well with this vegetable.

222
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,166
Stupid potato!

223
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,291
Holo, can
you really tell

224
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,500
if someone
is lying to you?

225
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,541
Lying?

226
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,416
Yes, basically.

227
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,250
But to what extent?

228
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,458
Well, to the extent
that I could know this:

229
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,666
You praised my tail, 

230
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,625
but for some reason
you did not mean it.

231
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,541
However, you realize I
cannot be correct at all times.

232
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,875
In the end,
whether or not

233
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,958
you believe me
is your decision.

234
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,666
Let's say I
believe you.

235
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,583
What do you think
about that kid?

236
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,958
What kid?

237
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,083
The one who talked to us
in front of the fireplace.

238
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,250
Oh, him!

239
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,291
Yes, but from my point of
view, you are both kids.

Do not worry.

242

I believe you are
a bit more mature.

243
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,083
You wish to know
if the story he told

244
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,958
was truth,
is that it?

245
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,583
[ZHEREN] Let me get
to the point here,

246
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,875
there's a certain
silver coin

247
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,708
that is currently
being circulated.

248
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,958
Word has it there's
a newer coin coming soon,

249
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,708
and it is supposed to
contain more silver.

250
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,166
Really.

251
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
Somethin' told me that
wouldn't surprise you.

252
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,208
When you exchange it for
another country's currency,

253
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,500
the silver coins will
be worth more to you.

254
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,708
So in other words...

255
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,500
In other words, if
you begin collecting

256
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,583
silver coins now
and exchange them

257
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,291
when the new ones
become available,

258
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,625
you will then
be able to make

259
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,666
a fairly impressive
profit on the difference.

260
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,166
What do you say?

261
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,541
I can tell you
which silver coin

262
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,750
they're going to change,

263
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,125
and in return, when
you make your big profit,

264
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,500
I wouldn't mind
if you shared

265
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,833
a little bit of
it with me.

but it is most
definitely a lie.

Currency speculation is pretty
common actually, but...

True?

271
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,708
When a person lies,

272
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,416
what is important is
not the lie itself.

273
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,208
No.

274

any idea at all

how long it took me
to figure that out?

You do not have
to let it bother you.

After all you are still a kid.

At any rate, what
would you have done

282
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,875
had I not been here
to tell you this?

283
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,083
I would have held
off on deciding

284
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,458
whether or not
it was true.

285
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,666
Most likely, I would've
acted like I was gonna

286
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,125
go along with
his proposal.

287
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,916
Why would
you do that?

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
If it is true, I can
just go along

289
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,916
with the idea of
making a profit.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,416
I'm not out anything...

291
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,125
If it's a lie that means
someone's up to something.

292
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,833
So, if I quietly investigate, 

293
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,375
I'll be able
to find out

294
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,833
what's behind
the whole scheme.

295
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,083
And nothing will change

296
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,083
now that I told you
it is a lie, correct?

have hesitated

323
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,791
That's enough for now.

324
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,458
It must have to do
with the changing times.

325
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:38,083
At this rate, we
cannot prevent it.

326
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,291
Have you changed
this much Holo?

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,416
Then, I'm willing to bet

328
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,583
your home won't
have changed either.

329
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,083
Being comforted by you

330
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,250
is rather disgraceful
for this wise wolf.

331
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,666
Hey...! Are
you coming...?

332
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,625
What are you doing?

333
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,291
[ZHEREN] Really?

334
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,000
You want to do
business with me?

335
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,958
Yes, but I can't
pay you up front.

336
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,875
I won't be able to do
much until I cash in the fur.

337
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,333
Then let's meet up again
at the port town of Pazzio.

338
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,125
Once you're in town, 

339
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,541
ask about the bar Yorrend
and we'll go from there.

340
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,833
Things'll be set up

341
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,125
so you'll be able
to get into contact with me.

342
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,208
Sounds good...
it's Yorrend, right?

343
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,041
Yes, Yorrend,
that's it.

344
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,458
Okay, I'm going on ahead...

345
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,375
I'll be seeing
the two of you soon!

346
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,708
He is
a very noisy man.

347
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,916
Why are we not
going with him?

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,333
The road's too
muddy right now.

349
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,708
Walking will be
faster for him.

350
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
There's no reason to
make him ride with us.

351
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,291
 Is it true merchants are
particular about time?

352
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,833
Time is money,
so yes.

353
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,166
I have never
heard that...

354
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,541
Time is money.

355
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,458
It means if
you have time,

356
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,333
you can use it
to make money.

357
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,458
Think about it.

358
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,958
I bet those
farmers you've seen

359
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,416
for all of these years
were pretty punctual.

360
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,583
What is your basis
for that comparison?

361
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,000
Those farmers were not
concerned about being on time.

362
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,791
They were following
their senses.

363
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,458
I don't understand.

364
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,083
Think of it like this.

365
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,958
They awaken when
they sense daylight

366
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,791
and pull weeds when
they sense the afternoon.

367
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,083
They rejoice
in buds spouting

368
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,708
when they sense
it is spring...

369
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,458
And they enjoy
crops growing

370
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,750
when it
becomes summer.

371
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,083
Celebrate the harvest
when they sense fall...

372
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,166
and await the spring
when they sense winter.

373
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,458
They do not care
about time...

374
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,541
And neither do I.

375
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,250
You only lack
the experience...

376
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,458
but you
will get there.

377
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,166
Shall I put
it another way?

378
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,458
I mean to say
you will become

379
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,333
nicely established
when you get older.

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,250
How many hundreds of years
ahead of me are you?

381
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,291
Do you see what I mean?

382
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,291
You have a very sharp wit.

383
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,166
I dunno.

384
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,458
I think that
might be all you.

385
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,250
Your brain is so old it's
starting to break down.

386
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,750
Let me ask
you something.

387
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,791
Do you know why we
wolves attack humans

388
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,541
when they travel
in the mountains?

389
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,291
No.

390
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,958
It is violent...

391
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,458
We do like to
eat their heads.

392
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,541
But it's only
because we want

393
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,458
to obtain their power.

394
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,083
You are just
a fledgling.

395
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,625
No match for me.

396
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,250
Now have you ever been
attacked in the forest?

397
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,791
Silence?

398
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,750
I can assume then
your answer must be yes.

399
00:19:54,833 --> 00:20:01,083
Yeah... at least
eight times.

400
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,625
And they were
formidable?

401
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,416
Yes...

402
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,000
We somehow made it
through a band of wild dogs...

403
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,166
but the wolves
were different.

404
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,166
Do you know why?

405
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,208
It's likely the wolves
had eaten humans before

406
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,791
and had gained their power.

407
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,291
Will you stop it?!

408
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,291
Look I'm sorry
if I insulted you.

409
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,875
Just please stop.

410
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,125
Please. Stop talking.

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,791
Oh... Yes

412
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
Are you angry?

413
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,375
Yes, I am.

414
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,666
Don't say anything
like that ever again.

415
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,791
Wolves have only
lived in forests.

416
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,166
Dogs, however...

417
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,208
have spent time
with humans.

418
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,666
That is the difference.

419
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,958
That is why the wolves
are more formidable.

420
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,083
Wolves only know about
being hunted by humans.

421
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,375
Humans are something
to be feared.

422
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,125
That is why
we attack.

423
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,666
We feel as if we
have no other choice.

424
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,458
The forest
must be safe.

425
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,708
Have you attacked?

426
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,375
There are things even
I refuse to answer.

427
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,041
I ask you
to understand.

428
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,666
Sorry.

429
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,750
And now
we're even.

430
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,500
We live in
two worlds...

431
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,833
And they are very different
from one another.

432
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,666
Wolf and Business Talent.
