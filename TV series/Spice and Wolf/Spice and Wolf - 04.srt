1
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,500
[LAWRENCE] Well, the smoked
mutton was unexpectedly tender.

2
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,750
Don't you think?

3
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,541
And I'm sorry, I guess
we ended up drinking

4
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,291
more than I had wanted to.

5
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,375
We didn't really exchange 

6
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,708
that much information did we?

7
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,208
[ZHEREN] Yeah, you know
I guess we didn't, did we.

8
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,583
I keep getting distracted
by your wife's conversation.

9
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,416
I'm fascinated
by what she says.

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,208
[LAWRENCE] She loves to chatter
about nothing, it seems.

11
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,291
[ZHEREN] Even so...

12
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,833
I think she's
absolutely incredible.

13
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,083
You're a lucky man.

14
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,375
[ZHEREN]
Thanks again.

15
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,000
You two have been
great. Bye, take care!

16
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,583
[LAWRENCE]
Sure.

17
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,250
[ASSESSOR] Sounds good.

18
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,666
Now that I know what this
Zheren person looks like,

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
I can find out more
about him for you.

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,583
[LAWRENCE] I'd really
appreciate it.

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,416
But to be perfectly
honest, this is unusual.

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,291
I'm surprised to see it
happening after only one day.

23
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,083
We were a little cautious
at the beginning,

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,041
but after hearing
all the details,

25
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,958
it doesn't seem to be
just a simple fraud.

26
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,375
In order to get a large
amount of silver coins

27
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,333
whose value is
going to decrease,

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,500
someone is enlisting
people to persuade

29
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,833
several merchants to
purchase silver coins

30
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,833
by telling them a
somewhat believable story

31
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,708
about the value increasing.

32
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,750
However, since their
value is going to decrease,

33
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,625
the merchants will want to
get rid of them pretty quickly.

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,166
I can only assume
at that point...

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,583
this mystery person
will buy them all at once.

36
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,166
And any merchants sure
aren't going to tell anybody.

37
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,666
After all, they don't want
to hurt their reputations.

38
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,708
I'm starting to get a good idea 

39
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,708
about how you can make
an enormous profit

40
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,166
using silver coins whose
value is decreasing.

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,916
However, it does come
with a fairly significant risk.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,166
I have to admit, I'm pretty
intrigued by this whole thing.

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,125
I'm glad to hear it.

44
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,375
Well, everything is
a learning experience...

45
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,041
And that includes the
sale of those marten furs.

46
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,583
[HOLO] Do you think
we will make it in time?

47
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,708
Even if your
assumption is correct,

48
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,541
Milone Trading is
going to have to

49
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,416
do something about
this situation quickly.

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,166
Otherwise the plan to outwit
Zheren shall end in failure.

51
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,000
[LAWRENCE]
I'm sure it will be fine.

52
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,625
In order for this
to be successful,

53
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,208
especially in a foreign land,

54
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,041
they have to be
able to investigate

55
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,500
a person's background...
and do it quickly.

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,375
[HOLO laughing]

57
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,375
What's so funny?

58
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,250
Oh, it's nothing...

59
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,458
I was just remembering
the old days.

60
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,375
Why?

61
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,791
Because of me?

62
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,583
He was leaning back
in his chair as well

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,958
and had a terrible fall.

64
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,958
I tried to warn him,
but he refused to listen to me.

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,166
I will never forget
the look on his face!

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,000
[LAWRENCE] Sounds like
a fun person to be around.

67
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,375
[HOLO] Yes...

68
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,875
He was quite a fool,
but still extremely cheerful.

69
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,708
For some reason he
was never surprised

70
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,458
when he saw my wolf form.

71
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,125
I imagined some
called him strange.

72
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,125
But he was a very nice man.

73
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,875
He was the first
person to treat me

74
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,208
as if I was like
everybody else.

75
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,833
I liked him.

76
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,208
He was from Pasloei.

77
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,541
Is he the one
who asked you

78
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,083
to make the village's
wheat ripen well?

79
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,083
[HOLO] Yes.

80
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,125
Oh, what a fool he was.

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,125
I found him to
be a good friend.

82
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,833
What's wrong?

83
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,666
I believe I need to tell
you something important.

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,416
I just had it, but now
I cannot remember what it was...

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,875
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,000
[HOLO] I do not remember,
but I think it is important.

87
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,708
If it's that important,
don't worry, you'll remember.

88
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,166
I imagine so.

89
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,958
He was her friend... huh.

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,125
My name is Marlheit,
branch manager.

91
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,250
You can count on us.

92
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,500
We have no problems
with this deal.

93
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,833
What about Zheren?

94
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,208
Does that mean you were able

95
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,458
to find out who
he was working for?

96
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,250
Yes. It appears he was working

97
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,791
for the Medio Trading Company.

98
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,500
The Medio Trading Company?

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,125
I don't understand.

100
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,000
I mean, yes, it's true
they're the number one

101
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,500
crop dealer in Pazzio 

102
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,583
and they do have a lot of
shipment vessels, but still...

103
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,958
You're correct.

104
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,041
It would seem to be
impossible for them to carry out

105
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,583
what you suspect
all by themselves...

106
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,375
It's more than likely
there is a nobleman

107
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,208
behind this whole thing.

108
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,750
We have yet to
identify that person.

109
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,500
But no matter
who they may be,

110
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,458
if we move first
as you suggest,

111
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,125
we can make it
work in our favor.

112
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:44,375
Then why don't we discuss
what our shares are going to be?

113
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,750
You appear perhaps
too happy, today, I think.

114
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,750
Yeah, but just think about it.

115
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,083
There could be at least
300,000 Trenni silver coins...

116
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,916
Maybe even 400,000 

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,916
and if Myloan gives me
10 percent of their profit...

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,208
That's 2,000 for me and
enough to open my shop!

119
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,958
I am glad things appear
to be going so well for you.

120
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,708
I wanted you to stay at the inn
if your hangover was that bad.

121
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,375
I was worried.

122
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,583
I did not want for you
to get sweet-talked.

123
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,541
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,625
Exactly what I sai--

125
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,083
You're going to be fine...

126
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,250
The inn is right around
the corner, alright.

127
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,916
Just a few more steps
and we'll be there.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,333
All right.

129
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,750
[LAWRENCE yawning]

130
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,750
You drew your shop!

131
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,583
Do not be frightened.

132
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,916
How long you've been there?

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,416
I never even heard you.

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
I think you are
a very talented artist.

135
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,833
Well I don't think so,
but thank you.

136
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,416
Are you wanting to open
this shop of yours soon?

137
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,875
If this thing with
Milone Trading goes through...

138
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
[LAWRENCE]
I guess, yeah...

139
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,166
it's pretty much a done deal.

140
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,166
[HOLO]
I see.

141
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,541
There isn't a
single merchant I know

142
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,166
whose dream isn't
to own their own shop.

143
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,208
I guess I'm not any different.

144
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,250
If you have your own store, 

145
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,125
you can become
a member of that town.

146
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,708
It's different
than being a peddler.

147
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,208
You can make close friends, 

148
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,583
and it'll be easier
to find a wife.

149
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,708
Speaking of which, 

150
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,333
I wonder how Chloe
is doing right now.

151
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,541
I can't imagine
what she would say

152
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,208
if I opened my own shop.

153
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,333
Who knows, she might
even bite her tongue.

154
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,375
I would be
at a loss, though.

155
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,208
What do you mean?

156
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,333
Once you open this store, 

157
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,666
you are not very
likely to leave there,

158
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,333
am I right?

159
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,833
I would be forced to
either continue traveling

160
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,750
all alone or find
myself a new partner.

161
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,875
Yes, but you are wise, 

162
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,708
and don't forget about
the money you earned

163
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,125
from the marten furs.

164
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,208
Trust me, you'll be fine
traveling by yourself.

165
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,083
I do not want to.

166
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
I will not bind you...

167
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,041
But I am tired
of being alone...

168
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,125
You know?

169
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,791
Holo, I don't mind
coming along with you

170
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,458
until you get back
up to the north.

171
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,833
Even if I do get the money

172
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,291
it's not like I'll be able
to open my shop right away.

173
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,125
Do you mean this?

174
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,250
Of course, why would I lie?

175
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,125
Now why're you
making that face?

176
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,708
I told you I was
gonna go with you.

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,375
This isn't like you.

178
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,291
I always have the same dream.

179
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,375
Dream?

180
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,166
When I wake up,
everyone is gone.

181
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,458
Yue, Inty...

182
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,000
Paro Muri...

183
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,458
I cannot find
them anywhere.

184
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,958
We can live for
a hundred years.

185
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,291
I thought I could leave.
I left on a journey,

186
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,666
fully believing
I would see them again.

187
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,333
But I cannot find them.

188
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,875
I cannot find them anywhere.

189
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,041
I never imagined...

190
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,458
I thought I would be
able to see them again.

191
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,625
And now...

192
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,666
I am afraid...

193
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,416
I do not want to
wake from my dream

194
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
and discover I am all alone.

195
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,375
I am tired of being alone...

196
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,500
I do not want to be cold...

197
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,125
I do not want...

198
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,541
to be lonely.

199
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,791
I am so embarrassed.

200
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,500
This dream is very common
among peddlers, too.

201
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,708
Goodness...

202
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,541
Your tears have made
your face all sticky...

203
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,458
Give me a second.

204
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,666
 Here.

205
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,625
That is your drawing.

206
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,166
I've drawn a ton of them.

207
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,208
Besides, it's
not like the deal

208
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,375
has gone through yet

209
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,000
I need to be careful...

210
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,458
Don't wanna get
overly optimistic.

211
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,375
Thank you.

212
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,291
I suppose I am in your debt.

213
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,416
Oh, I am so tired.

214
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,375
Are you not going
to go to sleep yet?

215
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,333
I suppose I should...

216
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,166
I can save the candle.

217
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,875
You think like a merchant
every second of the day.

218
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,208
[LAWRENCE] What the...
What are you doing?

219
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,250
[HOLO] That is not a very
romantic thing to say.

220
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,333
I cannot breathe.

221
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,000
Hold on. Have your
eyes adjusted yet?

222
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,500
What are you...

223
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,000
It was important
after all.

224
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,375
I finally remembered what
I'd wanted to tell you.

225
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,791
There are people
outside the door.

226
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,208
And I do not sense
they are well meaning.

227
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,666
I'd be willing to bet
it's Medio Trading.

228
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,750
And we are on
the second floor.

229
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,250
Luckily no one will
be waiting outside.

230
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:09,875
Come on.

231
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,166
We should go now.

232
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,083
You should probably
just take advantage

233
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,125
of this situation
and look at my body

234
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,041
under the moonlight,
do you not think?

235
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,958
[banging on door]

236
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,000
[HOLO]
We shall run!

237
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,416
We do not have
time for the wagon.

238
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,000
Killing the horse would not
serve their purpose anyway.

239
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,583
We can retrieve him
when things calm down.

240
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,625
[LAWRENCE]
Right.

241
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,625
[HOLO]
Here take this!

242
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,750
Keep it with you
just in case!

243
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,458
[LAWRENCE]
Why is it hot?

244
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,250
[HOLO] Because it is
the wheat in which I dwell.

245
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,916
[THUG A] They're headed
to Milone Trading!

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,916
[THUG B] Don't let
them get inside!

247
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,166
[LAWRENCE] Holo, when
we're done with this,

248
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,416
I think we should
go shopping.

249
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,166
[HOLO] What are you
saying to me right now?

250
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,666
I'll buy you
a comb and a hat!

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,916
What are you up to?

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,958
 Nothing.

253
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,291
You just happen to
have beautiful hair.

254
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,541
I think I would much rather
have a comb for my tail.

255
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,333
Good idea.

256
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,041
We should get one...

257
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,083
Hang on,
we're almost there.

258
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,833
[THUG A]
Did you find them?

259
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,083
[THUG B]
No!

260
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:41,791
[THUG A] They should be
around here somewhere.

261
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,000
We've got backup coming.

262
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,333
We're going to
completely surround them.

263
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,125
[THUG B]
Yes, sir!

264
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,458
This is not looking
terribly good for us.

265
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,166
Do you think we
should split up then?

266
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,125
That is a good thought.

267
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,500
But I think
I have a better idea.

268
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,000
What is it?

269
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,833
I will go out onto the street
and attract their attention...

270
00:14:58,916 --> 00:14:59,625
In the meantime...

271
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,041
No, you can't.

272
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:01,833
I won't let you.

273
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:02,833
Listen...

274
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,500
If we split up without a plan 

275
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,041
you will be the one caught.

276
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,250
Do not forget, I am a wolf
and not so easy to capture.

277
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,666
If I am left alone, how can I
negotiate with Milone Trading?

278
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,250
You have already handed
over your plan to them.

279
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,958
What if they abandon us?

280
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,500
We are left with no choice 

281
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,750
but for you to
threaten to betray them.

282
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,250
No, I can't do it.

283
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,541
Don't you understand?

284
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,041
If Medio Trading sees
your ears and your tail

285
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,375
they will take you
immediately to the church.

286
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,916
They shall not capture me.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But even if they did, 

288
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,625
I can keep my ears
and tail hidden

289
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,125
if it is for
a day or two.

290
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,791
After all, I know
you will soon arrive

291
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,500
to rescue me anyway.

292
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,791
You don't understand!

293
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,791
Listen!

294
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,791
You want to open
this shop, correct?

295
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,083
Remember, I owe you.

296
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,458
This is simply my way
to paying back the debt.

297
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,583
Don't be ridiculous.

298
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,625
If you get caught,
they'll kill you!

299
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,916
A debt is not
the same as your life.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,208
Loneliness is a disease
that can lead to death.

301
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,500
They might as well
be the same thing.

302
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,375
Please don't!

303
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,458
I will always
believe in you.

304
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,291
[THUG A] That way...!

305
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,000
We found them!

306
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,208
They're on Roita Street.

307
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
[THUG B] Where are they?

308
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,541
[THUG C] There's
only one of 'em.

309
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,208
There's supposed to be two!

310
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,666
[THUG A] There he is!

311
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,125
My name is Lawrence!

312
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:35,916
Help me!

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,166
I was here this afternoon!

314
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,708
Help me!

315
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,041
[THUG A] I hear him!

316
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,666
[THUG A] Hold it!

317
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,125
Hand him over to us, now!

318
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,166
[BOSS] That's enough.

319
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,333
Let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

320
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,000
This is the Great Marquis
Milone's Milone Trading Company

321
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,041
which is authorized
by the Grand Duke Raondeal

322
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,750
of the Duchy of Raondeal!

323
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,583
This gate belongs
to the Marquis

324
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,916
and anyone who is
on these premises

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,083
is considered a
personal guest to him.

326
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,208
And any guest
of the Marquis

327
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,750
is also under the
care and protection

328
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,541
of the Grand Duke of Raondeal.

329
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,958
Understand this:

330
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,125
You're wrong if you think

331
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,583
you're striking
a simple property.

332
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,625
You might as well be striking 

333
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,291
the pedestal of the Grand Duke.

334
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,041
[whistle]

335
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,125
[THUG A] Withdraw for now.

336
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,166
It's rather late for
this kind of disturbance.

337
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,208
Now, why don't you
tell us what's going on.

338
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,750
You saved my life just now.

339
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,375
And I do apologize
for disturbing everyone.

340
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,625
No problem.

341
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,875
But you shouldn't
be thanking us;

342
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,291
you should thank the Marquis.

343
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,250
So tell me, who
were those guys anyway?

344
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,416
In all likelihood,

345
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,541
those men were
working for Medio Trading.

346
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,750
I think so too.

347
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,833
Somehow, they figured out
I brought a deal to you...

348
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,291
And they wanted to stop it.

349
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,708
They wanted to stop it?

350
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,958
It's possible they caught

351
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,250
the woman who
was traveling with me.

352
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,416
Can you help her?

353
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,583
Is there anything
you can do?

354
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,375
After hearing all
the commotion earlier,

355
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,500
some of our men
went to investigate.

356
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,250
They reported back to me 

357
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,583
they had seen a young woman
being taken away by force.

358
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,875
Do you think
it might be her?

359
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,166
It has to be.

360
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,333
That was probably Holo.

361
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,916
She acted as my decoy
so I could come here.

362
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Let me ask you:

363
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,041
Why do you think
they captured her?

364
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,791
What would
they want her for?

365
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,250
Like I said...!

366
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,541
They didn't want
us to work with you.

367
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,250
They wanted to get us out
of Medio Trading's way.

368
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,875
Then let me ask you this:
do you find it at all strange?

369
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,916
What are you
talking about?

370
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,333
Please calm down Lawrence.

371
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,958
There is something
else is going on.

372
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,916
It's not that simple.

373
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,333
I don't understand.

374
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,416
Think about it
for just a minute.

375
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,958
What would they gain by
taking you two hostage?

376
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,416
It doesn't make any sense;
it'd have no effect on us.

377
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,916
What?

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,875
We've now started collecting
the Trenni silver coins

379
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,333
so what would
be the point?

380
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,708
They're already too late.

381
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,916
It would only
be worth taking

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,625
the two of you hostage
if you had asked us

383
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,458
to simply
collect the coins

384
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,250
without having told us

385
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,833
what kind of moneymaking
idea it was.

386
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,708
But we do know the deal.

387
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,166
We know what is happening.

388
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,958
It doesn't make any sense.

389
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,791
Yet still, if
the rest were true,

390
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,541
I can't see a
store acting on it.

391
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,000
Can you?

392
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,125
No, I... I can't.

393
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:20,791
Yes.

394
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,166
I hate to say this,

395
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,958
but we already have all
the necessary information.

396
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,958
Whatever happens
to the two of you

397
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,416
is really no longer
our concern.

398
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,625
Believe me,
I am sorry...

399
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,625
But we already
have invested

400
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,541
quite a bit
of money into this.

401
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,458
I have to compare
the extraordinary profit

402
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,916
from this deal with
a grudge from a merchant

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
who we might see
every three years.

404
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,333
Again, I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have

405
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,958
to chose
the company's profit.

406
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,458
However, everyone here
in Milone would like you...

407
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,333
I can't
believe this.

408
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,500
Calm down and think!

409
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,291
Look, I can tell
your companion

410
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,083
must be very
important to you.

411
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,083
But you cannot allow that
to go to your head right now.

412
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,916
Might as well put
the cart before the horse.

413
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,708
You're right.
I apologize.

414
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,625
No need. I don't
imagine I would be able

415
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,166
to keep my
composure either.

416
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,833
Not if my wife was
in the same situation.

417
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,750
Still though,
this is strange.

418
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,791
Medio Trading would
also know full well

419
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,083
what our decision would be
in regards to helping you two.

420
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,666
That's true...
Of course they'd know.

421
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,041
And yet they
went after you,

422
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,291
knowing it still wouldn't
give them any leverage.

423
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,708
Why would they
want the two of you

424
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,166
if they weren't going
to get anything out of it?

425
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,166
Do you have any idea
why they'd want you?

426
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,541
 No, none what-so-ever.

427
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,125
I don't know.

428
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,750
In all truth, the profit
margin we're looking at

429
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,375
could be enormous.

430
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,750
I'd like to insure this
plan is going to succeed.

431
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Yes, I'm sure
you would.

432
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,041
If you can think of anything,
no matter how trivial,

433
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,666
I'm asking you
to please let me know.

434
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,000
Lawrence!

435
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,166
If you have an idea...

436
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,041
Tell me what it is.

437
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,791
[knocking door]

438
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,125
Excuse me, sir.

439
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,458
Yes, what is it?

440
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,708
We received a letter.

441
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,458
It was thrown
over the fence.

442
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:22,166
I think it has something to do
with what is going on right now.

443
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,208
It's to the wolf...

444
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,250
and the forest
where the wolf lives.

445
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,125
Please give it to me.

446
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,333
You can have it back;
I just want to read it first.

447
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,416
Be my guest.

448
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,333
I appreciate it.

449
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,458
"We have the wolf.

450
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,458
The door of the church
is always open...

451
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,666
Keep the doors closed

452
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,041
with those in the house 

453
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,208
so the wolf does not come in."

454
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,583
They have the girl who was
with me; her name is Holo.

455
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,375
She is an incarnation
of the wolf

456
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,250
who is known
to bring a rich harvest.

457
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,250
It is you.

458
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,791
