2
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,541
[HOLO] No one knows when
the people of this village

3
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,791
began to say "the wolf
is running" to describe

4
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,458
the ripe wheat
swaying in the wind.

5
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,458
Whene'er the wind lays
flat the ears of wheat,

6
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,625
they become
"trampled by the wolf"...

7
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,583
And should a poor
harvest befall,

8
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,500
the crops are
"eaten by the wolf"...

9
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,791
In the beginning,
there was nothing...

10
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,958
There was only warmth...

11
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,375
And then, a promise was made.

The cycle of encounters 

15
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,250
and farewells continued,
with favour.

16
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,416
Until, one day,
humans came to achieve

17
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,208
abundance on their own.

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,208
And there was no
need to be faithful

19
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,875
to their promise anymore.

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,708
[LAWRENCE] I bet you're
getting just as tired

21
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,500
of these country roads
as I am.

22
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,875
Right?

23
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958
[CAVALIER]
A peddler?

24
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:19,958
[LAWRENCE]
I am, yes.

25
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,000
Actually, I'm
returning from

26
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,208
a small
mountain village

27

half a day east of here.

28
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,041
Lucky for me,

29
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,291
they ended up
buying my salt.

30
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,583
Really?
Is that it?

31
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,583
No.

32
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,333
These are all furs.

33
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,916
Yeah, that's just
a bundle of wheat.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,666
It's the kind which can
sustain either hot or cold.

35
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,166
What's going on?

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,916
Everyone seems a little
over cautious.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,958
Not really.

38
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,958
We've been told
a village in the west

39
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,000
is holding a pagan festival.

40
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,250
Pagan festival?

41
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,166
Yeah.

42
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,291
[CAVALIER]
It's a disgrace.

43
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,291
They refuse to believe
in the one true God.

44
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,375
You'd think
the Holy Father

45
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,916
would use his
power over them.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,458
If it were me,
they'd be crushed.

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,833
But it looks like
he won't do anything.

48
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,291
I don't know,
maybe he just pities

49
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
the filthy
and scheming.

50
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,583
Pagans, huh...?

51
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,625
So the people of
Pasloei are pagans.

[FARMER A] Who would
have guessed it?

54
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,375
I can't believe
the new method

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,916
led to such a
rich harvest!

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,666
[FARMER B] Can't
thank the Earl enough.

57
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,500
[FARMER C] Well, we couldn't
just keep counting on the wolf.

[FARMER D] Hey,
don't insult her.

59
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,000
She's supposed to
be a god, remember?

60
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,541
Oh! Hey Lawrence!

61

[LAWRENCE]
Hello!

62
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,083
It's been awhile,
hasn't it.

63
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,541
Well, you came
at the right time.

64
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,750
Our harvest festival
starts tomorrow.

65
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,291
Tomorrow...?

66
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,583
I'm getting the impression
it's already started, right?

67
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,083
[laughing]

68
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,958
You're right,
We started early.

69
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,791
Care to join?

70
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,500
Hey now...!

71
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,583
He didn't do any work,

72
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,375
so why does he
get to join us?

73
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,541
You didn't do
any work either!

74
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,916
You wouldn't by chance 

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,375
know where I could
find Chloe would you?

76
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,500
Chloe...?

77
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,291
Oh, I see.

78
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,541
That's how it is.

79
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,333
Not at all.

80
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,833
She's a fellow merchant,

81
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,500
so I like to have a drink
with her every once in awhile.

82
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,875
We like to talk work.

83
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,708
I have bad news for you.

84
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,250
They'll be the last ones this
year to finish harvesting...

85
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,166
 So Chloe will have to become
Holo for the festival.

86
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,375
Look everyone;
I can see her hiding

87
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,583
from us in the wheat!

88
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,416
Who'll be the lucky
one to catch the wolf?

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,833
Who's it going to be?

90
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,208
Chloe!

92
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,958
When'd you get here?

93
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,125
You better watch out,

94
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,666
Holo is gonna get away!

95
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,458
Finally, the last bundle!

96
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,833
Come on now;

97
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,000
don't keep all
the wheat for yourself.

98
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:41,791
You better be careful,

99
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,083
or Holo will escape!

100
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,375
Who's gonna
be the lucky one

101
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
to catch the wolf?

102
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,541
It's Chloe!

103
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,333
[howling]

104
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,291
Holo the Wolf has appeared!

105
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,875
Catch her!

106
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,000
She's heading over there!

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,250
Lawrence, help us!

108
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,125
Don't let her get away!

109
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,500
It's been awhile,

110
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,958
so tonight is
gonna be your treat.

111
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,583
What do you mean
"tonight is my treat"?

112
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,000
You're going to be

113
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,208
locked up in
there for a week.

114
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,833
Thanks to you,
we were finally able

115
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,916
to find some
new customers.

116
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,833
I'm sure Chloe's
a help to you now...

117
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,833
She has a talent
for this business.

118
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,791
Yes.

119
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,291
She is our
price negotiator...

120
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,708
This village is not
the same as it used to be.

121
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,250
Oh...

122
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,250
Those are
Trenni silver coins...

123
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,416
I haven't seen them
in this area before.

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,666
Yes, I know.

125
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,625
We are bidding
a farewell to the old,

126
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,833
rusty Lute silver coins.

127
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,708
I suppose you will soon
rival big towns like Pazzio.

128
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,333
Well, not yet.

129
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,666
But when we do, 

130
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,708
it will be thanks to our
new lord, Earl Ehrendott.

131
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:27,250
We will never have to
pray to that wolf again.

132
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,416
Fortunately,
we can now overcome

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,125
the drought and
the wind all by ourselves

134
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
Forget about
Trenni silver coins.

135
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,333
I'd like to fill our village
with Lumione gold coins.

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,833
And when you do,

137
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,250
I hope you continue
to use my services.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,708
After all, an outsider 

139
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,791
would just be a nuisance.

140
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,833
On the other hand, 

141
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,791
filling the village with
Lumione gold is a stretch.

142
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,000
Time for bed...

143
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,375
Finally.

144
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,583
What... a girl?

Hey you!

147
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
Get up now!

148
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,791
What are you doing
in my wagon anyway?

149
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:10,125
I said get up!

150
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,250
Are those... ears.

151
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,791
A tail?

a beautiful moon.

00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,208
You there...

155
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,875
Do you perchance
have alcohol?

156
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,750
No, I don't
have any!

157
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,791
Who are you?

158
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:18,833
Why not?

159
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, then do
you carry any food?

160
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, no.
What a waste.

161
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,416
Demon...

162
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,166
Are you possessed
by the devil?

163
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,500
Ungrateful beast.

164
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,875
How dare you direct
your blade at me.

165
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,500
What? Ungrateful.

166

You are not from
the village, perhaps?

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,125
My apologies...

169
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,666
You may wield away.

170
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,375
My name is Holo.

171
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
This is the first
time in a long while

172
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,791
I have
taken this form...

173
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,625
I believe it to be
working out finely.

174
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,583
Holo?

175
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,791
Yes. Nice name,
is it not?

176
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,125
Amazing...

177
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,666
I have heard
of someone else

178
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,333
who is referred to
by that name.

179
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,375
Really? How unusual.

180
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,916
I have never known another
Holo besides myself.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,166
From where
is this person?

182
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,791
[LAWRENCE] It is
the name of a god

183
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,541
a village nearby has
known for generations.

184
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,458
Don't tell me you happen
to be the same god?

185
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,791
I have been named a god

186
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,833
and bound to this region
for quite a long time now.

187
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,000
I am not so grand...

188
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,833
Not as a god.

189
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,458
I am Holo, and Holo
is all that I am.

190
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,333
A meager, lost,
delirious woman

191
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,291
who must have been locked
deep inside of her house

192
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,333
ever since she
was a tiny infant.

193
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:48,291
You are thinking
something like that?

194
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,208
I was born in a land
from the far north.

195
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,541
North?

196
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,125
Yes, they have a short
summer and a long winter.

197
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,666
My home is in
the forest of Yoitz.

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,625
It is a world of silver
where everything sparkles.

199
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,500
You are a traveling peddler,
are you not?

200
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,083
Take me with you, then.

201
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,250
But why me?

202
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,583
Because I am a good
judge of character.

203
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,916
And because I do not believe

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,541
you are at all
the type of person

205
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,125
who would deny me
this kind of request.

206
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,041
Stay away!

207
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,958
I am not
that generous.

208
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,833
Please be
kinder to me.

209
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,000
I believe you
are adorable.

210
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,916
[HOLO sneezes]

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,416
I do not
hate this form,

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,833
but I find it too
cold for my liking.

213
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,458
Holo!

214
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,875
If you really are
"Holo the Wise Wolf"

215
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,791
I want you
to prove it to me!

216
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,208
Does that mean you wish
to see me in my wolf form?

217
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,458
That's right.

218
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,500
I do not want to.

219
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,125
What?

220
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,875
But why not?

221
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,333
I should ask you why!

222
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,083
Well...

223
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,166
Because if you're a human,

224
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,291
I'll turn you over
to the authorities.

225
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,583
A person
possessed by the devil

226
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,375
needs to be saved.

227
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
But I might
reconsider turning you in

228
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,041
if you are indeed Holo,
god of rich harvests.

229
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,625
After all, it's
possible you might

230
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,000
end up bringing me
some luck, as well.

231
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,541
Then you
insist upon this?

232
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,916
Yes, please.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,708
One more time
shall I ask...

234
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,375
Do you insist upon
seeing this no matter what.

235
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,208
No matter what.

236
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,666
An incarnation
cannot change

237
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,166
her form without
a compensation.

238
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
And In order for
me to change

239
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,416
I'll need the blood
of a human.

240
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,166
Either that or
a bit of wheat.

241
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
By all means,
the wheat.

242
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,958
Hey, are
you all right?

243
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
[whimpering]

244
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,375
Once again, I apologize

245
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,125
for coming
back so suddenly.

246
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,625
Not a problem.

247
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,916
I'm headed to the festival,
but make yourself at home.

248
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,541
[knocking on door]

249
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,333
Who's there?

250
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,166
[CHLOE] Holo.
[LAWRENCE] Holo?

251
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,916
[growling]

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,041
You didn't bother showing up,
so I've come to you.

253
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,291
What are you doing?

254
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,291
Aren't you supposed
to stay locked up?

255
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,833
Come on, it's not
like there's a real Holo

256
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,375
that's gonna get mad.

257
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,083
Let's go.

258
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,833
Just where are we going?

259
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,083
[CHLOE] You're treating
me, remember?

260
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,291
Did you go to Sauschbasch
before you came here?

261
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,166
You smell differently
than you did last time...

262
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,666
You always did
have a good nose.

263
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,875
Each place you visit
has a scent.

264
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,041
I guess it's only natural
for it to stick to you.

265
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,208
And your features are
different than before...

266
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,750
You seem to be
more confident.

267
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,750
Thank you.

268
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,208
Things are going well for me.

269
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,291
You should watch out.

270
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,875
I might end up taking
your place soon.

271
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,208
Well...

272
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,250
When you do, please
make use of my services.

273
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,333
That's rude...

274
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,125
You don't really
think I will, do you?

275
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,250
Why not...?

276
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,541
This is good alcohol.

277
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,416
Fine.

278
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,333
Who's being rude now?

279
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,458
If you believe in me so much,

280
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,125
then I've got
a proposal for you.

281
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,250
If it works out,

282
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,208
you'll be able to
open your own shop.

283
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,291
You might even be
able to get married.

284
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,083
Very funny, Chloe.

285
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm not being funny.

286
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,666
I've heard them talking
about a big business deal.

287
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,666
I'm telling you;
we could make a killing here.

288
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,541
Lawrence?

289
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,208
You're becoming more
and more like your father.

290
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,375
When it came to
dealing with business,

291
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,375
he definitely shared
in your enthusiasm.

292
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,625
It's not just enthusiasm.

293
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,750
Otherwise, I would
never have brought it up.

294
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,125
Is that so?

295
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,291
Well, just talking big business
can be intimidating.

296
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,250
But I find it hard to believe
you'd need me to talk.

297
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,791
No.

298
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,166
I want to work
with you specifically

299
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,750
because I respect you.

300
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,250
Don't you know?

301
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,083
I carry everything you have
ever taught me in my heart.

302
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,541
he only reason I'm where I
am today is because of you.

303
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,125
It's always been you.

304
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,500
Sounds risky.

305
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,250
Risky. Risky.

306
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,041
You're still young Chloe.

307
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,833
It sounds to me like this
is an all or nothing deal.

308
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,000
Before you get involved

309
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,458
I think you should
have more experience.

310
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,375
Your choice...

311
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,750
but this could've
been an opportunity

312
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,708
to make a profit together.

313
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,000
How about I bring you

314
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,166
a less risky deal next time.

315
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,916
I wouldn't mind
working with you on that.

316
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,416
And here I am...

317
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,625
I've grown up and you
never even noticed.

318
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,666
It's just your judgment

319
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,458
as a merchant
needs some growth.

320
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,916
Don't underestimate me.

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,041
You'll regret it one day.

322
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,250
That might be good for me.

323
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,916
But I'll try not to do it.

324
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,125
Is it a woman?

325
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,375
You seem as if you're
distracted by something.

326
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,166
I was wondering
what it could be.

327
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,666
Oh.

328
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,291
I wonder what it would be
like if Holo became my partner.

329
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,708
Holo?

330
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,416
Do you mean me?

331
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,291
No, I'm talking
about the real Holo.

332
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,583
For God's sake...

333
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,916
Please don't tell me
you believe in that myth.

334
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,958
You think it's just a myth?

335
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes, I do.

336
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
Just a myth, huh?

337
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,416
Just a myth.

338
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,541
I wonder if she
ever feels heartbroken.

339
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,208
Are you talking about Holo?

340
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,083
Yes-if she is real.

341
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,500
No. That's impossible...

342
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,708
Why would a god
feel heartbroken?

343
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,583
I don't know.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,708
There's no way
she really exists.

345
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,583
Who does not exist exactly?

346
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,250
Holo!

347
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,375
Do not be surprised.

348
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,583
Who did you expect?

349
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,041
Where have you been hiding?

350
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,375
Around this time of year...

351
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,125
I am in the harvested wheat.

352
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,708
Usually, I cannot leave there.

353
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,833
otherwise people would see me.

354
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,375
But there is one exception.

355
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,000
An exception?

356
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,500
If perchance there
is another harvested wheat

357
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,750
within a close proximity to
the wheat where I am hiding,

358
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,833
I can then move to that wheat.

359
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,208
In other words...

360
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,166
Without the bushel in your cart

361
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,458
I could never have escaped.

362
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,083
I am in your debt.

363
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,833
I'm sorry...

364
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,041
You graciously showed
me your true form

365
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,583
and all I did was
act like an idiot.

366
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,916
Is that why you disappeared?

367
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,625
A long time ago...

368
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,125
A young man from this
village approached me.

369
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,458
He asked me to help
their wheat to ripen well.

370
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,166
The promise made
I have kept ever since.

371
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,666
However, a rich harvest places
strain upon the land.

372
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,666
I had to allow it to
rest from time to time.

373
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,750
The villagers
called me impulsive.

374
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,166
They believed I had
broken my vow.

375
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,041
Now, it appears no one
needs me any longer.

376
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,625
Yet even when they
still had need of me...

377
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,958
Whenever anyone saw me...

378
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,000
they trembled with fear
and ran as far as they could.

379
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,666
And, so I was alone.

380
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,666
I never wished for that...

381
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:18,875
I never meant to
frighten you, either.

382
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,291
All right, suppose
I accept your story as it is.

383
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,083
You are a very skeptical man.

384
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,791
Do you have a place to go?

385
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,375
I wish to return to the north.

386
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,708
Lawrence!

387
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,500
All clear... You
can come out now.

388
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,708
I have to admit
it was not easy

389
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,000
to tie my shoelaces
inside of this thing.

390
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,833
Woe is me.

391
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,541
I can imagine it would be...

392
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,375
Shoelaces?

393
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,041
Hey...

394
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,666
Those are mine.

395
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,875
Yes...

396
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:26,958
And how do I look?

397
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,208
Those are my best clothes.

398
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,583
I spent ten years
collecting them.

399
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,958
They are very fine...

400
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,833
Quite wonderfully tailored.

401
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,958
So you...

402
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,291
are not such a bad
merchant after all.

403
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,541
I can still refuse
to take you with me.

404
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,750
I do not think
you would, though.

405
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,333
Don't underestimate.

406
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,625
I would never...

407
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,041
Now, as for your
name, what is it?

408
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,833
Lawrence.

409
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,541
My name is Craft Lawrence.

410
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,958
Well, Lawrence...

411
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,458
I will make certain
a stirring legend about you

412
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,250
shall be passed down
among the people for all time.

413
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,750
No thank you...

414
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,333
I don't need a legend...

415
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,625
But I will need you to
pay for your own meals.

416
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,250
It's not like this
is an easy business.

417
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,708
I am not the sort

418
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,000
who would insist upon living
off the charity of others.

419
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,458
I am Holo the Wise Wolf...

420
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,583
And I am a very proud wolf.

421
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,208
 At any rate...

422
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,750
This is rather small...

423
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,791
Thank you.

424
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,875
But, I am sure it helps
to keep out the cold.

425
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,583
Next episode:
Wolf and Distant Past.
