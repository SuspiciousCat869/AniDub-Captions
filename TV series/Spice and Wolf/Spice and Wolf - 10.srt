1
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,625
[JACOB] There's only one reason
you'd come here so early,

2
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,166
you must be doing
serious business today.

3
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,625
Do you need
a certificate?

4
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,916
[LAWRENCE]
Yes, please.

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,250
I hope you'll end up
becoming a merchant

6
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:14,291
whose name alone
will make people flinch!

7
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,375
Yeah, so do I.

8
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,291
Oh, and, uh, by the
way, is there anyone

9
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,333
with the trading
house that might

10
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,583
want to go to Lamtra?

11
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,833
Oh no, say it isn't so.

12
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,500
Tell me you didn't fall
for that shepherd girl.

13
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,416
It's not like that.

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,625
Well, she is the only one

15
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,666
who comes back
safe from that area.

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,875
I don't need to tell you

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,958
how the church
feels about her, do I?

18
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,541
If you don't
want to be dragged

19
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,250
into a damned
complicated mess,

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,375
stay away from her.

21
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,875
Although, when
you think about it,

22
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,458
that fairy girl Nora
is definitely your type.

23
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,458
No she is not.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,916
So do you want
the recipients

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,166
name on
the certificate or not?

26
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,416
On it.

27
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,375
Go ahead and make it
out to Lemerio Trading.

28
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,583
Are you saying you
already have a buyer?

29
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,250
Did you purchase
this on credit?

30
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,541
Yeah, is that a problem?

31
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,458
I guess you'll find out.

32
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,166
What do you mean?

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,833
Did they drop
the price or something?

34
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,166
Now don't worry about it.

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,875
It's you so
I'm sure everything

36
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,708
will turn
out just fine.

37
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,958
Okay.

38
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,791
Either way, you need to
wait to spend your money

39
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,541
on women until later.

40
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,250
You go through
all that trouble,

41
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,208
and then it's
gone in no time.

42
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,666
If I didn't get anything
in return, I wouldn't invest.

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,875
Look who's turning
into a hot shot.

44
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,500
Here's the certificate.

45
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,166
Thank you very much.

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,208
Alright I'm off,
wish me luck.

47
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,333
Holo, sorry to
keep you waiting.

48
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,916
They were quite sweet

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,333
They told me I was just like
a pretty little snowdrop.

50
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,791
Yeah well those kinds of guys
are like starving dogs.

51
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,708
They're preying on
what they think is weak.

52
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,416
Well I'm not weak.

53
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,416
Plus I have you
to rescue me anyway.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,875
Am I not right?

55
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,666
Yeah I guess if
I felt like it.

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,333
Although, the
only one doing

57
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,083
any rescuing
recently has been me.

58
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,000
Now then,
I have no idea

59
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,958
what it is you are
expecting in return.

60
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,083
I would still like for you
to invest in me, though.

61
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,250
You heard that?

62
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,208
I did not know
you liked blondes.

63
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,875
So you like her
gangly appearance?

64
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,666
Or is it that she's
having such a hard time?

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,083
Or are you just
in to shepherds?

66
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,583
Hold on a sec!

67
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,958
Jacob was being funny,
that's how he is!

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,708
I mean it's not like--

69
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,958
Not like what?

70
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,125
Well, it's true
that Nora is very pretty.

71
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,458
And it's also true that

72
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,625
I well I like
talking to her.

73
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,875
But that's all

74
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,291
It's not like
that'll end up

75
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,958
making me not
like you anymore.

76
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,875
Please don't get
all sensitive, okay?

77
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,833
Okay.

78
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,583
I was just
trying to tease you

79
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,333
a little bit
that is all.

80
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,541
However, I never thought

81
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,083
I would hear
that from you.

82
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,583
Thank you
I'm so glad.

83
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,833
Holo...

84
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,583
But!

85
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,625
Men will say anything
to get their way.

86
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,875
That may be true
with other men

87
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:19,125
But I'm a merchant
my word is my bond.

88
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,958
I have heard
knights sometimes

89
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,666
leave their
shields and swords

90
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,666
in the hands of others
to show their sincerity.

91
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,375
What would you do,
as a merchant?

92
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,791
All right then
to show my sincerity

93
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,250
I'll buy you honey
pickled peaches.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,166
What did you say
you would buy for me?

95
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,708
You know, everything
doesn't have to be

96
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,416
a game all
the time with you!

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,875
You are the
one who told me

98
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,958
to ask you in
a cute way, silly.

99
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,000
No I wanted you
to just ask me

100
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,541
Not play games.

101
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,416
But I was cute,
was I not?

102
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,500
I was only trying to
make things more exciting.

103
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,625
They were starting
to get rather boring,

104
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,750
do you not agree?

105
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
Please do not be upset
with me Lawrence.

106
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,583
It is true
that I felt happy.

107
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:11,791
Does that not matter
to you at all?

108
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,208
Okay fine, I get it.
I get it, I'm not upset.

109
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,791
Are you happy now?

110
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,750
We should not
get separated so

111
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,375
I think we
should hold hands.

112
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,041
All right wouldn't
want that to happen.

113
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,958
Running a business can get
pretty scary, am I right?

114
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,541
One must be
intelligent to make money

115
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,208
yet if allowed
to go to their head

116
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,791
one can also fall victim
to their own schemes.

117
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,416
Then, they
will end up selling

118
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,708
the arms at half price,

119
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,416
just like Latparon Trading.

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,291
But we're
smarter than that.

121
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,541
By transporting arms
without investing anything,

122
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,416
like we've done,
we can make a lot of money.

123
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,041
The sooner the better.

124
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,125
Really?

125
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,583
That is all well and good,

126
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,041
but I do not like being in debt

127
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
it makes me feel
uncomfortable.

128
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,666
Do you mean
buying on credit?

129
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,583
Yes.

130
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,208
You bought
100 Lumiones worth

131
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,791
of weapons at
half the price.

132
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,291
But technically you borrowed
that money from him right?

133
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,125
I'll sell them at full
price to Lemerio Trading,

135
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,750
and that difference
will take care of my debt.

136
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,083
You see, they'll buy
them at the wholesale price,

137
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,875
which is two
times what I paid,

138
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,000
so I'll end up
making twice as much.

139
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,708
I know you don't
like it but come on

140
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,750
you have to
admit it's worth it.

141
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,625
Yes well I suppose.

142
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,875
It seems that this place
should be run by a monk.

143
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,125
If that were the case

144
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,333
we would have
heard a prayer or two.

145
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:58,458
I'm curious, can you hear
anything besides the sound

146
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,625
of you eating my meat pie?

147
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,166
Your sarcasm is appreciated

148
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,416
but if you actually want
an answer I can tell you

149
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,916
I do hear what sounds
like people inside.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,333
Are you serious?

151
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,875
Yes, but it is a
dangerous atmosphere.

152
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,583
Well, it is not a fun
atmosphere at least.

153
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,375
Hesitating isn't
gonna get me anywhere.

154
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,125
I mean I'm not gonna make
any money unless I go in.

155
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,000
Like meat pies are not
nutritious unless you eat them.

156
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,458
That is my
meat pie you know.

157
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,916
Oh, you should have
said something sooner.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,791
Here.

159
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,791
Is it a holiday
or something today?

160
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,208
Why isn't anyone here?

161
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,166
It's not the Sabbath yet.

162
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,291
Yeah well it's complicated.

163
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,416
Did you get into town today?

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,833
Oh no. We got
here a few days ago.

165
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,541
I had things to do.

166
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,208
Oh, okay

167
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,458
Well, you look like
someone important.

168
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,916
I'm not.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I guess I'll be
on my way then

170
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,458
We'll come back tomorrow.

171
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,958
In that case I'm sure
to see you next time.

172
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,541
'Til then, Craft Lawrence!

173
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,000
I knew it had to be you.

174
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,333
These must be the weapons
from Latporon Trading, right?

175
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,916
How did you know that?

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,333
A post-horse messenger
came here from Poroson.

177
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,000
Latporon Trading just
transferred a debt to us.

178
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,166
They transferred your debt.

179
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,916
They did what?

180
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,500
What is going on?

181
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,333
Sorry to tell you but your
friend's business has failed.

182
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,166
Now he's just like us.

183
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,958
What do you mean?

184
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,958
The arms market
collapsed a while ago.

185
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,041
Your weapons are
worth almost nothing.

186
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,333
Latporon let him borrow
money towards worthless stock

187
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,083
and then transferred
the rights to our company.

188
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:49,125
Pretty much, all he's got
in that cart is a huge debt.

189
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,166
Your friend is bankrupt lady.

190
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,000
Lawrence...

191
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,125
He tricked me!

192
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,166
We both make our living on
these kinds of arrangements.

193
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,333
You understand that right?

194
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,333
Of course I do Lemerio.

195
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,416
We are merchants after all.

196
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,791
You obtained exactly
100 hundred Lumiones

197
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,166
worth of weaponry
at Latparon Trading.

198
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,208
Out of that purchase,
47 and 3/4 Lumiones

199
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,416
have been applied to your
credit with a payment deadline.

200
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,958
I would appreciate
being paid promptly.

201
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,208
Otherwise I will insist
your debt be assumed

202
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,541
by Lohen Merchant Association
of which you are a member.

203
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,416
I see.

204
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,666
Your deadline will be
the day after tomorrow.

205
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,833
I can give you
2 days, but no more.

206
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,458
You will need to pay back

207
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,708
the 47 and 3/4 Lumiones
in full by then.

208
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,625
Have I made myself
perfectly clear?

209
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,000
You have and I will
sell those weapons somehow.

210
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,916
Thank you so very
much for your time.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,791
I'll see you in
two days then.

212
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,458
Good.

213
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,583
I'll get you your money.

214
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,958
Let me give you a little
information just in case

215
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,041
Our street stalls can be easily
found around the town exits

216
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,041
in case something should happen.

217
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,208
Feel free to stop by at
any time if you need us.

218
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you for your offer,
but I'm sure I'll be fine.

219
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,625
I hope the rest of your
day today is profitable.

220
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,083
The feeling is mutual

221
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,416
May God's grace be with you.

222
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,041
Sorry 'bout that.

223
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,875
[HOLO]
Hey so?

224
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,083
[LAWRENCE]
What?

225
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,916
To be more precise,
what happened back there?

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,958
To be more precise,

227
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,208
everything back
there is garbage.

228
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,541
Oh I was hoping
I had misheard.

229
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,041
You did not.

230
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:46,541
I'm gonna end up
being bankrupt.

231
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,583
Should we run?

232
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,375
The information network
among merchants

233
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,000
might as well be Gods.

234
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,416
No matter where we went

235
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,958
I'd be found in no time
if I was doing business.

236
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,625
So I would never be able
to be a merchant again.

237
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
Some are going
to take it for granted

238
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,000
but an animal once
wounded will not always die.

239
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,041
Will you let this
wound overtake you?

240
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,083
No, absolutely not!

241
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,291
What I'll do is find that
money one way or another

242
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,250
and throw it right
back in their face.

243
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,000
I've still got some
time to start over.

244
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,583
I am Holo the Wise Wolf

245
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,875
And I am sure I will
be of some help to you.

246
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,500
Yeah, actually saving
on your food alone

247
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,208
would be a really big help--

248
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,833
I have told you
I will earn my food.

249
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,666
I was just kidding.

250
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,708
Very funny.

251
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,958
But I promise you,

252
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,583
if you need it,
I will help you escape

253
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,458
Even if I have to use
the power of wheat.

254
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,250
You promised me
you would take me

255
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,750
to my home in the north.

256
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,041
I could not take it if you
stumbled in a place like this.

257
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,333
I know and I will
keep that promise I will.

258
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:54,541
If it comes down to it,

259
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,416
I might really need your help.

260
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,833
Of course you will!

261
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,875
Well then, I need to
stop by the trading house.

262
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,250
So you can just wait at the inn.

263
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,750
Do I look like an
ungrateful wolf to you?

264
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,166
Do I look as if I wish to
relax and groom myself

265
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,958
at the inn while
you are in trouble?

266
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,458
I never said that!

267
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,000
Answer me!

268
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
Holo of course not

269
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,875
But it's really not the point.

270
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,750
Then what is
your point exactly.

271
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,041
The trading house is
like a hometown for me

272
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,625
And if I take a woman there,

273
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,250
they'll tease us and
make a big deal out of it.

274
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,500
Then you can
explain the situation.

275
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,541
And how would you
like me to do that?

276
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
If they report
you to the church

277
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,916
it's not gonna
make anything easier.

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,666
So why do you not
tell them we are

279
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,208
in love or
married or something?

280
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:47,708
Okay then,
you can come with me.

281
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,541
After all, you're certainly
wittier than I could ever be.

282
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,666
Yes count on me.

283
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,958
And I think, I'll tell
them you're an associate.

284
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,666
Just don't say anything
you don't have to.

285
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,166
And one more thing,

286
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,166
their welcome
is a little rough.

287
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,166
Do not worry about me.

288
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,916
Okay.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,333
First I need to ask you,

290
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,416
who is this lovely girl
you brought with you today?

291
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,083
We've been
travelling together

292
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,625
for business reasons.

293
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,333
That the truth?

294
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:18,333
Milone Trading in Pazzio
offered 140 Trenni silver coins

295
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,375
for some furs I had,
but she got them to go higher.

296
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,000
They ended up paying 210.

297
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,333
What?

298
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,708
I told you, if I'm
going to invest in a girl...

299
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:32,500
You'll get
something back I see.

300
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,125
I know your type well.

301
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,208
But luckily the
scriptures also tell us

302
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,666
not to open a mysterious
box carelessly.

303
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,541
Which is quite wise.

304
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,833
Now, lets get to it.

305
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,916
So, I have a general
idea of what happened.

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,791
One of the Lemerio
Trading employees

307
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,791
came by earlier
to inquire about us

308
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,000
assuming the debt
they have with you.

309
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,041
The gist is you failed because
you simply got too greedy.

310
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,833
Is that right?

311
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,291
Basically.

312
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,625
Then it's quite simple.

313
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,333
The association
is most likely going

314
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,541
to have to assume
your bad debt.

315
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,416
Which means you will have
to repay us on your own.

316
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,166
If you had fallen victim
to fraud, been robbed,

317
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,083
or were sick or injured
things would be different.

318
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,916
We could have helped
you with your debt then,

319
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,333
but we cannot help you
with your own greed.

320
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,375
If God cannot
help you then it seems

321
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,625
the only one who
can is this young girl.

322
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,250
I'm well aware.

323
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,000
I am sorry.

324
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,666
Unfortunately I can't
show you any mercy.

325
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,000
I stand by the rules
no matter what,

326
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,208
which is the reason
I'm in this position.

327
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,375
My concern is
the entire association.

328
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,041
I understand.

329
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,791
If someone else
was being given

330
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,500
special treatment I
know I'd get upset as well.

331
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,208
Loans between
association members

332
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,375
are not allowed either.

333
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,250
Yes I know.

334
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,958
The debt repayment
is in 2 days, right?.

335
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,041
The pressure is on Emilio too,

336
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,916
due to their failed
investment in arms.

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,291
They'll probably want
to collect immediately.

338
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,458
Which means your failure
will become public knowledge

339
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,541
the day after tomorrow

340
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,541
and I will be forced to
physically restrain you.

341
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,541
Do you understand the severity
of what I'm telling you?

342
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
Yes I understand.

343
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,000
Unless I can collect
47 gold Lumiones,

344
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,291
I won't have a tomorrow.

345
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,916
No, you will still
have a tomorrow.

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,250
You will definitely
have one,

347
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,166
but this one will be cold.

348
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,458
It will be dark and
it will be very difficult.

349
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,708
If we're looking
at a 47 Lumione debt,

350
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,333
you can
probably repay that

351
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,875
if you row a long
distance trade ship

352
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,958
for about ten years.

353
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,291
You could also
dig holes in a mine,

354
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,125
but that's if you're lucky
and actually stay alive.

355
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,541
No one could be that lucky.

356
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,666
I know this is hard.

357
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,500
And I know it
doesn't mean much

358
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,416
but I don't
want you to die.

359
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,958
Sins get punished.

360
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,541
At the end of the day I still
have to do the right thing.

361
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
Yes I know.

362
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,666
Do the best you can
in these next few days.

363
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,041
If you need me I'll
assist you in any way I can.

364
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,583
I have faith in
you Lawrence. Go!

365
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,958
Take this time you have
to do as much as possible.

366
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,250
Thank you for
being so kind.

367
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,958
I don't know how,
but I'll make

368
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,500
this money
within 2 days.

369
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,666
There are
always loopholes

370
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,625
when it comes
to business.

371
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,708
And I'm sure
that some of them

372
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,958
can only be seen
when you're cornered.

373
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,250
Do you have any
more questions for me?

374
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,333
Anything else
I can help you with?

375
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,875
No we don't. Thank you.

376
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,041
No wait!

377
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
I need a clever
line to give them.

378
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,458
Something to
say when I throw

379
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,708
the money back
in their face.

380
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,375
Keep talking like
that and you'll be fine!

381
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,208
Good luck kid.

382
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:57,333
47 Lumiones in 2 days.

383
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:03,791
47 Lumiones in 2 days.

384
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,166
So, what are
you going to do?

385
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,333
Repay my debt
with a debt I guess.

386
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,041
Can you turn to anyone?

387
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,750
Well I'm not
known for running

388
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,291
my business irresponsibly.

389
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,500
I don't know
anyone in particular

390
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,208
who would loan me
a large sum of money.

391
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,375
But there are several
who might be willing

392
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,291
to help me out with
a little here and there.

393
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,208
If there are 47 of them you
will have the money in no time.

394
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,000
Exactly!

395
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,000
[MERCHANT A] 
Lawrence!

396
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,625
It's been awhile, hasn't it?

397
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,625
[MERCHANT A] You have
any money making ideas?

398
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,791
Well actually.

399
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,375
No problem!

400
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,458
There are plenty of others.

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,916
[MERCHANT B] Unfortunately,
we're too busy right now.

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,333
I'm sorry.

403
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,958
[MERCHANT C] Hopefully
the prices for wheat and meat

404
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
will also rise towards
the end of the year.

405
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,583
Oh well,
moving on I guess

406
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,333
How did it go?

407
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,208
There's still
the next person.

408
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,500
Yes, of course!

409
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,958
[MERCHANT D] We are
actually right in the middle

410
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,666
of inventory right now.

411
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,375
[MERCHANT E ]
I'm sorry, but we can't.

412
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,041
Okay. So?

413
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,375
Damn it! Why?!

414
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,708
Why did I have to
make such a stupid deal?

415
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,041
I'm an idiot!

416
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,875
Lawrence?

417
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:47,250
It's nothing, I've
still got the next one.

418
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,500
[church bells chiming]

419
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,375
What about this place?

420
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,166
No, that won't work.

421
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,625
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

422
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,625
What is it?

423
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,958
Please forgive me,

424
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,583
but I cannot walk as
freely as you in this form.

425
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,500
You're right I'm sorry.

426
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,000
[MERCHANT F]
It's been too long, Lawrence.

427
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,708
Yes it's been awhile

428
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,875
and I know that we haven't
done business in some time,

429
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,083
but I have a huge
favor to ask you.

430
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,583
I've heard that you've been

431
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,041
begging for loans all
over the place.

432
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,916
Is it because of
the collapse

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,125
in the arms market?

434
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,250
It is.

435
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,125
I made an
optimistic projection

436
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,750
which turned
out to be off.

437
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,291
Optimistic projection?

438
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,250
Well, that
was part of it.

439
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,333
What could you do?

440
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,125
A market collapse
couldn't possibly

441
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,916
be predicted by
anybody but God.

442
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,250
It would be unfair
to blame only yourself.

443
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,083
My friend,
you have helped

444
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,875
make me money
plenty of times,

445
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,416
so I thought I would
be able to help you

446
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,958
if you ever ended
up in trouble.

447
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,500
Really?

448
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,000
But your attitude
is not that

449
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,125
of one who is living
an honest life under God

450
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,875
as well as being
sincere to others,

451
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,750
especially your friends!

452
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,291
Wait! What?

453
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,916
What do you mean?

454
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,583
Don't mock me Lawrence!

455
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,750
If you're really that desperate
for money from everyone

456
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:31,083
then how can you afford to still
walk around with a woman?

457
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,166
[YOUNG COACHMAN] Idiot!

458
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,125
[YOUNG COACHMAN] You're in the
middle of the street,

459
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,416
what are you doing?!

460
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,916
I don't get it.
Why is this happening

461
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,166
Why now?

462
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,625
Wait! Lawrence!

463
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,125
Are you okay?

464
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,208
Let's go
to the inn.

465
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,958
You're so pale.
Please.

466
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,000
It's your fault!

467
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,375
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,458
I will be at the inn.

469
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,500
