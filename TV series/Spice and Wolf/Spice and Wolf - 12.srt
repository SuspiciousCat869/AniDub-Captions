2
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,083
Hello.

3
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,291
Hello, Nora.

4
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,583
I'd like you to meet
our other collaborator.

5
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,041
My name is Martin Liebert
from Lemerio Trading.

6
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, hello there,
my name is Nora Arendt.

7
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,000
I think it's about
time we get started.

8
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,833
Tell me, have you
ever heard the saying

9
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,458
"business is like
raw fish in a kitchen"?

10
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,416
Basically, what the
saying means is that

11
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,125
unless we act
quickly it'll go bad.

12
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,833
[LOADING MAN] Lemerio,
do you think it will go well?

13
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,916
[LEMERIO]
I don't know...

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,583
but if we fail none
of us will have a future.

15
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,375
Why are we stopping now?

16
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,708
The sun hasn't even set yet.

17
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,416
You must not
travel with shepherds.

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm going on ahead.

19
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
I trust you will
catch up with me quickly.

20
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,875
Wait! Liebert!

21
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,875
Oh don't worry,
I'll get him.

22
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,666
He just doesn't know
much about shepherds

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,041
and the dangers of
travelling alone at night.

24
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,958
Remember he
carries the burdens

25
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
of Lemerio Trading
on his shoulders.

26
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,041
It is only natural.

27
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,333
The stars are
beautiful out here.

28
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,416
[HOLO] They are
all right I suppose.

29
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,833
The stars
from my homeland

30
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,666
are much more
beautiful though.

31
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,166
[LAWRENCE] Who would've
thought we could have

32
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,750
such a normal
conversation in the midst

33
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,958
of a situation like this.

34
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,458
You realize we will not last

35
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,916
if we are tense
the entire journey.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,958
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

37
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,250
We're not
taking the dangerous

38
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,500
road until
tomorrow anyway.

39
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,958
There's really
no way of knowing

40
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,000
what might
show up out here.

41
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,166
Even if wolves appear,
please do not panic.

42
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,416
I will not fail you, I promise
we will get there safely.

43
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,875
[LIEBERT] May God's
grace be with us.

44
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,708
Holo...

45
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,458
Do you think we'll
be able to stay safe

46
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,041
from the wolves
in this forest?

47
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,416
It is too late...

48
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,208
we are already surrounded.

49
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,125
Are you serious?

50
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,583
Even if it were to happen...

51
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,375
You should have
more faith in me

52
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,833
to guarantee your safety.

53
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,791
Although beyond that
I cannot make any promises.

54
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,000
It'll be a problem if
we're not all safe you know.

55
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,500
So you say Lawrence,
so you say.

56
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,958
You do realize
the forest

57
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,541
is downwind of us?

58
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,083
If there are wolves within it,

59
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,916
they will have already noticed

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,541
the sheep and are most likely

61
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,416
sharpening their fangs by now.

62
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,541
He is a very wise dog.

63
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,750
Well yes...

64
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,458
which is all
the more reason

65
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,833
for me to be annoyed.

66
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,291
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,583
That dog of hers knows

68
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,333
all about me and
is threatening me.

69
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,916
Y-You really think so?

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,166
Yes I do...

71
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,333
and he is foolishly
forgetting his place.

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,583
I wonder if Nora
suspects anything as well.

73
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,583
If the smuggling fails,

74
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,583
she will be the one
who will suffer the most.

75
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,750
The rest of us can keep quiet

76
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,375
and try to escape but
she won't be able to.

77
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:27,083
Oh good grief, you really
are a sucker for blondes.

78
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,625
I did tell you the ways

79
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,791
in which they would
punish her didn't I?

80
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,333
She's so tiny.

81
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,708
There's no way her body
could withstand it.

82
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,583
Then you must protect her.

83
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,541
You should use
all your might

84
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,583
so she will not suffer.

85
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,583
Holo.

86
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,666
With any luck we won't have
to deal with wolves at all!

87
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,958
What?

88
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,833
Oh right wolves, I agree.

89
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,458
She said if
we leave at dawn

90
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,750
we should be able to
get to Lamtra by noon.

91
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,875
And then it shall be my
part in this small mission.

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,750
I should probably get
some rest so I'm ready for it.

93
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,500
I'll see you at dawn then.

94
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,458
Lawrence step back
now, please.

95
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,541
There is no reason
for you to panic.

96
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,458
[barking]

97
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,541
You need to wake up,
please be careful.

98
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,333
[horse neighing]

99
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,958
Have they departed?

100
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:01,000
No not completely but
they have backed off a little.

101
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,625
The wolves in this forest
always act the same way.

102
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,500
They don't howl or
show any other signs

103
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,291
they're about to attack.

104
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,083
It's almost
seems as if they're

105
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,833
just staring at us right now.

106
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,708
I agree with you,

107
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,750
it is strange to me
they are not howling.

108
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
Do you think that
it's going to go well?

109
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,333
Absolutely.

110
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,666
Um... Holo?

111
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,958
Do you know a lot about wolves?

112
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,125
Well it seemed to me,

113
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean you noticed the wolves

114
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,166
really early on as well
and so I was just curious.

115
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,166
Oh, yes, it is something
like instinct.

116
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,875
Instinct... really?

117
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,791
It could have been because
I was a little tense though,

118
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,750
you know since the men around
here are not very dependable.

119
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,750
Do you not agree with me?

120
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,916
What? Um I mean, uh,
I don't think so... no.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,250
I see...

122
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,625
Then tell me, what do
you think about this one?

123
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,125
Do not hold back.

124
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:25,666
Feel free to say exactly
what you are thinking.

125
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,291
You are indeed a very
good judge of character!

126
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,166
I think it is rather odd

127
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,833
to ask a woman who
is travelling alone

128
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,375
with a man if she
knows a lot about wolves.

129
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,833
Why is it strange?

130
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,458
If there is always a cute
rabbit sitting in front of him

131
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:49,583
a wolf will be sure to make some
sort of appearance every night.

132
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,250
Therefore a rabbit who is
eaten by a wolf every night

133
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,708
should have
a great understanding

134
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,541
of wolves
should she not?

135
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,958
Oh! I see!

136
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,583
Yes that makes sense...
oh dear.

137
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,083
What a great reaction!

138
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,333
But in my case,
it is the exact opposite.

139
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,416
My companion is a lonely
rabbit who would die

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,250
if you would not
keep him company.

141
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,791
In any case,
you can call it luck,

142
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,666
but I just happened
to notice the wolves

143
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,666
were there
early on-that is all.

144
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
Yes I see...

145
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,041
I had started to wonder if
you were a shepherd, though.

146
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,250
That is rather surprising.

147
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,125
Enek had been keeping
his eye on you

148
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,458
quite a bit so it
seemed to make sense.

149
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,000
Ahhh...

150
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,666
He is probably in love with me.

151
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,041
What? You mean...
Enek is in love with you?

152
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,833
Now I assume
you must cherish

153
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,875
your dog a great
deal am I right?

154
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,916
Because of that,
he is most likely thinking

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,166
your affection for him
is secure at the moment.

156
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,500
He must have gotten greedy

157
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,041
and wanted to play
with someone else.

158
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,500
What a naughty boy he is.

159
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,500
If you are cold
to him sometimes...

160
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,291
it should help towards
keeping him in line.

161
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,791
That's good advice...

162
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,000
If he thinks about
cheating on me again

163
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,416
I promise I'll go ahead
and give it a try.

164
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,083
Good for you!

165
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,583
In the meantime...

166
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,541
I believe I'll praise
him as much as I can.

167
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,708
After all in my case
it really doesn't matter

168
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,333
if this job goes
well or not.

169
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,000
Either way, taking
this job will forever

170
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,916
end my life
as a shepherd won't it?

171
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,875
See, you have
to admit to me now

172
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,500
you did not give
her enough credit.

173
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,333
Fine, you win.

174
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,708
So it went well?

175
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,916
I'm so glad!

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,166
After seeing your face
I started to worry!

177
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,375
Why?

178
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,916
What's wrong
with my face?

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,041
Considering the amount
of money you're carrying

180
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,291
it's natural
to be nervous.

181
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,750
Now I'm embarrassed...

182
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,083
Let's get going shall we?

183
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,791
Our future is
waiting for us...

184
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,750
And it's shining as
brightly as this gold.

185
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,666
This cannot be it!

186
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,750
This is the same
road we took before?

187
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:29,083
It does kind of seem
different now doesn't it?

188
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,291
Enek!

189
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,333
I'm sorry but we
need to move faster!

190
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,958
They're here.

191
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,375
Correct...

192
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,375
There are more
on that hill, too.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,041
[wolves howling]

194
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,666
Oh God, tell me
we're going to be okay!

195
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,291
We'll be fine but
I do still need you

196
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:54,666
to hurry please. Enek, go!

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,958
She is very good you know.

198
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,958
If we keep moving this fast
the wolves will not attack.

199
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,791
Think you can
elaborate on that?

200
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,500
Wolves will never
attack in a way

201
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,541
so just one of a group
will get injured...

202
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,041
Carefully
and cunningly...

203
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:13,666
they target the entire prey
by slowly surrounding them.

204
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,500
Enek!

205
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,041
But in this formation,
we would have

206
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,791
the capability to at least
strike back at one of them.

207
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,041
If we can keep this up,
we will be able to survive.

208
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,291
Wolves never attack alone.

209
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,875
Get ready.

210
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,333
Get ready?

211
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,750
Here goes nothing!

212
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,958
Back off!

213
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,041
I have heard humans
say the phrase,

214
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,041
"Young people
these days..."

215
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:17,208
I feel the same way
about the wolves in this forest.

216
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,083
[LIEBERT]
Hey! Are we out of it now?

217
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,208
Nora, are we okay?

218
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,583
I'm not sure...

219
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,541
I'm doing my best
to keep us safe.

220
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,958
Doing your best?!

221
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,041
Listen to me Lawrence...

222
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,250
I am the one who has to
take care of the trouble here.

223
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,666
Once we let the girl
and that brat go on ahead,

224
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,458
I want you to stay
here for awhile with me.

225
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,333
What? I don't understand.
Why now?

226
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,333
I did tell you they
were strange wolves did I not?

227
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,875
If I handle them now, the group
will not pursue the sheep.

228
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,375
After all, the sheep
are not their target...

229
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,625
Cheap stubbornness...

230
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,958
Crude pride...

231
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,791
Both of which these
ridiculous youngsters value.

232
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,166
Lawrence...

233
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,375
They are not going to go
if you do not talk to them.

234
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,750
Communication is
important, right?

235
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,333
Nora! Liebert!
We'll take care of things here!

236
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,916
You two go ahead!

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,958
Proceed with
the gold as planned!

238
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,541
No! We can't!

239
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,750
Come on let's just
do what they want!

240
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,125
We will meet at the city
walls of Lubinheigen!.

241
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,791
The next time we see
you we will all be rich!

242
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,625
God be with you!

243
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,333
I want you to keep a
safe distance from here.

244
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,791
If you are even a little too
close, I will be worried.

245
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:40,208
Do you understand?

246
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,083
You should know I won't
forgive you if you lose.

247
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,708
If you were actually
a good looking male

248
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,750
I would kiss you right now.

249
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:55,041
Oh, yes... Please keep
this with you for me.

250
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,250
I would like to settle this
peacefully if at all possible...

251
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,583
but I do not know
for sure what will happen...

252
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,875
If I am naked when
we join them again...

253
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,291
It could
be problematic.

254
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,041
I will see you soon.

255
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,250
We can't stop now, Nora!

256
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,708
Listen to me!

257
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,083
Are you going to allow their
deaths to be for nothing?!

258
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,583
Did you say deaths?

259
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,000
Pardon me...

260
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:38,041
In order to repay their
courage, we should keep moving!

261
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,791
Well go ahead.

262
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,125
You might as well
tell me what you want.

263
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,500
Is that really
all you have to say?

264
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,333
Kids these days
are all the same.

265
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,583
You all bare your
fangs immediately.

266
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,833
Holo!

267
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,500
Whoa. Are you the
one they call Lawrence?

268
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,500
That's my name.

269
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,625
So you did survive...

270
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,583
Liebert didn't
think you would.

271
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,166
[MERCHANT C] We had
been waiting for you

272
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,541
and your companion
outside the forest

273
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,250
just in case but we decided
we couldn't sit around

274
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,625
and waste any
more of our time.

275
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,333
All this for me?

276
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,000
Since the rain kept
getting heavier,

277
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,541
I found somewhere dry to
take cover for the moment.

278
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,625
So Lawrence...
where's your partner?

279
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,666
She's not here.

280
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh good, that's a relief.

281
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,916
I'm not gonna say
don't take it personally...

282
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,375
but this is just business.

283
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,750
It's Lemerio Trading...

284
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
They're betraying me, right?

285
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,166
Call it insurance.

286
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,791
We were initially
a little reluctant

287
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,333
when we found out
you were with a woman.

288
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,208
We're all glad she's
not with you anymore.

289
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
I know this isn't
much of an excuse

290
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,541
but in this economy
we're all suffering...

291
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,958
we've been forced to eliminate

292
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,833
any risk no matter
what it may be.

293
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,666
What? Did you think
I was gonna blackmail you?

294
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,208
Anyone would be blinded

295
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,000
from that amount
of money.

296
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,083
 It's called common
sense in the business world.

297
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,958
I'll give you back your
companion's memento.

298
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,666
I really hate to say it,
but I'm not bothered

299
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,041
too much by knowing
I'll never see you again.

300
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,708
It depresses me
more to think about

301
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,416
what we're gonna have
to do after we finish with you.

302
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,916
Stop it!

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
You feel the same way!

304
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,750
But still...

305
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,166
She is someone who
was brought in by him.

306
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,500
Nora...

307
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,958
That was your fault.

308
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,750
You should have kept still.

309
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,041
Why don't we just tie
that girl up instead?

310
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,708
We can bring her here
and leave her with him.

311
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,458
Let the wolves take care
of them both. You idiot!

312
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,916
Haven't you heard that
she uses pagan witchcraft?

313
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,916
We could blindfold
her and tie her up

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
but she'd still
probably survive.

315
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,875
If that happens then we'll be
the ones who'll have to suffer!

316
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,416
Do you think you'll
be able to stomach it.

317
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,083
Do you think you can kill her?

318
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,416
Don't say it!

319
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,916
Sorry.

320
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,500
Do you think we'll
need to finish him?

321
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,458
Maybe we should.

322
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,708
No.

323
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,666
The less we have to kill,
the better it is.

324
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,375
Agreed.

325
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,750
Let's go!

326
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,875
We better hurry or we'll
hear about it from Liebert.

327
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,916
I'm sure his companion
is dead by now anyway.

328
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,833
