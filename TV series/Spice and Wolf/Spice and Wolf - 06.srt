00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,166
[LAWRENCE] What's wrong?

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,791
[HOLO] The air, I can feel
it beginning to shake.

3
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,875
[LAWRENCE] We should be
right underneath the market.

4
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,625
Do you think that might be it?

5
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,000
No, it is something else.

6
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
Hold on.

7
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,125
Water..

8
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,916
I can hear it splashing.

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,875
What direction?

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,541
Ahead of us...
We need to run.

11
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,500
Does this passage
not fork anywhere?

12
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,000
Not the way we were headed,

13
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,916
but there are a series
of side roads up ahead.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,083
I do not think even
I could keep us

15
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,708
from getting lost in here.

16
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
What is it?

17
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,958
Even if we run
they will catch up...

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,833
It seems they have
released the dogs.

19
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,916
The dogs?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,583
Their voices sound stupid.

21
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,458
You should cover your
ears now. Trust me.

[PURSUER B]
What the hell was that?

24
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,875
I could really
use some apples.

25
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,375
Once we're out of here,
I'll get you some.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
How did they find
out where we were?

27
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,041
They most likely
didn't know we were here.

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,541
They probably
came underground

29
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,791
and found us by accident.

30
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,958
Otherwise we would've
been attacked already.

31
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,583
[PURSUER E] Milone Trading
betrayed you both!

32
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,500
Give up now!

33
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,416
[PURSUER E]
There's no use running from us!

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,458
Is that true?
Did they betray us?

35
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,041
If so, we were sold
for a high price.

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,583
After all,
they could shut down

37
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,833
Milone's branch
if they had you.

38
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,833
Really?

39
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,041
It must have been
high indeed.

40
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,750
They're just formally
greeting us...

Don't worry, it's a lie.

[PURSUER B] There they are!
That way!

46

Do you know
where we are going?

47
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,625
Yes! Of course!

48
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,541
We'll make the next right!

00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,250
No!

Sorry but...
we're in a hurry.

Lawrence! No!

52
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,541
[PURSUER A] Father, I ask
you to forgive me of my sins.

53
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,541
Before you
ask forgiveness,

54
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,958
you should try
repenting how you live!

55
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,583
Damn it.

56
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,666
He stabbed me.

57
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,375
[HOLO]

58
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,375
Thank goodness.

59
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,208
I... I could
not wake you up.

60
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,833
I'm alright.

61
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,083
I'm only resting,
that's all.

62
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,708
Please stay strong...
We are almost there.

63
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
Uh-where?

64
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,250
Did you not listen
to what I was saying?!

65
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,750
I told you I smelled light,

66
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,250
and asked if there was
a place that led above.

67
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,083
That's right...
yeah... I remember.

68
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,291
What's this?

69
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,541
A bandage.

70
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,750
Do not tell me you
forgot about that already!

71
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,666
Well, I am alright.

72
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,541
Don't worry.

73
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,041
We are getting close!

74
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,708
Now we should
find an exit

75
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,666
just at the other end
of this passageway.

76
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,083
Look!

77
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh no...

00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,541

80
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,000
I am sorry; I did
not foresee this.

81
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,208
[PURSUER B]
There they are!

82
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,708
[PURSUER WALLA] Hey!
We found them!

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,583
Stay back.

84
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,791
No. Wait.

85
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,250
Stop it. You cannot!

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,541
I don't have a choice.

87
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,083
You cannot!

88
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,000
Even if I were not Holo the
Wise Wolf, I could tell this!

89
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,875
From the description
they gave me,

90
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,291
I thought it
might be you...

91
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,083
I was hoping it
would not be, though.

92
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,791
It's a shame.

93
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,250
The one behind Medio Trading
is Earl Ehrendott, isn't it?

94
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,833
He is trading in wheat.
Pasloe's harvest.

95
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,333
And when you deal with wheat,

96
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,708
you can request payment
in any silver coin you prefer.

97
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,416
On top of that,
the privilege of eliminating

98
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,458
the wheat tariff
would be more than a blessing

99
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,958
to Medio Trading, the Earl,
and the Pasloe villagers.

100
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,791
You are the one
personally acquainted

101
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,125
with the merchants who
come specifically for wheat.

102
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,416
And more deals
are carried out

103
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,916
after the harvest festival
than any other time.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,875
The village mayor is putting

105
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,583
you in charge
of the entire thing.

106
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,541
It's been you all along.

107
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,375
Well, I think we
should catch up later.

108
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,125
We don't have time now.

109
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,750
Don't be so cold.

110
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,833
After all, I barely got to see
you while I was in the village.

111
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,000
Lucky for you,
you found someone else

112
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,208
to occupy your time.

113
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,708
Give her to us, Lawrence.

114
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,250
We're going to turn her in
to the church and bid farewell

115
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,166
to the days of Holo the Wise
and Faithless Wolf.

116
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,625
Once we give her over to them,
we can shut down Milone Trading.

117
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,666
Additionally, if we can
use the King's privilege

118
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,666
to eliminate the tariff,

119
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,291
our wheat will produce
an enormous profit for us.

120
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,958
And it will be the same for the
merchants who handle our wheat.

121
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,125
Lawrence...

122
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,541
You chose to purchase
wheat from our village

123
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,500
while we were still
suffering under that tariff.

124
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,541
I want you to know I still
appreciate everything you did.

125
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,291
We would certainly give
you preferential treatment

126
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,916
if you continued to
do business with us.

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,666
Lawrence...

128
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,500
This is our opportunity...
We could open that shop...

129
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,166
You and I.

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,375
Think of the profit
we could make together.

131
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,291
Come with me.

132
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,458
With you?

133
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,125
Opening a shop has been
my dream for a long time.

134
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,166
Yes, I know.

135
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,375
But, what kind of
a merchant would I be

136
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,875
if I couldn't keep
a simple promise?

137
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,666
I'm not sure what I did to
deserve this turn of events...

138
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,125
But I just happened
to meet a strange wolf.

139
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,583
She wants to
return to the north.

140
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,625
And I made a contract
to accompany her.

141
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,125
I cannot break
that contract.

142
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,958
I gave my word.

143
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,041
Yes...

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,125
I did not want to
say goodbye to you.

145
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,416
Such is a merchant's
life, is it not?

146
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,625
You can kill the
man.

147
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,750
Just make sure you
capture the girl alive.

148
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,791
I'm not dead yet.

Get the knife!

151
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,458
That is enough!

152
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,833
This might hurt a little.

153
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,583
Wha--?

154
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,500
You must bear it.

No!

You're cruel.
Every one of you.

166
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,916
Holo, please don't!

167
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,666
Wait, Holo!

168
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,166
Holo!

169
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,291
You... You tore all
of my good clothes!

170
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,208
Do you know how
much those cost?!

171
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,625
I don't care if
you're a god or not!

172
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,750
You'll have
to pay for them!

173
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,000
You may have earned
50 silver coins...

174
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,708
But that's not going to
be nearly enough at all!

175
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,333
Don't you try and
get out of it either!

176
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,041
I will follow you!

177
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,416
Holo...!

178
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I will follow you all
the way to the north!

179
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,166
Holo!

180
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:27,750
It's nice to
see you're awake.

181
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,708
Your injury isn't causing
you too much pain, I hope?

182
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:35,208
Oh, no it's...
It's fine; thanks.

183
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,791
I would like to apologize
to you, Lawrence.

184
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,083
We miscalculated
the situation.

185
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,458
Oh, thank you,

186
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:46,625
but I don't think anyone
could've seen that coming.

187
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,458
We were very fortunate
all the commotion

188
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,625
occurred
underground, though.

189
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,291
If people had
witnessed her true form,

190
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,208
they would have probably thrown
our headquarters into the fire.

191
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,916
You saw her true form?

192
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,083
I did.

193
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,875
I received a report
from my employees

194
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,458
stating that they had found
you, but that a giant wolf

195
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:09,208
had refused to hand you over
to anyone other than myself.

196
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,458
So where is she then...
where did she go?

197
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,750
Once we
brought you here...

198
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,875
she left without telling
us where she was going.

199
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,250
Without even
saying goodbye.

200
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,666
Well, did
everything at least

201
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,958
go as planned
with the King?

202
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,125
We were successful,
of course,

203
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
and acquired the privilege

204
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,833
before Medio Trading
could ask for it.

205
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,500
You've got to
be kidding me.

206
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,541
We collected
307,112 coins and...

207
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,875
It seems the King

208
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,291
will devaluate the silver
coins rather dramatically.

209
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,541
He said he will give us cash
worth 350,000 silver coins

210
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,791
to be paid at
the time of delivery.

211
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,125
350,000?

212
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,708
And, according to the
contract we made with you,

213
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,875
your share is to be 5
percent of our profit...

214
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,083
That is correct,
isn't it?

215
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,750
Yeah, that
was the deal.

216
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,083
Please,
look this over.

217
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,333
What is this?

218
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,541
You will receive
120 silver coins,

219
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,291
which is 5 percent
of our profit.

220
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,583
That's all...?

221
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,541
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

222
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,750
There's a delivery cost for
the coins we collected.

223
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,125
Then, the tariff that
comes along with it...

224
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:42,666
not to mention the handling
fee for the contract itself.

225
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
I never would
have believed

226
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,750
it would cost this much
just to handle a contract.

227
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,125
Blame his Government
Contractor for that.

228
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,583
Since they were also
giving us the privilege,

229
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,583
they were trying to
get back their losses

230
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,750
from purchasing
the silver coins...

231
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,458
We weren't expecting
this to happen...

232
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,541
It is an
unfortunate result.

233
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,583
I guess when it
comes to business

234
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,416
you can't be
prepared for everything.

235
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,708
However...

236
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,166
The unexpected
can be good as well.

237
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,208
Medio really
wanted that privilege.

238
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,666
Wait... What?

239
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,291
Remember, they were collecting
the same silver coins we were.

240
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,250
They knew the silver coins
would eventually be devalued,

241
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,625
so, in the end,
they were going to be

242
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,208
stuck with quite
a bit of debt...

243
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,625
I imagine they
were fairly determined

244
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,958
to turn a profit
no matter what.

245
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,666
So, when we
spoke with them,

246
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,625
they suggested
an amount

247
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,208
that we were willing
to accept on the spot.

248
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,666
It's 1,000 coins...

249
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,375
Yes, congratulations.

250
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,416
Would you like to receive
it in silver coins...

251
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
or if you'd like,
we could arrange

252
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,125
for some of it to
be given in product.

253
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,250
Pepper. Pepper.

254
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,708
It's light and
easy to carry.

255
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,208
And its price
is about to go up.

256
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,916
People buy more
meat in winter

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,333
so naturally they'll
buy more pepper as well.

258
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,458
What's so
funny about that?

259
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,791
Oh, I'm sorry.

260
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,458
You reminded me of
a play I read recently.

261
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,333
What're you
talking about?

262
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,333
It's actually a religious
play the church uses

263
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,291
to preach rules to
trading companies.

264
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,416
In it, the Devil appears
to a very wealthy merchant

265
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,125
and says to him, "Bring me
the most delicious human

266
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,833
in this land, or I shall
eat you instead."

267
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,041
Because he doesn't
wish to perish,

268
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,625
he brings young maids
and a fat male servant,

269
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,708
but the Devil
does not accept them.

270
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,083
He searches all over town
for delicious looking people,

271
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:40,416
until he finally finds a boy
who smells of honey and milk.

272
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,791
He presents this boy
to the Devil immediately,

273
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,416
but the
boy says to the Devil,

274
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,708
"The most delicious
human in the entire world

275
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,041
is right in
front of you.

276
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:53,000
Look, do you not see how
delicious this merchant must be?

277
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,125
He's seasoned his fat soul

278
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:59,958
with the spices
that made his fortune."

279
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,708
So, when you
asked for pepper,

280
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:06,083
I saw an image of you getting
fat and eaten by the Devil.

281
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,708
Well, the sooner my soul

282
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,416
can be seasoned
with spices, the better.

283
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,958
Yes. Definitely.

284
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,208
And I'll pray for luck.

285
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,875
Naturally, I want you to
know our company would like

286
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,125
to maintain the relationship
we've built with you.

287
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,500
Thank you.
I would as well.

288
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,291
Good, good,
I'm happy to hear it.

289
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,791
Lawrence, this is an invoice.
It has your name on it.

290
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,833
I don't remember purchasing
any of these products.

291
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,750
Where can I find
the unloading area?

292
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,583
Ah, well, go down the hallway
and take a right at the end.

293
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,000
Thank you!

294
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,500
Watch out!

295
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,541
Sorry!

296
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,333
A robe...

297
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,375
A silk waist sash...

298
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,541
A new pair of traveling shoes...

299
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,583
A tortoiseshell comb...

300
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,291
And last...

301
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,333
Plenty, of, apples!

302
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,625
[MILONE CLERK] Your total
is 140 silver coins.

303
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,208
Holo!

304
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,875
'Scuse me...!

305
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,166
I cannot have you coming

306
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,625
all the way the north to
collect, you understand.

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,791
Geez.

308
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,666
I shall not go home
'til I pay off my debt.

309
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,458
You've got a deal.

310
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,458
Spice and Wolf,
seems fitting enough to me.

311
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,416
Next episode...
Wolf and a Tail of Happiness.
