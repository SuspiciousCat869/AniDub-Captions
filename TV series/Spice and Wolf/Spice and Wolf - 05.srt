1
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,291
So... She's a wolf?

2
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,625
If that's the case,

3
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,916
then this is a warning
from Medio Trading.

4
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,333
They're telling you
not to do anything

5
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,166
until the deal is completed.

6
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,541
Unless you want your
companion taken to the church.

7
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,750
But still...

8
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,791
how can we know
they won't take her

9
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,500
to the church
afterwards anyway?

10
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,875
And let's not forget,

11
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,500
we've already
invested a great deal

12
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,708
in devaluing
Trenni silver coins.

13
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,875
If we back off now
we'll lose all of it.

14
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,916
Then we need to
be aggressive!

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,291
Suppose we rescue
your companion

16
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,958
and agree to
provide her shelter...

17
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,916
If we are
reported to the church

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,541
there will be no more
options available.

19
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,708
Like obedient sheep,

20
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,375
we'll simply have
to do what we're told.

21
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,541
As long as she stays in
this town we can't hide her.

22
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,500
Then I'll get her out
of the town and we'll run!

23
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,000
Unless you're extremely
lucky, you'll be caught.

24
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,708
She'll only
end up being taken

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,625
to another town and
reported to the church there.

26
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,958
Once that happens
there's nothing we can do.

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,291
What if we take into account

28
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,166
the profit
they're going to make

29
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,541
we might still be able
to solve this thing with money.

30
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,041
If only we had a trump card
we could counter with.

31
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,958
There is one way.

32
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,208
We'll report that Medio Trading

33
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,291
has your companion
with them before they do.

34
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,458
Which would redirect
focus on to them.

35
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,083
But if we choose
to sacrifice your friend,

36
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,625
I'm sure you would
be less than supportive.

37
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,708
You might even
take the initiative

38
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,750
and testify against us.

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,208
[LAWRENCE]
You can count on it.

40
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,583
But what's the benefit
in having the silver coins?

41
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,166
There must be some
sort of privilege

42
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,083
obtained from
the King of Trenni right?

43
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,083
According to our
investigation

44
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,625
the royal family's purse
strings are increasingly tight.

45
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,375
They'd have to be...

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,166
The royal family is
trying to temporarily gather

47
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,291
and melt the silver coins
currently in circulation.

48
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,250
The idea is that if
10 of their silver coins

49
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,583
can be made into
13 by reducing the purity,

50
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,250
they've made a profit.

51
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,000
For now they can
generate the funds needed,

52
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,958
but at the same time,
the country loses credibility.

53
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,708
You ask me,
the long-term disadvantage

54
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,958
is far greater than the
temporary increase in funds.

55
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,083
Yet they've taken it upon
themselves to do it anyway.

56
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,833
The Trenni Kingdom must be
in severe financial difficulty.

57
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,000
Which means...

58
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,708
that depending
upon the agreement...

59
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,708
you could get
plenty out of them...

60
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,291
It's amazing...

61
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,250
We're talking minting rights,
the rights to set tariff rates,

62
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,625
manage complete
markets, anything...

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,166
That's exactly right.

64
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
Then I think
I might have an idea.

65
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,916
Before Medio
Trading reports her...

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,916
complete your negotiations
on the Trenni silvers coins.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,750
Use that profit as the trump
card to bargain with them

68
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:06,791
But selling privilege for
Holo may not be worth it to you.

69
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,791
You mean we have them
buy the privilege back?

70
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,125
If we make them
think buying it

71
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,916
is more profitable
than shutting you down...

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm willing to bet
that they'll go ahead and pay.

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,750
Don't forget they
have their own trump card

74
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,375
that could send every
single one of us to the stake.

75
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,416
Not true.
If Trenni gets in trouble

76
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,875
with the church
the country can't win.

77
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,000
The Trenni Kingdom
wouldn't want their public

78
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,791
to know they were
connected with you...

79
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,291
not a company
sent to the stake.

80
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,666
If we received any unwanted
attention from the church...

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,750
the King would suffer because
of his interaction with us.

82
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,583
Medio Trading would
never make an accusation

83
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,583
that would only anger
the King in return.

84
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,375
I see... But still,
they won't be able

85
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,333
to back off of this quietly.

86
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,500
They'd be forced to
take you down with them.

87
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,875
So we hand over
the privilege in exchange

88
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,416
for reasonable compensation
and releasing your companion.

89
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,875
Yes. Exactly.

90
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
Well it's fine
methodology...

91
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,208
However, we still
have one major problem.

92
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,208
That's where you're wrong.
As far as I can tell,

93
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,291
Medio Trading hasn't
gathered that many coins yet.

94
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Based on?

95
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,458
Based on...

96
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,208
If they'd already
had enough silver coins...

97
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,000
they wouldn't
have just taken Holo,

98
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,000
they'd have gone
directly to the church.

99
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,541
But they didn't.

100
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,958
They just tried
to block our move instead...

101
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,333
Hardly seems to me like
they're confident in their plan.

102
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,583
This deal takes
advantage of the King.

103
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,250
I can't imagine they've

104
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,583
made a big show
of purchasing coins.

105
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,000
What about you?

106
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,500
It seems I have a plan,
but what are you going to do?

107
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,625
I'll get Holo back...

108
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,791
We can stay on the run until
you finish the negotiations.

109
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,416
That's reckless.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,666
We may eventually get caught,

111
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
but I think I can
buy us some extra time.

112
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,291
In the meantime,

113
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,250
gather as many silver coins
as you can and finish the deal.

114
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't do it.

115
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,500
So then do you
intend to report Holo?

116
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,791
If that happens
I will testify against you.

117
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,875
All we need is a little help.

118
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,791
We can manage for
at least a day or two...

119
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,166
You have to remember,

120
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,875
I'm running with the
incarnation of a wolf beside me.

121
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,833
Even if she ends
up getting captured...

122
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,500
Humans are no match for her,

123
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,125
not if she's using
her natural abilities.

124
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,625
Trust me on this.

125
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,916
Let me ask you a question,

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,708
How much time will you need

127
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:23,333
to gather enough
coins to talk to the King?

128
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,666
If we leave by horse
for Trenni Castle right now

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,500
we'll get there by sunset.

130
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,375
And then if the
deal's made on the spot

131
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,833
we could be back by morning.

132
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:34,916
Right now?

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,458
But you haven't
even figured out

134
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,583
how many silver coins you're
going to need to collect yet.

135
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,208
We'll simply work
it out based on an estimate.

136
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,083
And when it comes
time for delivery

137
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,833
we'll have
it all for them.

138
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,958
Okay...

139
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,333
But do you think
you'll be able

140
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,375
to negotiate
with the King on the spot?

141
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,375
I certainly
don't want to brag...

142
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,791
but if we want to we can
make any deal on the spot.

143
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,458
So then, you have to tell me,

144
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,916
do you know where
they're hiding Holo?

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,291
We are Milone
Trading after all.

146
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,750
Our employees
are attacked at night.

147
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,125
Our shops are set on fire.

148
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,708
These are everyday
things for us.

149
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,666
Our emergency measures
have to be and are perfect.

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,208
Although we do have one rival.

151
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,375
The church.

152
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,916
That is correct.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,833
They visit more
countries and cities

154
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,791
than we could or
would want to visit.

155
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,500
So, they are
surprisingly well prepared

156
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,291
for emergencies themselves.

157
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,500
If the church decides to make
a concerted effort to find her,

158
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,750
she'll have no choice
but to confine herself

159
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,166
instead of
carelessly running away.

160
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,083
Under normal circumstances,

161
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,750
I would have preferred
to negotiate after finding out

162
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,958
who's behind Medio Trading.

163
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,083
We could find out
who's behind their financing

164
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,916
and take it from them...

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it really is a shame
we don't know that benefactor.

166
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,458
I wouldn't even
know where to start.

167

Be careful.

I'm sure you'll be successful.

169
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,833
I'll try to live up
to your expectations.

170

Oh, the passwords...

remember them.

172
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,416
We're using two gold coins?

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,333
What else would we use?

174
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,375
[LAWRENCE]
Once I'm underground,

175
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,583
I go forward while
touching the wall on the right.

176
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,833
Is that it?

177
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,916
[MILONE EMPLOYEE A] Yes.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,375
When you get to
the end of the passage,

179
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,250
just stay there and wait.

180
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,583
And the warehouse above that

181
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,041
is where they're
holding Holo.

182
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,208
So I stay there until
the market's opening bell rings

183
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,625
and that's when your people
will go in and save her.

If all goes well...

someone will be there
to open the cover above you

186

and lower your companion.

187

if you hear the word
"Rahe" wait for my colleague.

via the planned
path immediately.

191

they'd be this prepared.

200
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,625
I've often heard that churches
dig underground passages

for espionage and tax evasion

the harvest is rich or poor.

In order to have
rich harvests more often,

298
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,583
I sometimes made a poor
harvest to recover the fields.

It was always
under my supervision.

Yet, even with
those poor harvests,

was a much better place

to grow wheat than other lands.

303
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,916
It is true
the villagers treated me

as if I were a god
of rich harvests.

305

But they did not
do so out of respect.

306

They simply wanted
to keep me there...

to be me, correct?

Do you have any idea
what that woman said to me?

heard my name from Zheren...

be true... I was... I was...

hardly finished with me.

00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,083
to a god who does not care.

322
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:30,083
I felt... I felt...
such shame!

323
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,833
You know...

324
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:54,125
I think you're
looking at it the wrong way.

325
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,083
If you want
to go back up north...

326
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,375
You're going to have
to leave the land eventually.

327
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,625
So it doesn't upset
them to see you leave...

328
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,666
Don't you see there's
a kind of freedom in that?

329
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,666
You're not bound
to the land anymore...

330
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,375
But at the same time
we're not leaving for nothing.

331
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,625
Because I-- no, we are
both of us merchants...

332
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,291
And I'll promise
you one thing...

333
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,708
We will not laugh
until we get the money,

334
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:24,291
and we will not cry
until we go bankrupt.

335
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,333
And guess what?

336
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,416
We are going to laugh.

337
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,958
Thank you.

338
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:38,583
However, I have
had few conversations

339
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,500
in the past several
hundred years...

340
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,250
So I've become
emotionally delicate.

341
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,166
It may be true that I have

342
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,416
cried in front
of you twice now.

343
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,041
But I would have cried
even if it was not you.

344
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,416
Do you understand
what I am saying?

345
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,875
That I'm your favorite?

346
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,333
Wrong.

347
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,458
If it makes you feel
better I'm taking care

348
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,625
of you
for the money.

349
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,750
Our job is to keep running
until Milone contacts us.

350
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,708
You can't keep crying
at the drop of a hat.

351
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,916
Although if you did
I'd still be there...

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,666
if only for the money...

353
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,708
So even if
it was someone else

354
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,250
that was doing the crying,
I'd have--

355
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,583
Stop it... That isn't fair.

356
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,708
I am the favorite.

357
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,500
[COACHMAN A]
Hey you two, we've arrived.

358
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,208
I certainly hope you've
come to an understanding.

359
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,958
Yeah...

360
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,208
I know the person
who's behind Medio Trading...

361
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,125
His name is Earl Ehrendott.

362
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,208
The merchant that's
been dealing wheat

363
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,916
in the Earl's territory
is the one who's collecting

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,916
the silver coins
in a large quantity.

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Please pass this
information along to Marlheit.

366
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,875
I'll tell him myself.

367
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,916
No surprise...

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,083
Seems those who bring
money-making ideas

369
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,375
are always a little different.

370
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,083
You mean my ears?

371
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,875
Watching you two reminds
me of the old days...

372
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,125
I used to be a peddler too.

373
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,791
You better be careful...

374
00:20:54,875 --> 00:21:01,125
Or you might just end
up with someone like her.

375
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,500
Really...?

376
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,416
Well the coach's seat
is too big for one person...

377
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,583
I'll have to start
praying for your luck.

378
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,875
Maybe if I had
"ended up" with him

379
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,791
I would not be in such a mess.

380
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,125
Not fair... I just won't talk.

381
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,500
I think you're
developing a crush on me.

382
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:24,541
All right, you are pretty cute.

383
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,791
I'll give you that much.

384
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,916
I'm glad.

385
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,791
And for a kid,
you're pretty cute yourself.

386
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,666
Geez.

387
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,750

Wolf and Silent Farewell.
