1
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,291
[HOLO] So this is
the port town of Pazzio!

2
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,583
It looks like they have
delicious things to eat!

3
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,375
[LAWRENCE] Hey.
[HOLO] What?

4
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,458
I don't understand 

5
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,750
why you don't have
to hide your face.

6
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,083
Are you implying something?

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,458
Nothing, it's just
if you've been

8
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,166
in that village for
hundreds of years,

9
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,583
shouldn't there be a legend

10
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,916
about you turning into a girl?

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,916
At certain times Holo
will appear in the village

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,791
in the form of a
pretty young woman.

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,875
And she is always seen
as a mid adolescent.

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,958
A lovely figure,
she has long flowing hair

15
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,125
as well as wolf ears and
a beautiful dark brown tail

16
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,250
with a splash of
white at the end.

17
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
In return for the
keeping of her secret,

18
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,583
she promises to make

19
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,250
the village's harvest
rich next year.

20
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,250
[LAWRENCE]
Sounds like you.

21
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,666
Even if I did
reveal everything,

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,875
they would only be as
skeptical as you were.

23
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,458
Unless I show
my ears and tail,

24
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,000
they will have no idea.

25
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,750
No, I suppose not.

26
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,166
They will not notice...

27
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,000
After all, they do
not remember me anymore.

28
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,000
[LAWRENCE] 
And for both of our sakes, 

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,791
I hope you're
right about that.

30
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,500
[HOLO] I am sure
it will be fine.

31
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,708
Oh!

32
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,583
This town is exactly what
I was hoping it would be.

33
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,125
[LAWRENCE]
Do you see those apples...

34
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,750
they look pretty
good don't they?

35
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,875
[HOLO]
They do!

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,916
Oh, they smell
absolutely wonderful.

37
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,250
Yes, they do.

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,291
Actually, an old
acquaintance of mine

39
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,750
dealt in apple futures.

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,083
He put more than half
of his assets towards it.

41
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,416
I don't know where
those apples were from,

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,041
but his investment
would've probably

43
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,791
more than doubled by now.

44
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,125
I should've gone
that route, too.

45
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,333
Yes.

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,333
I am sorry you did not.

47
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,958
[LAWRENCE] Well, you know,
the risk was high.

48
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,291
If I were him,
I'd'a used a vessel.

49
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,750
What? A vessel?

50
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,416
Yeah, I mean
if it got wrecked

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,166
you could end up
losing everything,

52
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,416
including your life.

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,666
But if all went well,

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,250
you could stand to make
an extraordinary profit.

55
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,458
You okay?

56
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,041
Well...

57
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,666
So what you do is
you rent a vessel.

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,583
The shipment size
is decided based

59
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,625
upon the amount
of money paid.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,291
[HOLO]
Apples... Apples...

61
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,041
Oh please? Can I?

62
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,541
Oh, so that's
what you want.

63
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,833
Go buy as many
as you want with this.

64
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,833
Who buys that
many apples?

65
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,625
You are the one
who told me

66
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,750
to buy as many
as I wanted.

67
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,416
Maybe you just don't
have enough self-control.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,666
Remember you're going to have

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,375
to earn these meals.

70
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,791
You tricked me.

71
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,208
You were only
pretending

72
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
not to notice I wanted them.

73
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,125
Well, were you or not?

74
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,333
I have to admit it
feels kind of nice

75
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,958
to know what people
are thinking sometimes.

76
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,666
Those are mine!

77
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,166
Hey! It was my money!

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,833
I am Holo the Wise Wolf.

79
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:21,833
I can earn this
money back quickly.

80
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,083
Which is a good thing.

81
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,625
Because I had originally
planned on using

82
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,291
that silver coin to cover
our room and board.

83
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,791
[LAWRENCE] How could
you eat that much?

84
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,916
[HOLO] Apples are
the devils fruit.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,333
They are full of a rich and
sweet temptation from hell.

86
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,250
If you're such a wise wolf,

87
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,916
why don't you
have more control?

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,291
You might lose
things due to appetite,

89
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,833
but it is not as if holding
back is beneficial.

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,875
Our client today is in
the big building right there.

91
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,125
[HOLO] Their entrance
is rather large,

92
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,583
but, if you are comparing
the size of the whole structure,

93
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,291
I am sure there must
be bigger buildings.

94
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,875
[LAWRENCE] They're the third
largest trading company.

95
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,958
But, it's actually only a branch

96
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,916
of an even larger
trading company

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,250
who is based out of a
country in the far south.

98
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,791
Because they're
new to this area,

99
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,375
they have a tendency to pay

100
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,916
a higher price when
they're buying things.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,250
But more importantly...

102
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,583
[HOLO] They receive
various information

103
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,250
from their other branches

104
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,916
as well as their
main store, correct?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,333
And since they run their
business across borders...

106
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,875
It is possible they
would hear of a change

107
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,625
in the currency market, also.

108
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,500
Exactly.

109
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,416
I'm going to ask them 

110
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,416
if they have
heard anything

111
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,916
about what Zheren
said to us.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,458
Maybe confirm it.

113
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,125
[INFO CLERK] Welcome
to Milone Trading.

114
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,333
I've been here before.

115
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,416
I sold wheat to you
about three years ago.

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,708
Today I was hoping you
would buy some fur from me.

117
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,791
Yes. Yes.

118
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,791
I'm sure that will be fine.

119
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,375
[ASSESSOR] For using
our service today,

120
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,041
we thank you very much.

121
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,291
Your name is
Craft Lawrence, isn't it?

122
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,041
[LAWRENCE] 
Yes, it is.

123
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,500
I am honored that
you remembered me.

124
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,541
[ASSESSOR]
We're honored you came back.

125
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,833
They told me you were here

126
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,375
because you wanted us

127
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,541
to purchase some of your fur.

128
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,583
[LAWRENCE] 
That's right.

129
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,958
There are a total of seventy.

130
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,166
[ASSESSOR] Nice.
These are very good marten furs.

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,500
With all the different crops

132
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,000
having rich harvests this year,

133
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,541
we haven't had that
many of them come in.

134
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,041
I'm sure all the
farmers were too busy

135
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,833
working the land
to go hunting.

136
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,166
Yet, look at how many
I've brought for you.

137
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,500
Yes...

138
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,208
Now, let's see, you said
there are seventy of them?

139
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,416
Yes. That's right.

140
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,583
Then, since we have
done business before,

141
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,958
how does this sound:

142
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,083
132 coins.

143
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,333
132? Which coin?

144
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,125
Trenni silver coins.

145
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,916
Furs like these come
once every few years...

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,750
Maybe even
once in a decade.

147
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,291
I'd like you to take a
look at their fine gloss

148
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,458
that survived intact the cold
rain we had on our way here.

149
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,041
The gloss is very nice.

150
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,541
The coat, too.

151
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,166
[LAWRENCE] They are
also uniformly excellent

152
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,250
which is hard to come by.

153
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,958
Personally, I am
hoping to keep

154
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,291
a good relationship
with your company.

155
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,416
Of course, our company
definitely feels the same way.

156
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,916
Well then if we take
our future friendship

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,875
into account,
how about 140?

158
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:05,041
Yes... 40

159
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,583
Excuse me
just a minute.

160
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,416
Yes.

161
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,375
I do not know the market.

162
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,000
How good is that price?

163
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,291
It's pretty good.

164
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:22,125
So, can I assume
that we have a deal?

165
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,625
140 Trenni silver coins?

166
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,333
Is that indeed
what you said?

167
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,750
Ah, yes... Yes, it is.

168
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,125
140 Trenni silver coins.

169
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,166
That is correct.

170
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,416
I gather you
are surely

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,375
a very exceptional
merchant.

172
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,708
Yes.

173
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,333
And that
has to be why

174
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,458
you pretended
not to notice.

175
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,416
We cannot afford to
underestimate you.

176
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,791
Oh.

177
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,166
Ma'am I apologize,

178
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,208
but I am not entirely
certain what you mean.

179
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,416
I'm sorry...

180
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,625
Lawrence why are you
being so mean to him?

181
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,875
That wasn't my intent...

182
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,666
Why don't you tell him then?

183
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,083
Please sir, take one.

184
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:10,833
Now, I would like
for you to smell it.

185
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,708
What do you smell?

186
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,291
This scent...

187
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,500
It smells like fruit to me.

188
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,583
Precisely.

189
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,041
Were you aware
that the forests

190
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,875
are also full of
fruits this year?

191
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,458
These furs belonged
to martens

192
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:30,166
who resided in such
forests until recently.

193
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,458
Since they could eat

194
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,791
their fill of
this sweet fruit

195
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,166
'tis only natural

196
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,583
that they should
smell as sweet.

197
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,208
Yes, I smell it.

198
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,625
When they were
flaying their skins,

199
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,416
it took two
grown men to do it

200
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,291
and even then
the task was difficult

201
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,125
because the
martens' muscles

202
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,000
were so incredibly firm.

203
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,416
You may see.

204
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,916
Go ahead,
give it a good tug.

205
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,750
Harder!

206
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,083
It is strong.

207
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,583
Just like that
of a fierce animal.

208
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,166
It is warm as is
the sunshine in spring.

209
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,958
If you were to hold it
over you during rain

210
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,583
It would repel the
water and protect you.

211
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,666
Imagine for a moment there
is one piece of clothing

212
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,375
which smells this sweet.

213
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,708
Only one such piece
for sale amongst so many

214
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,708
that make you
wrinkle your nose

215
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,125
from their
oppressive scent.

216
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,625
There is no question
that it would sell

217
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,208
for an
exorbitant price.

218
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,666
Now... knowing this,

219
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,791
what kind of price
would you be willing to pay?

220
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,833
[ASSESSOR] 200.
200 Trenni silver coins.

221
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,166
200.

222
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,958
How about three
Trenni silver coins

223
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,541
per one piece of fur?

224
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
That is 210.

225
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,958
I, well...

226
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:36,875
Lawrence?

227
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,666
Are there other companies?

228
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,791
Oh... No.
No, that's fair.

229
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,416
We will take
them for 210 coins.

230
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,791
Oh, well of course,
if you insist.

231
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,125
[HOLO and LAWRENCE]
Cheers!

232
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:03,166
Wine is definitely the best!

233
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,291
What is wrong?

234
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,416
You should drink.

235
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,250
It is my treat
after all.

236
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,458
Tell me...

237
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,166
Have you ever worked
as a merchant before?

238
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,291
Oh no...

239
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,000
I am sorry if
I hurt your pride.

240
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,625
I did not mean to do so.

241
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,125
There was a merchant
who passed

242
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,083
by the village
a long time ago.

243
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,666
I was using his method.

244
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,875
So do not worry,
it was not something

245
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,875
I could
accomplish on my own.

246
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,083
Relax, your pride can
remain free and clear.

247
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,333
You know what, I never
really noticed it though...

248
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,541
Not at all.

249
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,083
I rolled up and slept in
those furs last night,

250
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,125
but I don't remember
smelling anything.

251
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
Well, you
would not have...

252
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,083
It was because of
the apples I had purchased.

253
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
You lied to him.

254
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:50,625
It was his own
fault anyway.

255
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,708
Oh, do not groan.

256
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,666
After all I am sure he is
happy to learn this method.

257
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,166
Am I right?

258
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,458
Yeah, probably.

259
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
If you only get upset
when you are tricked,

260
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,833
you will not go very far.

261
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,708
A professional would
get impressed and think,

262
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,750
"Perhaps I could
sell it that way, too."

263
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,833
By the way,
did you accomplish

264
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,666
what you had set out to do?

265
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,125
More or less.

266
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,541
Unfortunately, it seems
they haven't heard

267
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,541
any stories about a country

268
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
that will be reissuing
their silver coins.

269
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,333
Well, there might be a
trick to Zheren's story,

270
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,750
but as long as I gain...

271
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,083
I guess that's all
that really matters.

272
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,166
[ZHEREN] And now,
here's to our reunion.

273
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,958
Cheers!

274
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
I'm amazed!

275
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
You are both drinking
very good alcohol...

276
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,125
I guess this means

277
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,958
you must've done
well with the furs.

278
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah.

279
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,125
Congratulations!

280
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,125
This means my share
is going to increase, too!

281
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,875
Enough of that... C'mon.

282
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:52,875
Yeah?

283
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,375
You will sell me
the information

284
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,083
as to which silver coins
will be revalued.

285
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,000
And in return
you want a share

286
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,916
of the profit I make
as your payment.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,625
That the right idea?

288
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Yeah.

289
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,791
Is the story about the silver
coin's revaluation true?

290
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:06,833
I'm not...

291
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,250
well okay this is actually

292
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,541
something I'm guessing at

293
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,750
based on a little
bit of information

294
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,250
I got in the mining
town where I lived.

295
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,916
I mean, if you ask me,

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,625
I'm pretty sure you
can trust it, but...

297
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,875
There's no absolute in
business though right?

298
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,875
If you would have told me

299
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,458
that you had no doubts at all,

300
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,083
I would've turned
you down immediately.

301
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,250
So, what's your
share going to be?

302
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,458
Oh yeah...

303
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,583
10 silver coins
for the information.

304
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,708
Trenni coins.

305
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,500
Plus, I'd like
to have 10 percent

306
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,916
of your total profit.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,500
That's rather modest,
don'tcha think?

308
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,916
True.

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,250
The problem is, if you fail

310
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,041
I won't be able
to do anything about it.

311
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,875
In exchange for
keeping my share small,

312
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,416
I don't want you to hold

313
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,958
me responsible if
you happen to lose.

314
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,541
I mean, I'd return
the 10 silver coins

315
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,958
for bad information of course.

316
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,166
Right.

317
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,500
That sounds good
enough to me.

318
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,958
This is just great.

319
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,708
Now, do you think we could
go see a notary public,

320
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,416
say first thing
tomorrow morning?

321
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
Of course.

322
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,500
That makes perfect sense.

323
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,500
To our profit then.

324
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,833
Cheers!

325
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,541
[HOLO]
Farum silver coin!

326
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,583
No. That one's a
fake Marinne silver coin.

327
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,875
But I thought that
was this one over here.

328
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,500
It's a later version
Bishop Radeon silver coin.

329
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,916
Don't worry.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
You'll learn more
as you use them.

331
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,083
I think we should continue
after you sober up.

332
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,041
No! One more time!

333
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,333
If you insist...

334
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,500
Now then I'll
start from here

335
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,125
so try to
listen carefully.

336
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,500
Trenni silver coin.

337
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,000
Philing silver coin.

338
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,708
Lute silver coin.

339
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,666
Fake Marinne silver coin.

340
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,250
Farum silver coin.

341
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,416
Bald King Ranbalt silver coin.

342
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,291
Mitzfing Cathedral silver coin.

343
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,500
Fake Mitzfing
Cathedral silver coin.

344
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,791
Saint Mitzfing silver coin.

345
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,958
And this one...

346
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,166
I am finished. Goodnight.

347
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,375
Good choice.

348
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,333
You are a wise wolf.

349
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,375
I do not understand why

350
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,208
there are so many
of those coins.

351
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,583
How confusing
and just stupid.

352
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,458
New countries emerge
and others fall.

353
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,416
In addition,
provincial power holders

354
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
and church authorities
issue them out

355
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,041
for no particular reason.

356
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,000
On top of that you have to
add in all the counterfeiting.

357
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,166
The Lute silver
coins actually

358
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,958
used to be called
Fake Trenni silver coins.

359
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,583
Did you fall asleep?

360
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,833
From the very beginning,

361
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
you've given me
good information.

362
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,666
So, thanks.

363
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,333
No, I should
be thanking you.

364
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,625
All right.

365
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,875
I guess I better get going now.

366
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:41,708
Right.

367
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,500
Yeah! Go... make a killing!

368
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:51,458
And you stay
beautiful, ma'am.

369
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:56,083
Even when that boy
leaves is he ever noisy.

370
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,083
So this is the silver
coin in question.

371
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,416
Yes.

372
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,375
It is a pretty trustworthy
currency in this area.

373
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,916
Trustworthy?

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,750
There are hundreds of
different currencies.

375
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,291
And the amount of
gold or silver in them

376
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,000
changes around
all the time.

377
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,375
I see.

378
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833
The face value of the
currency is actually higher

379
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,500
than the value of the gold
or silver within the coins.

380
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,666
So if you don't trust it,

381
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
you can't use
it for business.

382
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,041
I understand, I think.

383
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,416
All right then, have you
yet learned anything

384
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,583
with the information
you received on this coin?

385
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,708
Not really...

386
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,750
But I have a better idea
what might be going on.

387
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,916
Are you alright?

388
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,541
Yes. I would like
to eat that please.

389
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,125
What?

390
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,458
[HOLO] Now then,
what do you think

391
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,000
might be going
on with the coins?

392
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,500
Do you remember
which one this is?

393
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,500
Philing silver coin.

394
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,875
That's right.

395
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,666
The silver purity
of this coin is high,

396
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,250
so it's very popular
in the market right now.

397
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,166
It's right up there
with Trenni silver coins.

398
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,083
It seems to me it does
not matter what the era,

399
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,916
the currencies reflect
countries' power.

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,250
Correct.

401
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,083
If the market's conquered
by foreign currencies,

402
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,083
they might as well
have lost a war.

403
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,000
So, in order to
defeat their rivals,

404
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,791
they will increase
their silver purity.

405
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,416
Yeah.

406
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,125
Which means
it's possible Zheren

407
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,208
might be telling us
the truth after all.

408
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,416
Well, my ears are not
exactly omnipotent.

409
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,541
What?

410
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,041
Did you think I would
get upset with you?

411
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,583
Yes, I did.

412
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,250
The only thing
that might upset me

413
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,500
is you assuming
something like that.

414
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,833
All right. Where
are we going now?

415
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,041
One of my acquaintances
is a money dealer.

416
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,625
A money dealer?

417
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,000
Realistically, a person can't
tell the purity of currency

418
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,875
just by looking at it.

419
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,833
The reason why a coin's
popularity goes up or down

420
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,041
is because people are sensitive
to a change in purity.

421
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,166
To the extent they consider a
little change a big one.

422
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,583
So when the currency
has a big change,

423
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,958
there's always
an indication.

424
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,750
You don't have to memorize it.

425
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,291
Not right now at any rate.

426
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,208
But don't worry,
I can keep explaining it.

427
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,208
In other words, if
the currency creator

428
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,333
wants to make a major
increase in purity

429
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,416
he first increases the
purity a small amount

430
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,583
in order to measure
peoples expectations.

431
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,666
And judging by their reaction 

432
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,750
he will wait until the right
time to make the big increase.

433
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:17,208
Yeah, you pretty
much got it.

434
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:18,916
[WEIZ] Lawrence!

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,916
Hey, Weiz.

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,041
Long time no see!

437
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,666
Okay...

438
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,833
Hello.

439
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,125
What's your name?

440
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,125
My name?

441
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,041
Oh.

442
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,041
My name is Holo.

443
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,083
Oh, beautiful!

444
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,458
Lawrence...

445
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,416
So have you slept with her yet?

446
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,875
No, of course I haven't!

447
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,500
Then you won't mind if I do.

448
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:41,125
It's a pleasure, my dear.

449
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,458
What is happening?

450
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,666
I have some business to
discuss with you Weiz.

451
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,833
Do you have a Trenni silver coin
that has been issued recently?

452
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,083
Not possible.

453
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,041
We handle them every day
and still can't tell.

454
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,791
What about melting it
down to check it?

455
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,000
Absurd.

456
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,708
There's no way I can do that.

457
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,708
Would you mind if I took
a little peek at it?

458
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,333
Of course; sure.

459
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,208
You appear to
be very naughty.

460
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:19,333
Give me just a moment, please.

461
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,625
Holo, come on now-you
can't tell them apart.

462
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,750
I've heard among highly
experienced dealers,

463
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,375
a handful can tell
by doing that.

464
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,458
But really I think
it's just a myth.

465
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,541
Whaddaya got?

466
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,833
I cannot tell.

467
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,291
No, I suppose you couldn't tell.

468
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,166
Don't worry
about it though.

469
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,166
He is a very
interesting man.

470
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,166
He is an incomparable womanizer.

471
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,416
Really?

472
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,708
So, go ahead and tell
me about the purity...

473
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,291
increased or not?

474
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,708
What makes you think I know
anything about the coins purity.

475
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,000
I saw your ear move a little.

476
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,958
Perceptive.

477
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,708
Although, I was a bit surprised

478
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,625
you didn't mention
it back there.

479
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, I was thanking you.

480
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,750
What?

481
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,208
Come on now...

482
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,666
Tell the truth.

483
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,291
You were a little jealous.

484
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,208
It was a thank you for that...

485
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,125
Do not get upset though,
men are all jealous idiots.

486
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,958
And women are stupid too
to feel happy about it.

487
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,916
It's true, there are
idiots everywhere.

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,375
Come on.

489
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
What was the purity?

490
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:25,875
Oh yes that.

491
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,333
Well it was not by much,

492
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,375
but the newer the coin was
the duller the sound became.

493
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,666
Really...

494
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,958
so duller...

495
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,750
the purity must
be decreasing then.

496
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,333
Maybe Zheren
lied to us after all.

497
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,375
Making a profit with
decreasing currency

498
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,750
is really a waiting game.

499
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,750
If you buy back when
the value goes down,

500
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,375
there will be a difference.

501
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,875
When the market price
eventually catches back up,

502
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,000
that's where you profit but
it doesn't happen overnight.

503
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,375
I just don't see how Zheren

504
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,666
can expect to gain
any money this way.

505
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,916
Yes.

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,791
I think you might
have been tricked.

507
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,208
You really think so?

508
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,541
I really think so.

509
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,125
Okay.

510
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,958
So you think I was swindled out
of my money then, is that it?

511
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,791
In the worst case
he gets nothing.

512
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,416
That is all.

513
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,583
Even when the value of
the silver coin goes down

514
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,750
and you lose, all
he has to do is return

515
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,250
the money he originally
received from you.

516
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,416
But on the other hand,
the value could go up too.

517
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,666
Then he would receive
a share of the profits.

518
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,833
He has the chance
to make money

519
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,041
without paying anything
or risking a loss.

520
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,125
Well I'll be...

521
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,250
Humans are rather
smart, are they not?

522
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,500
Yes. They are.

523
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,666
Lawrence?

524
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,125
Is a decrease in purity
something abnormal

525
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,083
or is it more commonplace?

526
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:38,916
Common.

527
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,125
But they try to be careful

528
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,833
to make sure it stays
at the same level.

529
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,083
Yes.

530
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,250
And this, it is a deal
about silver purity

531
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,083
which appeared out of nowhere.

532
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,791
Coincidence or not...?

533
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,500
Curious nonetheless.

534
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,958
When hunting prey, we
sometimes climb the trees.

535
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,583
From that point of view, 

536
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,791
we can see our prey's
unexpected hiding places.

537
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,208
In this way, we look at
things from a different angle.

538
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
What do you mean?

539
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,708
What angle?

540
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,375
Think about it for a minute...

541
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,125
What if it is not the young
man who is doing the scheming?

542
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,166
He did not necessarily
have to earn his profit

543
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,666
from that person in a
direct manner, either.

544
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,750
For example, someone might
have offered him money

545
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,708
to simply propose a
suspicious deal to you

546
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,125
and he was paid with
the money you gave him.

547
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,875
Yes! That's the deal.

548
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,541
This is more than a simple
trick to make me believe

549
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,375
I'm profiting from some coins.

550
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,041
I suppose the new angle worked.

551
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,166
Let's go!

552
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,541
Hey!

553
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,375
Where are we going this time?

554
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,500
Milone Trading Company.

555
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,833
Next episode...

556
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,708
Wolf and Her Helpless Partner.
