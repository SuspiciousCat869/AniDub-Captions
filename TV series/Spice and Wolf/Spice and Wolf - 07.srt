[birds chirping]

2
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,125
How many have
you eaten so far?

3
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:39,250
17... maybe 18.

4
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,416
Probably at least 19.

5
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,958
How many are left?

6
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,750
Why do you even care?

7
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,500
I just wanted to know.

8
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,083
You already know.

9
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,500
I want to hear you say it.

10
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,000
81.

11
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,333
Really? 8.

12
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,875
I said 81!

13
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,583
I heard.

14
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,166
Would you like for me
to finish them right now?

15
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,375
Will that make you happy?

16
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,791
I don't know; I don't
think you can do it.

17
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,916
I can!

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I am Holo the Wise Wolf
so you shut up!

19
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,291
Ya know, you don't
have to be so stubborn.

20
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,250
I am not being stubborn.

21
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
You sure about that?

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,041
Yes, I am sure.

23
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,500
Are you sure that you're sure?

24
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,291
I am sure, that I am sure!

25
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,666
Because you don't
sound very sure to me.

26
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,416
Just you watch and you
will find how sure I am!

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,750
Honestly, I sure
am tired of them.

28
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,250
That's what I figured.

29
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,708
Even if they are your favorite,
you ate 20 of them yesterday,

30
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,916
on top of what you ate today.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,083
So what.

32
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,000
I will eat every one
of them right now, watch!

33
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,958
Don't get so upset...

34
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,875
I'm sure you're
tired of raw apples,

35
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:49,500
but there are plenty of other
ways to eat them, you know.

36
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,833
What other ways?

37
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,083
You had better not
be teasing; this is not a joke.

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,708
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,375
Baking apples, I have never
heard of such a thing.

40
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,833
I had no idea
there were still people

41
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,291
that have never
tasted apple pie.

42
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,708
Well, I have not, but it
sounds like an excellent idea.

43
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,875
It is!

44
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,833
They bake it in an oven.

45
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,791
That way the apples become
surprisingly tender.

46
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,375
It's like they're rotting...

47
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,208
well, the texture's like that,
the flavor's actually amazing.

48
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,208
Oh?

49
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,791
I guess you can
think of it like this,

50
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,625
you know how things are really
tasty right before they go bad?

51
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, for whatever reason,

52
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,791
when you bake an apple
it tastes like that.

53
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,541
It becomes sweet
and tender and warm

54
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,000
and it's all
at the same time.

55
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,708
But I'm sure after
your little binge,

56
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,750
sweet things is starting
to get boring.

57
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,541
So how about this instead...

58
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,625
Would you rather have
salt-seasoned meat

59
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,458
for dinner or fish?

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,041
Meat!

61
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,750
What happened to
the girl who looked

62
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,041
as if she couldn't stand
to eat another bite?

63
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,208
Meat is a completely
different story.

64
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,750
Let's go!

65
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,833
Okay...

66
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,208
Finish the apples, though...

67
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,416
Seriously.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,958
You do not have to worry.

69
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,333
After what you just told me,

70
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,958
I am positive I can
finish them all, thank you!

71
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,666
Well, I guess we can go then...

72
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,666
Ready?

73
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
Of course!

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,666
I have been waiting
out here forever.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,750
Why are you being so slow?

76
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,416
Why are you
being so difficult?

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,458
Because you like me this way.

78
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,041
[LAWRENCE]
Uh... well...?

79
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,333
[HOLO]
What?

80
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,916
It's just that...

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,416
Well you kind of
look like a nun.

82
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,583
[LAWRENCE]
All I see is a nun...

83
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,125
From every angle. Nun.

84
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,500
[HOLO]
Yes.

85
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,166
It is quite convenient for
travelling, would you agree?

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,375
I guess.

87
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,041
I fail to understand
how it makes a difference

88
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,666
whether I wear
this simple cloth.

89
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,458
The human world
is strange, as always.

90
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,708
But I suppose, if
you think about it,

91
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,333
even a wolf
will sometimes

92
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,333
like to wear sheep's
clothing, am I right?

93
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,791
True enough.

94
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,083
Although, if one were to wear
the fur of a rabbit instead

95
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,041
I believe you would
be caught rather easily.

96
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,250
Then I guess I should
probably carry some apples

97
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,916
with me just in case
I end up getting caught.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,958
And I had very nearly forgotten
about those stupid apples.

99
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,958
[HOLO and LAWRENCE laughing]

100
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:29,791
[LAWRENCE]
However...

101
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,125
[HOLO]
What?

102
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,583
In your particular case...

103
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,041
looking too much like a nun
could actually be problematic.

104
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,500
What do you mean?

105
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,750
Well, it doesn't
matter what happens,

106
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,458
nuns do not drink
during the day.

107
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,083
Oh really? Well then
I must be an outstanding nun.

108
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,666
And, a nun would never
say something like that.

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,916
I humbly beg your
pardon, kind sir.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,083
But really though,
when we head north

111
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,291
there are places
where you looking

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,708
like a nun will
definitely cause trouble.

113
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,000
Trouble...?

114
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,541
Well, what do you
suggest we do about it?

115
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,291
You'll have to change clothes...

116
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,625
I'm thinking it'll be safer
if you at least wear something

117
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:07,333
similar to what the girls
in town like to wear.

118
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,125
The food will
not taste as good

119
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,041
if we know we have
to run errands afterwards,

120
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,125
so what do you
say we go ahead

121
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,833
and purchase something
before we eat?

122
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,291
Really? Yeah,
that'd be great.

123
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,541
I was afraid I was going
to have to convince you.

124
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,875
Were you worried
I would insist

125
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,500
upon eating
and drinking first?

126
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,916
You should know
me better by now.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,500
I am not that
drawn to food.

128
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,625
No, not food.

129
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,833
I see...

130
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
Then you were being
considerate after all.

131
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,375
I should probably
take you up on it.

132
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,083
Your exaggerated reason behind
purchasing me a new outfit,

133
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,125
or did you really think
that I would not notice?

134
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,375
For your sake,
I shall not hold back

135
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,625
and will allow you
to purchase new clothes for me.

136
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,875
The winter is fast approaching
and it will be getting cold.

137
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,333
That's very big of you.
Thanks.

138
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,166
Oh, no!

139
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh no?

140
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,291
Is something the matter?

141
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,791
I don't have money.

142
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,916
I don't believe you.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,458
No. I didn't
mean that way.

144
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,458
I meant I don't
have any change.

145
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,541
I simply do
not understand.

146
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,125
Why can you not
use that money?

147
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,500
Well technically
I could

148
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,375
but they wouldn't
like it very much.

149
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,000
Using gold coins to buy
clothes is kind of like

150
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,416
using a sledgehammer
to kill a fly.

151
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,458
I see.

152
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,000
I didn't realize
the gold coins

153
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,333
were so much higher
in value than the silver ones.

154
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,541
They are.

155
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,375
For example,
a current Lumione gold coin

156
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,625
is equivalent
to 35 Trenni silver coins.

157
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,791
If you live modestly,

158
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,208
you can last 7 days
on 1 silver coin.

159
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,458
And, gold is
35 times that.

160
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,250
Wow, it is a big
difference, then...

161
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,458
But...

162
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,291
This robe cost 2 gold
coins... exactly...

163
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,000
That is what they
said at the store.

164
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,958
Are you sure you
do not buy clothes

165
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,666
with gold coins
and apples with silver?

166
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,000
If that were the case,

167
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,625
most of the townspeople
would be naked.

168
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,583
The clothing shop owner
who sold it to you

169
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,875
was probably just
worried about whether

170
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,541
he'd really
get paid for it.

171
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,333
Oh.

172
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,166
I did not realize
it was so expensive.

173
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,000
Well obviously...

174
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,375
So for the next ones,

175
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,916
why don't you pick out
something a little cheaper.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,208
Cheaper!

177
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,500
I am Holo the Wise Wolf.

178
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,041
If I am caught
in cheap clothing

179
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,000
it will ruin my good name.

180
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,208
You know they say
if one is truly pretty

181
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,208
she'll look good no
matter what she wears.

182
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,541
Now I need to
make some change.

183
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,666
Oh, exchanging money!

184
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,625
Then we shall have to
go to that bridge, right?

185
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,958
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

186
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,166
And walk fast
while you are at it...

187
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,791
I need to have a drink,
and I need one soon.

188
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,791
[WEIZ] Let's see...

189
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,833
For Lumione, it's gonna
be 34 Trenni silver coins

190
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,208
to stay current
with the going rate.

191
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,541
And the transaction fee?

192
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
It's 10 Lute silver coins,

193
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,208
or I'll take
30 Trie copper coins.

194
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,166
Lute silver it is.

195
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,416
Agreed, we'll
go with the Lute.

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,208
All right then.

197
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,458
Now don't forget
to be careful.

198
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,458
If you drop
anything it will end up

199
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,416
belonging to the person
who picks it up first.

200
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,583
Weiz?

201
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes?

202
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,666
Try to remember
that I'm the customer.

203
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,250
Just leave the coin
over there somewhere;

204
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,083
can't you see
I'm kinda busy?

205
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,166
Well, when you tear away
yourself away from her,

206
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
do you think you
can help me?

207
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,750
What did I say?

208
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,333
It is more important
to me to make sure

209
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,333
this delightful girl does not
drop any of her silver coins.

210
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,375
Isn't that right?

211
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,125
Yes, and thank you!

212
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,583
But, can I ask
you a question?

213
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,250
Anything
in the world.

214
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Do you not think there
might be a few too many

215
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,000
of these silver coins
for my hand to hold?

216
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,291
But my dear Holo,

217
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,708
that's exactly what
my hands are here for.

218
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,375
Oh...

219
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,541
Perhaps you
should not, though.

220
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,791
Your precious hands
will be occupied.

221
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,833
Oh, no.

222
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,625
I'd gladly
sacrifice my hands

223
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,708
to prevent any unfortunate
loss of silver coins from yours.

224
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,958
In fact, such sacrifice
could only bring me joy.

225
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,583
Yes, joy!

226
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,416
And do you know why
that is, my darling?

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,958
Because then
maybe you could see

228
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,208
that the passion in my heart
is so great that my hands--

229
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,500
no-- not even my
arms could contain it!

230
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,791
All right!

231
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,083
Have you forgotten
the basics of money dealing?

232
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,291
Silver gets a bag.
Gold gets a box.

233
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,416
And if money is
to be held in hand

234
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,916
it should be
crude copper, right?

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,166
Fine.

236
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,916
Keeping a wonderful girl
like that to yourself

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,791
is an act that
can only defy God!

238
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,375
Haven't you ever
heard the expression,

239
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,958
"Share the bread
you've been given with others."

240
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,458
You want me to share her?

241
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,416
Remember, there's no bargaining
when it comes to money dealing.

242
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,333
If I hand her over
it's all or nothing.

243
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,500
If you take her,
the debt she owes me

244
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
would transfer
over to you as well.

245
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,708
And I, of course,

246
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,458
would want to be paid
in full immediately.

247
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,291
I could never
do something as cruel

248
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,166
as put a price
on you, Love.

249
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,750
What a horrible
thing to say;

250
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,083
you are nothing more
than a crooked merchant!

251
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,833
I want you
to please understand,

252
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,541
the scales of my heart

253
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,125
will always be swaying
back and forth.

254
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,541
But there is something
you should know,

255
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,666
I shall never
lean to one side

256
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,375
or the other due to
the weight of gold coins.

257
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,666
Oh, Holo!

258
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,041
Of course you wouldn't.

259
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,583
You dare touch swaying
scales with your hand?

260
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,500
You must be a very
disreputable person indeed.

261
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,041
Oh, my darling.

262
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
Well, we should
be going now.

263
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,583
Hey, Lawrence,
I was wondering...

264
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,125
What?

265
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,791
You came all the way here just
to exchange that gold coin.

266
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,458
Are you buying anything?

267
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,000
I am.

268
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,458
I hear every
day things are getting

269
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,583
more and more
expensive best to buy now.

270
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,458
See ya.

271
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,166
Tell me,
do money dealers work

272
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,041
even after it
has become dark?

273
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,333
No.

274
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,708
It's pretty common
knowledge that money dealers

275
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,416
who trade after dark
are less than honest dealers.

276
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,208
I am not a crook,
so I refuse to work after dark.

277
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,541
I would like Weitz
to accompany us,

278
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,958
if you do not mind.

279
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,416
We're buying her clothes
and then we'll go get dinner.

280
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,458
If you feel like it, you can
meet us at the bar later.

281
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,833
Oh yeah, definitely.

282
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,833
I'm assuming the usual place?

283
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,666
Of course.
It's always best to get drunk

284
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,333
where you're comfortable.

285
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,208
See you there then!

286
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,500
As soon as I finish up here
I'll see both of you at the bar!

287
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,333
How fun.

288
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,083
That was certainly amusing,
do you not agree?

289
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,166
Hilarious, but you
had better watch yourself

290
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,500
with that one.

291
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,458
What do you mean?

292
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,541
He'll follow you around.

293
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,583
But I am already
followed around by you.

294
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,625
He is different though,

295
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,458
in that he knows
he is playing a game.

296
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,500
It is more fun
to tease you though,

297
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,333
and I enjoy
speaking to a smart male

298
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,833
every once in awhile.

299
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,875
Come on now Lawrence,
please do not be so serious.

300
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,916
We both realize that
this is only a game.

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,791
Although I have to admit
I am a little embarrassed.

302
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:28,666
It is just, that Weiz
fellow is such a smooth talker,

303
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,041
which is unlike
you completely.

304
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,541
But I know
from past experience,

305
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,166
there is nothing
more unreliable

306
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,458
than the words coming
out of peoples' mouths.

307
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,833
You live in
the business world.

308
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,833
You must know what I mean.

309
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,708
Yeah, I'm fairly certain
I would lie about anything

310
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,583
if it meant
I could make a profit.

311
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,000
Your lies do not
work on me though.

312
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,041
If you say so. Shall we
go buy your clothes then?

313
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,166
Lawrence!

314
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,458
You failed
to grab the happiness

315
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,250
which has been
handed to you twice now.

316
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,000
If you fail to grab
it one more time,

317
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,875
the tail of happiness
might just run away

318
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,416
and you shall
never find it again.

319
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,625
Wait...

320
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,250
I have no idea what
you're talking about...

321
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,375
Holo! What do you mean?

322
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,541
[CLOTHING SHOP OWNER]
That one is 40 Lute coins.

323
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,875
Which is a pretty
fair price for that piece.

324
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,833
It is expensive.

325
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,833
We're actually planning
to head north soon,

326
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,333
so if could you
find us something

327
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,625
suitably thick and cheap

328
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,583
for two people
that'd be great.

329
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,541
What can you afford?

330
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,916
Two Trenni silver coins.

331
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,833
I think I can help.

332
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,500
Two tops and bottoms,
plus two blankets...

333
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,750
How will these work for you?

334
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,041
I think those should work
just fine, thank you very much.

335
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,208
As you can see,
I'm a peddler myself,

336
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,750
I've managed
to get in good

337
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,000
with the local Milone Trading
branch while I've been here.

338
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,333
Oh! Milone Trading?

339
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,625
Yeah, so it looks as
though I'll be travelling

340
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,125
to this town several
times a year from now on.

341
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,916
Oh, is that right?

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Then why don't you go ahead
and take this coat as well,

343
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,500
and I'll just go and
grab you another blanket.

344
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,083
Of course
these have been fumigated.

345
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,541
They are guaranteed to be bug
free for 2 more years at least.

346
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,833
I am sorry, but I thought we
came here to buy me clothes.

347
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,000
We did.

348
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,541
But then...
do I have to wear those?

349
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,750
If you think you can stay
warm wearing just that robe,

350
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,791
then no, you don't
have to wear them.

351
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,583
If you are upset about me
spending some of your money

352
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,333
without asking, you can
just tell me you are angry,

353
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,083
For I am Holo
the Wise Wolf.

354
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,500
I have a good brain as
well as a pleasing appearance.

355
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,000
But I have a good nose too,

356
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,125
and wearing that will
make my nostrils curl.

357
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,416
Well, maybe this is your
chance to learn some humility.

358
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,541
Trust me, your personality
would benefit from it.

359
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Don't be upset. I'll show
you what's behind the trick.

360
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,541
Mister, I wanna
ask you something.

361
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,041
Yes?

362
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,333
Do you have anything nice
that a woman would want to wear?

363
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,875
Something for a woman?

364
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,458
Preferably something warm
for those northern towns...

365
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,833
And in the lady's
size if you have it.

366
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:24,000
Give me just a second,
I've the perfect thing.

367
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,416
How about this?

368
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,916
I bought it from
a merchant family

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,500
when they were
updating their wardrobe.

370
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,791
I think it is far
too extravagant for me.

371
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,916
Well then what
are you looking for?

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,416
I would like something
a little simpler

373
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,250
and easier to change into.

374
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,916
Right.

375
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,833
Let me see what I can find.

376
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,583
Excuse me? What about that?

377
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,833
Pardon?

378
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,625
Oh, yes, of course!

379
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm not surprised
this caught your eye.

380
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,833
This is an excellent piece
that has been worn by a noble.

381
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,333
Look at this...

382
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,208
The ends are stitched very
carefully so they won't tear...

383
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,708
And, pay careful attention to
this walnut button.

384
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,291
Can you see the detail?

385
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,708
You simply will not
beat this quality.

386
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,416
You are a very good merchant.

387
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,875
Oh and notice this
specially made sling,

388
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,541
if you wear this
around your shoulders,

389
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,833
you won't be able to help

390
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:20,083
catching the eyes
of people in town.

391
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,833
I smell rabbit.

392
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,250
Well don't eat it.

393
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,791
I would like these!

394
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
So how much are they?

395
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,375
For the two
of them together?

396
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,708
10 Trenni silver coins...
No... Make it 9 instead.

397
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,875
No, no, wait.

398
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,250
How about 8 silver
coins so I can

399
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,208
show my respect
to this lovely lady's beauty.

400
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,833
That's a deal.

401
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,250
What if this lovely lady

402
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,000
were willing to try
on this lovely merchandise

403
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:52,666
and show it off,
would you then make it 7?

404
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,625
Okay, sure.
You can have them for 7.

405
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,625
Oh, thank you!

406
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,833
Excuse me a minute.

407
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,625
How do I look?

408
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,083
Just wonderful!

409
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,291
If I didn't know better,

410
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,166
I'd think you paid
20 coins for it!

411
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
So, were the
clothes not expensive?

412
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,750
No, 7 silver coins for that
quality is a really good buy.

413
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:33,208
Did you know you'd be able
to knock the price down?

414
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,166
If I had picked the kind
of clothes you are carrying...

415
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,458
I know we could
have purchased them

416
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,791
for 1/10 the
price of this.

417
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,083
I had actually expected
it to cost a lot more,

418
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,791
so don't worry
about it, okay?

419
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,208
However, if you feel
that bad about it,

420
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,500
try not drinking
anything tonight.

421
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,333
You'd save up 7 coins
pretty quick.

422
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,333
I do not drink that much!

423
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,416
[HOLO and LAWRENCE laughing]

424
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,875
Anyway, your little tactics

425
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,750
for knocking down prices
are kind of dirty.

426
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,083
No matter how good
the merchant is,

427
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,875
he has no way around that.

428
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,458
So, it is hardly my fault
all men are idiots.

429
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:09,166
What do you plan on doing
with those things you purchased?

430
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,458
You do not intend to
take them to the bar do you?

431
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,791
No. That was
not my intention.

432
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,833
We are not headed to the inn
either, are we?

433
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,500
That is because I'm not taking
them to the inn.

434
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,583
I'll sell these as is to another
clothing shop.

435
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,791
We've still got some
time before winter hits,

436
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,125
we can buy them again
when we get further north.

437
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,916
Sell them? Really?

438
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,750
Yeah. There's no
use in keeping them

439
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,416
if we're not
using them, right?

440
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,041
Yes, that is true.

441
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,458
But will you be able to sell
them at a high price?

442
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm not sure.

443
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,916
I guess selling them for the
same price will be difficult.

444
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,916
I'll probably
lose some on the deal.

445
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,291
You sell even when
you know you will lose?

446
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,875
You haven't figured it out?

447
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,583
Hold on... I need a minute
to think this over.

448
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,875
Would you like me
to explain the trick?

449
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,333
I am not
asking for your help

450
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,125
but if you would like to tell
me I will not stop you.

451
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,458
Understood. It's nothing
special, and, plus,

452
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,750
you did a better
job than me anyway.

453
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,666
This bundle of clothes
cost 2 silver coins...

454
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
Let's say, for
example, I sold these

455
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,916
to another shop
for 1 silver coin.

456
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,625
I'd lose 1 silver coin.

457
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,041
Go on.

458
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,375
Well then,
you have to pay attention

459
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,625
to something
else altogether.

460
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,875
What else altogether?

461
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,000
Look...

462
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,333
No matter who sees your robe

463
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,750
they are going
to be able to tell

464
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,750
it is very
good quality, right?

465
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,958
I guess so.

466
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,541
I'm sure you can
imagine people who normally

467
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,375
wear this kind of quality
wouldn't visit a shop like that.

468
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,500
So, the shop owner wanted
to have a good relationship

469
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,458
with me because I was with you.

470
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,000
Now, this being the case,

471
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,208
what would you
do if you were him?

472
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,583
I would sell
things cheap

473
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
so it would leave
you with a good impression.

474
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,458
That's correct...

475
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,875
And after you did that,
then what would you do?

476
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,208
He reduced the price
a little on these...

477
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,625
but he reduced it quite
a bit for your clothes.

478
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,333
I am a customer who
willingly paid 2 silver coins

479
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,291
for clothes that
are basically rags.

480
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,250
But, there's a big
difference in the price

481
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,375
of these versus
the price of your clothes.

482
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,833
So tell me, what is
the significance there.

483
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,083
If we take
into consideration

484
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,166
the total balance
we really saved a lot.

485
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,625
Exactly right!

486
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,791
That hurt!

487
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,000
You did that to him and
yet you call me the tricky one?!

488
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,291
Which means...
you had to go and hit me?

489
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,375
That's right!

490
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,875
Although I am
surprised you came up

491
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,625
with such a method anyway.

492
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,541
I like to call it
having business sense.

493
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,791
Still...

494
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,250
The way you
handled that merchant

495
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,166
was a lot better
than I could have done.

496
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,250
Naturally.

497
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,791
Because your
shallow cleverness

498
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,875
is no match for my scheming.

499
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,291
Yeah, so you say.

500
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh? Is that a challenge?

501
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,333
Because if you are confident,

502
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,416
you should probably
show me your skills

503
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,291
in the bar
where we are headed.

504
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,833
Show them in the bar?

505
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,916
You can pay as high a price
as possible to purchase me!

506
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,625
Sure, of course I will...

507
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,708
But I'll insist
on paying in apples.

508
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,875
You are not playing
very nice to mention apples.

509
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,166
They will get a little
sweeter if you bake them.

510
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,333
I think jealousy heats
you up a little bit.

511
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,208
Males burned with jealousy
are too sweet to eat.

512
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,041
Then what about you?

513
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,750
What? Are you saying
you want to give it a try?

514
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,083
I'll think about it.

515
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,125
You caught
the happiness that time.

516
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,833
