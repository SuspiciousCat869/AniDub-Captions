[LAWRENCE panting]

4
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,833
[HOLO] I was hoping this
would be a more moving reunion.

5
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,833
But you look just terrible.

6
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,750
Lemerio betrayed us...

7
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,625
This is the only
thing I could protect.

8
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,166
Seriously, you are
such an idiot.

9
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,416
Your face is
swollen from being hit...

10
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,291
You are covered in mud...

11
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,333
And your wrists
are even burnt.

12
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,708
Even in this
pathetic state,

13
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,000
you were still careful

14
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,583
and folded my robe to
keep it from getting wet.

15
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,333
You are terribly
good-natured!

16
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,291
Lawrence...

17
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,333
I might be forced
to kill humans.

18
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,708
Holo...

19
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,291
I had a plan
to carry out

20
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,125
this scheme
as quickly as possible.

21
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,583
I wanted it to go back
to just us travelling alone.

22
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,125
It is the reason
I did not argue

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,041
with that arrogant youth.

24
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,458
I managed the situation
with maturity.

25
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,500
Did you have to
bow before them?

26
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,375
I did.

27
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,541
Forget about it.

28
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,000
I made the decision
to do so.

29
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,166
And yet...

30
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,000
This is how
we are rewarded?!

31
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,666
I return to find you
in this abused state!

32
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,083
I cannot bear
to see you suffer!

33
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,125
[HOLO] We will go see
Lemerio immediately.

34
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,041
A price must be paid
for what he has done to us!

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,708
[LAWRENCE] 
No, wait!

36
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,458
We have to find Liebert
and the others first!

37
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,541
And as soon as possible!

38
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,041
If a reason exists
that will convince me,

39
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,708
tell me now.

40
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,041
They are planning
to kill Nora.

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,083
That little girl does
have a partner as well.

42
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,166
I am sure she will be fine
even without our help.

43
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,041
It may be true
she has a partner,

44
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,166
but there's only so much
a sheepdog can do, Holo!

45
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,666
She needs you!

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,958
What could I do?

47
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,750
You could help!

48
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,500
You can take care of
a hundred men in no time.

49
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,958
Of course I can,
but only in my wolf form!

50
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,000
So?

51
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,083
That little girl
is a shepherd, right?

52
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,750
You have to do it Holo.

53
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,708
We can't let them kill her.

54
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,541
You don't want to see someone
murdered anymore than I do.

55
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,083
I would be willing to show
my appreciation, as well.

56
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,708
Really?

57
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,833
As long as you don't
say you want Nora's life,

58
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,333
I'll do everything I can
to fulfill your wish.

59
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:49,250
Come on...

60
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,208
You're the only one
that can save her!

61
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,875
Holo?!

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,041
I should probably
take off my clothes.

63
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,625
It would be such a pain
to make new ones.

64
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,083
I'll take that as a yes.

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,958
I still have one
condition though:

66
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,041
It does not
matter who they are,

67
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,833
I will not be
able to guarantee

68
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,500
their safety if they
begin to aggravate me.

69
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,791
You will accept
this before I can act.

70
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,958
Yes, I understand.

71
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,083
Although, I still
have faith in you.

72
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:26,000
When did you become
such a smooth talker?

73
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,875
Honestly...

74
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,500
My companion is nothing
more than trouble.

75
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,041
I am sorry...

76
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,375
Did you have
something to say?

77
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,875
Yeah...

78
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,916
You've got an amazing tail.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,875
Well, that was
rather bland,

80
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,416
but most appreciated.

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
Now then,
I need you

82
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,791
to close your eyes
for a minute.

83
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,208
Go ahead, get on.

84
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,458
It is all right if you need
to hold on to my hair.

85
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,708
Do not worry, if you fall
I will carry you in my mouth.

86
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,666
I'm not gonna let go!

[LAWRENCE]
What is it?

90
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,125
It is...

91
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
um...

92
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,250
I just want
you to know

93
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,583
I do not like shepherds
even a little.

94
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,416
Good!

95
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,791
I'm relieved to hear it!

96
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,375
Remember, Nora's
going to have to quit

97
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,666
working as a shepherd

98
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,708
whether this job
succeeds or not!

99
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,000
I have decided on
what I want!

peaches money can buy!

No! Lawrence and Holo!

[MERCHANT A] When we found them,
they were beyond recognition.

106
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:47,583

over one another.

Excuse me...

I think I'm okay now.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,291
[LIEBERT] While it
really is regrettable...

111
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,125
We must
remember we're alive

112
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,833
and we should
do our very best

113
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,875
to carry on
in their memory.

114

if you're prepared for this!

We are very near to them.

We've already caught up?

118
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,125
We have.

119
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,958
I can't see them!

120
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,958
Damn it...

121
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,500
There are at
least 20 people

122
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,375
and they appear
to be heavily armed.

123
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you serious?

124
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,875
It does not matter.
Leave it to me!

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,791
Once I jump over them,
I shall drop low.

126
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,791
I want you to
get off of me then.

00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,250
It wasn't me...

167
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,708
I swear... it wasn't me!

168
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,375
This wolf is a proxy sent
by the Almighty God, you know.

169
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,416
She is not going
to believe your lies.

170
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,250
[LIEBERT]
No! No! No! No!

171
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,708
The payment you demanded
was too much for us!

172
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,208
If we paid as much
as you wanted,

173
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,916
we wouldn't have
had any money left

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,541
after paying off
our own deb.!

175
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,416
It was Lemerio's idea!

176
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
It's not my fault!

177
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,750
You understand,
you're a merchant like me!

178
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,208
I'm nothing like you.

179
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,416
I hope you can excuse
all this commotion.

180
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,041
Oh... No problem.

181
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,458
By now I'm sure
you've realized

182
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,875
Lemerio Trading
has betrayed us.

183
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,083
I also heard them talking
about their plans to kill you.

184
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,833
I did think something seemed
strange but I never imagined...

185
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:34,333
[HOLO] Well, are we going to
run with the gold now or what?

186
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,916
I'm not really sure...

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If we don't smuggle
the gold to Lubinheigen

188
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
the exchange rate
for what Liebert purchased

189
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,875
is still worth
600 gold Lumiones.

190
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,250
If we simply
forget about Lemerio,

191
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,625
we could split it with
each other and live happily

192
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,583
without having
to work for a long time.

193
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,750
On the other hand,

194
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,416
if we didn't get
the funds from Lemerio

195
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,750
in the first place,

196
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,250
we wouldn't be in
the position to keep this gold.

197
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,291
If we run with
the money now, their company,

198
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,875
including all
of their employees,

199
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,708
will end up bankrupt
and out of business.

200
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,583
And then...

201
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,958
What then?

202
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,708
Holo!

203
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm just trying to make
sure that we can still

204
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,166
live with ourselves
at the end of the day!

205
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,833
If we get revenge on
them for betraying us,

206
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,333
there'll only be another
revenge waiting!

207
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,791
[HOLO]
I'll take care of it.

208
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,541
You can't tell me you're
going to kill everyone involved!

209
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,208
It won't feel good
to buy bread tomorrow

210
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,875
with money that's
been stained with blood.

211
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,083
You have to believe me,

212
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,000
there's more than
just one option here!

213
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,458
Now is our
opportunity to choose

214
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,333
the road that will
lead us into tomorrow!

215
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,791
Holo...

216
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,541
Don't act like
you don't care;

217
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,083
if it wasn't for you
I would have frozen to death.

218
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,666
And I appreciate you agreeing

219
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,458
to my request

220
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,750
Listen...

[HOLO]
Enough already!

00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,375
Do what you want!

223

I really do have the most
troublesome companion.

224
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,333
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,791
What? Oh that's fine.

00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,291
So tell me what you
think about this idea...

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,708
Tell me the truth,

229
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,041
The truth?

230
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,166
Yes, please.

231
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,125
I would like
to hear it from you.

232
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,333
What are you talking about?

233
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,833
Do not play dumb with me.

234
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,291
I know you are not quite
the saint you pretend to be.

235
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,375
I want you to be
the one to decide

236
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,125
whether or not we go ahead

237
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,000
and take this gold
into Lubinheigen.

238
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,666
And I won't mind
at all if you think

239
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,958
we should just
divide the 600 Lumiones.

240
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh...

241
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,125
But then, if we
take it in to town.

242
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,541
well... I could
turn it into 6,000.

243
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,208
6,000?!

244
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,500
Yes.

245
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,083
And with that
much we could

246
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,666
keep Lemerio Trading
from going under.

247
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,333
Since you seem to
know everything already,

248
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,458
I might as well tell you...

249
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,041
The amount of gold
was too little.

250
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,208
Really?

251
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,791
Yeah...

252
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,500
There's no way that bag
has 600 Lumiones in it...

253
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,833
There's 100 at best.

254
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,250
If we split it up,
and if you repaid your debt,

255
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,208
there wouldn't be any left.

256
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,375
So, unless we smuggle it,
we won't make any money.

257
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,750
Apparently they were starting
to get desperate...

258
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,500
The most they could come up
with was 100 Lumiones.

259
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,541
That's only a sixth
of what we asked for.

260
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,958
If they smuggled this,
it would increase to 1,000,

261
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,625
which would
barely get them by.

262
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,541
Then again, it's not
as if they would have had

263
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,166
to split the proceeds
with us had their plan worked.

264
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,458
Perhaps it was all
they could afford...

265
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,458
Either way, Lemerio Trading
knew they could not

266
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,541
pay us from
the very beginning.

267
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,041
Actually, I bet
it's the very reason

268
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,041
they decided to go along
with our little scheme.

269
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:27,083
Yes, I understand
it all now, however--

270
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,500
Don't tell me there's more.

271
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,791
It was not
necessary to speak

272
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,125
to that little girl
the way you did.

273
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,541
What... do you
think I overdid it?

274
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:41,666
You did not have to shoulder
the burden all alone.

275
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:49,666
There is more I would like
to say, but we are out of time.

276
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,833
Get on.

277
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,583
You do have to go
see Lemerio, correct?

278
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,916
You're going to come in
with me though, right?

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,208
I have no interest
in business dealings.

280
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,041
Are you angry with me?

281
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,708
If you don't hold on,
I will throw you off.

282

[LEMERIO]
What?! 500?!

283
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,958
[LAWRENCE]
That's right...

284
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,541
Once we succeed
with the smuggling...

285
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,791
Do you think
you would be able

286
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,583
to buy it from us
at 500 gold Lumiones?

287
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
N-No!

288
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,500
That's impossible!

289
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,958
There's no way we can afford
that in our current state!

290
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,958
I'm not talking cash here.

291
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,708
All you would have to do
is draw up a bond of debt

292
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,375
and then you would simply

293
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,791
pay installments
over the next 10 years.

294
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,916
Didn't you hear me,..
500 is too much!

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,333
Interesting...

296
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,291
You're someone who
founded a trading company

297
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,125
that can secure
a fairly lucrative

298

loading place in this town.

299

Seems to me
500 in 10 years

300
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,208
would be a small price
to pay for you.

Wait, what
are you doing?

Your man Liebert was
full of information.

303

I suppose you could run away

00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,666
with this insignificant
amount of money...

305
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,166
But it might be
in your best interest

306
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,083
to simply accept our demand
and rebuild your company.

Well, you can always

betraying an association

323
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,416
[LAWRENCE] It was
just a gold dealing...

324
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Although I can't
talk about it too loud...

325
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,791
For now, I'll buy this
for 30 Lumiones...

326
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,041
Once the deal goes through,

327
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,083
I'll go ahead and
give you another 100.

328
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,416
A hundred?!

329
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,291
It's extra for such
a joyous occasion!

330
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,583
Thank you, Jacob.

331
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,083
If I have that much,
I'll be able to repay

332
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,583
what I owe to people
when I go apologize to them.

333
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,750
[JACOB laughing]

334
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,541
Nah. I can't
believe it Lawrence,

335
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,416
you've turned out to be quite
an impressive peddler.

336
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,166
Now, once the
assessment is finished,

337
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,166
we'll drink until we drop!

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,458
Well, it's just
my companion...

339
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,125
She's waiting.

340
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,333
You are late.

341
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm sorry!

342
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,041
Now, did you have something
you wanted to ask me?

343
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,708
Two somethings.

344
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,125
Two somethings?

345
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,541
Firstly...

346
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,250
How much do you trust
that little shepherd girl?

347
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,083
It doesn't matter,
even if Nora ran with the gold

348
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,958
we'd be able to catch her.

349
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,583
I guess I don't
trust her to the extent

350
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,875
that I gave her
the gold with that in mind.

351
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,750
Well, that
is that, then.

352
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,125
What was your
other question?

353
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,458
I promise I'll answer
no matter what you ask.

354
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,458
Remember, I'm the one who
owes you now so please ask away.

355
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,166
I just wante...

356
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,208
I think I need
to get some air.

357
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,875
Do you... remember?

358
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,375
[HOLO] I have been
wondering...

359
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,083
Whose name did
you call when I faced

360
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,583
the dog and
the little shepherd girl?

361
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:31,166
I was so angry at the time,
I could not hear you.

362
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,958
However, I could
still see you though

363
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,125
so I know you must have called
at least one of our names.

364
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,916
That's what's been
weighing on your mind?

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,875
No, not really...

366
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,916
Like I said, I had just
been wondering about it.

367
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,708
I called your name, Holo.

368
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,333
Did you just lie to me?

369
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,166
Yeah, I kinda did...

370
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,000
To be honest, I don't
remember what I said.

371
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,541
On the other hand...

372
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,041
On the other hand?

373
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,125
Given the situation,
I'm almost positive

374
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,083
I would have
called out your name.

375
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't really
have any time to waste.

376
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,958
I imagine
I must've unconsciously

377
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,666
chosen to call your name.

378
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,250
Yes.

379
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,666
That makes sense because--

380
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,708
Lawrence, hold on!

381
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay. You may
finish explaining.

382
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:56,000
Well it's because...

383
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:02,583
It's because your name is
a little shorter than hers is.

384
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,333
On top of that, even if
I had said Nora quickly,

385
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,250
you'd know for sure, right?

386
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,083
I mean come on,
the name Holo

387
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,541
goes so fast in
that split second

388
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,250
you wouldn't have
heard me if you were angry.

389
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,083
So there,
don't you think

390
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,375
that's a pretty
good explanation?

391
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,708
Not one bit!

392
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,375
Are you seriously telling
me you only called my name

393
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,125
because it was
a little shorter?!

394
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,708
What upsets me
more than anything

395
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,541
is that you
actually think this way!

396
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,875
Idiot!

397
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh! I wish you just told me
you had called her name!

398
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,125
Moron!

399
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,291
What is wrong with you?

400
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,000
Try again.

401
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,916
But this is your last chance.

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,791
Lawrence, please
just say one name.

403
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,000
[clocktower ringing]

404
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,041
[HOLO and LAWRENCE
unable to hear each other]

405
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,833
[LAWRENCE] 
Holo.

406
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,875
Yeah I like that name
better after all.

407
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,250
Idiot.

408
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,291
[LAWRENCE chuckling]

409
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,041
[HOLO] Oh yes, well,
I should clear up

410
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,875
the false accusation for him.

411
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,250
[NORA]
Wha--?

412
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,041
Your companion was
never in love with me.

413
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,791
He just knew
what I was, that is all.

414
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:24,166
So you knew who she was then?

415
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,041
You have a very good partner.

416
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,916
Trust me, this one here is
more trouble than he is worth.

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,875
Oh really?

418
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:35,458
Well then, I wish the both
of you much happiness.
