[WOLVES growling]

2
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,250
[MERCHANT A] Right...

3
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,958
I heard quite a bit
of talk about it

4
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,208
on my way here
from Lubinheigen.

5
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,166
[MERCHANT B] Me too;
it's pretty scary stuff.

6
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,958
[MERCHANT C] Are you talking
about that new magician

7
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,666
who performs on
the outskirts of town?

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,166
Yeah, I've heard
about that guy too.

9
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,333
He summons wolves
to be his own personal puppets

10
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,291
and then orders them to
attack traveler after traveler

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,583
in order to gain
their lifeblood.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,458
Can't be...

13
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,041
Seriously, though,
you should be careful.

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,291
I heard a rumor
about those wolves

15
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,458
from a friend who works
at a church in Lubinheigen.

16
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,916
He told me a couple
of weeks ago

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,416
they attacked
an entire caravan!

18
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,083
Yeah, scary...
Very scary.

19
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,750
And since
I'm so scared

20
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,833
I should probably
drink more.

21
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,708
Sounds like a good
enough plan to me.

22
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,416
One can only hope this magician
is not actually a woman.

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,291
What? Why?

24
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,000
Because you are easily
tricked by women...

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,416
And you take painful
experiences very hard.

26
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,666
You've been drinking more

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,708
since you've found out
Chloe is working for Medio.

28
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,208
Hey! That's mine!

29
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,708
But, thankfully,
there are mostly

30
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
men lying to
you in this bar.

31
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,125
Lying about wolves or talking

32
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,750
about trading,
trading, trading.

33
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:42,208
I really do not understand
why you men are such fools.

34
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,250
Yeah, well...
Sorry about that.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,375
[HOLO]
This town is horrible!

36
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,708
Why do they close
the bars so early?!

37
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,708
Because this
town is managed

38
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,250
by the church city
of Lubinheigen.

39
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,458
At least they have bars;

40
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,875
it's better than nothing.

41
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,083
So this is a town which
is only interested in prayer?

42
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,625
Living life humbly
and worshipping God?

43
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,916
People here ramble on
so long about how valuable

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,291
the church's sermons
are you start to doze off.

45
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,291
It's almost their
way of greeting you.

46
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,541
I do not understand
what makes it so entertaining.

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,958
I'll tell you what,

48
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,416
as soon as I get
rid of this pepper,

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,458
I'll get a new load and
then we can go to Lubinheigen.

50
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,416
Is it a bigger
town than this one?

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,458
Yeah.

52
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,958
It's actually
bigger than Pazzio.

53
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,791
I'd say it's more
of a city than a town;

54
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,333
there are a lot of street
vendors and it's pretty lively.

55
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,916
Do you think
they have apples?

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,625
I'm not sure
about raw apples.

57
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,166
During this time of year

58
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,791
people start pickling
them to get ready for winter.

59
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,750
They pickle them?

60
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,625
Yeah but they
don't use salt.

61
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,291
Apples are pickled in honey.

62
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,833
[HOLO]
Oh...

63
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,041
Not just apples, either.

64
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,916
Honey pickled pears
are really good, too.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,375
And recently
I heard they started

66
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,916
pickling peaches that way.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,458
[HOLO]
Interesting.

68
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,958
[LAWRENCE]
You slice the peaches thin

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,125
and pile them into a barrel.

70
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,666
The higher grade
ones will even have

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,708
figs and almonds
between the peaches.

72
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,541
Once you pour a ton
of honey over that,

73
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,083
you add a little
ginger at the end

74
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,750
and pickle them
for about 2 months.

75
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,250
There is nothing
in this entire world

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
that compares to the
sweetness which hits you

77
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,375
as soon as you put
it in your mouth.

78
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,708
It's so sweet in
fact that the church

79
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,125
seriously considered
banning it.

80
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,291
You do realize
you're drooling

81
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
all over the place, right?

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,458
Hey! You are not
lying to me are you?

83
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,000
No No; it's not a lie
but it is mostly

84
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,000
just for rich
people and nobles.

85
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,500
So they're kind of difficult
to find in regular shops.

86
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,500
But what if we do
see them in a store?

87
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,625
What happens if
we find them in a store?!

88
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,041
I'll buy you some.
Calm down.

89
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,250
You swear it?

90
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,166
Yes, but I can't afford a lot.

91
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,041
But you still swore!
Remember it!

92
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,708
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
Good grief.

93
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,208
Good, let's go.

94
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,666
Come on. Move it already.

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,125
Hey! Where are we going?

96
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,291
We are going to the inn.

97
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,625
We are going to get the wagon

98
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,916
and head to whatever
trading where we will rouse

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the shop owner out of bed
and sell the pepper

100
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,250
for a high price
so we can leave

101
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,875
for Lubinheigen immediately.

102
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,166
No, we can't.
It's way too late.

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,500
What if the shops sell out?

104
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,208
We cannot afford to wait;
we have to go right now!

105
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,125
They probably won't
have sold any at all,

106
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,708
much less sold out of them.

107
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,875
I am not willing to risk it.

108
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,083
Peaches and honey,

109
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,041
I refuse to believe
it until I have seen it.

110
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,041
There's still no
guarantee they'll have them!

111
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,791
But...

112
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,041
I think I would
like the pears too.

113
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,541
Honestly, I wish
I could put into words

114
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,000
how touched we were
by the priest's sermon.

115
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,375
And for us to have heard
it that particular day,

116
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,291
it must have
been God's will.

117
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,541
His words gave us strength,

118
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,166
and we renewed
our determination

119
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,958
to live better lives

120
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,083
with those
words in our hearts.

121
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,791
Excuse me for rambling.

122
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,083
Now, shall we discuss
the business you had in mind?

123
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,291
Yes, and thank
you for seeing us.

124
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,958
So, what kind
of product do you have?

125
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,625
Oh, yes, this.

126
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,208
That's pepper, isn't it?

127
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,583
I'm surprised
you figured it out.

128
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,208
It wasn't hard...
I can smell it.

129
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,750
You must have a good nose.

130
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,291
No, not at all...

131
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,458
Just a trick I picked up in
my many years in the business.

132
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,875
By the way...

133
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,625
you didn't happen to bring
your scales today did you?

134
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,541
No I did not
bring my own scales.

135
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,583
But fortunately
I have my faith in God.

136
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,083
This is not
fortunate for me...

137
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,125
The demand for pepper
has been rising...

138
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,000
quite rapidly, in fact.

139
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,875
If you had come last week,
I could have gotten you

140
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,250
to knock the price
down considerably.

141
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,375
This is good timing
for me then.

142
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,416
It certainly is.

143
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,291
Now why don't we
get right down to it

144
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,833
and weigh the pepper?

145
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,125
Yes that would be great.

146
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,500
All right...

147
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,458
Let me grab my ink and paper
and we'll get started...

148
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,416
I'll be back in just a moment.

149
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,000
What's the matter?

150
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,458
I need something to drink.

151
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,916
Be patient.

152
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,000
Will water be okay?

153
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,166
If you'd prefer,
I have wine too.

154
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,791
Oh... May I have water, please?

155
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,583
Of course, let me
go get it for you.

156
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,541
The amount of pepper
is equal to 45 weights.

157
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
Where was this
pepper produced?

158
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,666
It was produced in Rampata.

159
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,583
It's a town in
the Leedon Kingdom.

160
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,250
Milone Trading
contracted the import.

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,708
From what I've heard,
Rampata is known

162
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,250
as one of the leading
producers of spices.

163
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,833
And there's no doubting
the authenticity

164
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,458
of this certificate.

165
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,625
So how about this.

166
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,416
I'll give you
one Lumione gold coin

167
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,833
for each weight here...

168
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,458
Does that sound good to you?

169
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,000
I guess it would
depend on how many

170
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,708
Lumione gold coins
we're talking about.

171
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,500
Do you mind if
I use Trenni silver coins

172
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,500
as the deliverable currency?

173
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,625
That's fine.

174
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,750
Using the Trenni
silver coins,

175
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,833
it's worth 32 and 5/6 coins.

176
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,958
Which is the most I can do.

177
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,208
32 and 5/6 coins it is.

178
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,291
Great. Thank you.

179
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,750
What's wrong?

180
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,458
I... feel dizzy.

181
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,625
Are you going
to be all right?

182
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,166
Y-Yes...

183
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,583
Are you feeling any better?

184
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,291
I am. Thank you very much.

185
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,791
I imagine you're tired
from your long journey.

186
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,833
I have some goat's milk that
might help calm your nerves.

187
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,041
Excuse me, sir?

188
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,916
These scales look strange.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,125
It is as if they
are leaning to one side.

190
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,250
Is it just me?

191
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,416
I do not suppose they
look unusual to you as well?

192
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
No, you must be mistaken.

193
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,291
They look fine to me.

194
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:05,708
Perhaps it is just me, then.

195
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,916
Holo are you okay?

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,041
Yes, but I am seeing
what cannot be possible.

197
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,208
It appears to me
as though I must have

198
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,500
been drinking wine
earlier instead of water.

199
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,791
Did you give me wine, sir?

200
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,416
No... I...

201
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,083
Have you ever
heard the saying that

202
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,625
"The livelier
and busier the bar is,

203
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,000
the less likely you are to
find the bar owner drinking?"

204
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,875
You see, being
the only sober person

205
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,833
is the key to a successful
business, am I right?

206
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,833
Well, it looks
like I must be drunk.

207
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,666
If you're lucky,
I'll probably forget

208
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,208
some of the things
I saw and heard here.

209
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,833
However, drunks often make

210
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,791
unreasonable demands,
don't they?

211
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,500
Wait, what do you mean?

212
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,125
I want the money here

213
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,625
as well as the profit
you were going to make.

214
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,083
While I'm at it...

215
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,541
I think you
should insist I buy

216
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,750
twice the worth of
this deal on credit.

217
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,958
I can't!

218
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,083
There's no way
I could do twice the worth!

219
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,000
How unfortunate.

220
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,125
And I think I'm
about to sober up, too.

221
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,041
Why don't we
talk about product?

222
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,833
Since this is a large
amount of money,

223
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,333
how about high-grade arms?

224
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,125
Weapons? But why?

225
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,458
Because they're
standard articles

226
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,041
that bring in a solid,
risk-free, profit.

227
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,125
On top of that,
if I'm dealing in weaponry

228
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,625
I'll be able to pay
you back right away,

229
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,458
isn't that nice of me?

230
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,708
You want... weapons.

231
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,666
I imagine there
must be trading companies

232
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,000
with whom you have good
relationships in Lubinheigen.

233
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,333
I can sell those to them

234
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,125
so you'll be
able to offset my credit.

235
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,083
Now how does
that sound to you?

236
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,416
Thank you very much.

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
Well then, could
you please arrange

238
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,208
the products right away?

239
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,375
We'd like to go
to Lubinheigen

240
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,833
as soon as possible.

241
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,416
Wait, we're not
finished here yet...

242
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,958
what about the assessment?

243
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll just leave
that to you...

244
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,208
After all I have
my faith in God don't I?

245
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,791
I feel sorry for him.

246
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,500
I have to say I am
impressed that you noticed it.

247
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,250
I know it's difficult
to look past

248
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,125
my brilliant tail,
brain, and looks,

249
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
but I also have
excellent ears and eyes.

250
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,041
I noticed it the very moment
I walked into this room.

251
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,500
Right.

252
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,125
Do not just say "right."

253
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,583
What is with
you all of the sudden?

254
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,500
When you are experienced,
you can be overly confident.

255
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,833
And such confidence
can prove fatal.

256
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,791
I thought you learned
this lesson from Chloe.

257
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,791
Yeah, I suppose I did.

258
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,208
Stop pouting!

259
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,041
You learned
something valuable!

260
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,291
Remember the lesson
not the disappointment.

261
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,541
Oil?

262
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,291
I hear it would be good
to take care of my tail...

263
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,958
Do you think you
could buy me some?

264
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
Pretty please?

265
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,958
The cost for the clothes
you are wearing,

266
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,000
the other clothes,
your comb.

267
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,916
Don't forget about your
traveling and food expenses

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,208
as well as the enormous amount
of money for your drinks.

269
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,666
Have you ever considered
adding these things up?

270
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,250
Were you not calculating
them on purpose

271
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,666
or can you
really not add?

272
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,708
Yes, of course, I can
at least do addition.

273
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,375
I am good at
subtracting things also.

274
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,791
Then why don't
you try adding together

275
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,666
all of my money
you've spent?

276
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,875
If you're such a wise wolf,

277
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,500
you'll know how I feel
about this oil of yours.

278
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,750
Yes. I do know
how you feel.

279
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:45,583
You are dying
to buy it for me!

280
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,458
The wise wolf,
whose pride is her wisdom,

281
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,708
isn't so sharp as drunk.

282
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,833
Hey, hey.

283
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,375
I am not drunk...

284
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,500
What are you doing?

285
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,041
Oh please,
I'm merely jEst.

286
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
I'm sure...

287
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,875
I believe you might be
underestimating me a little.

288
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,750
Or do you think
I did not notice

289
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,875
you made an
unimaginably large profit

290
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,708
by ruthlessly
taking advantage

291
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,583
of that poor shop owner?

292
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,791
So, will you please
buy some oil for me?

293
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,208
Focus.

294
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,166
How much debt do you really
think you have with me, huh?

295
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,916
It's 140 coins...

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,375
Do you even realize
what that means for me?

297
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,291
I just can't afford
unnecessary things.

298
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,666
Really?

299
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,250
You cannot do anything

300
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,416
because I have
not repaid my debt?

301
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,958
I think I've
made myself clear.

302
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,041
I did not know
this whole time

303
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,750
that was all you
were thinking about.

304
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,666
Wait. What
do you mean?

305
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,875
Well...

306
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,833
Once I repay my debt
I shall be free...

307
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,625
I will try to pay
it back quickly.

308
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,916
Perhaps I will...

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,041
And once I do,

310
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,166
I shall return to
the north all by myself.

311
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,041
Yes, I am accustomed
to being alone anyway.

312
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,291
You know we never did set
a deadline for repayment.

313
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,083
If you pay me back
by the time we get

314
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,625
to the north
that should be fine.

315
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,458
Are you happy now?

316
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,500
I am sure I will be able
to pay you back by then

317
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,125
so it no longer
has to be an issue.

318
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,333
I want you
to know that I do plan

319
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,333
on repaying every coin with
interest added, all right?

320
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,000
Let me put it this way,
the more money you lend to me

321
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,166
the bigger your profit
will be in the end, see?

322
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,333
Can I, then?

323
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,416
You mean oil?

324
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,958
You can add it to my tab.

325
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,333
Please can I have some?

326
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,166
All right then
we have a deal.

327
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,666
Thank you.

328
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,500
[HOLO yawning]

329
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,375
[HOLO] What a perfect
day for grooming!

330
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,000
Correct me if I am wrong,

331
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,916
but did you not knock
the price down quite a bit?

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,708
[LAWRENCE] Do you
honestly want to know?

333
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,500
It would not be fair
to squeeze so much money

334
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,375
out of a peddler who is not
doing very well, would it?

335
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,541
Weapons always sell
the best in Lubinheigen,

336
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,583
but there are also
a lot of merchants

337
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
who try to sell them there.

338
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,916
Because of that,
the profitability goes down,

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,541
so it won't be that much

340
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,166
even if I did get
them for a good rate.

341
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,500
Why did you want them

342
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,500
if you are not going
to make a big profit?

343
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,416
Holo, don't worry.

344
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I'll have enough
money to buy you oil.

345
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,166
That makes me happy.

346
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,708
Using that line
of thought though,

347
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,583
I think spices are
always a pretty good option.

348
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,833
Did you eat them?

349
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,208
Don't confuse me with you,

350
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,958
I'm talking
about profit here.

351
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,458
Well, if that is the case

352
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,833
why do you not
get more spices then?

353
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,666
The prices in Lubinheigen
aren't much different

354
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,291
from the ones in Poroson.

355
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,208
Plus there will be
a loss due to the tariff.

356
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,458
Then you should
probably give up.

357
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,416
If I can make a profit

358
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,583
at the same level
as the spices or higher,

359
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,375
I'll be able to open
up a shop in no time.

360
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,083
But would
different goods

361
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,083
not have been
better investments?

362
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,916
Are gold and jewelry
not standard articles

363
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,166
for this practice?

364
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,125
You would think so,

365
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,708
but not even
products like that

366
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,833
are profitable in Lubinheigen.

367
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Why not?

368
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,666
Because their tariff
is too high.

369
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,333
With the exception of
a few select merchants,

370
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,208
they charge an enormous
tax on any imported gold.

371
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,750
And I am not one
of those merchants

372
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,125
so I'd never be able
to turn a profit there.

373
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,583
But why do they
selectively choose

374
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,375
which merchants
they will tax?

375
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,000
Those few merchants
are conspiring

376
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,708
with people in the church.

377
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,375
In that city if you bring
gold to the church first

378
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,916
they will carve a holy seal
into it for you.

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,375
Once the gold becomes
something blessed,

380
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,458
it'll fetch
an absurdly high price.

381
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,375
And the church
will naturally receive

382
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,791
a large donation in return.

383
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,000
What a cozy
relationship they have.

384
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
It's no surprise
their policy

385
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,750
is to severely
punish all smugglers.

386
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,750
No, of course not.

387
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
If you smuggle it
you can probably sell it

388
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,375
for twice as much but
the risk is unbelievably high.

389
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,416
So high that no one
really can even afford

390
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,708
to think about doing it.

391
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,500
If it is just
gold can you not hide

392
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,041
it and bring it in?

393
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,750
No, they
inspect everything.

394
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,208
What would happen if you were
to get caught smuggling?

395
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,250
At the very least your dominant
arm would be chopped off.

396
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:30,708
If you ask me
it's just not worth it.

397
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,083
Well thankfully your
business is going pretty well

398
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,791
so I suppose you can keep
earning money steadily then.

399
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,625
You are exactly
right but unfortunately

400
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,375
someone on this cart

401
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,291
prefers to waste that
steadily made profit.

402
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,875
[CARAVAN LEADER] You should
be very careful on your way.

403
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:02,833
He said that mercenary troops
are here from the north.

404
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,500
Mercenary troops?

405
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Yeah.

406
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,000
If this is the case,
then it is suicidal

407
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,041
to continue on this road,
is it not?

408
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,416
Definitely.

409
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,750
They find their prey faster
than eagles in the sky

410
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,375
and steal anything
with even the smallest value,

411
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,541
even the leaf from a turnip.

412
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,208
They have long spears as well.

413
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,750
I remember even I had
troubles dealing with them.

414
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,458
Another thing
that worries me

415
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,875
is the fact they took the
trouble to move farther south.

416
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,291
Just like merchants
they'll only move

417
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,333
if they can gain something.

418
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,833
But, we won't
accomplish much

419
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,750
by worrying about it,
will we?

420
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,416
We can just take the
new detour instead.

421
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,583
Wait, Holo,
you're not scared

422
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,791
of that pagan
magician are you?

423
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,375
I've also heard
there's a pack of wolves

424
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,041
around this detour.

425
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,458
They're easier to deal
with than humans.

426
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,333
Well we can at least
understand each other.

427
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,375
Then, I'll leave that
particular negotiation to you.

428
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,291
There is really
no one around here, huh?

429
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,250
Yes but remember rumors
are there for a reason.

430
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,333
This is boring...

431
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,875
I think I will take a nap.

432
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,000
If you're asleep...

433
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,666
can you still tell
if wolves are near?

434
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,833
Yes I can still sense them.

435
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,166
If we end up surrounded
I'll be mad at you.

436
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,916
Oh, you are ever the worrier.

437
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,375
Normally animals
do not differ that much

438
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,791
whether asleep or awake.

439
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:32,958
It is only humans

440
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,250
who are left
vulnerable while sleeping.

441
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,666
That all sounds well and good

442
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
until you start
snoring again.

443
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,916
What are you saying?
I do not snore!

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Don't be so sensitive
it's not that loud.

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,791
Because I do not snore!

446
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,875
Okay, okay!

447
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,125
You dare say I snore?

448
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,958
Calm down already,
I said okay.

449
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,875
What do you hear?

450
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,208
Nothing.

451
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,125
But I'll leave
the negotiation ahead to you.

452
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:04,458
Something ahead of us?

453
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,291
The kind of human
I hate more than anything.

454
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,750
Are you talking
about the magician?

455
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:35,291
Sheep?

456
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:39,083
Is the shepherd
the magician?

457
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,541
What are you
doing that for?

458
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,416
It's the ceremony for whenever
one meets a shepherd.

459
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,041
And I think it's
fairly safe to say

460
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,958
that man is
not the magician.

461
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,875
I am Lawrence,
a travelling peddler.

462
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:05,625
And this is Holo;
she is my companion.

463
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,541
May I ask you, the shepherd
whom we were able to meet

464
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,791
due to providence,
to pray for our safety

465
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,541
during this journey?

466
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,208
[NORA] I'd be happy to.

467
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,250
Next episode:
Wolf and the Shepherd's Lamb.
