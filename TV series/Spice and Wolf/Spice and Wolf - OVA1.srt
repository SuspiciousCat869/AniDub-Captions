[LAWRENCE]
I hate to repeat myself,

2
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,333
but I can't help to think
our running into each other

3
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,875
must have been
divine intervention.

4
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,708
If it hadn't been
for you, Nora,

5
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,000
I wouldn't be wearing this
tipsy smile at the moment,

6
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,833
so thank you,
I appreciate it.

7
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,125
You're welcome,
Lawrence.

8
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,958
And I'm also very
grateful to you.

9
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,208
I'm so glad
we got to meet.

10
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,000
Me too.
But, really, I should...

11
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,000
No, I should...

12
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,083
You shouldn't.

13
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,333
I was the one
who asked you to help

14
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,416
me out with that crazy
gold smuggling business.

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
And to be
perfectly honest,

16
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm still kind of
shocked you actually

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,500
went through
with the whole thing.

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,875
I am too.

19
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,416
I never even imagined
I could do something like that.

20
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,291
It's funny...
I am strange, aren't I?

21
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,083
 I had been
thinking I would have

22
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,291
to do something
radical one day.

23
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,208
I always knew I could
not be dependent

24
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,125
on the church forever.

25
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,666
You helped me break
away from them,

26
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,166
and that is why
I'm so thankful.

27
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,166
I'm not as great
as you think I am.

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,333
Merchants have a tendency
to be egotistical.

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,791
So do shepherds,
for that matter.

30
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,833
It's true.

31
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,500
[LAWRENCE] You are drinking,
aren't you, Holo?

32
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,083
Your presence does not
mean I cannot drink alone.

33
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,125
[NORA] I do wish you would
join us in our conversation.

34
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,041
Hold on... Are you
already drunk?

35
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,333
Me?

36
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,291
A wise wolf who can
consume an entire lake?

37
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,708
'Tis impossible on
such a small amount.

38
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,083
All right.

39
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,541
It sounds like our friend

40
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,458
might just prefer
to be left alone.

41
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,333
After I drink
a bit more,

42
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,375
I shall join
your conversation.

43
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,291
So until that time...

44
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,375
[NORA] Of course.
We'll wait.

45
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,250
[LAWRENCE] Now, what were
we talking about?

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,041
The food is here!

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,416
[NORA] Wow.
It looks so good!

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,958
Thank you very much.

49
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,375
Do you want
some too, Holo?

50
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,833
You said you would
leave me alone,

51
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,625
and that is
all that I want.

52
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,375
Right. So sorry.
Where were we?

53
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,625
Let me see, I think
we were debating

54
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,208
who was more thankful.

55
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,250
Right, but what
was before that?

56
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,166
Oh! Yes, it was about
sheep and rock salt.

57
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,125
Ah, of course, that's it!

58
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,875
Now then, I had
no idea that sheep

59
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,708
could find rock salt.

60
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,166
Yes. It's rather surprising

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,958
how much they
enjoy it, actually...

62
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,625
For example, if you
rub salt lightly on a rock,

63
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,666
they will
continue to lick it

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,916
well after the salt is gone.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,875
Then I wonder if
that old story is true.

66
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,208
What story do you mean?

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,041
I've heard there's
a town east of here

68
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,750
that uses a particular type
of torture involving sheep.

69
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,125
I never imagined it
could be true before now.

70
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,750
Torture involving sheep?

71
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,250
Yes, it's pretty funny,
believe it or not.

72
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,583
Basically, what they do
is tie up their criminals

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,958
and rub a bunch of salt
on the bottoms of their feet.

74
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,000
Rub salt on their feet?

75
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,208
That man will never
cease being an idiot.

76
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,458
Oh, excuse me...

77
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,708
What happened after they
rubbed them with salt?

78
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,041
Well wouldn't the sheep
lick the salt off?

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,333
They would.

80
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,958
They say at first,
the criminals laugh

81
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,541
uncontrollably because
they're being tickled.

[CRIMINALS laughing]

No, stop, no,
please don't, no, no no.

84
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,791
Yes, it is very unusual.

85
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,375
Especially when
you take into account

86
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,166
the sheep won't
stop licking once

87
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,416
they taste the salt on
the criminal's guilty feet.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,875
What do you
think happens then?

89
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,791
Gee, I don't really know.

90
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,791
The criminal would be
reformed through laughter

91
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,166
and spread nothing but joy
to all of those around him.

92
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,625
They lived
happily ever after.

93
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,750
Is that story true?

94
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,708
I might have just
made up that last part.

95
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,000
You're so silly.

96
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,291
The first part of it
was true, though.

97
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,750
I mean, who knows what must

98
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,333
go on in the minds of sheep?

99
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,458
Well, now that
you mention it,

100
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,916
whenever I eat dried meat,

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,708
I usually get salt
all over my hands.

102
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,125
They're very good sheep,
but how do I put this...

103
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,291
They get too
carried away sometimes.

104
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,250
It can be frightening.

105
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,875
Luckily, you have
an obedient knight

113

Which I'm sure
is completely due

114
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,333
to you being such
an exceptional shepherd.

hundreds of years
until recently.

127
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,291
The days passed by peacefully.

128

different from today.

129

And, tomorrow
was no different

130
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,208
from the day after that.

131
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,125
Time seemed only to move
forward a few times a year.

132
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,000
There was the annual
harvest festival,

133
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,166
the 2 sowing festivals,

134
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,750
the festival
to pray for no rain,

135
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,041
and the festival
to pray for no wind.

136
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,666
The remaining time
was a cluster of boredom.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,250
Ordinary day after ordinary
day with no celebrations.

138
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,916
Once, I even watched a tiny
sapling grow into a huge tree.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,416
Compared to that,
while travelling,

140
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
every day is
a new experience.

141

I feel reborn each morning.

142
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,583
The time spent with
my travelling peddler

143
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,541
has only been
a few short months,

144
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
but it has been
the equivalent

145
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,916
of several decades.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
We would have a clamorous
argument in the morning

147
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,666
but reconcile by
lunch where I would

from my mouth.

150
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,666
We would have yet another
fight over dinner at dusk

151
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,250
and quietly discuss
the following day's

152

affairs in the evening.

153

living with others.

155
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,458
However, I cannot seem

156
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,541
to remember them
for some reason.

157
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,125
I suppose I am too busy

158

was doing yesterday.

be like tomorrow.

exhausted and
thinking of home.

163
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,500
But now, each day is
so full and wonderful...

164
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,375
I do not find myself
feeling sad any longer.

165
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,083
I cannot even pretend
I am not having a good time.

166
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
In fact, I am
rather concerned

167
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,916
I might be
having too much fun.

168
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,500
Heavy... Why am I at the inn?

169
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,541
Sorry.

170
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,416
No. That cannot
have happened.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,166
No. It was just a nightmare.

172
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,333
I refuse to believe it!

173
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,833
I wonder why I...

174
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,833
Of course, I was
thrown off guard.

175
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:24,916
It was his stupid face.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,625
When I do not like things,
I get angry.

177
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,416
I laugh when
they are funny.

178
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,958
To show him
that side of me

179
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,208
is unbecoming
of the wise wolf.

180
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,541
How can I live with myself

181
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,458
for behaving in such
a ridiculous manner?

182
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,791
This is my preferred form.

183
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,500
I can swiftly respond
to enemies' attacks

184
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,583
when I am as a wolf.

185
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,833
[HOLO laughing]

186
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,750
He cannot help but
expose himself as a fool.

187
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,833
He is as if a silly cat.

188
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,666
Perhaps I should
be defenseless

189
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,291
and insensitive like him

190
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,625
in order to survive in
this obtuse human world.

191
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,833
Why is he not here?

192
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,375
To think, he is not at my side

193
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,750
at a critical time
such as this... useless.

194
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,291
[footsteps]

195
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,375
[gasps]

196
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,583
Why am I reacting this way?

197
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,625
[knocking]

198
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,750
Finally, you have
come back to me.

199
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,333
Why didn't you tell me

200
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,500
that you weren't
feeling well?

201
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,875
Um, well I...

202
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,208
You're not a child.

203
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,458
Don't tell me you didn't
notice until you fainted.

204
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,041
Thank god we were here.

205
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,750
What would we have done

206
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,291
if this happened to you
while we were travelling?

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,875
I know you may find
it hard to understand,

208
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,333
but if you fall
sick in a forest

209
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,583
or wasteland,
you could die.

210
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,708
You scared the hell
out of me, you know.

211
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,083
I am sorry.

212
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,791
How are you feeling now?
Any better?

213
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,125
I am fine.

214
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,375
I believe the exhaustion
has caught up with me.

215
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,500
So...

216
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,500
It's not a special
disease or anything?

217
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,916
Do not worry.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,125
Oh, good... Thank God.

219
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,166
I feel like
I can breathe now.

220
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,958
You are good
at overreacting.

221
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,458
Yeah, thanks...

222
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,833
I guess once I started
thinking about everything

223
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,708
and what might have
caused you to be sick,

224
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,625
I, thought... never mind.

225
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,916
Tell me.
You thought what?

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,916
I... I thought it might be
because I gave you those onions.

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,666
I am not a dog, you know.

228
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
Yeah, I know.

229
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,041
You're Holo the Wise Wolf.

230
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,875
It is a shame I did not
get the chance to enjoy

231
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,708
the food and alcohol
from the festival, though.

232
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,333
Did you forget
I'm a merchant?

233
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,291
I'm on top of it,
I asked them

234
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,500
to wrap up
the leftovers for you.

235
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,916
Did you really?

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,416
Yes, I did.
Do you want them now?

237
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,708
Of course!

238
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,625
I knew you'd say that;
let me check...

239
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,666
Feels like you
still have a fever.

240
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,583
You were exhausted,
weren't you?

241
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:21,125
It is all your fault.

242
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,250
What?!

243
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,875
Your fingers are hard,
like a wolf's nose,

244
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,708
and it is very
confusing for me.

245
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,333
When wolves rub
their noses together,

246
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,333
to humans
that would mean...

247
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,458
I cannot say it.

248
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,916
Why not?
What's wrong?

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,041
Nothing is wrong!
Forget it!

250
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:44,875
Well, anyway, you're going
to have to wait on your food.

251
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,583
Try and get some rest.

252
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,333
Lawrence!

253
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,791
You are so warm.

254
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,250
[knocking]

255
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,041
Holo, are you up?

256
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,791
Can you not see me?

257
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,041
How are you feeling?

258
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,083
Can you not see me?

259
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,458
No, I cannot.
Now I can tell...

260
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,583
You look as pale as a spoiled
princess from a rich family.

261
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,458
Thank you. I am hungry.

262
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, there's a bit
of good news...

263
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,541
I'll see if I can get
you porridge or something.

264
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,291
I am thirsty as well...
Did you bring me water?

265
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,666
No. Since you had
a fever last night,

266
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,291
I got you hard cider.

267
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,916
Are you serious?!

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,375
Um, Holo?
Hey, are you okay?

269
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,250
If only you were
half as quiet normally

270
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,750
as you are now.

271
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,625
You would get upset
if I never spoke,

272
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,541
sleeping in
the cart all day.

273
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,208
Well, it wouldn't be fair if
I were the only one awake.

274
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,875
If I did not speak up,
you would take advantage

275
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,416
and eat more than
me during meals.

276
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,916
I'm a good deal
bigger than you.

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,166
That's just natural.

278
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,208
So in order to compete,

279
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,166
shall I pretend to
be bigger than you?

280
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,958
What's wrong?

281
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,916
It tastes odd.

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,250
Right.
I diluted it some.

283
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,458
You did what?!

284
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,125
I thought my nose had
decided to stop working.

285
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,833
Diluted hard cider,
is good for a fever.

286
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,208
What?

287
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,750
Oh, come on...

288
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,416
You really
didn't know that?

289
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,791
I am Holo the Wise Wolf...

290
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,583
I know there are things
in this world I do not know,

291
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,583
and that makes me wise.

292
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,083
Sickness happens
when the balance

293
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,833
inside your body
breaks down.

294
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,125
It's like the ebb
and flow of the tide.

295
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
And when an imbalance occurs,

296
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,833
you can cure it
by simply adjusting

297
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,208
the balance between
the four humours.

298
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,666
Did you just say humours?

299
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,958
Correct!

300
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,083
There's hot,
there's cold,

301
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,291
there's dry,
and there's moisture.

302
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,708
If you say so.

303
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,333
All of these can
be adjusted with food.

304
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,875
Since you come
down with a fever,

305
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,375
you'd want to make sure
and eat something cold.

306
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,833
Cold like... apples!

307
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,583
I would thoroughly
enjoy eating a raw apple.

308
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,416
No, that won't work.

309
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,125
Apples are cold,
but they're also dry.

310
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,291
When you're
not feeling well,

311
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,500
you're actually dry,

312
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,000
so you need to
consume moisture

313
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,875
to balance yourself out.

314
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,333
The best source would be
to have something to drink.

315
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,416
Usually, if you
drink alcohol,

316
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,583
you'll feel better.

317
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,291
But, strong
alcohol is hot,

318
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,875
so we need to
lighten it up a bit.

319
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,958
So, what am
I allowed to eat

320
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,791
in order to be
balanced, then?

321
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:57,333
Well, if you have a fever
from accumulated fatigue

322
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,541
you need to cool
yourself down first.

323
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,500
Your body is
probably dehydrated,

324
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,875
so you need
to rehydrate it.

325
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,000
However, moisture
has a cooling effect,

326
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,500
and if you get too cold

327
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,208
You become gloomy...
It's true...

328
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,041
Now, knowing all this,
what would you say

329
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,625
to wheat porridge
cooked in sheep's milk

330
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,625
with apple pieces
and goat cheese on top?

331
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,958
That sounds delicious!
Yes! I want that!

332
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,583
Are you sure?

333
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,791
You seem completely
recovered right now.

334
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,875
I am dizzy.

335
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,500
Will you please hurry up?

336
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,375
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

337
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,208
Do not forget
the goat cheese!

338
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,208
Lawrence!

339
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,833
[knocking]

340
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,750
Can you get up yet?

341
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,625
I cannot.

342
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,708
If I ever get sick,
I expect you to take

343
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,875
really good care
of me in return, deal?

344
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,291
Sure, I hope you will not
mind the Yoitz approach.

345
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,416
I can't promise anything.

346
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,666
Do not worry, I have
a very sensitive nose

347
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,500
and I would do
something about it

348
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,750
long before
you got like this.

349
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,291
Yeah, I am sorry
I didn't notice earlier.

350
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,166
But, for future reference,

351
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,000
I would like
for you to tell me.

352
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,375
I guess I'm just slow.

353
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,541
I can't really help it.

354
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,833
I believe that it would take
a while for you to realize

355
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,541
I was ill even if
I were on my deathbed.

356
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,875
What?

357
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,291
Forget I said anything.

358
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,750
Where is my food?!

359
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,666
If you can eat this,
you'll be fine.

360
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,083
Just give yourself
another day or so.

361
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,583
Ahh... Okay.

362
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,208
Once we leave this town,

363
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:19,333
we'll be back on
the wagon for a while.

364
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,666
I am sorry.

365
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,875
Don't be.
Focus on getting better.

366
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,208
I gave up on travelling

367
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,666
with any urgency
once I picked you up.

368
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,250
And remember, they say

369
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
after a big storm
comes the calm.

370
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,458
I gained back my reputation,
and things already seem

371
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,916
a whole lot better
than they were before.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,250
When I think about it,

373
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,666
the prospect of staying

374
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,208
a few more days
could be a good thing.

375
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,666
I actually wouldn't mind

376
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,666
doing a little exploring
while we're here.

377
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,833
Please wait!
'Tis just...

378
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,875
The inn is...
it is far too quiet.

379
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,791
I suppose it is.

380
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,208
At any rate, it's probably
time we had a discussion

381
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,041
about what to
have for dinner

382
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,958
due to a certain
glutton I know.

383
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,750
Oh, that is
a good idea!

384
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,416
So have you
given any thought

385
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,833
to what you
might want to eat?

386
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,208
Although I'd like to
stay and keep you company,

387
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,666
I won't be able
to make you anything

388
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,750
if I don't get to the market
before it closes.

389
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,375
Keep in mind,
you need to stay

390
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,000
away from the heavy stuff.

391
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,458
Meat?

392
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,791
No. It has to
be either porridge

393
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,333
or soup with
bread dipped in it.

394
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,958
Then I want the dish
I ate earlier...

395
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,208
Sheep's milk, yes?

396
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,541
The flavor and the sweet
scent were so wonderful.

397
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,125
I would like that.

398
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,750
Ah, you want
sheep's milk again?

399
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,041
Is there a problem?

400
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,625
It goes bad quickly,

401
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,458
so the price of decent milk
goes up in the afternoon.

402
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,916
You want it to be
fresh, don't you?

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,291
I do!

404
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,708
All right.

405
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,041
I'll see if Nora
can find some.

406
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
She isn't a shepherd
for nothing.

407
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:43,791
She's really good
at finding a-- Uhh...

408
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,083
Um...

409
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,250
If we ask Nora,

410
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,625
we'll be able to get
you some good milk.

411
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,166
Or you could use
the power of money,

412
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,000
and then you would not need
her precious help at all.

413
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,541
Yes...

414
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,000
You might be right
about that, but still.

415
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,875
But still what?!

416
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:02,958
Can I ask why you insist
on hating Nora so much?

417
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
What...? What did you say?

418
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,041
I'm just wondering.

419
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,708
I mean, obviously
something happened

420
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,583
between you and shepherds.

421
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,500
I understand you don't like
her because you're a wolf.

422
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,125
But you don't
have to be so openly

423
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,875
hostile towards her,
do you?

424
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,041
There's an exception
to every rule.

425
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,416
I wish you could see
how kind she really is.

426
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,250
You know, I...

427
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,708
What is it?

428
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,333
Okay, fine, I am sorry.

429
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,041
So you'll
give her a chance?

430
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,416
Ugh, how shall I put this...

431
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,750
Whatever...

432
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,291
You cannot help
how you are.

433
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,333
I expect the milk
to be good.

434
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,125
Nora just wanted to
see how you were doing.

435
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,166
Are you feeling
any better now?

436
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,833
I am suffering from
a little bit of fatigue.

437
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,083
That is all.

438
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,250
However, I would like
to talk with someone.

439
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,333
I am curious; may I ask
you something, Nora?

440
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,250
What? Oh, sure.

441
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,333
I just hope I know
the right answer for you.

442
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,250
What do you think

443
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,916
is the greatest
trick to leading sheep?

444
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,875
I would say that
it's having a big heart.

445
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,416
It's getting windy
out there, huh?

446
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,541
I believe you are right.

447
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,083
Sheep are often convinced

448
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,750
they are too clever
for their own good.

449
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,791
Are you ladies
getting along?

450
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,333
Um... of course.

451
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,000
We are sharing
a little secret.

452
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,208
Really?

453
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,208
Next episode:
Wolf and the Inadvertent Rift
