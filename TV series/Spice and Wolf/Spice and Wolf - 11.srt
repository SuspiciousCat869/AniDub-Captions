1
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,875
[SHOP OWNER] I said no!
Now get out!

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:19,208
Please help; I'll take
anything you can give me!

3
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,333
Thank you for your kindness.

4
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,666
[INN OWNER]
Well you're back early.

5
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,250
I'm sorry.

6
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,125
Holo... I...

7
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,041
I could only manage
3 Lumiones on my own.

8
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,333
I'm 44 Lumiones short,

9
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,500
but there's not much
I can do about it now.

10
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,166
I thought maybe
I could gamble with it

11
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,750
and see what happened,

12
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,458
but you'd probably have
better luck than I would.

13
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,166
I suppose at this point

14
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,916
it doesn't make
a difference, though.

15
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,333
I can afford to risk it.

16
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,833
I'm sure that adding
3 Lumiones back to my debt

17
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:53,291
probably can't hurt
me anymore, right?

18
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,083
You idiot!

19
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
Get back up here already!

20
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,041
[INN OWNER] Will you
make a decision please?

21
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,541
Sorry... uh...

22
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,458
I dropped this bag out
of the window up there.

23
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,791
Yeah right. I'm sure you did.

24
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,750
You are an idiot!

25
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,708
Stop saying sorry!

27
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,791
Do you know
what you're sorry for?

28
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,666
What would you do if I had
run off with all your money?

29
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,500
I think that I would've
been okay with it...

30
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,125
After all, I won't be able
to help you anymore anyway.

31
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,291
Perhaps you
could use it to travel.

32
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,583
Use it to travel?

33
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,625
Why can't you just
be angry with me?

34
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,541
It's all my fault!
Correct? It's my fault.

35
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,125
Otherwise I know they
would have helped you!

36
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:35,083
This is all my fault!

37
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not angry with you,

38
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,375
because you only
came along to help...

39
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,708
I could never blame
you for that--

40
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,250
Again, you are an idiot!

41
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:52,666
Holo!

42
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,625
You are terribly good-natured.

43
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,708
What do you mean?

44
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,000
You are wrong about me!

45
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,000
I went with you out
of my own selfishness.

46
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,416
It backfired, so you could
be angry about it if you want.

47
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,458
But, instead,
you apologize to me

48
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,416
for simply brushing
up against my hand.

49
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,625
You should
not feel sorry.

50
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,833
But I do feel sorry...

51
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,166
I thought I had
done something

52
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,875
that I could
never take back.

53
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,875
I thought you would never
be able to forgive me.

54
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,125
I will do all that I can
to make things right again.

55
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:32,125
But, I realize it
still may never be enough.

56
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,291
Lawrence?

57
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,583
Will you answer
something for me?

58
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,541
Why is it that you
have such a good nature?

59
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,333
I just cannot
understand it.

60
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,583
My personality?
I don't know.

61
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,250
You really are rather dense.

62
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,333
Did you just tell me
your personality?

63
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,166
An imbecile would
have charmed me

64
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,791
and said I was
special or something.

65
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,541
Even if it was a lie!

66
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,916
Okay I'm sorry!

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,250
I'm confused about
what you want, though.

68
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
There are times you
want to hear something.

69
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,416
It does not matter
if it is a lie or not

70
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,625
but you will eventually want
to hit a person in his face

71
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,041
if he takes too
long to say it!

72
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,250
Guess where I stand?

73
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,375
Um the hitting?

74
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:25,166
Unbelievable. I simply
cannot believe you.

75
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,375
I am sure you find it
inappropriate to tell me

76
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,041
how you feel because
of our situation.

77
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,791
I'm appalled at
myself, actually.

78
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,041
I would still enjoy hearing
you say it to me though.

79
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,750
Shall we try it again?

80
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,791
Tell me...

81
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,875
Why is it you have
such a good nature?

82
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,500
Because you are
very special to me, Holo.

83
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,833
Oh my goodness,
what are we doing right now?

84
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,916
Wait, you're the one who
told me I had to tell you that.

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,916
Well, it was good
practice for you, was it not?

86
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,708
But you realize...

87
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,458
From now on you
should just try to upset me.

88
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,375
Although I do very much
appreciate your consideration.

89
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,791
Do you not agree that
we get so much more

90
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:43,083
accomplished faster
when we just argue about it.

91
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,583
Agreed, yes.

92
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,708
So how much exactly do you
have in this little leather bag?

93
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,125
I have 3 and 2/7 Lumiones.

94
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,833
Then there are still
43 and 5/7 left of the debt?

95
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,208
I have an idea,
do you want to hear it?

96
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,958
What idea?

97
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,583
Now do not get
your expectations up...

98
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,666
But I think it might work.

99
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
Seriously, what is it?

100
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,875
Well then...

101
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,000
This approach is
out of the ordinary...

102
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,750
Which means, what I
have in mind right now

103
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,958
they will
never see coming.

104
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,833
What is it?

105
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,791
[birds tweeting]

106
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,750
Do not worry.
I am right here.

107
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,125
Yeah.

108
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,291
You've already
obtained my money?

109
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,250
I heard you had something
important to discuss?

110
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,583
You really want me to
take that road this time?

111
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,416
[PRIEST] The road
is a bit rough, yes.

112
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,125
But I know
you can do it.

113
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,666
I have faith in God,
and I believe He

114
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,208
will protect you
again as He has before.

115
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,958
You're right.

116
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,750
But haven't you heard
about all the mercenaries

117
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,833
terrorizing and murdering
people along that route?

118
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,583
[PRIEST] Remember faith is
what keeps you eternally safe.

119
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,416
You must trust in
God to protect you.

120
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,125
I will.

121
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,791
You are indeed
quite an extraordinary

122
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,750
shepherd my Nora...

123
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,541
The Church and I
are proud of your steadfast

124
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,208
commitment to our lord.

125
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,708
Smuggling?

126
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,750
Are you serious?

127
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,208
Do I look like I'm joking?

128
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,583
How dare you waste my time.

129
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,875
I realize there have probably
been many people who've

130
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,083
tried a smuggling method
similar to this before.

131
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,416
And I'm sure
they were all caught.

132
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,791
At least you're
not completely ignorant.

133
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,541
Those on the verge
of bankruptcy

134
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,333
have a tendency
to misunderstand

135
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,250
a reckless plan
as a perfect one.

136
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,333
You must think
that I'm new at this.

137
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,833
But what if...

138
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,125
What if you could entrust
the gold smuggling

139
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,458
to a dependable
highly skilled person?

140
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,875
If the person
is that skilled,

141
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,125
he'd be making
enough money

142
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,458
without taking the trouble
to smuggle gold, wouldn't he?

143
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,375
Your theory is empty.

144
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,416
What would you say if
I told you I knew someone

145
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,208
who was very skilled but who
didn't make very much money?

146
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,750
I would say...

147
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,708
I don't believe
you in the least.

148
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,791
Who could that be?

149
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,750
Highly skilled and
currently working

150
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
in this town,
but poorly paid...

151
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,125
and even more importantly
they're in need of money.

152
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,250
What's more...

153
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,291
This person is,
shall we say,

154
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,916
dissatisfied with
their employer...

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,458
To say they're unhappy
would be an understatement.

156
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,958
Their employer is the church.

157
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,000
Now clearly, smuggling
gold is an action

158
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,625
that directly
opposes its rulings.

159
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,750
If we imply this is
not simply an opportunity

160
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,958
to make money but a
small yet calculated

161
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,416
revenge on the church,

162
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,875
this person will
definitely want to be involved.

163
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,541
And, trust me, there's virtually
no possibility of betrayal.

164
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,833
Once I tell you
who this person is

165
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:51,166
I think you'll understand their
position a little better.

166
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,583
If what you say is true,
why don't you carry out

167
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,500
this scheme on your own?

168
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,916
You must want
something from me

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,625
otherwise why
tell me your plans

170
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,333
knowing you will
have to share the profit.

171
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,916
Repayment of my
debt is due today...

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,375
As soon as
the sun goes down

173
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,041
I'll be arrested
by the trading house.

174
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:14,916
Unfortunately this is all the
money I have on me right now.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,583
I want you to accept
this as collateral.

176
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,000
You see...

177
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,500
I'd like you to hold off on
the collection of my debt...

178
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,041
and I also want you to provide
me with the necessary funds

179
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,500
to purchase the gold
we'll be smuggling.

180
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
Excuse me?

181
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,541
Do you believe now is
the best time to be hesitating?

182
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,000
What do you mean?

183
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,875
Holo?

184
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,333
Interesting...

185
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,791
I heard someone
taking off just now.

186
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,416
My ears are especially
sensitive...

187
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,375
I can even hear whispering...

188
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,166
For example, the people
downstairs

189
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,625
are planning a strategy
for running away.

190
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,666
Oh, another one left now...

191
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,291
As it stands I do not see
how this trading house

192
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,125
can last more than
a couple of days.

193
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,500
Please stop it!

194
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,000
So Lemerio, what
do you think?

195
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,208
I assume you have the
appropriate channels

196
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,750
we can use to sell
the smuggled gold

197
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,875
and you can trust me
with that knowledge

198
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,166
as well as my promise to make

199
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,875
the conditions of
the deal favorable to you.

200
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,875
I need an answer.

201
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,000
All right I'll do it...

202
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,333
You have a deal.

203
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,000
Good, may God overlook
us in this endeavor.

204
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,458
Get Liebert here, now.

205
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,375
[SUBORDINATE A] Yes sir.

206
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,041
I think now it must be
my turn, am I right?

207
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,833
I don't know what you mean.

208
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,000
You cannot possibly believe
a good-natured person

209
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,208
like you could deceive
that little girl.

210
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,916
There are actually a few
innocent people in this world

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,875
who simply like
good-natured men you know.

212
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,208
You think you
understand females so well...

213
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,458
You do not.

214
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,041
Listen to me, okay?

215
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,833
Come on, you cornered him...

216
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,916
Now, it's my turn.

217
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,250
I need to talk to her myself.

218
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,083
Remember, I'm the one
who was blinded by greed

219
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,000
and ended up getting
products whose value

220
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,458
had collapsed
in the market.

221
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,875
If I have you talk to her
just because I don't want to

222
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,708
then I'm pretty
much hopeless.

223
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,083
Oh well...

224
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,041
I was hoping I could
get you further and further

225
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,208
into debt with me,
then you would owe.

226
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,416
Whoa, yeah that
was close then.

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,291
[church bells chiming]

228
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,250
Hello, Nora!

229
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,333
Oh, Lawrence!

230
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,166
Hi Holo!

231
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,708
Well, who
would've guessed it!

232
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,083
We happened to run
in to you right here

233
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,416
in front of the church...

234
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,791
The only explanation has
to be divine intervention.

235
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,083
Even I won't fall
for that story.

236
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,541
Well...

237
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,583
I think that might be
because you've been drinking

238
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,333
too much holy
wine at communion.

239
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,208
I don't really
drink alcohol very much...

240
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,041
that includes the wine
as a sacrament too.

241
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,541
What's the the truth?

242
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,666
Right...

243
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,083
I came here to
request your service.

244
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,375
Really?!

245
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,666
Is that so?

246
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,500
We can't really talk
about it in the open

247
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,666
so why don't we go to
a street stall instead?

248
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,125
Okay.

249
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,041
Here's to our reunion!

250
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,625
Now then,
you told me this before

251
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,708
but can you really
go to Lamtra?

252
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,916
Yes, that's right.
I can go there.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,291
But can you go there
with sheep as well?

254
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,750
If there's not too
many of them I can.

255
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,708
All right then this
time I'm gonna ask you

256
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,125
to do something different...

257
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,791
Your pay... 20.

258
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,541
I'm not talking about
a worthless bond either.

259
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,541
I'll give you
20 gold Lumiones.

260
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,916
Watch it!

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,375
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,000
Um, did you say
20... Lumiones?

263
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,625
That's what I said...

264
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,000
But there is a risk
so the payment

265
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,500
will be contingent
upon our success.

266
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,125
If we fail
it'll be nothing.

267
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,416
I see.

268
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,166
What I'll need
you to do is walk

269
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,166
to Lamtra
with your sheep

270
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,166
and then just bring
them back safely,

271
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,666
that's basically what it is.

272
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,333
So, I'm not really
asking for anything

273
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,083
more than for you
to just be a good shepherd.

274
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,083
I imagine this job
must be very dangerous.

275
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,958
Otherwise you wouldn't
be paying me so much.

276
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,375
I won't deny that.

277
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,458
In fact because of it I
won't insist that you join me.

278
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,208
I want you to take a minute
and think about this.

279
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:35,000
The fee to join the Association
is 1 Lumione at the most, right?

280
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,208
If you have 20,
you can rent a house

281
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,000
and work without
having to worry

282
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,791
about your
immediate living expenses.

283
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,375
You'll probably be able to
purchase a trusteeship, too.

284
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,875
At that point, you
will be the proud

285
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,208
owner of
Nora's Clothing Store.

286
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,083
I'm wondering something...

287
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,708
Were you wanting to
join the tailors association

288
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,541
in this particular town?

289
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,791
No, actually I had
always planned

290
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,875
on moving
somewhere different.

291
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,750
I see...

292
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,291
But the size of this town
is at least appealing right?

293
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,458
Just think Nora...

294
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,375
It would be
difficult to move

295
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,625
to a town with
no contacts...

296
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
Then again, I guess you
wouldn't want anything

297
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,791
to do with the church in
this town if possible either.

298
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,458
No, you have it wrong.

299
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,625
Nora it seems to me
the church does not at all

300
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,250
appreciate the effort
you go through

301
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,375
to protect the sheep
they entrust you with.

302
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,833
In fact,
the better you are

303
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,208
the more they suspect you
of using pagan witchcraft.

304
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,458
You know that I'm correct.

305
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,291
As a test they
send you into areas

306
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,041
other shepherds
wouldn't go near...

307
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,666
And even though
you know it's not true

308
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,583
they tell you
the safe territories

309
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,291
all have been
claimed already.

310
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,916
I'm willing to
bet they'll keep

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,666
on sending you
into danger too.

312
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,458
until you're attacked.

313
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,125
They want you
to be attacked

314
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,791
by wolves or mercenaries
they don't care.

315
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,375
And they'll
keep sending you out

316
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,708
because they want
to prove you're a pagan.

317
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,208
I've seen it happen before.

318
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,750
If you ask me,

319
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,458
the church here is
worse than the devil!

320
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,041
We figured that we
could make a little money,

321
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,375
and then we can
leave this town.

322
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083
But only after we make
sure the church suffers!

323
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,250
You know we're the only
ones you can count on.

324
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,875
I really believe we can
help each other, Nora.

325
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,916
This is your way out.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,125
What do you think?

327
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,208
Tell me, what
are you planning?

328
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,166
We're going
to smuggle gold.

329
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,375
What...?

330
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,875
Smuggle gold?

331
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,500
I don't understand.

332
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,541
What do you
think I can do?

333
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,375
You can help
us pass through

334
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,916
this town's
strict inspection

335
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,958
because the gold will be hidden
within your sheep's bellies.

336
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,583
Can I...

337
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,708
Would you mind
telling me the whole plan?

338
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,375
In any town
influenced by the church,

339
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,083
gold fetches
an exorbitant price.

340
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,000
So the most
convenient place to make

341
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,541
a wholesale purchase
of gold would be

342
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,583
a pagan village
such as Lamtra...

343
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,916
but...

344
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,500
If we want to take the
safest route from Lamtra,

345
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,458
we'd have to take
the main road...

346
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,458
one which is
entirely too busy...

347
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,708
On top of that,
the area has been

348
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,583
another shepherd's
territory for a long time.

349
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,916
But if its me, I won't
arouse any suspicion

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,625
even if I decide to
go on a quiet road

351
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,458
which very
few people take...

352
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,625
And of course
I would decide on a road

353
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,500
that is the shortest distance
between here and Lamtra.

354
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,916
Exactly... Nora...

355
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,541
You've been treated very
poorly by this town's church...

356
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,500
This plan is a great chance

357
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,791
for you to get back at them
for being so cruel to you.

358
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,500
After all, the biggest
source of their funds

359
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,375
is the import
and export of gold...

360
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,375
along with
so-called donations.

361
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,583
However, if they
were to find out,

362
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,333
we'd be severely punished...

363
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,708
and regardless we'll
have to leave this town

364
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,750
for our own safety after
the work is completed...

365
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,625
Now you understand...

366
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,750
That's why the
compensation is so high.

367
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,791
[church bells chiming]

368
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,833
All right Lawrence
I will do this for you.

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,166
I look forward
to working with you.

370
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,583
Likewise.

371
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,000
Um?

372
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,833
What's wrong Nora?

373
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,958
Nothing...

374
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,333
I just wanted you to know

375
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,625
I wouldn't have taken
this offer from anyone else.

376
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,875
I only said yes because...

377
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,000
because it was you.

378
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you not happy now?

379
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,666
Things turned out well,
did they not?

380
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,375
But is the end worth it?

381
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,708
Of course it is.

382
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,208
The gamble's not
worth our lives...

383
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,500
If what we're focusing on
here is our financial gain

384
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,583
then we might
as well call it fraud.

385
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
If you sign an unfavorable
contract, you're the fool.

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,708
That rule is common
sense if you're a merchant...

387
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,041
But what about the person
we're working with this time...

388
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,833
She's a poor shepherd girl

389
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,625
who doesn't know
her left from her right.

390
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,458
It is true that little girl's
smile at least looked innocent.

391
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,791
Seriously...

392
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,250
You are more than
hopelessly good natured.

393
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,875
That little shepherd
girl is not

394
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,958
a mere sheep you
understand...

395
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:32,333
she exists for more
than to be hunted.

396
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,500
No, in fact she is
a rather bold sheep

397
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,166
who decided on her own to
jump into a pit of wild animals.

398
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,791
Consider this...

399
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,250
She might just be
a completely different animal

400
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,791
who is hiding in sheep's skin...

401
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,500
I do not wish to admit this...

402
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,708
but she is a shepherd
that even I acknowledged.

403
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,791
You are not so bad after all,

404
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:56,083
but please try not
to be so gullible!

405
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,291
Well at this point
it doesn't matter,

406
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,833
we have a job to focus on now...

407
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,833
Hopefully we'll end up
the ones laughing.

408
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,208
Is that so?

409
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:08,666
Because I believe the
idea of the two of us

410
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,875
chuckling all by ourselves
is the most appealßing.

411
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,333
I don't
necessarily disagree...

412
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,541
But I'll be
far more relieved

413
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,333
once we can all
laugh together.

414
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,708
You really are
terribly good natured.

415
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,166
You don't like it?

416
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,583
You are silly.

417
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,041
[LIEBERT] Master you've
gotta be kidding me!

418
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,625
Are we really going
through with this?

419
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,666
We're going
through with it...

420
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,708
We have no choice.

421
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,958
Did you hear me Liebert?
We have no choice.

422
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,041
