Che Dio vi benedica
il vostro cammino...

00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:12,041
La pace sia con voi.

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,625
Thank you very much, sir.

00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,541
Oh no, thank you very much.

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,458
And now I must
thank you again.

6
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,750
Well then...

7
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,666
Wait.

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,958
[NORA]
I was just wondering,

9
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,916
where did you hear
about this road?

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,208
[LAWRENCE] A bar in
Poroson a few days ago.

11
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,416
Didn't they tell you
about wolves out here?

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,083
Yes, they certainly did,
but we decided to risk it.

13
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,333
We're in a bit of a hurry.

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,833
I understand.

15
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,583
Um, is something the matter?

16
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,833
Oh... no... It's just...

17
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,041
Go ahead...

18
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,583
Please don't hold
yourself back on my account.

19
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,333
Okay then...

20
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,041
Do you think you
might want to hire me?

21
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,791
I am a shepherd.

22
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,750
And, yes, part of
my job is raising sheep,

23
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,250
but I also have
to protect them.

24
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,708
I can drive wolves away.

25
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,833
I'm very good at it.

26
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,250
If you hire me,
I can protect you

27
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,875
from the wolves on this road.

28
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,000
What do you think?

29
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,958
Enek, go.

30
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,750
[ENEK barking]
[SHEEP baaing]

31
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,625
Give me just a second.

32
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,666
Let me go talk to my partner.

33
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,750
Her skills?

34
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,125
Yes, she can help us.

35
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,166
You heard what
she said, right?

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it might be worth it.

37
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,750
Yes, but you
already have me.

38
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,875
I know, and I realize
you should be enough...

39
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,958
but I never even
considered that a shepherd

40
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,958
could be used to protect
us from wolves, did you?

41
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,375
It could help me with
some business ventures, too.

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,333
It appears as though
human males do not mind

43
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,416
having several females around.

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,375
First of all,
don't wolves run in packs?

45
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,625
And second of all,

46
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,291
you're prettier than
her and you know it.

47
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,958
Oh fine.

48
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,416
I guess I can accept
that explanation.

49
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,291
So, you think
she's any good?

50
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,708
She ranks among the highly
skilled, most likely.

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,666
Think you could
be more specific?

52
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,750
I could hunt her sheep
without a problem.

53
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,916
But, I imagine she could
handle ordinary wolves easily,

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,958
even if they all
attacked at once.

55
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,625
[LAWRENCE]
Why is that?

56
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,291
[HOLO] She is quite the
expert at handling her dog.

57
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,416
A troublesome shepherd
and a clever dog

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,333
always work well together.

59
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,083
'Tis true in her
case at least...

60
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,458
Judging by her voice,
she seems young.

61
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,875
I am concerned about how
good she is yet to become.

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:14,083
Perhaps I might want
to take care of her now...

63
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,666
Please don't.
Thank you though.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,333
Oh, Lawrence?

65
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,666
You do not really
plan to hire her, do you?

66
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,166
That's what
I'm thinking, yeah.

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,041
If you do hire her
we will be forced

68
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:31,041
to travel together for
a while, am I not correct?

69
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,333
Well yes.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,500
Well, I find
that disconcerting.

71
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,750
We'll only be
traveling together

72
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,958
for two days, that's all.

73
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,583
Yes and I find
that disconcerting.

74
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,791
Right...

75
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,083
You'll be fine,
just be patient.

76
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,666
What could I possibly
need to be patient for?

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,083
Well you know...

78
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,333
it'll be two whole days
before we can be alone again...

79
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,875
But if you can't bear it...

80
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:59,333
I do not mind, but it
might cause problems for you.

81
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,833
If we were to
carelessly travel with others.

82
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,791
What happens if they
are to find out about me?

83
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,041
Oh... I understand now...

84
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,000
Would you rather
I said something like this?

85
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,750
I want to travel with you...
all by myself!

86
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,666

00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,791
Seriously.

89
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,958
Well, she will
probably not find out

90
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,416
if it is
only for two days.

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,166
You may do
as you please.

92
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

93
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,250
No, that's fine.

94
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,166
How does 40 Tries to get
us to Lubinheigen sound?

95
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,416
And, I'll pay you extra

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,958
if you keep us
from getting harmed

97
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,583
should wolves
happen to attack.

98
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,125
Is that too low?

99
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,666
No! Thank you very much!

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,000
No, thank you.

101
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm sorry, I completely
forgot to ask your name.

102
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,875
Oh... of course.
I'm sorry too.

103
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,291
I'm... I'm Nora Arendt.

104
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,291
Enek.

105
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,041
Have you been working
as a shepherd for long?

106
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,958
Oh no. It's been
about four years.

107
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:34,500
I only became a shepherdess
after I took in my Enek.

108
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,125
That's surprising...
What did you do before?

109
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,333
I lived in a convent
annex and worked there.

110
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,750
We sheltered the poor
and helped take care of them.

111
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,083
I see.

112
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
I enjoyed my
time at the shelter,

113
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,875
but I always wanted
to have a job on my own.

114
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,958
I'm really lucky
to have found my Enek.

115
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,416
He's probably a reward
for your kindness.

116
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,833
Yes...

117
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,250
I'm sure it must have been
God that brought him to me

118
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,291
and for that
I am very grateful.

119
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,208
When I first met him,

120
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,958
he was filthy and
covered in wounds.

121
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,000
Attacked by wolves?

122
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,291
No...

123
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,708
I think it must've
been mercenaries...

124
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,875
The poor thing was
cowering under a small cliff

125
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,166
not far from the annex
when I first saw him.

126
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,458
Really?

127
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,875
You know...

128
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,625
I never imagined
I'd have a shepherd as a guard

129
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,833
No?

130
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,333
Shepherds don't normally
guard people, right?

131
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:36,125
No... I guess...

132
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,708
I thought
we could talk.

133
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,666
I can understand.

134
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,166
Also, I had always
wanted to become a tailor.

135
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,750
But to do it I knew
I needed to have money.

136
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:51,041
They have association
fees and things like that.

137
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,500
So you know, you'll
probably make more money

138
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,416
guarding merchants
than you will caring for sheep.

139
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I imagine your territory

140
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,541
as a shepherd
is always up for debate.

141
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,833
Definitely...

142
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,041
It seems the safe places

143
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,291
are already claimed
by the time I get there.

144
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,000
The only area left was
the one with all the wolves?

145
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,708
Yes.

146
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,208
I have a feeling
they can be a pain.

147
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,791
Ow!

148
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,750
On top of that they're
cunning and underhanded.

149
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,125
They may be able to hear us

150
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,375
so it's best not to
talk bad about them.

151
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,375
You're right.

152
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,583
Once again, I am very sorry
for making you stop so early.

153
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,750
No...

154
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,750
Don't be.
I understand completely;

155
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,291
shepherds have to go to
sleep before the sunsets.

156
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,541
Thank you.

157
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,083
Enek and I have to watch

158
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,000
over the whole flock
throughout the night.

159
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,750
You know I always
think the same thing

160
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,666
when I look
at all of them.

161
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,041
"I wonder what kind of clothing

162
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,333
their wool will become."

163
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,625
Your shepherding skills are
really quite impressive Nora.

164
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,083
You're talented.

165
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,583
Oh no... Not me.

166
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,333
With your skill,
they should allow you to care

167
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,375
for a lot more
sheep than this.

168
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,208
I consider the ones
I have blessing enough.

169
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:22,250
I don't think I would
be able to handle any more.

170
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,875
I don't think your
employer is very smart.

171
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,708
Why don't you find
someone who appreciates you?

172
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,500
I could never though.
It's not possible.

173
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,416
Sorry...

174
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm a merchant after all

175
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,000
so I tend to
think about things

176
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,125
only in terms
of profit and loss.

177
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,166
Lawrence?

178
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
Yeah?

179
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,500
Could you tell me,

180
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,625
do people usually change
their employers a lot?

181
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,375
Well it's normal to find
someone else to work for

182
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,333
if you don't like
how you're being treated.

183
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,750
I didn't know that.

184
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,625
Nora, don't you
work for the church?

185
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,166
What?

186
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,458
It's just a guess,
but I have feeling it's true.

187
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,625
I do, yes...

188
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,333
The priest at the church
entrusted the sheep to me.

189
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,708
He's actually
been very considerate.

190
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:13,916
You can ignore
what I said earlier...

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,416
You may not
get the best pay,

192
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,166
but as long as God
doesn't abandon us,

193
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,916
the church is not
going to go anywhere.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,458
You won't ever have to
worry about losing your job

195
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,333
as a shepherd
and you'll never go hungry.

196
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,791
I guess you're right.

197
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,375
Yeah, I guess you're right.

198
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,625
And, as far as I know,
God doesn't have any rules

199
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,833
against doing a little
work on the side.

200
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,416
Tell you what,
when I get to Lubinheigen

201
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,958
I'll have a talk
with some of my friends

202
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,375
who are merchants.

203
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,708
I'll see if any of them
need a dependable guard, okay?

204
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,083
You'd really do that
for me Lawrence? Thank you!

205
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,125
She does not have
a job that's easy.

206
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:01,291
Well I do have to care
for my tail every day.

207
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,625
Oh wait., you're
talking about her aren't you.

208
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,208
Her name's
Nora by the way.

209
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,625
Hey!

210
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,291
You said it was okay.

211
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,500
I mean that is why
I asked you first!

212
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,250
Now I cannot even
groom my tail in peace.

213
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,791
But you were
just doing it.

214
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,541
Yes, until I had
to listen to the two of you.

215
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,583
Are you kidding?

216
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,250
I suppose you seemed to
be having a nice little chat.

217
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,791
You mean with Nora?

218
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,333
Unless you were speaking
to her dog or the sheep.

219
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,291
She said she wanted
someone to talk to;

220
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,958
I'm not gonna
turn her down Holo.

221
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,500
More importantly,
I haven't talked

222
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,625
to a normal
girl in awhile.

223
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,375
And you never noticed
that the little shepherd girl

224
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,625
did not actually
wish to speak with you?

225
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,583
That's okay, too.

226
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,500
I mean if it was love at
first sight I wouldn't be able

227
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,125
to experience
the joy of gradually

228
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,000
having her fall for me.

229
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,458
Whatcha think?

230
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,166
I'm pretty smooth, right?

231
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,458
No. No you are not.

232
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,125
You are not smooth at all.

233
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,208
Thanks so much
for that. Geez.

234
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,541
You happy now?

235
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,750
Yes.

236
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,833
Actually I am rather
amused at the moment.

237
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,083
So thank you.

238
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,416
As long as you're
not in a bad mood anymore,

239
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,041
that's all that matters.

240
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,041
I am not.

241
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,583
I do not remember
why I was angry.

242
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,541
I shall take it as
a gift from shepherd girl.

243
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,958
This is it.

244
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
Good morning to you, sir.

245
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,916
[GUARD] Well,
good morning to you miss.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
May I have a pass?
Thank you.

247
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,000
Thank you
very much, sir.

248
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:21,083
I really
appreciate your help.

249
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,500
You know at
an official checkpoint

250
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,333
it would have taken
me at least 10 times longer

251
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,583
than that to get
this pass. Thanks!

252
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,500
Don't thank me,
it's all part of

253
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,208
my employment
with the church.

254
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,916
All right, here's the
40 Tries I promised you.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,875
Wait, these 2 silver
coins will exchange

256
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,416
for about 45 Tries.

257
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,625
An investment
from a greedy merchant.

258
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,125
How?

259
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,250
If I have a good connection
with a skilled shepherd

260
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,083
you never know
I might just come

261
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,750
across an unexpected

262
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,708
money-making idea
in wool trading.

263
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,916
Well then thank you again.

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,291
We'll be at the trading house

265
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,833
of the Lohen
Merchant Association

266
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,250
for the next few days.

267
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,500
If you plan
to go back out

268
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
across the fields again,
please let me know.

269
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,083
I may be able to introduce
you to some merchants

270
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,833
from town who are
in need of a guard.

271
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,625
Yes of course I will.

272
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,583
Just in case let me
ask you something,

273
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,708
the road we took,
is that the only road

274
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,500
you'll be able to
work on as a guard?

275
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,791
No.

276
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,583
I can also go to Kastrata,
Poroson, and Lamtra.

277
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,166
Lamtra...
You mean that Lamtra?

278
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
Of course.

279
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,583
And not the roundabout
official route either?

280
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,541
Oh no, I take the shortcut
that goes through the forest.

281
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,083
Are you serious?

282
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,291
Even knights are
afraid of that forest.

283
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,250
As long as I'm
with Enek I'm fine.

284
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh, in that
case you'll have

285
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,083
a much better chance
of finding a customer.

286
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,708
I hope that
you're right Lawrence.

287
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,750
Well, I have to go this way
for the livestock entrance.

288
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,416
Okay. We've almost made it.

289
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,208
Now all we're gonna have
to do is get through customs

290
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,291
and then head over to Lemerio
trading to sell these weapons.

291
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,541
Hold on.

292
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,208
We still have to buy
honey pickled peaches.

293
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,833
All right... let's go.

294
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
I do not
appreciate being ignored.

295
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,250
Now listen to me,
if they don't have them,

296
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,458
you're just gonna have to
deal with it and they might not.

297
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,791
So you say.

298
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,625
You can't get mad
at me if they don't.

299
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,208
So you say.

300
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,333
I'm not kidding!

301
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,000
[HOLO]
What is that gate?

302
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,541
[LAWRENCE] It's there
to keep enemies

303
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,958
from getting in
during a battle.

304
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,583
And they use those holes

305
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,041
for pouring out
boiling hot oil.

306
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,750
[HOLO] This town has
a disturbingly solid defense.

307
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,958
[CUSTOMS OFFICER]
Your pass please?

308
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,916
So you're coming
from Poroson.

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,208
What are you bringing?

310
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh, yes I am
bringing 20 sets of arms.

311
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,666
Weapons? From Poroson?

312
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
That's right.

313
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,833
I bought them wholesale
from Latparon Trading.

314
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,041
Is that okay?

315
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,958
All right you're good.

316
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,750
So, are you paying
tax with cash or goods?

317
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,041
Oh, with goods please.

318
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,625
That's a wise decision...

319
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,250
Give the people on
your left 2 sets of arms.

320
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,958
It must be unusual then

321
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,041
to make a wholesale
purchase from Poroson.

322
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,916
Well, as a matter
of fact, no it's not...

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,833
It's actually
pretty common.

324
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,458
Oh.

325
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,500
Here are my papers.

326
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,708
[TAX COLLECTOR]
You can go.

327
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,541
I think public officials
have to be unpleasant

328
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,791
no matter where you go.

329
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,041
Did you not notice?

330
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,875
It appeared the last
one we encountered

331
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,791
was silently
laughing at us.

332
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,625
He most likely
became jealous

333
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,041
after seeing that pile of
arms and thought to himself

334
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,416
"You are a mere merchant,
do not get to have an ego

335
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,541
just because you
made a little money."

336
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,833
Well that's okay...

337
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,166
we still entered the
town without any problems.

338
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,125
So you wanna leave
the wagon at the inn

339
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,166
and head straight
to the street vendors?

340
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,541
[WOMAN] Peace be
with you, Father.

341
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,416
[PRIEST]
Good morning to you.

342
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,333
[CHURCHMAN] And God
will always find a way for us.

343
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,500
So good!

344
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,875
Could I have a refill please?

345
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,208
[BAR OWNER]
Okay another beer it is.

346
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,666
You're a pretty strong lady.

347
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,541
Oh but barkeep,
I am just getting started.

348
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,041
You've been had
by an expensive girl, sir.

349
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,458
But I gotta say
she is pretty.

350
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,375
I know and
she'd be perfect

351
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,625
if she just
didn't have that tail.

352
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,250
I like this place,

353
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,916
the alcohol is good
and the town is lively.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,416
Be careful of
that liveliness;

355
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,916
you can't let
your guard down.

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,333
No matter what,
don't mess around

357
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,041
with knights or
mercenaries okay?

358
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,500
If you do, we'll
be in big trouble.

359
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,375
Here you go ma'am.

360
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,250
Thank you!
Much appreciated!

361
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,291
So, where are
we going now?

362
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,791
The trading house.

363
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,666
Holo, you have stuff
all over your face.

364
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:17,291
Will you stop?! Come on.

365
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,708
I have a question.

366
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,541
Is there any
point in me going

367
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,250
to that trading
house with you?

368
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,791
No, but I think it's too
dangerous to leave you alone.

369
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,250
Because of how
attractive I am, right?

370
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,958
I didn't mean
it that way.

371
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,416
We'll be in trouble
if you get drunk

372
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
and show off
your ears and tail.

373
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,416
If that should happen,

374
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,791
which it won't,
but if it did,

375
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,041
I shall take you into
my mouth and run out of town

376
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,375
as quickly as possible...

377
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,416
the fence is low,
I could do it.

378
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,875
If I am correct there
are stories like this

379
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,791
about a knight
and a young woman

380
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,291
in fairy tales
is there not?

381
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,750
The ones where
a knight rescues

382
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,166
a captured young
woman in his arms?

383
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,500
Yes. I shall do that.

384
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,125
I'm sure you see it
as a lovely picture

385
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,583
but for some reason

386
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,541
me inside a wolf's mouth
doesn't seem too romantic.

387
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,583
Would you rather
I took you upon my back

388
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,833
and raced through
a field of lilies?

389
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,000
By the way...

390
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,958
What is this
trading house?

391
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,416
Running any business comes
with dangers and accidents

392
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,208
and you can't always trust

393
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,041
that someone's
going to protect you.

394
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,708
You know how
knights wear armor?

395
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,458
Well, we, merchants,
like to keep safe

396
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,208
by using connections
with each other.

397
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,000
We're headed to a
branch of an organization

398
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,666
that consists of merchants
from the same homeland.

399
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,208
As always, this place
brings back memories.

400
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,416
It looks like
buildings where I'm from.

401
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,708
It just feels like home.

402
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,416
It must be nice.

403
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,875
To be able to feel at
home in different places.

404
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,708
Do you think
you can manage

405
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,708
to wait here
a little while,

406
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,916
while I go inside?

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,083
Wait, I thought you
were going to take me in

408
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,500
and show me off

409
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,875
to all the people
from your hometown.

410
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,583
I'll be quick,
if you can behave yourself

411
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,375
I'll buy you some sweet
bread when we're done.

412
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,750
Do not treat
me like a child!

413
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,541
So you
don't want some?

414
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,250
I shall wait
'til you get back.

415
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,250
[JACOB]
You're a poor excuse

416
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,458
for a merchant
to come in here.

417
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,333
It's the
middle of the day!

418
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,750
If you don't
have an interest

419
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,291
in doing an
honest days work

420
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,708
then you might as
well become a thief, huh.

421
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,583
But a really good
merchant can make money

422
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,958
without even getting
dust on his shoes.

423
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,666
And he should only
dirty his fingertips

424
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,791
with a little black ink.

425
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,333
Running around in
the market all day long

426
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,458
is proof of a
third-rate merchant.

427
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,750
Isn't that right?

428
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,833
Look what
the cat dragged in.

429
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,208
You've turned into
a pretty smooth talker.

430
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,625
Welcome back son!

431
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,875
I've never understood why
you always call me your son.

432
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,375
Now, don't
act so special.

433
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,458
You know everyone in
the Lohen Merchant Association

434
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,375
is like a son
or daughter to me.

435
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,375
Plus, I do still have
the benefit of knowing

436
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,875
you wet your bed a lot
whenever you went camping.

437
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,208
I also know you stole
the proceeds from a sale

438
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,375
and went trembling
with some of your friends

439
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,583
to a house of ill repute.

440
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,125
Okay, that's enough,
thank you.

441
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,833
[YOUNG MERCHANT]
Have you seen a merchant

442
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,291
named Craft Lawrence
come through?

443
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,458
[LOADING MAN]
Forget your man Lawrence.

444
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,583
I haven't even seen a rat

445
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:29,666
around here for
the past few days

446
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,291
[YOUNG MERCHANT]
I see...

447
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,583
