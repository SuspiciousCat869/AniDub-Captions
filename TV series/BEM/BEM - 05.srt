Look at this town. It's filthy!

00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,733
Are you really okay with that?

Oh, look at the
mess you've made!

6
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:55,192
Now I'll have to clean
it up all over again!

7
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,442
Go.

8
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,775
I'll track him down.

Hey there, girly.

11
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,525
It isn't safe out here.

be walkin' al--Gah!

[DARYL]
Thank you, Officer.

14
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,067
You went through the trouble
of crossing over the bridge.

15
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,775
[SONIA] I've been summoned
to headquarters.

16
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,233
Listen.
I know who's behind this.

17
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,858
Then call in and report them.

18
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,358
The police are no good.

19
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:27,275
They would never bite
the hand that feeds them.

20
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:30,192
I can count on
no one but myself.

21
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:33,233
I'll avenge my father
with my own two hands.

22
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:35,483
And who are you
taking vengeance on?

23
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,858
The true enemy of those
who despise corruption.

24
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,942
Called the unseen council.

25
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:56,983
Oh, hey!

26
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,358
How are ya, Belo?

27
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,025
What's strange is how
I see him sitting nearby

28
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,358
all the time.

29
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,233
I don't get why he doesn't
just come in and say hi.

30
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,858
Guess something must've
happened to him.

31
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,900
Well then he should
talk to us about it.

32
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,442
Maybe we should ask.

33
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,483
But we feel weird about it.

34
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,233
It kinda comes off like he
doesn't wanna be bothered.

35
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,275
Belo's always gone out
of his way to help us

36
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:27,817
when we needed it.

37
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,692
We should do the same for him.

38
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,358
Well then why don't
you go and talk to him?

39
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,817
I'm a little scared to.

40
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,608
But I also miss my friend.

41
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:39,358
It's boring without Belo.

42
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,775
[HQ CHIEF] We never would've
found out about all this

43
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,608
were it not for your
efforts, Summers.

44
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,858
I'd like to thank you
for filing that report.

45
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:54,442
That said...

46
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,358
It seems the chief here dragged
his feet getting it sent to us.

47
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,400
Please allow me to apologize
for delaying that decision.

48
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,358
Uh... Summers was
the only witness,

49
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:05,442
so it took time to confirm
that the monster was real.

50
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,483
We haven't had time
to build a rapport yet.

51
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,692
I assure you she can be trusted.

52
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:14,525
I know Summers well.
I'm the one who sent her to you.

53
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,400
That isn't to say I had
much choice in the matter.

54
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,358
Summers had to be transferred.

55
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:23,067
I did it to protect her
from certain... realities.

56
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,192
I understand completely, sir.

57
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,817
We realize that mysterious
cases like this one

58
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,942
are far more common in the
Outside than in Upper Town.

59
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,900
Although, from
everything I've read,

60
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:35,192
it seems this case may
belong in a peculiar league

61
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,900
of its own, yes?

62
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,567
Before I proceed,
let me establish one thing.

63
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,942
Officer Summers,
I believe you saw exactly

64
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,358
what you claim you saw.

65
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,275
I've discussed it with my
peers and we've agreed

66
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:48,483
on a name for such creatures.

67
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,733
From this day forward,

68
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,358
when you're dealing
with a monstrosity

69
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:54,108
that has a
relatively human form,

70
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:57,692
you ought to refer to it
as a humanoid monster.

71
00:06:57,775 --> 00:07:00,442
[CHIEF]
A humanoid monster, eh?

72
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:04,358
To be honest, sir, that sounds
pretty outlandish to me.

73
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:06,317
You'll get used to it in time.

74
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,025
Our mutual superiors are
quite keen on the term.

75
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,108
--[CHIEF] I see.
--Also...

76
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,233
We've given special designations
to the three humanoid monsters

77
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,358
that can disguise
themselves as humans.

78
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,442
Alpha.

79
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,608
Beta.

80
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,442
And Gamma.

81
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,983
Those creatures
are quite unique.

82
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,067
There's something
else I should mention.

83
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,567
[HQ CHIEF]
By all means.

84
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,983
No one's been in contact with
them as many times as you.

85
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,400
What's your opinion?

86
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,192
I know how this sounds,
but they may our allies, sir.

87
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:39,983
[HQ CHIEF]
Oh?

88
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,400
They're monsters, Summers.

89
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:43,025
You think they wanna be friends?

90
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,775
I believe it's possible.

91
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,067
Especially after
this last encounter.

92
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,858
You see...
Alpha has protected me.

93
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:52,192
More than once.

94
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:54,942
He's even put himself
into harm's way to do it.

95
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,483
And why didn't you mention
any of this in your report?

96
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,358
'Cause it would've
made you even less likely

97
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,858
to believe it.

98
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,942
[HQ CHIEF] We'll find out
if they're friend or foe soon.

99
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,817
They're most active
in your precinct,

100
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,233
so we're entrusting
you with their capture.

101
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,317
Capture?

102
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,608
You'll be working under
an operational commander.

103
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,608
It's time.
Please come on in.

104
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,608
Well... This is--

105
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:33,108
Head Operative Felt,
Special First Division.

106
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,233
I'll take over from here.

107
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:37,817
Hey. I'm the Eighteenth
precinct's poli--

108
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,108
Your name is irrelevant.

109
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,608
Let's begin.

110
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,983
D'you want me to fill you in
on the situation, at least?

111
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,483
[FELT]
I've read the reports.

112
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,275
[CHIEF]
I'm sure you have.

113

[HQ CHIEF]
Sonia.

114
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:50,942
Doesn't look like
you've changed much.

115
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,442
You need to try not to act
on your own all the time.

116
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,942
You've got a knack for making
your chiefs look incompetent.

117
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:02,525
If there's a need for action to
be taken, then I take action.

118
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,025
[sighs]

119
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:06,608
Overdo it again and there'll
be nowhere left to send you.

120
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,817
[SONIA]
With all due respect, sir.

121
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,400
This is quite the
change of tone for you.

122
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:13,025
Oh, don't be like that.

123
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,608
To be honest,

124
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,025
I was pleasantly surprised that
you chose to bring this issue

125
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,108
to me.

126
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,525
I'm surprised at
myself for trusting you.

127
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:21,650
Goodbye, sir.

128
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,817
[BEM]
You lost him.

129
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,483
I would've caught him,
but some lowlife got in my way.

130
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,858
I see.

131
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,608
So what's this
idiot's weird obsession?

132
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,900
He wants to clean.

133
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:41,275
More than anything.

134
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,567
This old mansion
of yours is filthy.

135
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,567
I could clean it for you if
you made me a proper vacuum.

136
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,525
Hoh!

137
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,192
You want a vacuum?

138
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,858
Well isn't that homey.

139
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:17,525
Might I ask why you
like cleaning so much?

140
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:22,192
I like how it feels to make
filth disappear for good.

141
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,733
I want to clean up every fetid
corner of this disgusting city.

142
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:31,233
That's why I joined the
sanitation department.

143
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,525
I wanted to make
our streets shine

144
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,858
so that no Uppertowner
could call the Outside

145
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,400
a trash dump again.

146
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,692
I just don't understand.

147
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,233
They're all content
to sit in their own filth.

148
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,608
My mother never learned
to pick up after herself.

149
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,108
I didn't have a father.

150
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,733
And each time Mother came home,

151
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,942
she brought a different
man with her.

152
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,192
None of them were kind.

153
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,233
Most were quite
violent towards me.

154
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:04,567
Mother never stopped them.

155
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,942
But thankfully, she and
her boyfriends spent

156
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,900
most of their time
away from home.

157
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:12,400
I didn't have much
to do by myself.

158
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,900
So I started cleaning
up that filthy place.

159
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:21,025
It felt so nice to be
surrounded by clean things.

160
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,192

How disappointing.

323
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,733
You were almost in my grasp.

324
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:15,317
I'm waiting.

325
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,233
Hurry and come to my side.

326
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,442
I must have you, Bem.
