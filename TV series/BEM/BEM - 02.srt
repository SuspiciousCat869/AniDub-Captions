00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:04,608
You just might get
me a new high score!

323
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:08,192
Looks like he's takin' his third
and fourth shot doublehanded!

324
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,608
Well, talk about a
heebie jeebie mama!

325
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:20,858
Shot five's comin'!

326
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:23,275
But first,
I'm demandin' a re-rack!

327
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,275
[BOWLING MAN] I've got
one shot that never misses.

328
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,567
This bowler's going
for the bagger!

329
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,817
[growling]

330
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,025

[BOWLING MAN grunts]

332
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:46,192
But... How'd you beat me?

333
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,983
Tell me who it was
that put you up to this,

334
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,775
both ten years ago and today.

335
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:50,858
[BOWLING MAN yells]

336
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,192
There's no need
to twist it in deeper!

337
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,067
I'm an Outsider:
this is just a job:

338
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,442
nothin' personal!

339
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,858
I was hired by a woman
named Elaine, okay?

340
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,275
That's a lie!

341
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:02,192
I'm not lyin', I swear!
This really hurts, take it out!

342
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,025
You said you'd
murder me "again."

343
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,025
Yeah, Elaine hired me
to kill you ten years ago,

344
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,733
and you plus that
rich lady tonight!

345
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,025
I swear!

346
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,608
[yelling]

347
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:13,150
[BOWLING MAN]
I'm tellin' you the truth!

348
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,608
Hey, this hurts a lot!

349
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,275
It's Elaine who killed you!

350
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,358
I'm just how she did it!

351
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,442
[BELA]
I hate it when humans lie to me.

352
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,733
She set it all up.

353
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:47,108
Think her plan was to
call you the ghost of Mary

354
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,192
and say that you
murdered Dominic.

355
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,858
Dominic was about
to speak with the police,

356
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,733
and Elaine wanted
to silence her.

357
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,567
Hey.

358
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,650
Annabella. Something wrong?

359
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,608
Dominic was just murdered.

360
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,650
I took care of
the culprit myself.

361
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,108
This wasn't a gift.

362
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,900
You stole it.

363
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:20,483
And pinned it on Mary.

364
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,858
You're full of lies.

365
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,108
Do you have any proof?

366
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,317
What use would I have
for a thing like that?

367
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,400
Tell me why you murdered Mary.

368
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,483
[ELAINE]
I didn't. It wasn't me.

369
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,900
Yes, I know.

370
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,900
It was the Bowling Man
who did it.

371
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,317
But the fact that you
wouldn't dirty your hands

372
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,275
only makes me hate you more.

373
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:42,983
You had Dominic
and the Bowling Man

374
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:46,067
dancing from strings,
while you stood in shadow.

375
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,108
You shed real tears
of sadness for Mary.

376
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,692
What were you trying to achieve?

377
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:52,775
[ELAINE chuckles]

378
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,942
Dominic was rich, and well...

379
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,525
Rich is useful.

380
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,692
Which is why I let her live.

381
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,108
I killed Mary...

382
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:03,025
...'cause her happiness
pissed me off!

383
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,942
Her smile was so annoying!

384
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:06,442
And she was so honest!

385
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:07,567
I hated her!

386
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,025
[BELA]
But she was your friend.

387
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:10,400
She was never my friend.

00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,067

--[ELAINE gasps, shrieks]
--[BELA growling]

396
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,692
This is the woman who was
behind Mary Russell's murder.

397
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,483
That's why you called me here?

398
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,233
[WOODS] We got statements
from the rest of their friends.

399
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,025
They say it was
Elaine who pushed them

400
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,192
to abandon Mary during
the bravery test.

401
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:42,650
When they heard
she'd gone missing,

402
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,525
they vowed to keep
that night a secret.

403
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,900
It's awful. They called
themselves her friends,

404
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,942
then they left her to die.

405
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,233
People of Upper
really piss me off.

406

You never said why
you took her face.

Hearing her...

410
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,317
I realized what it
meant to be human.

I like this face,
and I'm glad to know

It's probably his fault.
