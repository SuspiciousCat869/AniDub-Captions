going to be easy,

strong our opposition is.

[CARVER] If we take it slow,

I hear that the one

was a young boy.

Don't bring him here again.

He didn't move like

He might be an assassin.

Shut up.

318
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,650
[DARYL]
It's fine. Father's still out.

319
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,192
Actually, he's home now.

320
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,233
[DARYL]
Huh?

321
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,233
Hey! Wait!

322
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,108
[BELO]
Stay here! I'll be back!

323
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,233
It's you!

324
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,025
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin.

325
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:04,567
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin?

326
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,358
Now die.

327
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:32,525
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin!

328
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:34,400
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin!

329
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,275
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin!

330
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,192
[BELO grunts]

331
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,025
[SHADOWMAN]
Nin! Nin! Nin!

332
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,025
[SHADOWMAN yells]

333
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,692
[DARYL]
Father?

334
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:13,983
Belo...

335
00:20:15,483 --> 00:20:16,483
Did you...

336
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,025
Did you kill my father?!

337
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:20,817
No. I would never
do that to you.

338
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,317
[DARYL]
You're covered in blood!

339
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,858
Where are your clothes,
and why did you run away?!

340
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,400
Well?

341
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,442
It's not my fault.

342
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:52,983
[HAMSTER 03A squeaks]

343
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,817
[VILLAIN 03A] Looks like
that's it for our pal, Shadow.

344
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,983
[VILLAIN 03B] Water and
Bowling got wrecked, too.

345
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:28,067
Really pissed someone
off out there, didn't we?

346
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,692
[VILLAIN 03C]
Be careful.

347
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,983
Whoever they are,
they could be watching us.

348
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,150
[VILLAIN 03A]
Sounds like fun to me.

349
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,983
If there's something out
there, I'd like to hunt it.

350
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,483
[AIDE 01A] The one
who eliminated Shadow

351
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,233
has been confirmed as Gamma.

352
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,150
We'll continue
our investigation.

353
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:51,067
[video game sounds]

354
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,192
[BELA]
Retreating into his games again.

355
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,900
You've felt this pain, too.

356
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,775
Give him time.
He'll find his answers.

357
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:13,775
What is our power good for?

358
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:15,775
Why can't we be human already?
