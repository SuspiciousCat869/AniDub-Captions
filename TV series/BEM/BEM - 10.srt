00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:21,275
Briggs had recently begun
moving to rebuild his reputation

4
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,067

In recent years,
Libra City has witnessed

00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,692
a rash of grisly murders.

8
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,983
These killings have been
perpetrated by the so-called

only Representative Smith,

and Secretary Bryson

by these creatures.

[HQ CHIEF] We have confirmed

murder of Gavin Briggs.

16

These hateful,
subhuman creatures.

17

They're enemies of mankind.

everything on us.

00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,817
It would appear that she
has made contact with Alpha.

This is it.

32

The council is trying
to bring all of you in.

Do you know the true
face of the council?

34
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:31,608
[SONIA]
I came in contact with them.

35
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,275
That's why they had
me sent Outside.

36
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:34,483
I knew too much.

37
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,983
When I was a child,

38
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,358
I never really questioned
the things I saw around me.

39
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,275
Once some thug came
after me in the Outside,

40
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,192
I was terrified.

41
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:50,275
Then this young cop, he showed
up to rescue me just in time.

42
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,775
He was my hero.

43
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,650
I knew right then that
I wanted to be like him,

44
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,317
to protect the city
from the bad guys.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,442
I thought that I could hold
on to that feeling here

46
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,942
in the Outside.

47
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,858
But this place wore me down.

48
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,692
I'm not Gavin.

49
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,442
I'm not as strong as him.

50
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,942
Through all that injustice,
he never lost himself.

51
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,733
He kept his convictions.

52
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:15,233
Yes.

53
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:18,900
In the end, he gave his own
life to protect one of ours.

54
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,942
I had never met
a human like that.

55
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,483
To him, you weren't a monster.

Just another person in need.

Tell me, what are humanoid
monsters, really?

[BEM] That is a phrase
that humans created.

It's not for me to say
what it means.

You saved me more than once.

Instead of thanking you,
I shot at you.

I'm a coward.

I was too scared to
let myself trust you.

fear is what drives you.

It's your reason to fight.

70

Humans betray their comrades
to save themselves.

And yet, they also
strive to save others.

lives to protect strangers.

But the idea of living
forever with no purpose,

Flattery will get you nowhere.

simply give this city to you

[DARYL]
Just like that?

171

[VEGA] I have a secret that I've
never shared with a single soul.

[DARYL]
The city's tenth anniversary.

174

That's me in that picture.

175
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:34,900
Libra City was built
by my own hands.

176
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,983
[DARYL] But that was more
than a century ago.

177
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,358
[VEGA]
To me it was like yesterday.

178
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,817
My earliest memory
is of an alchemy lab

179
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,692
in the city of Ingolstadt.

180
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,192
A man was there with me,

181
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,400
crying out in ecstasy
that he had touched

182
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,067
the power of God.

183
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,192
And soon after,
the Inquisitors came for him.

184
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:58,900
The alchemist who created me
was burned at the stake.

185
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,983
I took refuge in Rome with
the noble house of Borgia,

186
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,900
a flower of poison.

187
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,317
And from them I learned much.

188
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,317
Rodrigo unshackled
me from morality.

189
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,858
His son, Cesare, taught me
how to manipulate others.

190
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,483
From his daughter Lucrezia,

191
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,567
I learned the secrets
of love and of poison.

192
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,942
Then you're 500 years old?

193

I suppose that's right,
if we're counting.

194
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:28,067
For centuries I've observed
the world of humans.

195
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,942
They have evolved only
in their cruelty.

That's impossible!
Who are you, really?

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,150
I'm a humanoid monster.

My name is Vega.

I've been searching for years,
