I don't know.

Maybe birds sing because

No. Can't say I have.

An attacker can more or

by vibrating its
components with sound.

However...

It takes a strong oscillator
to create those vibrations.

I'll zoom in.

327
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,775
[WOODS]
That looks like Julia Bush.

328
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,317
[RADIO GUY 08A] A fire
appears to have broken out

329
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,650
at the concert hall.

330
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,108
Fire trucks and emergency
personnel are en route.

331
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,025
A fire?

332
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,275
Well, well.

333
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,733
Something tells me that's
not a coincidence.

334
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,192
Just drive, Woods.

335
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,317
[JULIA]
There's no point in hiding.

336
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,525
I made sure all the
doors were locked.

337
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,067
You're not going anywhere.

338
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,442
Fine.

339
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,233
You leave me with
no other choice.

340
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,817
It's a shame about Al, though.

341
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Poor boy.

342
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,275
[singing continues]

343
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:04,317
[BELA]
Stop it!

344
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,692
That voice...

345
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,317
Is that you, Annabella?

346
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,775
You look positively
dreadful, my dear.

347
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,400
[BELA] Yeah, well,
you're not exactly looking

348
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,650
so good yourself.

349
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,650
[JULIA laughs]

350
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,567
Appearances aside,
I'm pleased to see

351
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,275
how readily you
fell for my trap.

352
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:22,067
Did you really think
I'd kill my own son?

353
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,858
Seems youth and
beauty are no match

354
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:26,775
for age and experience.
[laughs]

355
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,275
That dress you were
wearing earlier

356
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,858
looked lovely on you, though.

357
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,400
What happened to it?

358
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:32,692
[BELA]
This isn't a joke!

359
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,108
[JULIA]
I beg to differ.

360
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,317
The idea that a little girl
like you could defeat me

361
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,900
is very amusing, indeed.

362
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:43,400
[JULIA singing]

363
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,608
How is she--?

364
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:45,900
The stage, dear.

365
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,983
The acoustics here are
ideal for my purposes.

366
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:49,817
See?

367
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,275
[singing continues]

368
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,650
[JULIA laughing]

369
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,858
What's your next move,
little girl?

370
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,733
[BELA] Even in that form,
she's still Al's mother.

371
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,483
What should I do?

372
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:09,108
[JULIA laughing]

373
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:12,400
Let's skip ahead to
the stretto, shall we?

374
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,442
[BELA]
Shit!

375
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,983
Aww. Not even close.

376
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,233
[BELA]
That's where you're wrong!

377
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:23,983
[JULIA grunts]

378
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:29,483
[JULIA]
You vile brat!

379
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,483
How dare you strike
my beautiful face!

380
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,525
[singing]

381
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,692
[JULIA] Now! It's time
for our moving finale!

382
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,192
[singing continues]

383
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,483
[JULIA screams]

384
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,233
Sorry, lady.

385
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:14,442
You had quite a voice,
but our bodies don't die.

386
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,442
Mother... what...?

387
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,150
[BELA]
Al?

388
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,817
[ALBERT yells]

389
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,233
Is that a...

390
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,400
It's a monster!

391
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,317
[yelling]

392
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,983
[RODDY]
Beautiful.

393
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,775
[RODDY]
No, wait!

394
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,608
[WOODS]
Police!

395
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,858
[SONIA]
Anyone in there?

396
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,400
[bell rings]

397
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,900
[RODDY]
Incredible.

398
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,775
Such perfect beauty.

399
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:37,150
[RODDY gasps]

400
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,317
You've got strange taste.

401
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,192
[RODDY gasps]

402
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,233
[CHRIS]
Hey, did you hear?

403
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,650
Apparently, Al transferred
to another school.

404
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:55,692
[MEGAN]
Really?

405
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:56,942
[CHRIS]
Bummer, right?
