Then, after he saved
me many times,

that he is not the enemy.

In my ignorance, I'd believed
that humanoid monsters

00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,733
must be a danger to society
simply because they aren't human

A structure that breeds
inequality and discrimination.

292
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,567
We look at those who
have less and feel better

293
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,483
about ourselves because
compared to them,

we're safe and secure.

295
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,358
We view the humanoid
monsters the same way!

296
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,317
Faced with beings
so different from us,

297
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,317
so frightening to look at, we
fool ourselves into believing

298
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,067
we're noble by comparison.

299
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,358
We lie without hesitation,
for purely selfish reasons.

300
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:38,858
We turn away from the truth,
simply to protect ourselves.

301

Gavin Briggs wasn't evil.

302

He wanted to save
the people of this city.

Maybe more than you
care about yourselves.

you've been treated,

I'll accept most
of your testimony.

in and of itself!

321
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,400
There's not been
a single deliberation

322
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,525
on any of the charges!

323
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,275
And now you think insulting
the court will help your cause?

324
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:27,983
No, sir.

325
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,317
[FELT]
Just... Look.

326
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,983
Could you ever come
to love a monster like this?

327
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,150
I pose the same question
to those here today.

328
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,150
Could you accept this thing
as a member of society?

329
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,150
Get a shot of the gallery!

330
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,442
Anyone can spout idealism.

331
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,317
But! As I've said
time and again,

332
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,192
the trial's purpose is clear:

333
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,150
to determine our
collective stance in regard

334
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,567
to these monsters!

335
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,692
That's the only
deliberation we need!

336
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,150
Order, please.

337
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,358
I ask that both the prosecution
and witness remain calm.

338
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,525
Your Honor.

339
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,733
I called this trial
for the good of all.

340
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:11,108
I wish to make plain the dangers
these wretched humanoid

341
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,692
monsters present.

342
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:16,483
We must conclude this case and
move to eliminate the scourge!

343
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,983
Hmm.

344
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,483
I have been given a document
from the Libra City Council

345
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,525
that expresses
a similar opinion.

346
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,650
"All humanoid monsters
should be executed."

347
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:26,942
No, way!

348
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,108
They can't interfere
with the judiciary branch!

349
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,108
[JUDGE 11A]
Order in the court! Please!

350
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,608
[VEGA chuckles]

351
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,858
[FELT] The prosecution
agrees with the council.

352
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,900
Humanoid monsters should die.

353
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,400
Your Honor. We eagerly
await your verdict.

354
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,775
My verdict is as follows:

355
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,192
The defendant is
sentenced to death!

356
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,108
[FELT]
Your Honor.

357
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,317
Humanoid monsters are evil.

358
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,025
We must execute him soon.

359
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,275
Even as early as
tomorrow morning.

360
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,775
[JUDGE 11A]
Accepted.

361
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,942
A public execution's best.

362
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:03,025
Please, Your Honor!

363
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,192
I know humanoid
monsters aren't evil!

364
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,275
They protect the city,
and all the people in it!

365
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,983
The verdict has already
been handed down.

366
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,483
Enough, officer.

367
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,067
[SONIA]
Wait, Bem!

368
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,192
[SONIA grunts]

369
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,567
Let me go!
I still have things to say!

370
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,233
Please! Wait!

371
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,275
Bem!

372
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,192
[BEM]
Sonia Summers.

373
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:33,567
Thank you.

374
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,567
Forgive me!

375
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,567
It was supposed to be
different this time, I'm sorry!

376
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,858
[RODDY yells]
Ow...

377
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,275
[RODDY chuckles]

378
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,525
[BELA]
Why are you here?

379
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,400
You know what I am, right?

380
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,192
[RODDY]
Everyone is so mean.

381
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:08,150
Chris and the others were
supposed to be your friends!

382
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,442
[BELA]
I understand it, though.

383
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,483
Nothing good comes
of being with me.

384
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,108
That's how it's always been.

385
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,942
I'm fine with that!

386
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:17,233
[BELA]
I see. Even this?

387
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,233
[RODDY gasping]

388
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:24,275
Holy crap that's just amazing!

389
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:26,442
I didn't think it would
be like this!

390
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,650
[BELA]
Why are you crying?

391
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,775
[RODDY]
I don't know.

392
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,358
I guess I'm just floored.

393
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,692
To think you were
this cool the whole time!

394
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,650
I'm honored to
see you like this!

395
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,983
[BELA] People usually run
when they see this form.

396
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,442
So, then, were you trying
to frighten me away?

397
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,567
[BELA]
Sorry. I have to go.

398
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,025
[WOODS]
Got one burning question:

399
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:59,275
who the hell's
this Dr. Recycle?

400
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:00,733
I wonder.

401
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:03,067
What kind of research has
he been doing on monsters?

402
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,067
Like experiments?

403
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
[DR RECYCLE] Excuse me,
but do you have any idea

404
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,942
how you plan to kill the
humanoid monsters?

405
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,442
[FELT]
Yes, of course.

406
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,400
With ten times the electricity
we pumped into him today.

407
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,317
[DR RECYCLE] They have
the ability to regenerate,

408
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
just so you're aware.

409
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:23,650
If a single part of them
remains, they will recover.

410
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,400
Trust me, I did tests.

411
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,983
I tried killing them
a number of ways.

412
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:30,150
The only thing that
had the desired effect

413
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,650
was that special bullet.

414
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,733
Thanks to my
brilliant creations,

415
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,442
I was able to obtain samples
of their bodily fluids.

416
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:41,525
I am fairly sure you're
curious to know the details.

417
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,567
You're a frightful man, Doctor.

misplaced your faith has been?

I do not believe that's true.

Poor, pathetic Bem.

435
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,900
What did you ever see
in them in the first place?

436
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:58,233
[BEM] At the very least, I never
saw in them what you did.

But look.

I hope you have fun
at tomorrow's execution.

You seem to be
having all the fun here.

Yes.

I can't wait...
just to see their faces.
