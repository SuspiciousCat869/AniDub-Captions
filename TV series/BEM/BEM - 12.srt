[VEGA]
What are you doing?

337
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,150
[BEM] We will not grant
your wish for death.

338
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,192
We'll make you face eternity.

[VEGA screaming]

They're doing everything
they can to protect us.

341
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,650
[BEM] We're not going
to let you get your way.

342
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,817
[VEGA]
Bem!

343
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,150
[BEM]
I have something to protect now.

344
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,442
[BELA]
So do I.

345
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:38,817
[BELO]
Me, too.

346
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,275
[VEGA gasps] What distinctly
human sentimentality.

347
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,525
Once again...

348
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,900
...I am alone.

349
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:09,067
[AIDE 01A]
Everyone.

350
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,608
Madame has become
a thing of the past.

351
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:14,025
However, things are
going smoothly

352
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:15,983
with grooming her successor.

353
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,025
This time, it's a human.

354
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,275
So, rest easy.

355
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,900
[CHRIS] You're studying
that stuff again?

356
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,942
Do you wanna be a doctor?

357
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,525
You've been doing that
ever since Annie disappeared.

358
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,442
Why, though?

359
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,067
Not Annie. Bela.

360
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,858
[GROUP]
Huh?

361
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,108
She's... alive.

362
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,942
Welcome home, Sonia!

363

[SONIA laughs]

364
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,025
Glad to be home, Harazy.

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,192
Did you behave yourself?

366
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,275
[HARAZY]
Mm-hmm!
