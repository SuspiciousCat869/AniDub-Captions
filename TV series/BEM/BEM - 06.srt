a humanoid monster too.

Yeah, it's totally crazy!

25
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,608
It's the big circus that they
put on in the Outside arena,

26
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,275
but the tricks are
so far beyond anything

Beyond human capability, even!

actually be true!

It's Gravity Man and Harazy!

We're in the dark.

We're thinking maybe
another humanoid monster?

What now?
Anything new from above?

53
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,025
Val Titan.

54
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:34,442
He was a foreign astronaut.

55
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,900
[WOODS] What kind of "foreign"
we talkin' about here?

[FELT]
That isn't relevant.

Evacuated from the lunar
surface with a fatal wound.

58
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,775
But it didn't kill him. He
escaped from a military hospital

59
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,150
two years ago
and fled the country.

60
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,775
The incident that caused
his wound also granted him

61
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,775
a special ability.

62
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,817
Great, so it is another monster.

63
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,233
It's too early for
us to assume that.

64
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,858
So you're telling us
to go find him, then?

65
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,608
[FELT] This man is known
to be in Libra City.

66
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,775
He's responsible for the corpse.

67
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:06,317
Frankly, he's nothing but
a distraction from Alpha,

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,150
but we have our orders.

69

We are to apprehend
Titan and hand him over.

To who?

71
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:14,317
If he's a suspect
in these murders,

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
our investigation
should take priority.

and understand the politics

Where are you going?

We spoke to a witness who
said he saw Gravity Man

at the scene,
and I'd like to find out

what he was doing there.

Who's this Gravity Man?
Some kinda monster too?

He's the show's biggest draw.

he actually has superpowers.

He can make a brick

heavy as a boulder.

I couldn't tell you.

He's quite talented,

Though I can't imagine his

And behind the mask, does
he look something like this?

as good as mine, friend.

is the prime suspect!

he kidnapped her!

[VAL] I met her at
a military hospital.

305
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,942
I was the leader
of a lunar expedition,

306
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,067
there was an incident
on the surface,

307
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,233
and I was knocked unconscious.

308
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,483
I was found on
the lunar surface,

309
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,525
and before I knew it,
50 years had passed.

310
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,692
They told me I had been
pulled through spacetime

311
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,858
by a gravitational singularity,

312
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,400
and it changed me,
mind and body.

313
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,900
I couldn't breathe in the
earth's atmosphere anymore.

314
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,608
My own planet's air was poison.

315
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:57,192
I could no longer be
called a human being.

316
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,942
So they kept me around
as a guinea pig,

317
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:02,483
and told the world I was dead.

318
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,942
Then one day,
they brought in Harazy.

319
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,983
Even back then,
she already had a reputation.

320
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,817
They called her a witch.

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,108

She's a good girl
with a sensitive soul.

324
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,817
But to those monsters,
she was just one more subject

I could not let it go on.

328
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,942
I had to break out,
for her sake.

329
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,733
We've been together ever since.

330
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,483
We're all we have in the world.

331
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:48,483
She's not my blood,
but we are a family.

332
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,775
I see, and what
about your powers?

333
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,192
[VAL]
What do you mean?

334
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,067
Your abilities should be
more than enough to fight with,

335
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,233
but earlier, you pointed
a gun at me.

336
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,317
It's fine.

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,692
Once you've escaped from here,

338
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,942
I hope you'll never
have to fight again.

Annie.

00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,358
I don't know how to say this,
but from the way you act,

343
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:33,400
you almost seem...

344
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:34,483
Yeah.

345
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,317
I'm further from human
than you are.

346
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,233
[VAL]
Sorry.

347
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,483
I'm just kidding.

348
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,608
Take care, Harazy.

[ACES 06A]
We have the target surrounded.

352

End it here.

[ACES 06A]
Right!

Are you trying to kill him?

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,025

[VAL]
Harazy.

00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,525
I never wanted
to leave your side.

00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,817
I'm sorry I can't stay with you.

Please be strong.

Hold on to the kindness in
your heart, no matter what.

I'm scared.
Val, what do you mean?

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,025
Please.
I don't want to be alone!

Goodbye.

It was Harazy you were
after from the beginning.

387
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:28,650
She was the one
who had the abilities.

388
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,733
Val was trying to keep
her safe from people

00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,442
who wanted to use her.

390
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,317
Unwarranted speculation.

391
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,233
You spread rumors across the
web to turn public opinion

392
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,775
against Gravity Man, right?

393
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:41,358
And you manipulated Harazy
into using up her power

394
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,733
so you could capture her.

395
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,775
You strong-armed a
little girl into custody.

Was all that under the
orders of the unseen--

That's enough, Officer Summers.

So, what is that girl?

399
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,192
[BELA]
A human being.

Then what's that make us?
