That seems like a pretty
vulgar way of thinking.

Call it whatever you want.

164
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,358
This city, this country,
the whole world,

165
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,733
all of it has to change.

166
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:59,192
I don't care about clothes
and the cars and the cameras.

167

It's about doing what's right.

168
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,817
It's about love
for our fellow man.

169
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,192
The love that compels
us to feed the hungry

170
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,733
and protect the weak.

171
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,942
I won't spend
my money on myself.

172

I will use it to
build a better world.

173

Bem, you're in pain,
and I want to help.

174
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,483
I want to make you human.

Can you? Even now?

176

You lost everything, didn't you?

The bribery scandal.

178
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,942
It's been a nightmare.

179
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,983
You know, I used to believe
that there's no smoke

180
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,275
without fire.

181
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,608
Then I started hearing
about meetings with people

182
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:42,858

183

documents I'd never seen.

184
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,192
The press turned on me,
cameras lying in ambush

185
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,775
around every corner.

186
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,858
The public had already
reached its verdict.

"The merchant of death."

00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,525
They made the smoke,
and then they lit the fire.

190

Who are "they"?

191
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,442
Libra City knows them well.

192

But who they really are,
nobody can say.

[REPORTER 09A] Public opinion

Gavin Briggs

It's not true!

the whole world fooled

I don't know.

But I want to think he
was telling the truth.

across the whole country,
and even around the globe.

They can turn lies

It's more terrifying than

They turned me into the
godfather of the Outside,

217
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,067
and I never knew a thing.

218
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,775
They even pinned Representative
Carver's murder on me.

219
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,442
And implicated me.

They say that I killed
him on your orders.

221

Carver was on my side,

but they took me to court
on murder-for-hire.

223

And got me put away.

You came to my hearing. I see.

226
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,733
[BEM]
Why did they want you gone?

227
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:55,275
[GAVIN] I was in the way of
the real merchants of death.

228
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,775
I tried to move those conflicts
toward a peaceful resolution.

229
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,858
I managed to get a politician
they needed on my side,

230
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,067
and they couldn't allow that.

231
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,775
[BEM]
And that politician?

Erased.

I didn't want to call you out,

but you've hardly
touched your drink.

235
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,400
It does little for me.

236
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:25,650
We can digest food and drink,
but it's flavorless to us.

237
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:28,733
We need only water to survive.

238
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:32,275
Even among allies, we are alone.

239

We were brought into this world
for reasons we cannot know.

240

[GAVIN]
That's the same for everyone.

241
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:44,233
No living thing is
born with a purpose,

242
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,692
and the only thing
promised at the start

243
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:48,692
is that death is
waiting at the end.

244
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:52,942
So, our only play is to try
to do what feels right to us.

245
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,733
Live as best we can
in the little time we've got.

246
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:01,108
But that time is cut
short for too many people.

247
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,525
It pains me.

248
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,275
We three are not promised
even the release of death.

249
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,150
We are carried ever
forward by the flow of time.

In my long years on earth,
I have observed many humans.

the most of their short lives.

Yeah.

253
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,275
Knowing that our time will
come to an end makes it easier

254
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:24,275
to see the value of it.

My time is not so scarce,

he did anything wrong.

[GAVIN] The other times
we've met up for drinks,

you've been full
of questions for me.

272
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,900
You'd ask why I
wanted to help people

273
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:00,400
and put their needs
ahead of my own.

274

Now I think that must have
been a test to make sure

275
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,567
I was somebody you could trust.

No matter what...

Why would you go
that far for me?

I just can't leave
someone to suffer.

284

And what about you?

00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,983
I know you weren't just

If we continue to help
humans, one day,

we can become humans ourselves.

That is what we have
always believed.

I couldn't explain how this
transformation might occur.

Nor what led us to
believe that it could.

That man...

341
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,400
Was he trying to protect me?

00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,775
[BELA] We're supposed to be

[REPORTER 09A] Gavin Briggs,
disgraced former chair

of the Briggs Foundation,

348
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:48,567
has been found dead
on the streets of Outside.

349
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,775
Police attribute his death
to humanoid monster activity.

00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,650
Mr. Briggs had sought
a medical solution

00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,567
to the humanoid monster problem,
but his efforts were stalled...

[DARYL]
I owe you my thanks, Father.

353
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,025
You came so close to
exposing the unseen council.

354
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,358
In the end, you died for it.

355
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,942
And left my path wide open.

356
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,775
[VEGA]
Welcome, my little knight.
