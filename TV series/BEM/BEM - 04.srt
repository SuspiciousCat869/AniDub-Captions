died from electrocution,

At each scene, a powder was
found near the victim's corpse.

Hey! What the hell
have you done to me?

319
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,942
It's like I'm covered
in stone, or--

This is your lightning.

00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:45,733
Take it back.

I don't get it.

00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:25,983
Why?

326
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,858
Why would a monstrosity
protect me?

327
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,900
That sure was exhausting.

328
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,858
Why'd you decide to show up?

[BELO]
Felt like it.

We're still monsters.

Though that may be the case...

There are certain things
we just have to do.

[VEGA] Excellent work.
You've all done well.

[AIDE 01A] It seems that others
have begun calling them

339
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,775
"monstrosities."

340
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:25,483
Interesting. But incorrect.

341
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,483
Monstrosity is not
the right word.

342
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,900
Those specimens
should be referred to

as humanoid monsters.

I apologize for
the inconvenience

this will cause you all,

00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,650
but I must ask that
you capture them

Father.

Please give me strength.

There. Nice and clean.
