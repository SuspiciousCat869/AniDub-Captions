194

his grandmother has
me trying new things.

195

Well, if you don't want them...

196

Hey, back off,
I never said that.

197
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,630
It's like a party in my mouth.

Please, Mrs. Mikado,
let us help.

Why don't you come
hang out for a bit?

Aren't you tired after
making all that food?

'Cause they so fresh, yo.

‐Have you lost it?

That's gonna taste
totally gross!

212
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,083
Now get out of the kitchen
before I get majorly agro!

213
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,626
Don't worry about Gao, Mom.

214

He'll be just fine.

215

Mighty Sun Fighter uniform

Well now it's the
perfect size for Gao.

218

I've even caught him
sleeping in it.

219

(sobbing)

223
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,325
I promised myself I wouldn't
cry like this anymore.

224
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,081
I know you're with us in spirit.

225
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,332
I'm okay.

226
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,416
(sniffling)

227
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,461
I've been so scared
that someday Gao and Hana

228
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,879
would end up like you.

229
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,840
Maybe it's crazy,
but I thought that...

230
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,134
if I kept them close to
me for as long as I could

231
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,927
that they'd be safe.

232
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,012
That's why I force
Gao to train with me

233
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,640
every day and always
worry about where he is.

234
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,434
Oh, pretty silly, huh?

235
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,938
But, today I realized something.

236
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,690
Gao's got his own path now,

237
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,650
and it's turned out
surprisingly different

238
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,610
from yours, Yota.

239
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,697
And Hana's, too.

240
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,449
I guess it's about time
I finally give him this,

241
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,951
isn't it?

242
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,662
Gao, get over here
on the double!

243
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,956
Sorry, dear.

244
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,457
Here, take this.

245
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,042
Where did this come from, Mom?

246
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,628
I found it mixed in
with some of Yota's things.

247
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
Hmm?

248
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,007
I have no clue why
he had just one card,

249
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,592
but what I do know is this:

250
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,428
Yota kept it with
him all the time.

251
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,929
I never knew about it.

252
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
He would've wanted
you to have it.

253
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,099
Yeah?

254
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,934
And I think you should use it.

255
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,979
That would've made
him very happy.

256
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,440
