As you can imagine, children

Could you tell our viewers
why you're handing out

188
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,951
the Dark Core Deck Cases?

189
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,662
Of course, it's part of
our plan to save the world

190
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,623
from the impending invasion
from Darkness Dragon World.

191
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,085
Oh, I see, but I don't
understand how the distribution

192
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,963
of the cases could lead to
the survival of our world.

193
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,007
Well, if we're forced to
fight against the monsters

194
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,050
of Darkness Dragon World,
we're going to need

195
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,053
all hands on deck,
especially the kids.

196
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,181
They're the only
ones who can control

197
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,184
the phenomenal power
of Disaster Force.

198
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,977
You'll remember
we first witnessed

199
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,771
Disaster Force at the Gaen Cup.

200
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,774
Team Purgatory's Rouga
Aragami was the first

201
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,860
to demonstrate this
incredible ability.

202
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,404
Followed by his teammate,
Sofia Sakharov,

203
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,448
they surprised everyone
when they made

204
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,409
the power of their cards real.

205
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,162
Yes, the Dark Core Deck
Case is the only way

206
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,332
someone can tap into
this unstoppable power.

207
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,083
But Disaster?

208
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,960
Many of our viewers
have concerns about

209
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,796
the sense of doom
the name conveys.

210
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,925
We're committed to preventing
all kinds of disasters.

211
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,551
That's why we gave it that name.

212
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,803
I chose it myself.

213
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,764
I've got a few names for him.

214
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,224
Tell me you're not
cool with this.

215
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,017
‐Cool with what?
‐Doesn't it bother you

216
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,186
how many lies are coming
out of this guy's mouth?

217
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,022
Sure, but what he says won't
matter when we win the fight

218
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,192
and show everyone that he's
not who they think he is.

219
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,195
Agh, I can't wait
to beat this guy!

220
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,697
You said it, let's go.

221
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,658
Where to now?

222
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,201
We got some work to do.

223
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,788
Let's kick Explosive
Dragon Fang up a notch.

224
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,878
Are you really gonna
go through with it, bro?

225
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,048
Fighting Kyoya Gaen
is a huge deal.

226
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,842
If you ask me, I think
it's a big mistake.

227
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,220
Really, Z?

228
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,514
‐Not you too?
‐What's your beef?

‐Isn't it obvious?
‐I miss a lot of stuff.

231

Ever since his publicity
stunt on network TV,

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,441
Kyoya's gotten a fresh
rep as Earth's big hero,

233
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,152
and by fighting against him,
those who don't know Gao

234
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,780
will see him as some bad guy.

235
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,740
But that's not really fair.

I mean, it's not like
Gao's done anything wrong.

237

I can't believe the whole
world's been conned

238
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,000
by Kyoya Gaen's power and
charisma, it turns my stomach.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,211
What's worse is that he's giving
away those Dark Core Deck Case

unsuspecting Disaster members.

I'll never forget it.

320
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,520
Now, I know you have
this big fight coming up.

321
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,355
‐Are you okay?
‐I don't know.

322
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,440
There's so much riding
on the outcome.

323
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,235
The entire future of the
world is all up to me.

324
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,989
It's a lot of pressure
to be under.

325
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,491
It's not just that Kyoya's
an awesome Buddyfighter.

326
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,661
I mean, he beat you so he
must be really skilled.

327
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,790
It's the fact that everyone
thinks he's some kinda hero.

328
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,334
People actually think
he's trying to help them.

329
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,837
Like he'll protect them from
the Darkness Dragon World.

330
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,338
What a joke!

331
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,633
I wish there was some way
I'd be guaranteed not to lose.

332
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,388
Gao!

333
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,057
That's enough of
that talk, ya hear?

334
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,268
Don't forget half the
battle of winning a match

335
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,228
like this is staying positive.

336
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,647
Come on, kid, what you need
to be thinking about now

337
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,192
isn't a way not to lose, but
a way you can win the fight!

338
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,778
You taught me that, remember?

339
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,947
When we first became buddies!

340
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,408
It was your confidence
and courage that made me

341
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:41,329
wanna be your Buddy
in the first place.

342
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,706
Come on, what's the matter?

343
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,417
Easy, Drum, what we should
be thinking about now

344
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,754
is not how to avoid losing,

345
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,049
but how we're gonna win.

346
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,800
Draw!

347
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,385
Time to charge, eh?

348
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,097
Just 'cause you used Dragobrave
doesn't guarantee you the win!

349
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,433
Tasuku's only holding
size two monsters

350

and offensive spell
cards in his hand.

351
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,604
And how do you know that?

352
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,273
If he doesn't, then there's
no chance I can win.

353
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,400
The only way I'm gonna
defeat him is for me

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,903
to believe in myself
and make the draw!
