Tasuku's Gold Ritter,

can win this thing.

You're a quick one, aren't ya?

Or maybe even a unicorn?

325

Either way, I'll have to start
putting some effort into this.

the Cold Blade in the center.

your own monster

335

so you could open up the center?

336
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,254
It's no different from
what you did to Jack,

and gives the fighter

475
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,797
‐some wicked defense!
‐It's true,

476
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:05,341
and if the opponent can't
beat his 10,000 defense,

477
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,010
he won't receive any damage.

478
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,928
That's not all, even
if a fighter is hit with

479
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,055
a link attack, the damage
becomes two points.

480
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,641
It sounds totally unbeatable!

481
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,976
So what do you think, guys?

482
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,519
You think you can
open up one of these?

483
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,439
(together)
You'll never know until you try!

Next time, Disaster figures out
a way to control Buddy Monsters,

Reaper took have been turned

puppets, even Tsukikage!
