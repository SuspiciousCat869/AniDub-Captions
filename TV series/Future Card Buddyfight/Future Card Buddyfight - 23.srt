That's just it, we're
all solo acts, Dragon.

300

We've never had to
work as a team before!

301

Let's talk about it when
you're all out of my grill.

302
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,180
The only thing
legendary about you

303
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,015
is being a legendary
pain in the butt!

304
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,350
Listen, guys, I
know we can do this!

305
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,561
(grunting)

306
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,980
‐What's our plan again?
‐I say we retreat.

307
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,775
That word's not in the
legendary phrase vocabulary!

308
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,985
I need a few more seconds
to find his weakness!

309
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,320
Ahh!

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,823
I've gotta figure out how I
can get these guys to cooperate!

311
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,659
A question for you.

312
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,912
If no one hears
a baby dragon cry,

313
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,039
‐is it quiet?
‐Huh?

314
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,625
You've convinced yourself
that you lack strength,

315
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,086
‐but are you sure that's it?
‐I got it!

316
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,464
That baby was crying because
he couldn't do what he wanted!

317
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,174
It's so obvious now!

318
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,592
So then I have
to let these guys

319
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,178
do exactly what they wanna do.

320
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,931
How about a formation?

321
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,683
Baku to the right,
Tetsuya to the left,

322
