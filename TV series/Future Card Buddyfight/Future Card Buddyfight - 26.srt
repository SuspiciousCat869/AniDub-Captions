What focus, what
concentration!

167
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,251
He's juggling the two
card Soul Guard out there.

168
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,837
Alright, he's really
stepping it up!

169
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,923
To master Ancient World,
you've got to use combo decks.

170
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,884
Genma knows Duel Sieger
needs a boatload of gauge,

171
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,469
so he's making it happen.

172
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,012
His strategy always
stays the same,

173
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,223
no matter what
fighter he's up against,

174
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,475
but it works
almost every time.

175
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,103
He would make a
really good ninja.

176

This is going perfectly.

177

right into our hands.

178

Glad to see some
things never change.

184
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,543
Now Kemura gets
his first turn.

the faint of heart.

He's actually drawing
with his tongue.

188
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,179
It's grossing me out.

189
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,847
Good thing
Suzuha's not here.

190
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,557
She'd probably
faint again.

Hey, now, get a
hold of yourself.

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,897
Wake up.

194

Slime and goo never
really bother me.

Why don't you cheer
him on for once?

199

I vow never to be
the kind of leader

488
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,484
who makes excuses
for his failures.

489
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,236
I made a mistake
and I'm sorry.

490
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,071
I must continue training.

He's really upset
about that card.

496
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,007
Are you mad at me?

497
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,592
Did I mess up?

00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,095
Win.

499
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,015
Not everything.

500

Please don't cry!

501

I'm sorry I didn't
pay more attention!

502
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,693
So, if he didn't put the
card in his deck, who did?

Don't know.

Unless.

Hey!

506
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,160
You gave it to him,
didn't you, Rouga?

I am the mastermind!

509
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,875
Even a fool and his
flying bug have their uses.

510
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,377
It was worth the risk.

511
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,003
And now we have our reward.

512
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,881
A cunning move
to secure the win.

513
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,344
Wasn't that Kem‐boy's
first victory, like, ever?

514
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,305
And what do you think,
Mr. Aragami?

515
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,891
My brilliantly devised
scheme worked perfectly,

516
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,143
wouldn't you agree?

517
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:37,481
We won, and that is
always the objective.

518
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,442
But still, it was
a cheap way to win.

Jackknife "Beistand".

526
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,087
Man, I've never seen
an evolved form like this.

527
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,171
Tell me about it!

528
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,883
Jack can evolve into
lots of different forms.

529
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,384
The great thing
about Beistand

530
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,261
is that he lets me take
one dragon shield card

531
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,263
from the drop zone and
return it to my hand.

532
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,681
That's totally awesome!

533
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,559
I'd give anything to have
one of them in my deck.

So, what do you think, guys?

You think you can
open one of these?

You'll never know
