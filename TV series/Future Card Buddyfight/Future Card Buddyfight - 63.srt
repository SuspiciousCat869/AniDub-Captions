Dragon Ein.

165
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,745
Hold the phone!

166
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,123
Can anyone tell
me what that is?

167
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,999
Oh, right,
no one else is here.

168
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,253
It's just like Tasuku
said it would be.

169
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,754
Dragon Ein?

170
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,630
His flag's unique.

171
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,298
It doesn't represent
a specific world

172
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,633
like yours or mine.

173
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,843
It's special.

174
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,469
It allows him
to use any card

175
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,847
that has dragon
in its attributes.

176
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,515
It limits him to
four cards in his hand,

177
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,976
but he starts out with
twelve life points.

178
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,354
We're up against a flag card
that has its own ability.

179
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,357
I can't believe that
kind of thing even exists!

180
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,650
I've been
announcing for ages.

181
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,694
Why haven't I
heard about this?

182
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,237
I'd like a rule
confirmation, please.

183
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,822
Is something like
that even allowed?

184
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,782
Of course it is.

185
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,118
And that's
because I'm the one

186
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,786
who actually approved it.

187
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,414
Hey, Tasuku, what brings
you all the way out here?

188
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,042
Come to beg Kyoya
to take you back?

189
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:02,834
Not gonna happen.

190

Look, he's got
Kiri with him, too.

193

Remember how weak he was
before we helped him?

194
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,718
This is gonna be fun.

195

We don't want
to fight you guys.

we have a choice.

Charge and draw.

226
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:42,267
I call Thousand Rapier Dragon

Go on, attack the fighter!

End of move.

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
As he's never been seen
in competition before,

232
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,113
all eyes are sure to be
fixed on Kyoya's first move.

233
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,116
I draw and
charge and draw.

234
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,951
I cast Dragon
Emperor Legend.

235
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,870
That spell increases
his life gauge

236
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,788
and the cards
in his hand all by one.

237
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,291
Interesting, that card
is from Ancient World.

238
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,625
So he can use spell cards

239
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,044
with dragon in
the attribute, too?

240
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:14,132
Next I chose to cast
Divine Dragon Creation.

241
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,300
He just gave up
two life points

242
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,802
to increase the number
of cards in his hand.

00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,803
For my next move,

244
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,222
I'll set the spell,
Dragon Throne.

245
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,265
I'm at a loss.

246
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,892
I don't know that card.

247
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,310
It's a spell that
can only be played

248
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,686
when the Dragon
Ein flag is used.

249
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,522
It boosts the maximum size
of monsters I can call

250
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,982
from three to four.

251
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:31,983
He's kidding, right?

252
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,443
Did he say size four?

253
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,278
None of my spells
or items in the field

254
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,947
can be destroyed
or returned to my hand.

255
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,116
What it means is that
the Dragon Throne spell

256
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
can never be undone.

257

Soon your need for
victory will consume you

Gael Korga to the right.

Clearly there's no holds
barred in this fight!

354

Somehow Gao managed
to survive that round,

but he's clearly outmatched.

369
