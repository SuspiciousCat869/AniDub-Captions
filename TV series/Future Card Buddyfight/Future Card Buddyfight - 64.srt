There's a rift in reality

when they link us
to parallel worlds

it to our game.

It doesn't matter.

228

this world has no need

Oh, really?

Just think about it
for a second, everyone.

233
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,788
Our world is divided
by our differences.

the languages we speak.

236
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,584
These divisions
have led us to have

different views and values.

238

Our different
ways of thinking

life more fun!

Kyoya, you may not
think so now,

friends again.

It seems the world

I don't know about that,

For sure!

I'll be looking

That's the best
part of this game,

anyone can make friends

Maybe you can start
hanging out with us, too.

An unsanctioned experiment

team of scientists?

That's their
explanation for why

525
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,847
such a massive particle
accelerator was built?

526
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,099
That's right,
allegedly Kyoya Gaen

527

knew nothing
about any of it.

But he is taking
full responsibility

529

in stepping down as
head of operations.

The Gaen Financial
Group did what?

Apparently, they've withdrawn
their controlling interest

534

No, I'm not saying that.
