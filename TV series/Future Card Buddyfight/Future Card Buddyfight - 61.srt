and the rest of
us Disaster members.

205
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,802
We've known about
their plan for some time

206
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,804
but that's the reason
we've all been learning

207
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,306
to perfect our use
of Disaster Force.

208

these devastating monsters

Why didn't he tell us?

I guess the secret's out.

212
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,652
I'll tell you everything
you wanna know.

213
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,780
It began with my company's
applied sciences division.

214
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,323
While researching Buddy cards,

215
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,908
we stumbled upon
the existence

216
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,701
of Darkness Dragon World,

217
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,579
which until then was no
more than an urban legend.

218
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,998
We uncovered their plot
to invade earth.

219
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,751
At first, we just trapped
them in Buddy cards

220
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,753
but we knew this
wouldn't work forever.

221
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,464
The only way to defeat them
would be to harness the power

222
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,550
that the Dark Core unleashes,

223
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,926
the Disaster Force.

224
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,678
We've been training
those gifted fighters

225
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,805
who are able to use it.

226
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,933
But why didn't you report this
discovery to the Buddy Police?

227
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,560
I'll tell you why!

228
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,604
Because you adults have shown
that you cannot be trusted!

229
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,480
Hm?

230
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,274
That can't be true.

231
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,608
It was four years ago,

232
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,110
after that terrible day,

233
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,946
when I decided that things
needed to change.

234
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,991
I knew I had to grow up
and become an adult

235
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,410
so that I could
help other kids.

236
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,578
If that's true,

237
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,913
then why did you become
a member of Disaster?

238
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,456
You know why!

239
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,293
You let the Buddy Police
fall to Nobari.

240
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,670
After that,
the only option I had

241
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,380
was to join Kyoya.

242
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,382

the only way that could happen!

Selected children
from all over the world

496
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,736
will tap into their
Disaster Force potential

497
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,238
and together we'll help
form a giant gateway.

498
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,406
Listen to yourselves.

499
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,325
You can't really be serious.

500
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,787
We'll tell everyone
everything you just told us!

501
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,580
Do what you think is best.

502
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,081
You don't care?

503
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,876
You forget, everyone thinks
that young Master Kyoya

504
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,503
is the hero of the hour.

505
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,588
Do you really think
they're going to believe

506
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,381
what you say?

507
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,636
Then maybe I'll just have to
beat you in a Buddyfight!

508
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,805
It won't take long
for people to see you

509
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,015
for what you really are.

510
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,517
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

511
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,811
but we're coming back live
from our commercial break,

512
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,896
so do you think it would
be all right if I interviewed

513
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:54,939
the winner now?

514
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,233
I've got something better.

515
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,568
Attention,
now hear this!

516
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,571
Great news, I have just
been challenged to a Buddyfight

517
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,031
by Gao Mikado!

518
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,575
And, of course,
I intend to accept.

519
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,285
Are you sure about that, Gao?

520
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,121
Challenging our hero,
Kyoya Gaen, to a Buddyfight?

521
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,498
I know you've
never lost a fight,

522
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,375
but think about
what you're doing.

523
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,545
Making an enemy of Kyoya Gaen
is not the best choice.

524
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,422
I mean, it's like making
the whole world your enemy.

525
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,841
Well, this oughta be good.

526
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,009
Looks like Gao's
in over his head.

527
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,054
I'll take care of all
the arrangements personally.

528
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,223
I'm looking forward to it, Gao.

529
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,476
Everything that happens
is as Master Kyoya wishes.

530
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,980
Going against him is
like going against nature.

531
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,982
Whatever, even if
the whole world

532
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,942
is against us like you say,

533
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,820
I'll fight alongside
this kid to the very end

534
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,365
because we have a bond that
you could never understand!

535
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,201
We're Buddies!

536
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,579
‐It's time for...
‐Tasuku and Gao's...

537
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,789
‐Card of the day!
‐Card of the day!

538
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,542
Today we're gonna talk to you
about the really cool set spell,

539
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,043
Dragon Return System.

540
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,670
Yeah, it's a good card to have.

541
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,505
When one of your monsters
returns to your deck,

542
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,340
your gauge is boosted by one!

543
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,593
In the event your life
points would become zero,

544
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,428
you can discard the
top card of your deck

545
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,679
to your drop zone

546
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,347
and if that top card's
a spell card...

547
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,557
You're back in the game

548
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,517
'cause your life points
would become two!

549
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,852
So what do ya think, guys?

550
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,395
You think you can
open up one of these?

551
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,856
You'll never know
until you try!

552
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,901
♪

553
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,992
Next time, Gao squares
off with Kyoya Gaen

554
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,660
and while the Dark Core replicas

555
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,995
start to wreak havoc,

556
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,788
Tasuku pays Gao a visit

557
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,957
and you won't believe
what he tells him!

558
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,083
Next episode:

559
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,919
