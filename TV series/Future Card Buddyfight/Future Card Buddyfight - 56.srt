things like that,

all of his friends.

one prodigy to train

it is to build decks

your interest and imagination.

And when you were ready,

249

I planned on teaching
you everything I knew.

even by another
card's ability.

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,780
To win a game
of Buddyfight,

350
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,531
you must open up
the opponent's center

351
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,784
and cause damage
directly to the fighter.

352
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,078
And all this time
I had no idea!

353
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,372
The number of cards
that you usually gain

354
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,707
in a turn is one.

355
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,209
So if you mount
a strong defense

356
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,919
that your opponent
can't surpass

357
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,837
and use double attacks
to make that opponent

358
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,799
use at least two
cards per turn...

359
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,425
well...

360
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,720
then victory will
automatically become yours.

361
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,514
His strategy is
to protect himself

362
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,307
and make his opponent
quickly use up all

363
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,350
of their cards.

364
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,477

if you ask me.

366
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,230
It lacks the excitement

367
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,274
and offers no
opportunities to shine.

368
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,526
No wonder this bonehead

369

of the desire to fight.

373
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,120
As everyone knows,
the goddess of victory

374

never smiles on
those without desire.

Gao's not going
down without a fight.

378
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,047
Since his life
is below five,

379
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,674
his spell lets him
draw two cards

380
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,842
by paying two gauge.

381

give up, kem.

give you more cards?

Final Phase!

504
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,485
Hah!

505
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,028
You've changed.

506
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,822
I cast...

507
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,865
Hey, Retsu...

508
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,700
What is it?

509
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,451
Building decks is
the biggest thrill

510
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,494
I've ever had.

511
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,038
Promise me that you'll
teach me even more?

512
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,623
All right, I promise.

513
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,834
But real deck building
takes a very calm

514
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,001
and cool head, Baks.

515
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,795
Hah, don't worry about me!

516
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,672
So, should I call
you coach or what?

517
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,756
Huh?

Sometimes when
a deck builder

543
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,654
caters to a fighter's wishes,

544
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,615
an unpredictable
power is born.

545
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,659
I refuse to accept that.

546
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,786
Regardless...

547
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,455
I'd like you to make my
deck even better than it is.

548
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,542
After what you've just seen...

you can't refuse my wishes.

We now have an important
announcement from our

552
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,891
Please welcome,
Mr. Kyoya Gaen.

553
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,643
Amazingly, with
all the excitement,

554
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,896
the Gaen Cup is
already at the finals.

555
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,856
And this will serve
as the last surprise

556
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,817
you'll see from me.

The pairing what?

560
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,115
The first game will
be Sofia Sakharov

561
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,409
versus Tetsuya Kurodake.

562
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,287
The second game will be
Rouga Aragami versus

will be Purgatory Knight,

aka my boyfriend,

It's totally obvious
he's up to something

fights in this way.

I say we keep rolling
with the punches.

you nullify
