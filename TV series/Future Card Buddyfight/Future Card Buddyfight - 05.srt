hang out with us?

They're completely

Hands off, they
smell like sardines!

109
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,296
You see, the reasoning
is that all monsters,

not limited to
dragons by the way,

111

are beings that have come
here from other worlds.

important material that's needed

457
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,045
to make the core deck cases that
are given to Buddyfighters is

458
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,089
a mineral called photon metal.

459
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,009
And the place with the largest
reserve of this oh so precious

460
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,720
mineral is Fuji
Photon Metal Mine.

it from intruders,

but now that they've
all been destroyed,

463
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,852
who's gonna be able
to protect it?

464
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,520
Can you open a Buddy rare card?

465
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,813
What do you think?

466
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,491
On the next Buddyfight, Gao
is challenged by eighth grader

467
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,704
Rouga Aragami, and the match
is pretty even until Gao does

468
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,580
something truly amazing.

469
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,790
