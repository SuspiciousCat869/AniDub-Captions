Kanahebi's got a pretty
unique fighting style.

343
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,773
He's not the type
who'd use an impact card

344

or equip an item and
attack an opponent himself.

345

Being a fan of
ninja warfare,

346
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,613
Zanya predicted how
Kanahebi'd play it.

347
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,324
That's why he ditched
the Lethal Formation.

that in English, yo?

It's all about
the activation.

350
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,704
Lethal Formation's triggered

351
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,875
when an opponent uses an
impact, item or spell card.

352
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,670
But since Kanahebi doesn't
even use two of these,

353
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,421
playing it
would be a waste.

356
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,386
that's activated
by an impact card.
