Get ready for a cool new
card game that connects

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,965
to a parallel universe.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,344
Special cards act as portals
bringing monsters to Earth

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,596
to become buddies
with humans,

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,805
and through
friendship and courage,

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,016
help them take on
fight challenges.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,061
It's called Buddyfight.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:24,024
Tasuku Ryuenji, I'll seek
revenge until my last breath!

They've come for us, Wolf.

The one and only fighter the
boy considers a worthy opponent

attends the Buddyfighting
school, Aibo Academy.

Maybe if I beat this rival
Tasuku will come forward.

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,758
Yes, what is his name?

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,178
Gao Mikado.

It's time I started to get
real about taking down Gao.

19
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,827
I'll show that noob!

20
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,037
Hands off!

21
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,623
Huh, Armorknight Eagle?

00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,083
No way!

Rouga Aragami?

Wait, why are you...
I, uh, what I mean is

00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,422
what do you want with me?

I'm just a second‐rank
sixth grade Buddyfighter.

27
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,637
I don't want you,
I'm looking for Gao Mikado.

28
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,806
It's very important
that I speak to him.

Yeah, kitten shirt,
you know him?

Hey, it's a tiger!

31
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:09,690
Uh, what would someone like you
possibly want with that doofus?

32
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,529
I cast Green Dragon Shield.

33
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,948
Five out of ten.

34
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,491
Very funny.

35
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,494
Tasuku was so good at it.

‐Hmm.
‐Hi, there, Gao!

00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, hi, Kiri!

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,252
What are you up to?

40
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,087
Well, I was, uh‐‐

‐Hey, guys!
‐Hmm?

42
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,841
Baku just finished
building your deck.

43
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,467
‐Uh?
‐I balanced out adding

44
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,513
Gargantua Punisher by throwing
in four Drum Bunker Dragons,

45

Pile Bunker Dragon, and
Steel Fist Dragoknuckle.

46
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,726
It's a super
aggressive deck

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,353
and might just
be my finest work.

48
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,855
Sounds sweet!

49
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,022
Come on, let's try it out.

50
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,275
No way, this deck is
way too complicated

51
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,861
for a total beginner
like you to handle.

52
00:03:55,861 --> 00:04:00,240
Mmm, man, what's it gonna
take for you to believe in me?

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,783
You can start with your lunch.

00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,172
Yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo,

‐Tetsuya, stop goofing around!

56
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,385
Yo, yo, why so serious, amigo?

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:25,140
Because if you loose focus
then somebody's gonna get hurt.

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,433
Sorry, yo.

59
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,852
So how does Gao know so
much about this stuff?

60
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,480
He's won three consecutive
national championships

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,732
with his Mikado‐style
Aiki‐jujutsu.

62
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,900
What?

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,110
He competes against adults?

64
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,570
Yep, and he's also
trained in judo,

65
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,405
so they made him
our instructor.

So cool!

Hey, Sun Fighter,

he wants to ask ya!

Better watch it,
yo, Gao's not

70
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,165
in a good mood today,
you know what I'm saying?

71
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,334
‐Stop talking, right now.
‐Stop talking!

72
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,585
Uh!

74
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,923
We're right in the
middle of our judo class,

75
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,174
so can it wait?

76
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,383
Are you all right?

‐Yeah, Tetsuya's cool.
‐Hmph!

Hey, wait is that...

79
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,557
Rouga Aragami's the top‐ranking
fighter in the eighth grade.

80
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,643
So what do you think
he wants with Gao?

81
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:16,066
Funny, being the only rival
Tasuku Ryuenji acknowledges,

82
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,901
I was expecting a little more.

83
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,611
Am I supposed to
guess what you want?

84
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,988
I challenge you to a Buddyfight
during the lunch break.

85
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,616
Come to the fighting
stage and don't be late.

86
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,409
To the fighting stage, rah!

87
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,246
And why would I want to
accept a challenge from you?

88
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,916
Because of what I said
to you the other day at Castle.

89
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,293
Remember, the only
thing of any value

90
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,295
in this world is winning.

91
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,715
I disagreed then, and I
disagree with you now.

92
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,509
And that's why you'll
accept my challenge,

93
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,637
because you claim not to
care if you win or lose.

94
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,888
Win or lose!

95
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,098
I don't buy it.

96
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,392
You don't really care
about taking me on at all.

97
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,894
I'm just part of some scheme
of yours to fight my friend,

98
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,314
Tasuku, and I don't
want any part of it.

99
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,526
You little... aah!

100
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,153
I've seen it a thousand times
but the banana peel gag never

101
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,364
gets old, ha, ha, ha, ha!

102
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,157
It's like you're
always telling me,

103
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,952
every tense situation
needs some comic relief.

104
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,996
Asmodai is your buddy, huh?

105
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,373
You punk, you'll
pay for humiliating

106
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,584
the great Rouga Aragami.

107
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,794
Let me guess, the
fighting stage at lunch?

108
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,421
You're on, we'll be there.

109
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,672
Ah!

110
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,508
Gao, do you really think
Tetsuya should fight him?

111
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,718
Hmm.

112
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,804
Nothing yet.

113
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,681
We're still trying to
uncover why the satellite

114
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,974
self‐destructed.

115
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,894
And Wolf's abilities...
do you think he was using

116
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,353
Future Force as well?

117
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,898
We don't know, but the fact
he stole Photon Metal suggests

118
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,443
he's planning to recruit an army
of fighters and outfit them

119
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,653
‐with the special power as well.
‐Huh?

120
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,530
He'll most likely
target youngsters

121
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,116
with natural
Buddyfighting abilities.

122
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,119
If that's the case, then
the first place he'll look

123
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,203
will be...

124
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,747
Aibo Academy.

125
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,209
Buddy...

126
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,170
Fight, woo!

127
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,255
‐Raise the flag.
‐Raise the flag.

128
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,882
Magic World.

129
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,553
Danger World.

130
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,143
Rouga will go first.

131
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,811
Charge and draw.

132
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,398
I Buddy call Armorknight
Eagle to the center area.

133
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,443
With a Buddy gift, Rouga
now has 11 life points.

134
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,111
Buddy call already?

135
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,115
Out of the darkness,
leaving destruction in his wake,

136
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,078
I call Armorknight
Demon to the right!

137
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,371
And give him Eagle!

138
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,542
(roars)

139
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,091
(screaming)

140
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,677
He sacrificed his Buddy
to the Armorknight Demon??

141
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,638
It has 9,000 power
and 8,000 defense.

142
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,099
There isn't a single card
in Tetsuya's deck that can

143
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,600
compete with that.

144
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,187
I equip Boulder Piercing Spear.

145
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,607
Demon attacks, Trident Cannon!

146
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,987
Aah!

147
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,197
End of move.

148
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,573
What an intense attack!

149
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,992
Tetsuya has just
seven points remaining.

150
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,120
It's gonna be almost
impossible for him to defeat

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,331
this powerful demon with
his Magic World deck.

152
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,999
So what gives, huh?

153
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,545
It's not like you to refuse
a challenge from anybody.

154
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,630
It's just that thing he said.

155
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,965
Huh?

156
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,883
That winning is everything.

157
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,928
You see, I used to
think that way, too.

158
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,474
When I first started training in
Aiki‐jujutsu I really loved it.

159
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,311
But the better I got,
the more I hated losing.

160
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,440
Before I knew it, all that
mattered to me was winning

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,191
at any cost.

162
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,652
It was pretty extreme.

163
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,156
I bet you can't
handle this move!

164
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,490
(grunting)

165
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,117
Yah!

166
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,328
He's using our Mikado‐style
throwing technique.

167
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,831
Ah, come on, I didn't
flip you that hard, man.

168
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,583
(crying)

169
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,793
Are you all right, young man?

170
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,004
Oh, no, I think
his wrist is broken.

171
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,839
Huh?

172
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,883
Help me get him to
the first aid station.

173
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,636
(voices whispering)

174
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,478
What were you thinking using
such a dangerous technique?!

175
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,814
I was so obsessed with
winning, I didn't even think

176
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,069
about my opponents, or the
fact that I could hurt people.

177
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,614
It's not a time that
I'm very proud of.

178
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,076
I had to change if I wanted
to have any friends.

179
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,410
I hear ya.

180
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,414
I don't like Rouga because he'll
do whatever it takes to win.

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,083
Oh, my, what's this?

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,336
Tetsuya has called two demon
realm Death Metal Valefars

183
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,587
at once!

184
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,297
What a dilemma, what do I do?

185
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,132
Why not link attack it with two?

186
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,469
My power will grow, double
in size, and give this demon

187
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,845
a big surprise!

188
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,222
I didn't see that coming.

189
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,849
With more power, he'll be able
to smash Armorknight Demon

190
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,976
‐on the right!
‐The right?

191
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,604
I equip Boulder Piercing Spear.

192

Hold on, I see
what Rouga's doing.

193

Tetsuya, no, don't do it!

194

Armorknight Demon.

196

Uh‐huh, uh‐huh.

The Battle Spirit Unite card
has to be used with an item.

209
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,061
So that's why he equipped
it on his first turn.

Rouga really is as
good as they say.

Rouga's preparing

He's really lived up to his
excellent reputation so far.

214
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,368
I call Armorknight
Eagle to the left.

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,955
What, how can he
call another monster

216
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,374
with a size three
demon already out?

217
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,252
Armorknight Eagle is
a size zero monster.

218

We went over that in
class the other day.

Prepare for the Trident Cannon!

221
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,181
Then I cast Solomon's Shield.

222
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,310
Ugh.

223
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,853
‐Ready.
‐Huh?

224
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,814
Now attack him again
with the Trident Cannon.

Yeah!

226
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,151
Hey, how come he's
attacking twice?

227

The only time a player attacks
just once is on the first turn

that Armorknight Demon can

230
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,369
attack twice in one turn.

231
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,164

Aah, I cast Quick Summon,
Beleth to the center!

237

I never get to attack!

Wow, that Drill Bunker sure has
quite a devastating effect.

243
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,116
Even with a monster in the
center area, it's capable

244
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,994
of inflicting four damage
points to an opponent.

245

Game over.

246

Rouga, my man, that
was an awesome fight.

250
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,010
You are so pathetic.

251
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,554
Did you honestly think
that you could defeat me?

252
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,931
You can't defeat me, wah!

253

Hey, Tetsuya's my friend,
you can't talk to him like that!

‐Huh?
‐Hmph.

you want to say to me?

What are you going
to do about it?

260
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,697
‐Struck a nerve!
‐What?

261
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,241
My, you're a sensitive one, huh?

262
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,243
You make it so easy.

263
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,412
He's just the bait
to lure you out!

264
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,913
I'm just bait?

265
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,206
Don't listen to him.

266
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,418
He's just bitter he can't
bust a move like you.

Hmm?

The Mighty Sun Fighter is here!

271

Excellent, we'll meet
here after school.

what a real Buddyfight is!

275

Please, you have to
let me use that deck!

The guy's a bully,
and he embarrassed Tetsuya.

00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,464
Without that deck,
I can't beat him.

You're sure the deck is
strong enough, though, right?

Well, it all comes
down to experience.

The deck can go either way.

It could be a real disaster,

293
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,786

Gao would look like

understand it was wrong.

453

me to try and become friends

462
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,050

a mistake.

468
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,979
What's important is
that you admit to them,

469
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,231
and maybe even
learn a thing or two.

470
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,649
I'll try.

the same mistake.

Next time, I'll arrest Wolf.

Hello, there, I'm Paruko, here
to guide you through the world

474
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,792
of Buddyfight.

475
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,086
Today, we're gonna
talk about monsters.

476
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,422
Buddyfight monsters are
grouped by their world,

477
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,007
but they're divided
even further.

478
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,509
For example, in Dragon
World there are Armordragons

479
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,094
and Dragon Knights.

480
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,847
So if you have more cards
of the same kind of monsters,

481
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,891
it will usually give
you a greater advantage

482
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,726
when you need an
extra edge in a match.

483
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,811
Just keep that in mind
when building your decks,

484
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,770
okay, guys?

485
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,607
