You're right.

also known as the
ABC Cup for short,

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,373
is a major Buddyfight tournament

60
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,624
open to both the elementary

61
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,335
and middle school
students at our school.

62
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,672
It's the number one event for
those in the Buddyfight class.

this is a team competition.

68
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,016
So you'll need to form a
group of two or more students.

I want you to build my deck.

Sure, but only if you
listen to me, okay?

73
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,733
First time for everything.

74
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,402
You're gonna need
an analyst, too.

75
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,278
Am I right?

76
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,613
What's an analyst?

77
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,073
Something you can eat?

78
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,326
An analyst is a person who
keeps track of all the card data

79
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,703
and recommends play strategies.

80
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,954
In other words,

81
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,707
she's a walking,
talking card dictionary.

82
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,666
Wicked!

83
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,042
We can use that!

84
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,669
So now we have a team.

85
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,547
All that's left to do is
come up with a good name.

86
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,382
Huh?

87
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,259
Let's call it

88
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,802
Rising Tiger.

89
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,889
I think that oughtta catch
their attention, hey, guys?

90
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,558
You sure you want
us on your team?

91
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,893
It's just that

92
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,811
we won't be much help.

93
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,105
Yeah, we're not strong
fighters like you are.

94
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,316
We don't even know
how to build a deck.

95
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,817
Hey, not a problem.

96
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,569
You just need to
make up the numbers,

97
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,237
the rest I'll do myself.

98
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,782
You think you even stand
a chance after yesterday?

99
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,910
Yeah, I mean, that Gao
Mikado guy destroyed Rouga

100
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,244
in just one turn.

101
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,913
He obviously just got lucky.

102
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,289
Beating someone
on your first turn

103
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,041
isn't something you can plan.

104
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,044
That guy just fluked
out is all, trust me.

105
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,088
I think our team name should
be the Mighty Sun Fighters.

106
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,340
Huh?

107
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm already the
Mighty Sun Fighter.

108
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,843
You'll be the
Mighty Deck Builder

109
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,470
and you, the Mighty Analyst.

110
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,139
So together we'd be called
the Mighty Sun Fighters.

111
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,182
It's a no brainer.

112

Super cool, don't you think?

113
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,602
Sounds to me like you just
wanna take all the credit.

114
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,812
No way, Jose.

115
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,105
But I will be the
only one fighting.

116
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,399
Let's keep brainstorming, guys.

117
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,735
The Mighty Sun Fighters
is a stupid name.

118
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,028
Fine, who needs ya?

119
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,987
I'll build my own deck!

120
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,239
How hard can it be

121
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,907
to slap a few cards
together anyway?

122
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,283
Oh, yeah, you think so?

123
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,952
In that case I'll never ever

124
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,954
build a deck for you again.

125
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,580
And I'll form my own team.

126
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,791
Good luck with that.

127
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,459

Hey, Geronimo, go
and attack the fighter.

131
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,009
Not bad at all.

132

For a Dragon Knight deck

‐Raise the flag.
‐Raise the flag.

144

Why do you have
to fight about it?

147
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,042
You are gonna regret
running away like this, Baku.

You're already
regretting it, aren't you?

151
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,885
No, not at all.

152
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,471
I think I just need
something to eat.

153

Here you go.

154
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,932
It's high in potassium.

155
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,517
Huh?

156
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,185
Hurry up and eat it, young man,

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

That did the trick.

As a thanks for this banana I,

162
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,574
the grand master
of all deck builders,

163
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,743
will build your deck.

164
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,078
You really mean it?

165
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,498
This deck building
stuff is easy.

166

Hey.

This guy here is one

Yeah, I'm gonna
need this one here,

00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,053
There, my most powerful one yet.

171
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,556
You sure they're all gonna
fit into your deck case?

172
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,266
Nope, not even close.

173
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,225
Didn't think so.

174
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,353
Maybe if I push a little harder.

175
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,063
(ringing)

176
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,565
Kuguru?

177
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,818
She said her house
was supposed to be

178
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,403
around here somewhere, right?

179
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,822
Uh, you mean like that big
one right in front of us?

180
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,033
Oh, yeah.

181
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,076
Man.

182
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,578
Don't tell me she lives here.

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,122
What's this?

184
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,915
Ah!

185
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,707
Hi, guys.

186
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,376
Find the place okay?

187
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,004
Yeah, but what did you want
us to disguise ourselves for?

188
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,798
Please, make yourself at home.

189
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,842
Man, this place is huge.

190
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,761
Hey, those are Baku's shoes.

191
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,097
And that's why you're incognito.

192
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,683
So Tetsuya.

193
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,810
What's the
objective of your deck?

194
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,894
That's easy.

195
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,562
It's to win, of course, yo.

196
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,773
Yeah, but how do
you plan to win?

197
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,774
A speedy attack

198
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,275
or defend and then a counter

199
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,820
or maybe a deadly combo deck?

200
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,446
It all sounds good.

201
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,407
How about just giving
me a little of each.

202
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,950
Come on, you can't
have everything.

203
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,119
That would be like
asking a pro sumo wrestler

204
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,287
to be a gymnast.

205
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,458
Nothing's impossible
for Demon Lord Asmodai.

206
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,379
Sumo gymnast!

207
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,255
Boo‐yah.

208
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,464
He went there.

209
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,551
Anyway, you really need
to start with a focus.

210
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,970
Or maybe a specific
card you wanna use.

211
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,473
Hm.

212
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,266
Sure!

213
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,767
I pick Asmodai.

214
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,018
Huh?

215
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,895
How about a deck with
a bunch of Asmodais

216
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,148
to show off their
wicked skills, yo.

217
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,315
Tetsuya.

218
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,026
Oh yeah, and then we
could call it something

219
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,154
like Asmodai's Crazy
Dance Spectacular Deck.

220
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,948
Actually, I'd prefer
something a little edgier.

221
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,742
Not a problem.

222
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,993
I can work with that.

223
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,494
Yeah, sounds good.

224
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,163
What are we doing here again?

225
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,290
I don't know.

226
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,001
First we'll add more Asmodais.

227
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,420
Give me Asmodai's
trends and abilities.

228
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,504
You got it.

229
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,964
And his synergy.

230
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,715
Wow, yo.

231
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,842
He's racing.

232
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,969
So that's a deck
builder at work.

233
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,721
Amazing.

234
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,806
♪

235
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,682
Game over.

236
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,268
Winner, Naboru Kodo.

237
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,520
That's ten wins in a row!

238
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,814
You're just too
strong for us, Naboru.

239
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,941
Okay, let's go again, Maihama.

240
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,984
But I can't.

241
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,528
I've got chess club, remember?

242
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,530
Yeah, and I've got
a test to study for.

243
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,364
All right.

244
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,200
Catch you later, then.

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,243
Kid ain't bad.

246
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:42,207
♪

247
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,543
You could be a
better Buddyfighter.

248
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,170
Slow down, kid.

249
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,713
Hey, kid.

250
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,965
Hey, listen.

251
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,966
Hey.

252
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,301
I watched your fight back there

253
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,929
and I think I can help.

254
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,639
Your deck's well balanced.

255
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,641
But you let your
gauge get too low.

256
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,560
Against a good
fighter it will cost you.

257
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,646
Are you listening?

258
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,565
Why do you keep following me?

259
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,943
Why don't you add an
El Quixote to your deck?

260
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,905
It has a handy ability
to increase your gauge.

261
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,533
I don't actually like
the El Quixote card.

262
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,408
Huh?

263
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,868
What are you talking about?

264
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:20,829
Okay.

265
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,914
That should do it.

266
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,249
Wow.

267
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,750
You'll get stronger
using your deck

268
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,085
with every match you play.

269
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,504
This is so totally wicked.

270
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,550
There's no way I could
have built a deck like this.

271
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,260
Let's blow this place, Drum.

272
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,845
Huh, why?

273
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,388
Hey, wait!

274
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,097
Look, Kugaru.

275
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,348
Yeah?

276
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,102
I know exactly
what you're up to.

277
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,897
It was worth a try.

278
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,737
Give me one good reason why
you don't like El Quixote.

279
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,489
'Cause he looks weak.

280
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,117
And he's really, really old.

281
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,703
You saw my fights
earlier, right?

282
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,705
I didn't lose a single match.

283
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,415
That's not really saying much.

284
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,751
Yeah, well, my setup's
already good enough as it is.

285
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,170
Huh?

286
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,172
Ah, yeah, I'm super
stoked about my new deck.

287
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,882
Why don't we go try it out?

288
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,758
It's Asmodai and Tetsuya.

289
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,760
I know that buddy monster.

290
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,304
Which can only mean
that that boy there

291
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,181
must be quite a bit
tougher than he looks.

292
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,225
To have a buddy like
that, he must be strong.

293
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,810
No, he's really not.

294
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,562
And the only reason
he's a Buddyfighter

295
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,607
is because Demon Lord
Asmodai asked him to be one.

296
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,983
Hey, I know.

297
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,110
As a warm up match
before the big tournament

298
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,487
why don't I destroy that noob?

299
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,033
Hm.

300
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,996
Really?

301
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,332
Noboru challenged
you to a Buddyfight?

302
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,666
Mhmm.

303
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,501
He challenged me on
my way home yesterday.

304
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,003
We're fighting at
the stage after school.

305
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,296
Come check it.

306
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,757
You do realize he's
the second best fighter

307
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,091
in our grade, right?

308
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,635
And you haven't
had time to practice

309
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,178
with your new deck yet.

310
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,013
So Noboru, huh?

311
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,973
Couldn't ask for
a better opponent.

312
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,683
Hey there, good morning, Gao.

313
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,851
Oh, hi.

314
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,145
With that deck
your odds are good.

315
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,397
Go and get your
first victory, okay?

316
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,024
All right, thanks, Baku.

317
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,359
I'll do my best, yo.

318
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,736
The ABC Cup's just
around the corner

319
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,030
and we've seen some exciting
practice matches lately

320
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,823
as the big day approaches.

321
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,992
Today's game, though,
doesn't promise to be much

322
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,535
as Testuya Kurodake's known

323
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,704
as the worst fighter
in the sixth grade.

324
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,582
But with buddy monster Demon
Lord Asmodai in the house

325
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,168
prepare to be dazzled.

326
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,294
And his opponent today,

327
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,796
also from the sixth grade...

328
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,922
Luminize.

329
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,382
...and ranks
second in his grade,

330
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,467
the lover of
tigers big and small,

331
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,303
Noboru Kodo!

332
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,097
My buddy's Red Baron.

333
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,140
You got this, Noboru!

334
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,392
We'll see.

335

00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,575
You know I'm gonna cast
Devil Advantage, yo.

504
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,993
I like that spell.

505
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,287
When it's played a
fighter can play one gauge

506
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,164
and bring two 72 pillar monsters

507
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,583
sent to the drop zone
back into their hand.

508
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,876
Nice strategy.

509
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,794
So that means
Asmodai can come back.

510
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,212
Bingo.

511
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,006
Asmodai's defense
isn't the greatest.

512
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,507
That's why I created a deck

513
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,468
that lets him keep
coming back into play

514
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,762
no matter how many
times he's defeated.

515
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:01,515
Two Asmodai cards have
returned to Tetsuya's hand.

516
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,518
I call Asmodai to the
center and the right.

520
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,110
I discard and activate
Asmodai's ability.

521
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,904
Time to destroy Geronimo.

Okay.

Oh, wow, there it is again.

Asmodai's ability.

Dangerous Back Drop.

Hang on a sec,

527
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,998
Geronimo has soul guard.

528
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,501
Even if destroyed this
ability allows him to come back

529
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,253
as many times as there
are souls beneath him.

530

If one's just not enough

531

I'll drop another card, yo.

532
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,883
Ugh.

How do you like me now?

534
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,928
He's destroyed Geronimo again.

535
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,931
How are you supposed
to defend against that?

536
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,016
Asmodai breaks down the defense

537
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,477
and sets up the finishing move.

538
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,647
Not bad for the first
time using his new deck.

539
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,982
Hey, Zepar, now it's up to you.

540
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,151
Go and show 'em what you can do.

541

That's not gonna happen.

542

Use your Dragonic Thunder.
