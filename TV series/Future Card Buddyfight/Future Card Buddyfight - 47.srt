Aibo Academy is now

Kyoya Gaen
is a visionary.

So, naturally, he's
taken a special interest

73

in the management of
schools for young people.

74

He merely asked me to do some
research for him is all.

75

investigate schools

I have to say every place
I went was very charming.

I was asked to examine their
educational policies and ideals.

79
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,151
I even looked into the quality
of their teaching staff.

In my final report,

81

as the most suitable choice.

All this leaves a horrible
taste in my mouth

day‐old baguette.

hard this must be

89
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,467
and I'm sorry, but you
need to accept the fact

90
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,927
that everything
at this Academy,

91
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,262
right down to the
ballpoint pens and thumbtacks

92

All is as he wants it.

94

You'll have
to accept that.

95
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,977
You should do your best

96
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,729
to get in the young
tycoon's good graces

97

you in for newer models.

Now, let's listen to
see who they'll be facing.

327
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:29,035
It's Team Goddess!

328
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,536
I've never heard of them.

329
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,372
Let's find out who these
mysterious fighters are.

(giggles)

331
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,751
It seems that the
brave Mr. Mikado and I

332
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,796
are bound together
by the power of fate.

333
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,963
There it is!

334
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,757
The first match of the
first ever Gaen Cup will be

335
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,343
between Team Balle du Soleil
and Team Goddess.

336
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,636
Don't go away!

337
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,888
After this break, we'll
have all the action for you.

338
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,892
Do your best, Gao,
and make me proud.

339
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,268
Crush 'em good, Z.

340
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,146
We'll go get set up over at
the Buddy Pit, alright, bro?

341
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,940
I know you'll
win this one.

342
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,817
Thanks for letting me
take the first match, guys.

343
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,527
I won't let you
down, I promise.

344

No problem, yo.

345
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,905
Wait, don't do it.

346
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,615
I actually think
that I should go first.

347
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,700
‐Huh?
‐You're stressing me out.

348
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,078
You saw how excited
the audience is out there.

349
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,288
It was like being in
one of my live shows.

(cheering)

351

If the crowd's
supporting our team,

352
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,753
then that's great,
but we could still

353
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,588
get overwhelmed
by the atmosphere.

354
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,965
I'm worried that
we might lose

355
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,884
without being able to utilize
even half of our full power.

Yeah, I get it.

357

I think you'll agree that
at times like these,

the person who
has the most calm
