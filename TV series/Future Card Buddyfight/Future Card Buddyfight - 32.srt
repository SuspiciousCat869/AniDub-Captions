the Buddy Gossip Forum.

170
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,776
They say that the
sword itself chooses

171
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,985
who gets to wield it.

172
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
And those who don't
possess the qualities

173
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,405
of the king will never
be able to pull it

174
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,491
out of the stone.

175
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,117
Could it ever be a queen?

176
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,036
I'm all the Blade
you'll need!

177
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,579
I wouldn't be so
quick to believe

178
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,581
everything you read on the net.

179
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,209
I once posted that your
voice gets auto tuned.

180
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,919
It so does not!

181
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,087
Equipment change.

182
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,005
Instead of Divine
Protection, Prydwen,

183
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,883
I'll take the Sword
of the King, Excalibur.

184
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,595
(grunts)

185
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,930
Are you a king?

186
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,848
Only the virtuous
may remove me.

187
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,267
Who needs virtues
when you have strength?

188
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,560
I command you!

189
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,022
Yield to me and give
me your unlimited power!

190
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,983
Those are not the
words of a worthy.

191
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,026
Wait, no!

192
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,530
He's too weak to
control the dark powers

193
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,781
of Disaster Force.

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,117
Well then...

195
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,786
I guess we'll have
to move to Plan B.

196
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,787
Incredible.

197
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,539
Maybe the stories
are all true.

198
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,332
I've never heard
of not being able

199
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,001
to equip an item you
called into the field.

200
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,087
Tell me, mighty Excalibur,

201
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,340
why have you failed to
recognize my true potential?

202
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,383
You're wrong.

203
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,136
Rouga was wrong
about me, too.

204
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,303
Huh?

205
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,097
Fine.

206
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,932
I don't need your
miserable power anyway.

207
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,643
I have something better.

208
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,604
Feast your eyes
on my Dark Core.

209
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,523
What's a Dark Core?

210
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,152
More destruction than
you could ever imagine.

211
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,237
'Cause that won't
give you nightmares.

212
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,156
I know that mask
from somewhere.

213
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,198
Me too.

214
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,908
This is so weird.

215
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,411
It's the same half‐mask
thing Doai was wearing

216
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,246
in the underground
maze at Aibo that time.

217
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,500
I sense a great dark
power coming from him.

218
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,461
You must keep your
distance, Kazane.

219
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,337
But Blade, Gao's in danger.

220
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
Immortal Sword, Durandal.

221
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,010
Divine Protection, Prydwen.

222
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,344
This isn't right.

223
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,221
According to the official
rules of Buddyfight,

224
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,015
a player's not allowed
to equip two items

225
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,099
at the same time!

226
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,227
Then it's a good thing
your rules don't apply

227
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,022
to me or my Dark Core.

228
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,148
Huh?

229
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,483
You're no longer needed.

230
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,567
Get out!

231
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,985
(shrieks)

232
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,528
(shouts)

233
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,863
He's like Wolf.

234
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,491
He has the same
power over the cards.

235
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,201
(indistinct chatter)

236
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,994
If his power's
inside the game,

237
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,080
how did he just
destroy the stage?

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,414
You know, I was
just thinking

239
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,041
the exact same thing.

240
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,542
I'm getting a reading.

241
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
There's no denying it,
that power is real.

242
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,005
I didn't think
that was possible.

243
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,175
Like all spells and items,

244
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,803
a monster's power can
only be used for short times

245
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,554
on Earth during Buddyfights.

246
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,681
If those abilities
were freed and someone

247
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,558
found a way to control them,

248
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,602
I don't wanna be
a buzzkill, but...

249
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,064
this might happen.

250

joking, right A‐dawg?

Check it out, Tets.

503
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,944
Take a look at Gao's hand.

504
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,488
What about it?

505
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,947
He's all out of cards.

506
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,990
No!

507
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,453
Once Shosetsu
makes a move,

508
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,080
Gao's history for sure.

509
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,665
No, he's gotta
have a plan.

510
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,291
Well, looks like it's over.

511
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,793
Not yet, keep watching.

512
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,336
You know what?

513
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,588
I almost feel bad
about beating you.

514
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,467
Not a problem, 'cause my
final phase isn't over yet.

515
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,719
But look, you don't
have any cards left.

516
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,762
Sure I do.

517
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,971
Check it out.

518
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,808
Isn't that a set spell
that increases your gauge?

Get ready!

521
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,731
I cast True Thunder Formation.

522
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,817
That set spell is sweet
'cause it acts like

523
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,818
an impact card.

524
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,611
When activated,
it draws three cards

525
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,821
from the top of the deck.

526
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,073
And if any of them
are Thunder Knights...

527
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,741
then you can call
the monster to your

Takihara, he's just

There's no need

Why's that?

For one, he can no

If we let you go,
will you tell us

563
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,274
I will.

Thank you for
giving me the chance.

After giving your statement,

do you know?

Well, I guess I'll

about to be served.

580
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,559
And the Wolf's hungry.

581
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
I wanna fight him alone,

582

if that's okay with you.

583
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,523
Are you sure?

584
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,982
It's dangerous.

585
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,776
He's not who
you think he is.

586
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,236
I know, Tasuku.

587
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,863
He's the one who
attacked the Fuji Mine.

588
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,990
So you've figured it out.

589
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,617
Then you also understand...

590
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,993
he's a criminal fighter.

591
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,246
You can't still want
to become friends with him.

592
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,330
Why not?

593
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,791
He's still Rouga
underneath it all.

594
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,751
I don't care about
that other stuff.

595
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,628
I know deep down
he's a good guy.

596
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,090
And when I fight him,
I'll prove it to the world.

597
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,550
Have it your way.

598
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,134
But I still have
a job to do.

599
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,636
If he uses that
dark power of his,

600
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,846
I'll have to stop the fight.

601
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,431
‐Agreed?
‐Agreed.

602

You okay?

604
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,980
I have to protect
Gao from him,

taking a big risk.

It's Thunder Knights,
Drum Bunker Dragon.

616

Drum did some intense training
with the Thunder Knights.

617
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,298
He's got upgrades
