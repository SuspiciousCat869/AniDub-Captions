I came for the food.

498
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,574
Everyone kept telling me
how delicious it is,

499
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,869
so I decided to investigate
the matter for myself.

500
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,122
‐What?!
‐What?!

501
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,332
Well then, why don't we
go back to the house

502
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,126
and you can try
everything we have.

503
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,377
Sounds good.

504
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,003
I've worked up quite
an appetite playing

505
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,005
‐with these little brats.
‐Grown‐ups are so weird.

I really like
the new look, Drum.

508
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,845
It's awesome;
now I have something

509
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,138
to write about in my letter!

510
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,849
Don't forget to mention
your fly friends too.

511
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,560
And Zanya's epic fail
against a girl.

512
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,769
Why, you!

513

He's kidding, Z,

‐To our boys.
‐To our boys.

516
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,319
Seeing your youngling
grow up and make good choices,

517
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,905
you can't ask for
much more than that.

518
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,158
I couldn't agree more.

519
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,869
Hi there, it's time
for our special report.

520
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,955
A recap of the opening
day of the Gaen Cup.

521
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,749
And the four teams
that will be taking part

522
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,084
in tomorrow's semi‐finals
have been decided.

523
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,003
Now let's go to a live update.

524
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,046
Hi, Paruko,
are you there?

525
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,423
You know I am!

526
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,258
And have I got a story for you.

527
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,261
The arena's still buzzing from
today's exciting first round.

528
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,930
Let me give you a rundown
on the teams that advanced.

529
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,767
The winner of the opening match
was Team Balle du Soleil.

530
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,394
Its experienced fighters
managed to squeeze out a victory

531
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,272
over the beautiful
all‐girl Team Goddess.

532
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,774
Although they dropped
the first game,

533
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,193
they came storming back
with two big wins

534
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,237
including one surprising game
against yours truly,

535
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,908
making them the first ones to
get a spot in the semi‐finals!

536

♪

537
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,829
Up against them will be
Team Darkness Masterminds

538
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,248
who demoralized
Team Kanme Three Brothers

539
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,417
with two effortless
wins in a row!

540
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,419
Oddly enough, they'll be
heading to the semi‐finals

541
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,422
without their team captain
having even made an appearance.

542
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,257
Although the crowd
got upset during the match

543
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,468
because cards from Darkness
Dragon World were used,

544
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,679
the tournament's sponsor Kyoya
Gaen soon calmed them down.

546
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,266
In the third match,
Team Purgatory,

547
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,810
whose captain is also unknown,

548
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,063
faced off against the
powerful Team Sengoku Academy,

549
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,940
carving out two victories.

550
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,233
In a surprising twist,

551
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,026
Mr. Gaen had Rouga Aragami

552
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,737
demonstrate his company's
new incredible invention,

553
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,280
the Dark Core Deck Case

554
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,991
which makes the power
of the cards into reality.

555
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,952
Truly unbelievable!

556
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,662
Their opponents
in the semi‐finals

557
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,913
will be Team Destiny

558
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,706
who overcame some
tough competition

559
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,250
in Team Seifukai.

560
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,460
And despite an unorthodox
switching out of fighters

561
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,545
at the last second,

562
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,046
they fought a spectacular match

563
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,466

Seems there's no choice.

Today we're gonna talk
about Drum's evolved form,

577
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,003
the amazing Super Armordragon,
Drum Breaker Dragon.

578
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,713
He can already
penetrate and move

579
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,755
but in his evolved form,

580
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,382
he can also move
to another area

581
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,550
during the main phase.

582
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,051
Unlike his old move ability,

583
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,595
now you can call
Boomerang Dragon

584
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,638
after he changes
position in the field.

585
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,434
It works great in combo with
the Explosive Dragon Fang deck.

586
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,852
So what do you think, guys?

You think you can
open up one of these?
