You're not so tough.

510
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,450
Oh, man.

511
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,827
End of move.

512
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,079
Shosetsu just blocked
Gao's big attack.

513
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,497
He's really stepping it up.

514
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,008
I call Knights of
the Round Table,

515
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,634
King Arthur to the right.

516
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,847
And Great Magician,
Merlin to the left.

517
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,223
Incubus' Blood.

518
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,017
Once again,
with Merlin's ability,

519
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,602
he adds cards
to his hand.

520
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,564
I Buddy Call and equip
Immortal Sword, Durandal.

521
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,732
Here it comes!

522
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,151
It never breaks, dents,
rusts, or shatters.

523
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,111
It's the fabled Demon
Sword of Legend World,

524
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,030
the Immortal Sword, Durandal.

525
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,823
And it can never
be destroyed.

526
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,409
Has our champion
finally met his match?

527
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,787
Halberd, move
to the center!

528
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,121
By using Thunder Formation,

529
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,707
that move adds one
card to Gao's gauge.

530
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,126
Heh.

531
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,045
What a waste of a move.

532
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,798
King Arthur, shall
we link attack Halberd?

533
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,883
I will protect you, sir.

534
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,259
Hiya!

535
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,178
Trusty sword,
time to penetrate.

536
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,597
(Halberd shouts)

537
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,642
Halberd!

538
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,852
Quell the uprising.

539
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,562
Ugh!

540
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,564
King Arthur's ability
gives one card

541
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,982
to Shosetsu's gauge.

542
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,485
Merlin, attack the fighter.

543
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,030
I cast Blue Dragon Shield!

544
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,783
Gao defends well,
blocking Merlin's attack.

545
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,743
And Blue Dragon's
ability puts another card

546
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,953
in Gao's gauge.

547
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,579
End of move.

548
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,831
(scoffs)

549
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,123
Your move.

550
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,166
Draw.

551
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,251
Charge and draw.

552
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,588
I think it's time.

553
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,507
Are you ready, Drum?

554
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,050
Never been more ready.

555
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,552
Let's beat this guy.

556
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,719
That's the plan!

557
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,804
All right.

558
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,514
Buddy Call...

559
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,599
Thunder Knight,
Drum Bunker Dragon

560
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,809
to the right!

561
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,935
(Drum shouts)

562
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,688
My Buddy's not only
a triple threat,

563
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,232
he's also three times
stronger than before.

564
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,400
That's right.

565
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,151
Thunder Knights,
Drum Bunker Dragon

566
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,280
is now on the scene,
and I'm ready to dance.

567
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,825
It's time for‐‐

568
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,034
Tasuku and Gao's‐‐

569
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,495
‐Card of the day!
‐Card of the day!

570
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,913
Believe it or not,
we have our very own

571
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,582
Dungeon World cards.

572
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,417
And today's card
is one of them.

573
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,502
It's called Legendary
Brave, Tasuku.

574
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,212
When this card makes
a link attack with

575
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,463
an Adventurer Card,

576
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,841
both cards gain the
ability to penetrate.

577
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,302
Which means this card
deals equal critical damage

578
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,344
to your opponent.

579
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,138
That means that you can
do a penetrate attack

580
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,890
with two cards at once!

581
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,057
So, what do you think, guys?

582
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,851
Think you can open
up one of these?!

583
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,186
You'll never know
until you try.

00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,115
backs Shosetsu
into a corner,

589

forcing the Legend
World fighter to call
