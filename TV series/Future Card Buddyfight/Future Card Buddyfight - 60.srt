Hmm?

114
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,934
Today, and only
at this location,

115
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,187
we're giving out free
Dark Core Deck Case replicas.

116
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,814
Huh, no way!

117
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,483
To be able to connect with
parallel worlds at will,

118
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,945
we developed the incredible
Dark Core Deck Case.

119
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,238
Although replicas,

120
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,448
they can still make
all the items and spells

121
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,327
that you'd use during
a Buddyfight game into reality.

122
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,706
For example, here's Gleipnir.

123
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,457

(screaming)

125
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,837
But the Dark Core Deck
Case's magnificent power

126
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,463
is reserved for kids only.

127
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,257
That means no adults allowed.

128
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,009
Now, don't be shy, take one,

129
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,511
and start using yours to
try and change the world

130
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,680
into a better place,
brought to you by

131
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,682
the very generous Mr. Gaen.

132
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,601
Oh, it's like a dream come true!

133
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,854
Hey, let me down,
I want one, too!

134
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,105
Akatsuki, no!

135
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,025
You should know how bad
those Dark Core Deck Cases are.

136
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,736
Remember Doai and
Shosetsu Kirisame?

137
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,863
Have you forgotten how
they were both controlled

138
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,197
by the dark power?

139
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,365
I know.

140
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,408
But if I had one,

141
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,535
I could become
an awesome fighter like you.

142
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,370
I could use Art
of Body Replacement

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,664
and Five Heavenly
Swords, Onimaru.

144
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,875
Seriously?

145
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,169
Easy, Zanya.

146
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,421
We all make mistakes, man.

147
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,631
Wait a sec.

148
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,383
Don't tell me you want to
let them get away with this.

149
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,094
They turned the power of
the cards into reality.

150
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,555
It makes sense that people
would want to try them out.

151
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,558
Yeah, but with everyone using
them, it's kinda dangerous.

152
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,934
And it's a little bit strange

153
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,770
that they can only
be used by kids.

154
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,314
It sounds to me like they're
planning to hand them out

155
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,108
as a way of finding some
new members for Disaster.

156
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,944
So you have to side with
them to use their power?

157
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,405
How does that make the
world a better place?

158
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,741
Is that supposed to be justice?

159
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,452
I can't believe Tasuku
was with these guys.

160
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,537
I wonder how he is.

161
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,082
You're right, Tasuku's lost it.

162
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,208
Hmm.

163
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,919
And it's up to us to stand
by and help our friends,

164
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,921
even when they've
made bad choices.

Knight is really Tasuku.

00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,703
You and I both know
that if your opponent

494
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,538
has five life points or less

495
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,749
and each of your centers
is open, then you can use

496
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,042
Roaring Slash!!
Gargantua Punisher!!

497
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,127
(groaning)

498
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,295
What will he choose?

499
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,714
Is Gao gonna use his
awesome Impact card?

500
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,798
Yes or no?

501
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,133
Aw, don't do it, yo.

502
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,885
If you roll with
your Impact card now,

503
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,846
that dude will use his
counter final on you for sure.

504
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,556
Gao's aware of his situation.

505
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,308
That's why he looks so worried.

506
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,934
He only has three life.

507
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,772
If Tasuku counters with his
Distortion Punisher!! card,

508
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,774
then Gao will definitely lose.

509
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,234
♪

510
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,236
If he doesn't have
a counter final card

511
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,863
in his hand,
we can win this,

512
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,741
but if he does,
nothing will beat it.

513
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,494
Especially counter spells.

514
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,787
Uh.

515
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,163
♪

516
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,457
I can't use that card right now.

517
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,043
I have to hold out
until next turn.

518
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,336
Play it, Gao.

519
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,754
Mm, really?

520
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,882
Yes, really, you gotta
unleash it right away.

521
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,091
Are you sure?

522
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,386
What about the counter final?

523
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,055
If Baku says to play it,

524
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,264
then I will.

525
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,267
He's the best deck
builder who ever lived!

526
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,895
Like always, I put
my trust in Baku

527
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,314
and in the entire
Team Balle du Soleil.

528
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,107
I owe them everything.

529
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,944
I guess that means it's
time for Final Phase.

530
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,028
I cast!

531
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,863
So this is how it's gonna end?

532
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,907
I'm disappointed in you, Gao.

533
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,909
Counter final!

534
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,160
I cast!

535
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,250
(clock ticking)

536
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,172
Let the world distort.

537
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,552
Turn back the sands of time and
erase all sadness from the past.

538
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,721
Sword of Nothingness!

539
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,640
Distortion...

540
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,935
Punisher!!

541
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,104
(loud crashing)

542
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,985
I'll be the one
to save this world.

543
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,736
Even someone like Gao Mikado

544
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,031
won't be able to stand
in the way of my triumph.

545
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,244
It's time for...

546
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,662
Tasuku and Gao's...

547
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,330
Card of the Day!

548
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,249
Today we're gonna talk
to you about a card

549
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,667
called Distortion Punisher!!

550
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,669
When your opponent has
four life points or less

551
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
and both of your center
positions are open,

552
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,840
this Impact card
deals four damage.

553
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,091
Pretty sweet, huh?

554
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,635
Don't forget that when your
opponent uses an Impact card,

555
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,679
it's possible you can
cause four damage

556
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,264
before it's even activated.

557
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,557
That's why it's called...

558
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,517
A counter final card.

559
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,852
So what do you think, guys?

560
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,604
You think you can
open up one of these?

561
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,606
You'll never know until you try!

Next time, Kyoya's
