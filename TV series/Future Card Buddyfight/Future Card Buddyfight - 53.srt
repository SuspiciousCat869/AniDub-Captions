Uh...

166
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,723
Attention, please.

167
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,935
His name is Purgatory Knight.

168
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,062
And the armor that he's wearing

169
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,440
is actually a Core Gadget.

170
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,442
Well, there you have it, folks.

171
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,944
And as far as I can tell,

172
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,113
he's not officially
breaking any rules.

173
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,448
That Core Gadget's
really tough looking.

174
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,075
Core Gadgets are
just reflections

175
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,952
of the fighter's
inner hopes and dreams.

176
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,787
The Core Deck Case
can change itself

177
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,789
into a symbol that gives
the fighter strength

178
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,458
or make itself match with
what a fighter really wants

179
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,584
on the inside.

180
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,046
Your cool spear is kind
of a perfect example.

181
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,966
It represents both your
straightforward determination

182
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,178
to fulfill your dreams and
your idolization of knights.

183
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,931
So his Core Gadget
turned into a suit of armor

184
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,474
to hide his true identity.

185
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,642
That's it, right?

186
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,311
Well, that would be one
assumption that we could make.

187
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,312
Mmm.

188
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,982
Miss Nanana, would you
please begin the fight?

189
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,483

190

Oh, no, but I already

but now I think I do.

492
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,413
Thing is, you need time to
grow up and do kid things.

493
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,874
Being a kid teaches you
a ton about the world

494
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,293
and how we should try to
fit into it as grownups,

495
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,713
but you're not really there yet,
so you shouldn't pretend to be!

496
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,840
And like your
Commander I told me,

497
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,633
you need my help!

How dare you?

500
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,681
How dare you treat
me like a child?

501
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,224
Kids are so powerless,

502
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,186
and I would be, too,
if I didn't change.

503

You see?

504
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,775
I couldn't even help my family,

505
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,860
so I decided to become an adult.

506
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,989
