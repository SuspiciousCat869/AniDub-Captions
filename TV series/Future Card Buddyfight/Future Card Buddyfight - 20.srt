The reason why you
made this comic book

in the first place.

I'm guessing you

Catch ya later,
I've got a lot to do.

Ever since that day,
I've held the title

255
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,396
Gao's trying to claim.

256
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,942
Sorry, kid, but I made
a promise to your brother.

257
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,736
Wait, you actually knew Yota?

258
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,905
He told me that he wrote
those stories for you

259
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,824
to help you gain confidence
and strength; he wanted

260
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,119
to be there for you
the only way he could.

261
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,373
So, as I said before,
I am the true Mighty Sun Fighter

262
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,125
and I'm the only one
who can go by that name!

263
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,921
You don't have the skills
to beat him anyway!

264
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,924
Face the facts, the character
your brother created would never

265
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,885
lose a battle like this,
yet you're only a few seconds

266
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,097
away from defeat!

267
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,974
Just ignore him.

268
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,476
You think you're ready
t be there for people?

269
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,104
To be a ray of hope
in the darkness?

270
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,897
But you're just a flicker!

271
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,567
Wait, a ray of hope in darkness?

(gasps)

273
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,405
It's not all about
being good or being the best;

274
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,407
rising up is the easy part.

275
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,951
A leader is someone who tries

276
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,287
to become better for
the good of others.

277
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,747
That's what
the Sun Fighter's all about!

278

Someone who can‐‐

279
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,584

‐Just like the sun!

00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,755
Those are your brother's words!

282
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,633
They helped me choose
the right path to follow.

283
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,094
His stories gave me
the inspiration to live

284
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,014
my life as a leader!

285
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,266
Genma, you've got it all wrong.

286
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,019
That's not the message
of the Mighty Sun Fighter.

287
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,396

What, what are
you talking about?

292

What the story's trying to say!

293
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,827
It's not the smartest
or the strongest people

294

who should lead,
it's the ones that worked

295

the hardest at improving
life for everyone else!

296

Yeah, you're saying that people
who are stronger or more capable

301
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,973
should protect those
that are weaker, am I right?

Uh.

303

00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,691
I haven't even left
so much as a singe mark.

493

I've gotta get stronger
