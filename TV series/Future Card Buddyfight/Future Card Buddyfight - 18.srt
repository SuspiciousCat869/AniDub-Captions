Good thinkin', big Z.

331
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,247
In order for him
to call Duel Sieger,

332
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,957
he needs three gauge.

333
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,792
I'll just keep
taking it from him,

334
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,752
even a charge
on his next turn

335
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,129
will only give him two.

336
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,133
So it'll be a while
before he can call him out.

337
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,886
He who controls the gauge
controls the Buddyfight.

confident out there.

497
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,265
I can call him
from the hand.

498
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,976
Once he appears,
the Lifelink is canceled

499
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,605
and my life points return.

500
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:58,442
I told you,
Duel Sieger is supreme.

501
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,446
Did you actually think
you had defeated him?

502
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,823
Ha!

503
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:10,079
♪

504
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,706
I failed again.

505
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,167
Do you think Genma's
telling the truth after all?

506
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,836
Maybe there is no
one who can handle

507
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,255
Duel Sieger's
incredible strength.

508
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,422
Especially now
that he's returned

509
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,801
in an even
more powerful form.

510
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,428
Awesome!

511
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,473
Whoa, I'm jealous.

512
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,518
Before we go any further,
listen up, Zanya.

513
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:38,440
I may have been a little
too harsh on you earlier.

514
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,568
You have improved a bit
since our match last year,

515
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,529
but not nearly
enough to defeat me.

516
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,281

Hello there, I'm Paruko
here to guide you

519
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,498
through the
world of Buddyfight.

520
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,126
Did you see Genma Todoroki's
cool buddy monster,

521
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,670
Marshal Arts Dragon
Emperor, Duel Sieger?

522
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,839
It's a legendary card
belonging to the Seifukai

523
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,799
that's been around
for ages and ages.

524
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,759
They call it the
lord of dragons,

525
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,220
meaning it's crazy powerful.

526
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,222
Size three monsters
are usually tough,

527
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,348
but when Sieger's defeated,

528
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,893
he turns into an even
more terrifying form.

529
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,896
Can you open a
Buddy Rare card?

What do you think?

531
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,074
You got to watch next time

532
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,910
to see Duel Sieger Spartand's
devastating strength.

533
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,288
And to find out what special
gift Gao gets from his mom.
