00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,450
I mean, we did build your
Dungeon World deck together.

330
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,035
What's with these monsters?

331
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,288
Come on, I know you know.

332

Adventurer and dungeon enemy.

333
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,375
If I remember right,
decks are always stronger

334
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,003
when they're built off
of one of those two types.

335
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,713
Yeah, and since
I'm an adventurer,

336
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,966
your deck focuses on
amazing monsters like me.

337
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,801
But Kazane's deck has both.

338
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,304
She's got dungeon enemy
monsters like Gummy Slime

339
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,307
and Bladewing Phoenix,
and adventurer monsters, too.

340

And yet, it's all built
around one single monster.

341
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,978
So this deck

342
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,483
is built to take advantage
of Orser Kleinz's skills?

From what the principal told me,
I believe he's already left.

494
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,504
Bummer, how could he leave
without even telling us?

495
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,176
I don't understand
why he would do that.

Today, we'll introduce you

to the Demon Wolf,
Fenrir combination.

508
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,253
Fenrir is a super strong
monster with a critical of six,

509
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,297
but it costs five
gauge to bring it out.

So, to get around this, you can

place Fenrir in the soul
of the set spell Gleipnir,

512

and destroy it.

513
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,680
Then you can call
it with no cost.

There's a little
more to this combo,

those details next time.
