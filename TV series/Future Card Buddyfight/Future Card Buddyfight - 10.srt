00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,531
I told you, didn't I?

502
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,657
He's wicked strong.

503
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,700
Hey, watch out.

504
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,451
Huh?

505
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,704
Give me your buddy!

506
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,581
Buddy skill on.

507
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,420
Oh!

508
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,965
Uh, El Quixote, what's this?

509
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,184
Nice card fight!

510
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,977
Nah, that guy wasn't so tough.

511
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,437
Uh, Noboru.

512
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,023
What's that glowing
armor you're wearing?

513
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,566
It's a buddy skill.

514
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,567
Am I right?

515
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,444
El Quixote?

516
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,071
A buddy skill?

517
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,616
How come Asmodai hasn't hooked
a buddy up with some of that?

518
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,286
Aw, how am I gonna win the
Cup without crazy powers?

519
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,663
Yeah, he's right, man.

520
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,748
You're definitely
the guy to beat now.

521
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:17,586
Yeah, well, you can try.

522
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,131
I guess Buddyfighting's
my thing after all.

523
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,466
Uh?

524
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,759
All right.

525
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,595
I just hope we get
to meet in the finals.

526
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,430
Yeah.

527
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,725
Hey, dudes, the new
cards have just arrived.

528
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,811
So, you were way
off about this kid.

529
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:34,645
Guess so.

530
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,146
I underestimated him.

531
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,524
Now anyone's capable
of winning this thing.

532
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,652
You could be in big
trouble, Mr. President.

533
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,529
♪

534
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,908
It's all playing out exactly
as I predicted it would.

535
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,495
Hello there, I'm Paruko

536
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,707
here to guide you through
the world of Buddyfight.

537
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,542
When someone opens
a buddy rare card

538
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,335
the Buddy Police
pick up on the signal

539
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,630
and deliver a core deck
case to them right away.

540
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,465
The Buddy Police do
all kinds of things

541
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,342
and some of it's dangerous.

542
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,720
Like arresting rogue
criminal fighters.

543
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,804
Pretty cool, huh?

544
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,264
And they even keep an eye out

545
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,141
on all of the monsters
that come to Earth

546
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,643
looking for a buddy.

547
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,603
What do you think, guys?

548
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:19,023
Can you open a Buddy Rare card?

549
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,991
Join us next time
to see seventh grader

550
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,326
Suzuha Amanosuzu and Mary Sue,

551
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,786
her amazing buddy.

552
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,080
They say there's
nothing she can't do.

553
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,417
Next episode, the start
of the Aibo Buddy Cup.

554
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,460
It's gonna be a splash!
