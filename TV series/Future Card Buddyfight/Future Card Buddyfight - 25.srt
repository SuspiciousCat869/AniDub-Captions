488
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,657
is now added
to his gauge.

489
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,826
I knew it would be tougher
than that to take him down.

490
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,327
Gauge, smage, who cares?

491
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,704
Final phase!

492
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,164
Unbelievable, it's his
first full turn of the match

493
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,583
and he's already
calling Final Phase!

494
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,669

495

actually pull it off.

499
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,142
I cast Bold Retaliation.

500
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:31,063
One more shot and I can get back
to chilling with my main crew.

501
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,732
Two impact cards in a row!

502

Maybe Tetsuya is gonna
have a one turn victory.

He's sure come a long way.

He did it!

506
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,907
I cast Phoenix Wall!

507
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,081
Rouga reduces damage with
a feisty Phoenix Wall.

508
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,000
There ends the
one turn victory.

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,418
End of move.

510
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,171
Aw, I got punked.

I think I've played
against you before.

512
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,924
Uh, yeah, it's me, Tetsuya.

513
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,967
Of course.

514

Your buddy's that
strange demon, Asmodai.

You're about
to be schooled.

517
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,768
This is how to win
it all in one turn.

518
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:13,063
I buddy call to the center,
Armorknight Cerberus Ace!

519
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,359
I equip Demonic Spear,
Swirling Darkness.

520
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,570
He regains one life point
with a buddy gift.

And Mind‐Blowing
Roaring Charge.

524
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,083
He's added Cerberus Ace to
Swirling Darkness' soul.

525
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,794
This is dicey, yo!

526
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,754
Rouga had to pay
a lofty three gauge

527
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,590
to use Cerberus Ace's
ability, Roaring Charge,

528
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,009
but it increases his
critical to eight!

529
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,761
Time for Final Phase!

530
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,222
Isn't it a little early
to be trying for that?

531
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,433
Unless he's got a card that'll
give him even more critical!

532
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,477
I cast.

533
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,230
I'll get you and
your little monster, too.

534

Drill Bunker!

535
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:01,111
This brings Swirling Darkness'
critical to an astounding ten!

536
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,113
It's lights out if
we get hit with that.

537
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,824
Relax, I'm a step ahead.

538
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,660
I cast Solomon Shield.
