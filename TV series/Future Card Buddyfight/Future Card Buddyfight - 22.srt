Tetsuya better be ready.

167
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,439
No doubt.

168
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,734
Remind me again why it's so
important for me to be here.

169
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,403
I already told you why.

170
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,029
As part of your
suspension agreement

171
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,116
you're required to help
our PR promote the game.

172
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,410
(grunting)

173
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,453
(whirring)

174
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,415
Tasuku, don't let
him get to you.

175
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,126
It'll all be over
before you know it.

176
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,877
I'm suddenly not
feeling so well.

177
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,421
I need to get some fresh air.

178
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,966
Don't be long, we need
you front and center.

179
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:28,967
Hi, Daddy.

180
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,969
I didn't expect
to see you here.

181
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,764
Magaroku, why, I'm here on
official business, of course.

182
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,850
What are you doing
hiding under the table?

183
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,059
Planning some grand entrance

184
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,103
as this year's
ABC Cup champion?

185
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,147
You should be the
center of attention.

186
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,314
Wh‐‐what's wrong?

187
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,399
Are you crying?

188
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,192
You did win the
trophy, didn't you?

189
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,986
Oh, Daddy!

190
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,988
They didn't let me win!

191
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,533
Okay, watch the uniform.

192
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,160
Tasuku, you're here!

193
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,953
I didn't think you'd show.

194
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,497
You took time out of
your busy schedule

195
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,665
just to see me?

196
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,959
‐Huh?
‐Hey, Gao.

197
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,170
I was hoping I'd
run into you here.

198
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,505
S'up, man?

199
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,675
He completely ignored me,
or was he just pretending?

200
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,844
Yes, of course,
as I'm the only daughter

201
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,679
of the famous
Amanosuzu family,

202
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,306
he wants to protect
my reputation

203
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,266
from those nasty
rumors in the tabloids.

204
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,268
Poor Lady Suzuha,
so innocent.

205
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,481
I cast Great Spell Saturday
Night Devil Fever, yo!

206
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,358
Great Spell Saturday
Night Devil Fever?

207
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,236
The fever, it's used
when there's six or more

208
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,947
72 Pillar monsters
in the drop zone.

209
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,158
And it lets you call
three size one monsters

210
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,203
of the 72 Pillars without
having to pay any cost at all.

211
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,039
And since he was getting
majorly squashed out there,

212
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,707
his drop zone's
loaded with them.

213
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,958
Stayin' alive.

214
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,335
Yeah!

215
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,294
Check it.

216
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,881
Saturday Night Devil Fever.

217
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,052
I'll get rid of a card and
activate Asmodai's skill, yo.

218
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,011
Oh, no.

219
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,098
Dangerous backdrop for what!

220
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,392
Come on, feel the beat,
and attack the fighter, yo.

221
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,186
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

222
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,021
Ahh!

223
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,064
Game over.

224
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,233
Winner, Tetsuya Kurodake.

225
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,986
‐One down.
‐That card's practically ours.

226
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,905
Well, that wasn't
a great fight.

227
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,824
Oh, I don't know.

228
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,909
I actually found it
quite interesting,

229
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,954
especially that little guy
who used the Danger World.

230
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,372
You mean Kiri Hyoryu?

231
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,458
If he finds a buddy monster
that fits his fighting style,

232
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,876
he'll definitely be someone

233
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,004
we'll need to
keep our eye on.

234

♪

235
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,641
Huh, so that's the head of
the Gaen Financial Group?

236
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,393
He's not very old, is he?

237
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,854
Apparently he's quite good
at Buddyfighting too.

238
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,939
You could say the
guy has it all.

239
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:48,982
What gives?

240
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,067
Why aren't you getting
Tasuku's autograph?

241
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
He's been your hero for
as long as I can remember.

242
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,280
Sure, I admire
his achievements,

243
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,031
but I don't get starstruck.

244
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,951
I'd never ask for an
autograph like some lame‐o.

245
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,870
Okay, got ya.

246
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,788
Huh?

247
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,208
But if you wanted to get one,
that'd be totally cool.

248
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,626
Good afternoon.

249
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,670
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

250
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,381
As a major fan,
I think it's wonderful

251
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,009
we can all come together
through friendship and courage

252
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,510
to enjoy a Buddyfight.

253
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,387
He has such a charming smile.

254
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,222
I don't know if
"charming" is the word.

255
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,016
Looks kind of sketchy to me.

256
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,933
Envy much?

257
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,226
Green clashes with pink.

258
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,352
Ugh.

259
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,062
I sure hope you all
have a good time

260
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,397
and enjoy the matches.

261
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,399
As promised, the player
who impresses me

262
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,651
the most out there
will receive

263
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,738
this much sought‐after
special rare card.

264
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,907
Now, let's see the
exceptional card

265
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,450
you could win.

266
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,368
(gasping)

267
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,205
Come on, is this
some kind of a joke?

268
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,957
(indistinct chattering)

269
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,168
I don't understand,
how could it go missing?

270
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,044
Oh, my.

271
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,171
Now things are gonna
get interesting.

272
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,672
There's been a crime.

273
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,674
Here you are, stay in school.

274
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,343
I gotta go, duty calls.

275
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,345
My brother's
your biggest fan!

276
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,221
Excellent.

277
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,389
This'll be even
better than I planned.

278
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,017
Excuse me, may I
examine that case?

279
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,018
Be my guest.

280
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,187
It's Ryuenji, isn't it?

281
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,857
Yes, and you seem to be the
victim of a serious theft.

282
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,692
(grunting)

283
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,027
When the ship raised anchor,

284
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,113
the card was definitely in
the case, is that correct?

285
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,699
Yes, I made sure
of it myself.

286
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,535
So the theft occurred
sometime after we set sail,

287
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,704
which means that the
perp is still on board.

288
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,749
Your reasoning
would seem sound.

289
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,043
It's such a treat
to see him in action.

290
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,380
Oh, Tasuku,
you're so wonderful.

291
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,216
The case doesn't look
like it was forced open.

292
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,509
I don't know how they did it.

293
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,136
I had a security detail
watching it the whole time.

294
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,888
There's no way
anyone could have

295
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,974
gotten close enough
to steal it.

296
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,393
You seem to be forgetting
one important thing.

297
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,896
Most of the people you invited
here today are Buddyfighters

298
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,023
which means...

299
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,652
...there are lots of
Buddy Monsters on board.

300
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,821
(laughing)

301
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,864
Though it's impossible
for us humans,

302
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,617
some buddy monsters have
the power of invisibility.

303
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,244
They could have
easily taken the card

304
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,453
from right under our noses.

305
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,540
Are you trying to say there's
a criminal fighter among us?

306
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,583
Tell me, A‐Dawg, did you?

307
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,419
Don't get it twisted.

308
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,628
It wasn't me.

309
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,754
I even have witnesses.

310
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,632
I swear Asmodai was totally
with me the entire time.

311
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,009
‐Me too.
‐Y'all sound

312
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,760
kind of suspicious, yo.

313
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,471
I wouldn't put it past him.

314
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,143
If anyone's good at sneaking
around, it's you, ninja!

315
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,438
Things are getting
heated out there.

316
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,356
Huh?

317
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,027
Oh, could that be
the missing card?

Ah!

Oh, this is a total drag.

323
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,248
They might make the
thieves walk the plank.

324
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,499
Rules are different at sea.

have been a spell

00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,298
Uh‐huh.

491
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,675
He's probably behind this.

492
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,598
So that's the Future
Force, and right on cue.

493
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,142
Just one question
remains, however.

494
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,979
Is it stronger than
my Disaster Force?

495
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,359
How can I ever repay you?

496
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,445
‐You're a hero!
‐Let go of me!

497
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,490
Haven't you ever heard
of personal space?

498
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,367
I'm a hugger, don't
pretend to be so modest.

499
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,745
You're the strongest
ever, my Buddy.

500
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,829
Get off of me!

501
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,207
You're not seriously
talking about Drum, are you?

502
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,043
Who else, I never believed
I'd ever find my Buddy.

503
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,670
Uh, reality check,
we're both monsters.

504
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,256
Whatever, there's
nothing I like more

505
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,925
than breaking the rules.

506
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,218
Cut it out!

507
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,260
Hmm.

508
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,222
Listen to me, if you
really want to pay me back,

509
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,348
then help out Gao for me.

510
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,642
I'll do anything
for you, Drum!

511
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,018
What are you talking about?

512
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,937
Where are you gonna be?

513
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,899
About that, I need
to take a little trip.

514
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,651
Huh?

515
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,069
The way things are right now,

516
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,488
I just can't call
myself your Buddy.

517
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,447
Are you kidding me?

518
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,491
You still won't accept
me as your Buddy?

519
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,284
No, you've got it backwards.

520
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,578
I'm the one who's
not worthy of you.

521
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,290
Jack reminded me.

522
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,252
I need to get some
strong abilities like him

523
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,087
so I can protect you.

524
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,673
What's wrong with the way
things are right now?

525
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,132
We just won the Cup.

526
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,759
As the Mighty
Sun Fighter says,

527
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,971
"There comes a time when
a dragon must fight alone,"

528
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,305
or something like that.

529
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,682
Please don't go!

530
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,058
See you soon, kid.

531

Hello there, I'm Paruko,
here to guide you through

the world of Buddyfight.

539

Did you see that way cool
Buddyfight party on the ship?

540

The prize was gonna be
a special rare card.

For those who don't know,

542

the order of Buddyfight
cards goes common, uncommon,

then rare, double rare,
triple rare, and special rare.

But, you know, even
cards that aren't rare

545

are super important to
your supply in a Buddyfight.

Every card is precious.
