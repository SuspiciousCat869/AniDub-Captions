1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,880
Get ready for
a cool new card game

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,299
that connects to
a parallel universe.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,009
Special cards act as portals,

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,471
bringing monsters to Earth
to become buddies with humans.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,889
And through
friendship and courage,

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,141
help them take on
fight challenges.

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,893
It's called: Buddyfight.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,897
Thought you'd be
sneaking around here.

9
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,941
What are you up to?

10
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,319
Genma, what a
pleasant surprise.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,905
Don't you play with me
you twitchy little ferret.

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm the leader of the Seifukai.

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,326
We've received recent
reports that implicate you

14
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,161
in a suspicious fraud case.

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,038
Obviously, they're wrong.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,375
Isn't it true the deck
you'll be using in the ABC Cup

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,377
has been handed
down year‐to‐year

18
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,379
within the Seifukai?

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,673
It's one of our
oldest traditions.

20
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,968
Well good, then you won't
mind if we examine it.

21
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,636
Or what?

22
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,471
Being so old, some of the cards

23
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,391
might have identifiable
marks from wear and tear.

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,643
Some people may see it
as an unfair advantage

25
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,814
to know your cards
before playing them.

26
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:08,277
The Seifukai take pride in
self discipline and fairness.

27
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,820
Examine away.

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,863
I've nothing to hide.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,535
Sophia.

30
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,412
Done.

31
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,372
Oh.

32
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,336
Well, that takes care of him.

33
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,464
They might as well engrave
my name on the cup already.

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:02:58,929
♪

35
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,399
Must be cool to fly.

36
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,239
What gives, Drum?

37
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,074
When are you gonna
stop holding out on me

38
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,243
and let me use your
buddy skill, huh?

39
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,828
I keep telling you, kid,

40
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,330
I'm not sure I want
to be your buddy yet.

41
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,998
Aren't you hilarious.

42
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,543
Something tells me you probably
don't even have a buddy skill

43
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,128
to give me in the first place.

44
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,379
Take that back!

45
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,047
Are you guys at it again?

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,799
‐Oh, hey.
‐Hey!

47
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,301
Look alive we got
a lot of work to do.

48
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,512
Wait until you see,
we're gonna tweak your deck

49
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,347
just a little
before the next match.

50
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,932
Why bother?

51
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,685
Lizard breath here says
we're not even real buddies.

52
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,687
Does this ever get old for you?

53
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,732
I know right, it's like, "Bro,
feel the buddy love, already."

54
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,025
Hm?

55
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,194
What are those
Seifukai cronies up to?

56
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,572
Whatever it is,
they're sure in a hurry.

57
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,532
Scoping the opposition?

58
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,201
What have you done
with our leader? Tell me!

59
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,079
Easy there, tough guy,
you're a little too intense.

60
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,998
I know that the stakes
are pretty high after

61
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,709
our school's last win,
but take it down a notch.

62
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,754
Stop acting innocent, kid.

63
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,381
I'm Zanya Kisaragi.

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,924
Seriously, can't
you Neanderthals

65
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,594
even remember my name?

66
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:25,974
Well, look at that, the mini‐me
has a mouth on him too, huh?

67
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,894
Don't you even think about
touching my little brother.

68
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,604
You think you guys are scary?

69
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,189
I don't care how many
of you there are,

70
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,607
you're no match for me.

71
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,734
You're easy to fight,
you all think the same,

72
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,277
you even dress the same.

73
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,155
It's not smart to
talk to Seifukai.

74
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,531
Sukikage.

75
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,744
Nin.

76
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,413
Buddy Skill, on.

77
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,916
This will be an excellent
warm‐up for my next match.

78
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,959
Nothing personal, comrades.

79
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,003
Save some fight for me, man.

80
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,425
Eclipsing
the darkness with flames,

81
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,511
and brightening the hearts
of the mistreated.

82
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,893
The mighty sunfighter is here.

83
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,186
The mighty...

84
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,187
Sunfighter?

85
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,110
Nine against one, huh?

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,946
How about I even things up.

87
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,281
Don't stick your nose where
it doesn't belong, kid.

88
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,908
We're the Seifukai.

89
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,411
Yeah, spare us the sideshow
act, move along, sunshine.

90
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,664
Tell you what, you
overdressed wannabes,

91
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,875
I'll give you to the count of
three to take a hike or else.

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,585
One, two!

93
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,295
Or else what?

94
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,089
Don't worry, I'm
gonna show you what.

95
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,801
Break it up!

96
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,718
Moai?

97
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,554
Deputy leader!

98
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:49,432
Drop it, do you really think
these little kids took Genma?

99
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,476
So Moai is a real person.

100
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,728
I don't know who this Moai is,

101
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,023
but I'm Doai, yes,
and you are finished here.

102
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,944
No, Zanya's finished
when he says he is.

103
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,988
Gao, you okay?

104
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,739
A girl‐‐

105
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,450
What's wrong? All of a sudden,
you don't look so good.

106
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,579
I'm fine.

107
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,997
It's nothing.

108
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,790
Let's get out of here!

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,007
Check the buddy skill.

110
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,008
Oh yeah?

111
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,217
Didn't notice.

112
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,222
So you're Gao.

113
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,683
The great Buddyfighter
everyone's talking about,

114
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,477
who defeated Tasuku Ryuenji.

115
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,981
It really wasn't as awesome
as everyone is saying.

116
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,109
The thing is, it seems
our Seifukai leader,

117
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,653
Genma, has gone missing.

118
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,614
Seriously? What
about the tournament?

119
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,742
Everybody knows that he's
favored to win again this year.

120
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,911
Bro, he's gonna miss the match.

121
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,497
Unless he turns up soon,
which seems unlikely,

122
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,500
I'll have no choice but
to compete in his place.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,377
But what about the Kouryuken?

124
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,714
The famous Seifukai deck,
handed down over generations?

125
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,842
If it's missing too, what
will you use in the match?

126
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,137
Don't worry, my team
is always prepared.

127
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,307
As for you, Mr. Gao,
when you get to middle school,

128
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,727
I hope you join the Seifukai.

129
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,354
It's the best place for training

130
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,565
to become an
exceptional Buddyfighter.

131
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,233
You've got potential.

132
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,778
It's guys like you
that the Seifukai need

133
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,987
joining their ranks.

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
Can you believe it?

135
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,075
Gao with Seifukai?

136
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,910
Ho‐ho!

137
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,288
Just imagine, seeing
him in one of those suits.

138
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,082
Don't make me laugh.

139
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,751
It's a rare thing for
Doai to be so interested

140
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,128
in drafting somebody that young.

141
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,757
Wait, that voice,
I recognize it.

142
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey, it's sure been
a long time, Drumstick.

143
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,597
Old man Demongodle?

144
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
In the flesh.

145
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,184
You know each other?

146
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,397
Our dragon relatives have known
each other for many years now.

147
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,441
Even though they are
from lowly Dragonworld,

148
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,652
they've shared years
of friendly competition

149
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,278
with my Dangerworld kin.

150
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,739
You know, it's because of
fights with this guy here

151
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,951
that I've got such a hard
head on my shoulders.

152
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,537
Those were some
pretty good times.

153
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,705
Hm.

154
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,165
(shouting]

155
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,085
You still can't see anything

156
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,462
until it's right
under your nose.

157
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,756
Well, what do you think, Gao?

158
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,883
Seifukai has, like,
unique training

159
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,469
to teach you how to
become a fighter, right?

160
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,513
Yeah, you could say that.

161
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,308
In that case, I don't
need to join you.

162
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,812
Come on, I'm the

Let's reveal Cyber
Ninja Art's dominance.

323
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,103
We've surpassed human intellect.

324
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:24,442
I buddy call Nanomachine
Ninja Sugikage to the center.

325
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,695
There he is, I wondered when
he'd make an appearance, or not.

326
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,115
Zanya's buddy has the ability
to vanish and reappear at will.

327
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,117
Who knows where he'll
materialize next?

328
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,161
So girls, clear out
of the changing room.

329
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,916
Aw man, why'd she
have to go there?

330
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,503
I cast Clear Serenity.

331
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,380
He just increased his gauge?

332
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,301
Hirikakara Saizo,
attack Gaokorga.

333
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,929
Hide in the mist and
cut through the shadows.

334
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,807
Rotation sword navigates
through the unknown!

335
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:02,230
Okay, Shiden,
attack Demongodle.

336
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,773
I'm back!

337
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,149
What happened?

338
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,276
Demongodle doesn't
only have soul guard,

339
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,986
he also counterattacks.

340
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:14,075
Whoa, that's powerful.

341
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,495
Sukikage's ability,
nanomachine body replacement.

342
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,455
Nin.

343
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,498
No way.

344
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,749
Say what?

345
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,793
Did I tell you,
or did I tell you?

346
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,503
How could they attack
what's not there?

347
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,505
All this disappearing
and coming back to life

348
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,008
reminds me of a zombie
flick I saw on pay‐per‐view.

349
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,969
I think she needs a holiday.

350
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,428
Sukikage keeps coming back

351
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,931
as long as cards are
discarded from the hand.

352
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,141
Yeah, whatever.

353
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,060
Something's not right.

354
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,311
Like what?

355
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,521
Your move.

356
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,106
I draw.

357
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,275
Wishing you could
come after me, hotshot?

358
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,610
You'll have to defeat
Sukikage, first.

359
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,696
But good luck with that,
he's invincible.

360
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,574
I don't need any advice
from a beginner like you.

361
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,492
Charge and draw.

362
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,494
This just doesn't make sense,

363
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,330
unless he's trying to
use Sukikage as bait.

364
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,500
I call Ogre to the left!

365
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,043
Ogre!

366
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,631
Go and crush that stealth ninja
dweeb standing in the center.

367
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,091
Ogre!

368
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,175
Nice try.

369
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,429
Nanomachine body replacement!

370
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,973
Sukikage has come
back yet again.

371
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,268
Seriously, how many times are
we gonna see this zombie rise?

372
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,936
Seifukai never quits!

373
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,231
Demongodle, attack!

374
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,235
I cast Demonwainorohikigami!

375
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,112
That's a reflection
in the mirror.

376
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,241
Your attack just rebounded
and took out your own monster.

377
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,868
End of move.

378
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,245
Impossible, my Demongodle.

379
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,997
Is that really all you got?

380
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,207
This is the most boring
match I've been in.

381
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,502
You punk, you'll pay
for destroying my buddy.

382
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,378
Your move.

383
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,630
Draw.

384
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,798
Now you'll see why I'm the best.

385
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,553
So now I'm gonna call
Hirikakari Saizo to the right.

386
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,847
Attack the fighter,
ninja warriors.

387
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:08,606
♪

388
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,691
Come on, Doai!

389
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,443
Wow, what a display!

390
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,280
Zanya's ninja arts are wiping
the floor with Doai out there!

391
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,407
The Seifukai might've
made a tactical error,

392
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,493
keeping Genma on ice.

393
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,413
Your move.

394
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,625
So, it appears, I may have
underestimated this guy.

395
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,210
But it's not too late.

396
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,921
It's time to put an
end to this mockery.

397
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,299
Draw, I charge and draw.

398
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,718
I must rely on your
strength once again.

399
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,012
I call Gaokorga to the right,

400
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,806
and I will equip
Boulder Pierce‐‐

401
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,265
What are you doing?

402
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,226
Leaving your center
open is way too risky!

403
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,436
Silence! Don't you question me.

404
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,564
Now, I equip
Boulder Piercing Spear!

405
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,818
Too easy, you fell
right into my trap.

406
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,403
No, don't do it, Doai!

407
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,947
Call your monster to the center
so it can protect you!

408
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,323
Defense?

409
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,909
Earth to Gao, I thought
you were a fan of offense.

410
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,995
Zanya's luring him into
a trap, I can see it.

411
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,373
You do seem to have a sixth
sense about these things.

412
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,166
I want to know what
Zanya predicted.

413
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,460
He's the one who's
seen all of Doai's cards.

414
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,674
I hope I'm wrong, then maybe
Doai can turn this around.

415
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,509
You still can't
see anything

416
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,886
until it's right
under your nose.

417
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,349
What's Gao seeing that I'm not?

418
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,560
I'll get the showoff
in the red scarf.

419
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,770
You're going to see what
the Seifukai are all about,

420
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,147
ninja boy!

421
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,189
I cast‐‐

422
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,609
What happened?

423
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,282
What's going on?

424
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,034
And how come my
spell didn't work?

425
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,038
Your predictability
led you right here.

426
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,708
When Kashin Kojin helped
me to see your hand,

427
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,169
I knew just how
you would respond.

428
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,088
And once I showed you
Sukikage's abilities,

429
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,885
I figured under the pressure,
you'd just use that card.

430
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,430
I will pay three gauge
to activate Lethal Formation,

431
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,390
Secret Sword Star Crusher!

432
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:15,149
♪

433
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,525
Game over.

434
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,487
Winner, Zanya Kisaragi.

435
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,532
Tatsuo Doai, I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,992
I got carried
away in the battle

437
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,411
and pushed things
a little too far.

438
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,913
You're a great warrior.

439
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,749
It could've gone
either way here today.

440
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,544
I'm sorry, too, for making fun
of your prime ninja skills.

441
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,005
I was wrong.

442
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,340
What a finish!

443
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,925
With so many mind
readers in the house,

444
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,343
how come no one knew
the middle school

445
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,637
was gonna lose two
straight matches?

446
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,931
Zanya's Secret Sword
Star Crusher allowed him

447
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,434
to cancel out Doai's spell and
inflict three damage points.

448
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,604
That ninja's one
master buddyfighter.

449
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,774
You know, bro, it wasn't because
Doai or his deck were inferior.

450
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,528
Yeah, it was Zanya, he's good.

451
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,613
You agree?

452
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,616
After today's match,
I gotta say.

453
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,701
He's the guy we need to beat.

454
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,123
Where are you, Genma?

455
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,085
I really should've been
fighting you here today.

456
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,545
That was terrible.

457
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,922
What a humiliating loss.

458
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,383
Doai is a disgrace
to the middle school.

459
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,301
Hm.

460
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,136
If I knew this
was going to happen,

461
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,432
I would've made sure Doai
had Genma's deck to use.

462
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,060
Well, it doesn't change
the fact that I'm going

463
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,313
to win this tournament.

464
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,107
Hey, wait for me.

465
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,859
Sukikage, quick go after them.

466
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,656
Why does Shido
have Genma's deck?

467
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,954
Hello there, I'm Paruko,

468
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,999
here to guide you through
the world of Buddyfight.

469
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,209
Seifukai's a club run
by student volunteers

470
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,171
of Aibo Academy Middle School,
led by Genma Todoroki.

471
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,091
He was last year's
ABC Cup Champion.

472
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,927
Apparently, he uses a
specially crafted Seifukai deck

473
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,055
that's been passed down from
generation to generation.

474
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,266
I don't have to tell you
guys that a deck like that

475
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,185
must be really strong.

476
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,770
Can you open a Buddy Rare card?

477
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,314
What do you think?

478
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,908
While Tatsuya and Djinn
face off in the third match,

479
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,119
Tasuku Ryuenji
disappears from Earth,

480
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,496
