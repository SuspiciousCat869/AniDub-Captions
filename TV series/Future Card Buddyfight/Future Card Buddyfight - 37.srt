The reason she
wears those glasses

166
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,105
is to hide her true feelings.

167
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,523
But if you look deep
into her eyes,

168
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,360
you start to see how
cruel she truly is.

169
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,236
That girl?

170
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,488
You're kidding me.

171
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,661
Time to tear it up.

172
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,205
You know I will.

173
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,040
Shazam.

174
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,876
That was off the chain, homie.

175
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,960
Represent.

176
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,378
Hey, don't you have a big gig

177
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,756
down at the Dragon City
Music Stadium in a few?

178
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,884
Yeah, gotta pay the bills
and show my fans some love.

179
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,055
All right, that's my buddy, the
hippest dance show host around.

180
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,475
I just got a Buddy Choice
Award for "Most Chill Demon."

181
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,437
Of course, I am the only
demon in the category.

182
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,481
Well, catch you
later, I gotta fly.

183
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,565
Stay real.

184
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,236
Now what'll I do.

185
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,821
Maybe I'll cruise to Gao's

186
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,532
and feast on his Grandma's
super fresh cooking.

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,992
Huh?

188
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,160
That you, A‐Dawg?

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,829
Did you forget something again?

190
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,247
Huh?

191
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,165
What's your deal?

192
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,458
What's my deal?

193
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,835
You're always in my way!

194
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,919
Well, where you
trying to get to?

195
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,673
I summon Divine Armor, Aegis.

196
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,050
Huh?

197
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,927
Your dancing is so irritating.

198
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,930
I'm putting a stop
to it right now!

199
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,766
Hey, that's not paid off yet!

200
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,393
It doesn't make sense!

201
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,399
Tell me right now, why is it
that you annoy me so much?

202
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,775
Answer me, banana brain!

203
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,444
Well, maybe you just
like indie pop better?

204
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,781
I could tell you
what's going on.

205
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,907
That was fast.

206
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,325
Wrong day, homes.

207
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,994
Good thing you're
not my manager.

208
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,580
The gig isn't until tomorrow.

209
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,747
Huh?

210
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,457
But it's a good thing,

211
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,459
because it looks like you're
losing a fight to a girl.

212
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,128
It's not what it looks like!

213
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,171
Hey, how's it going?

214
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,422
I'm Asmodai, the demon.

215
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,923
You don't intimidate me.

216
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,926
Now, you said you could tell me
why you irritate me so much.

217
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,428
Go on, spit it out.

218
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,054
Tell me now!

219
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,431
It's like I'm being hypnotized

220
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,267
by your lack of
shame or something.

221
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:28,021
Trust me, it's just as easy as
one‐two‐three, little sister.

222
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,608
Tets is always keeping it real,
in other words, he's free.

223
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,401
The reason you're
so irritated by him

224
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,820
is because you're way too
focused on power and approval

225
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,407
all the time, which means
you can't be free like he is.

226
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,366
What are you saying?

227
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,160
I am free.

228
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,662
Wait, at least I think I am.

229
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,456
To use a different lingo,

230
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,501
you're what we demons call,
"All shriek and no freak."

231
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,669
That's why you're
jealous of him.

232
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,964
He didn't care what peeps think.

233
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,799
That's crazy, I'm not jealous.

234
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,801
Taking life seriously
is what made me powerful

235
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,055
in the first place.

236
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,683
This guy's always acting
a fool, because he's happy.

237
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,687
It's happiness, and not power,
that makes him strong.

238
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,814
That's ridiculous.

239
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,733
If you won't give me
a proper explanation,

240
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,318
then I'll fight you for it.

241
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,446
For starters, here's my buddy.

242
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,698
Now you're in trouble.

243
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,743
Meet Gorgon
Three Sisters, Medusa.

244
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,495
You guys think you're so tough?

245
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,207
You're about to learn what
true strength really is.

246
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,792
Gorgon Three Sisters, huh?

247
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,835
I've never seen one
up close before!

248
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,921
Why don't we go over
and talk to her, huh?

249
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,714
Whose side are you on?

250
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,718
I don't know, she doesn't
look all that strong to me.

251
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,179
She's half snake and half girl.

252
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,431
Spoke too soon!

253
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,269
She's breaking my heart, I guess
that part must be the girl!

254
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,645
I've been called many things,

255
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,689
but no one's ever
called me weak.

256
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,692
So much for your
silly theory, demon.

257
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,402
No way, just leave him alone.

258
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,071
Don't sweat it, there's
nothing she can do to me.

259
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,572
I don't know.

260
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,409
Why are you protecting
your monster, banana boy?

261
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,412
Comes natural, A‐Dawg ain't
just the flyest Buddy ever,

262
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,788
he's my main man.

263
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,415
You actually care about him?

264
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,166
See, that's what I've
been telling you, lady,

265
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,377
he's a strong human because
he surrounds himself with homies

266
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,338
who've got good vibes, and he
sticks by them in hard times.

267
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
I don't want to hear it!

268
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,091
If my medusa shoots her arrow,

269
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,677
it'll be lights out
for dancing boy, here.

270
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,888
Are you afraid of
attacking us directly?

271
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,809
What is that spear,
anyway, an accessory?

272
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,269
Go on, come at us.

273
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,688
I promise we won't move at all.

274
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,274
You gotta recognize that
using a dark power like yours

275
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,609
doesn't mean that you're
any tougher than those of us

276
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,527
who don't use it.

277
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,112
Time to face facts,

278
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,905
if you hang around people
who sweat the small stuff

279
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,449
and you let them
tell you what to do,

280
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,825
then you're always
going to be thrown off

281
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,245
by guys like us who know
how to keep it real.

282
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,621
How's this?

283
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,623
If you manage to beat
Tets in a Buddyfight,

284
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,793
then my boy here will
do anything you say.

285
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,878
Say what now?

286
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,379
What you mean "anything"?

287
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,757
You really think
that he can defeat me?

288
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,052
I'll take that as
a yes, let's roll!

289
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,553
Bring it on.

Today's card is special.

488
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,626
Fighting Dragon Emperor,
Demongodol Ark.

489
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,336
His abilities are counterattack,

00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,922
Soulguard, and he can
even destroy weapon cards.

him on a Duel Dragon,

492
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,219
your opponent won't be able
to attack any other card.

493
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,014
Put him on top of Fighting
Dragon Demongodol and call him,

494
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,434
he'll be way strong
with a three Soulguard.

495
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,852
So what do you think, guys?

496
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,395
You think you can
open up one of these?

497
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,522
You'll never know until you try!

Next time, Kiri
is sad to find out

500
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,159

501
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,452
To make sure no one forgets him,

502
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,914
he challenges Kazane
to a big final showdown.
