00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,147
to the center!

330
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,566
Leave him to me!

331
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,608
And to the left area,

332
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,111
I call Thunder
Knight's Dragoarcher.

333
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:08,157
Using his ability,
I draw one card.

334
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,992
I will not miss my mark.

335
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,243
Okay, Drum, you're up.

336
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,786
Go attack the fighter!

337
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,080
(shouting)

338
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,001
♪

339
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,837
Whenever I get burned,
I'll burn you right back.

340
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,963
We'll fall together

341
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,008
into the spiraling
darkness of despair.

342
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,136
Now I cast Guillotine Cutter!

343
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,722
No, my Thunder Formation!

344
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,265
Now I've seen it all.

345
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,058
The wicked tough
Guillotine Cutter

346
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,768
can even destroy Set Spells.

347
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:40,147
'Kay, Dragoarcher,
go attack the fighter!

348
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,399
With arrows of justice.

349
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,776
I cast, with Black
Dragon Shield,

350
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,403
I receive no damage.

351
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:50,532
And as a bonus,
I regain one life point.

352
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,659
This is just too easy.

353
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,161

354
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,121
End of move.

355
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,957
I think it's time
to set the bait.

356
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,084
I expected more
from you, Gao,

357
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:03,795
being the Mighty Sun
Fighter and all that.

358
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,255
(gasping)

359
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,882
What would your
big brother Yota

360
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,718
say about your
performance here today?

361
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,053
If you ask me,

362
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,306
he'd be calling you
the "Mighty Failure."

363
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,475
(grunting)

364
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,852
I mean, look at you
in that lame‐o uniform.

365
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,730
What makes you want to be
a comic book hero anyways?

366
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,398
Talk about a joke.

367
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:24,983
Heroes are so boring.

368
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,818
They're always trying
to please people

369
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:28,820
and force their
cheerfulness on others,

370
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,322
doing what they
think is right

371
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,449
in spite of everyone
else's feelings.

372
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,076
Do you really
think your brother

373
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,328
would want you to be
acting like that?

374
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,162
I doubt it.

375
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,580
The nerve of this guy.

376
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
Come on, what is
he waiting for?

377
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,044
Don't listen to a word
this two‐faced poser says.

378
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,462
You know I'm right.

379
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,422
In this world,
wherever there's light,

380
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,675
shadows will appear,
and there are some people

381
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,262
who will find their rightful
place in those shadows,

382
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,807
like Kiri, your
pathetic little friend.

383
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,643
The more you shine,
the bigger your shadow,

384
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,145
the darker he becomes.

385
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,021
Don't you get it?

386
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,358
You're the one who
made Kiri change.

387
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,151
It's on you, Gao.

388
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,695
It wasn't me at all.

389
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,947
Why, you little
tongue‐wagging freak!

390
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,115
How dare you!

391
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,661
Nobody talks to my
Buddy Gao like that.

392
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,997
He did not just do that.

393
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,498
That rube is cheating.

394
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,584
Wait, is it possible he
did it against us as well?

395
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:25,419
It is.

396
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,004
So you mean you
knew about this

397
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,007
and you didn't bother
saying anything to anyone?

398
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,717
Well, I didn't
have any proof,

399
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,095
and I‐‐I didn't really know
what I should do about it.

400
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,722
Pretty sure I
missed something.

401
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,390
He distracts his opponents,

402
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,975
and then when they're
totally shaken up,

403
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,310
he breaks the rules.

404
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,229
This guy has no right
to be a Buddyfighter.

405
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,023
(grunting)

406
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm gonna move Drum
to the right next!

407
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,693
(laughs)

408
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,153
You're too much, kid.

409
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,070
Even though I cheated,

410
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,905
you still want to
continue the fight?

411
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,991
Guess you really are a hero.

412
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,034
All right, Deathgaze,

413
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,078
attack that slow‐witted
Drum Bunker Dragon!

414
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,496
Ah!

415
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,708
First I cast
Blue Dragon Shield!

416
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,629
So you think you can stop me?

417
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,590
Well, think again!

418
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,800
(grunting)

419
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,095
You okay, Gao?

420
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,930
Darkness Death Wand!

421
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,808

422
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,602
End of move.

423
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
That was way too close!

424
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,397
If Gao received
two damage points

425
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,107
from Deathgaze's
Spectral Strike,

426
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,026
it would've been over
right here and now.

427
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,986
Our Sun Fighter's
on the brink

428
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,614
with just one card and
two life points remaining.

429
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,617
No matter what dishonest
things you try to pull,

430
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,078
you are not beating me.

431
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,914
My victory's already
been decided, ha!

432
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,249
Do you think he'll know
what to do with that card?

433
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,501
Hope so, either way,

434
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,378
it looks like now
is his only chance.

435
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,838
This is where
things get real.

436
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,967
I draw!

437
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:56,968
Huh?

438
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,762
Charge and draw!

439
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,723
I equip Steel Fist,
Dragoknuckle.

Okay, Dragoarcher,

00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,897
Arrow locked and loaded.

443
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,567
I cast my Counter
Spell, Death Grip.

444
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,570
It's a great little card
that can defeat one monster

445
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,280
size two or smaller.

446
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,700
All yours, Drum,
attack the fighter!

About time!

448
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,578
You've earned this, punk!

449
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,872
I cast Black Dragon Shield!

450
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,082
Ah, give me a break.

451
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,333
I don't believe this!

452
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,002
Using Black Dragon Shield
this late in the match?

453
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,671
Wait, that prevents
Gao from using

454
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,047
his Gargantua Punisher.

455
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,383
But it's his signature move!

456
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,261
Steel Fist, Dragoknuckle!

457
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,847
(grunting)

458
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,224
Ha, I know my
center is wide open,

459
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,892
but I have five life points.

460
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,269
Even with enough gauge,

461
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,062
you can't cast
your impact card

462
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,356
unless my life
is four or less.

463
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,358
But he can with
a different card.

464
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,484
Hey, don't give it away.

465
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,987
Let them watch and
see for themselves.

the final phase.

‐Indeed, if that's the lesson

you've learned
today, then bravo!
