This is a super
strong card.

166
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,272
No matter how
strong it is,

167
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,692
if you're not able to
handle it during a battle,

168
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,610
then it's useless to you.

169
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,195
You've really got to know

170
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,490
the exact moment to
cast it from your hand.

171
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,825
It is a special card

172
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,868
and it'd be a bummer
not to use it.

173
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,079
But you're gonna have
to play with it a few times

174
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,123
to get your deck
into game shape.

175
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,624
So then‐‐

176
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,959
You're gonna need a tuner.

177
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,127
What's a tuner?

178
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,461
You seriously don't know?

179
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,880
Okay, now you just
made me all hangry.

180
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,299
Right, don't worry,
I'll explain it.

181
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,259
Well, if he's eating‐‐

182
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,302
Hey, wait, that's my lunch!

183
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,889
A tuner is what we
call a practice partner

184
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,683
who you get along
really well with.

185
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,436
Once I analyze the trial rounds
you have with your tuner,

186
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,646
Baku will rebuild
your deck from there.

187
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,440
That's about
the best way to do it.

188
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,152
Bottom line, bro, no tuner,
no Gargantua Punisher card.

189
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,486
You got me?

190
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,654
I got you.

191
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,864
Have anyone in mind?

192
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,948
Don't sweat it, we've got

193
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,783
the special
Buddyfight class next.

194
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,785
I'm sure I'll find
someone there.

195
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, I'll help you
scope out a winner, kid.

196
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,290
Hmm.

197
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,125
(door squeaking)

198
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,711
But the kid needs my help!

199
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,214
Monsters are not allowed in
the classroom during class.

200
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,674
Says who?

201
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,052
Before we begin,
are there any questions

202
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,637
about the strategies
you were asked to memorize

203
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,639
for homework?

204
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,932
Anyone?

205
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,394
Don't be shy now,
take a minute to think.

206

Gao!

208

Something you'd like
to share with the class?

209
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,361
I saw some
bananas walk in here.

210

Gargantua Punisher.

Gao adds plus one

Excuse me, Asmodai?

Gargantua Punisher

'Cause let's be honest,

about entertaining
the people of Earth.

Yeah?

To make the most out
of Gargantua Punisher,

553
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,792
I should reconstruct my deck.

554
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,169
Thing is, I don't
have enough monsters.

555
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,921
I could add some
dragon knights.

Dragon knights?!

557

I can't believe
you'd do that to me!

558

So, before
you build a deck,

you need to chose the world
that you want the cards from.

For example, Tasuku
Ryuenji and Gao Mikado

picked the Dragon World.

578

But Tetsuya Kurodake
uses the Magic World.

579

There are a few
