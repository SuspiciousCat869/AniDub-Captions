of seeing Gao defeat many
powerful opponents before,

241

he always seems to use

Dragon Shield
to defend himself.

243

I'll explain.

244
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,091
It may seem he has the
dumb luck to help him draw

when he needs it,

Instead, leaving it in
his hand to the last second!

249

Because of that, I'm guessing
the card he has in his hand

00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,411
Gao's giving it his
best shot out there,

330
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,289
but he seems ill prepared
for Paruko's amazing skill

331
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,708
and her timely
counter spells.

332
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,084
We'll just see about that!

333
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,216
(sighs)

334
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,302
I forgot the match.

335
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,889
Here comes a second Martian Zap
Zap Beam from yours truly.

336
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,266
Unfortunately, somebody's
perfect formation

337
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,185
has a crucial flaw.

338
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,519
It's easy for his
opponents to guess

339
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,937
which cards he's holding up,

340
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,481
and do you know what's
even more predictable

341
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,774
than the outfit
he's wearing?

342
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,151
Boomerang Dragon just
returned to his hand.

343
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:24,489
You're probably the only person
who would realize that.

344
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,033
Who's ready for
some more zapping?

345
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,410
(screaming)

346
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,706
Now, Paruko's using Martian Ray
Gun on Thousand Rapier Dragon!

347
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,917
(screams)

348
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,835
And then she's
sending Warrior Einder

349
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,754
to attack the
fighter, Gao!

350
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,548
I cast my famous
Green Dragon Shield!

351
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,218
And with that he's used
the last Dragon Shield card

352
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,804
remaining in his hand.

353
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,099
But nothing can stop this girl's
next electrifying attack.

354
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,851
She hits Gao with
another Solar Panel Man!

355
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,853
I cast Dragonic Formation!

356
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,857
And I use Drum's
move ability.

357
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,901
He doesn't need
more shield cards

358
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,028
cause he's got
a shield in me.

359
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,988
Solar Kick.

360
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,156
(grunts)

361
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,909
The rest is up
to you, kid.

362
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,202
No problem!

363
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,370
It's not over yet.

364
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,372
‐I cast.
‐What's that?

365
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,624
The super spell
Hero Climax can be used

366
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,086
after a player defeats two or
more of an opponent's monsters.

367
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,754
Thanks to playing
this special card,

368
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,340
Paruko gains
two whole life points.

369
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,636
And it allows UFO Takosuke
to attack one more time.

370
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,179
UFO Battle Skill!

371
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,389
(groaning)

372
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,724
Galaxy Crash!

373
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,020
(screaming)

374
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,731
And he's down to
just one life point!

375
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,527
Meaning my victory is
as sure as my hair is pink!

376
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,904
I never thought
the day would come.

377
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,032
He might actually be out of the
running after the first round.

378
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,908
(groans)

379
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,951
This is bad.

380
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,371
I didn't travel all
this way for nothing.

381
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,372
You're back.

382
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,540
Yeah.

383
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,208
How's Gao doing
in the fight?

384
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,877
Even though victory
is all but assured,

385
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,461
our starlet's
hesitating.

386
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,547
Knowing his luck,
Gao might still draw

387
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,508
his Roaring Slash
Gargantua Punisher card.

388
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,676
That could
change things.

389
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,927
‐Hang on a sec.
‐Huh?

390
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,137
I won't let
you tell people

391
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,931
that my playing style
is just a matter of luck.

392
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,267
Explosive Dragon Fang
is a special deck

393
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,852
that was made just for me

394
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,479
by probably the greatest
deck builder ever.

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,565
That's why the card
I need shows up in my hand

396
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,942
just when I
need it the most.

397
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,696
Cool, thanks, bro.

That's quite an
amazing impact card.

404
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,965
I really can't find the words
to describe what just happened.

405
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,508
It wasn't very professional,

406
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,801
but that's all I
could think to say

407
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,346
when I first saw Roaring
Slash Gargantua Punisher.

408
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,973
Understandable, but you
shouldn't let it get you down.

You're not alone.

410

Everyone there was
astonished by it, I'm sure.

You just happened to
have the microphone.

M'lady is right.

413

To me, it speaks as a
testament to your dedication

414
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,944
as a Buddyfight
announcer, Miss Nanana.

415
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,238
As you know, I was
fortunate enough

416
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,450
to be on the receiving end
of Gao's previous impact card.

417
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,162
Gargantua Punisher!

418
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,334
It was completely
unlike anything

419
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,878
I had ever
witnessed in my life.

420
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,630
I felt scared, while
at the same time,

421
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,715
feeling a real
sense of joy.

422
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,634
Even though I
lost the fight,

423
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm very glad I was able
to personally experience

424
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,555
such an incredible move.

425
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,014
I will never forget it.

426

That's my dear
lady, Suzuha.

427

She's the pinnacle of
elegance even when defeated.

428
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,523
Well, I've done commentary
on the Gargantua Punisher.

429
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,525
I'm sure I can
handle it in a match.

430
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,235
Just remember,
there's a big difference

431
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,153
between watching
from the sidelines

432
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,447
and experiencing
it for yourself.

433
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,032
Huh?

434
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,200
Take it from me.

435

Experience is a treasure
greater than any other.

greater than any other."

as the final fighter
of Team Goddess

00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,381
to become a
better announcer?

441
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,800
I guess it all comes
down to Gao's next draw

442
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,302
and charge and draw.

00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,820
you'll use the things
you learned today,

491
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,489
and that you'll give Roaring
Slash Gargantua Punisher

492
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,492
the full airtime
it deserves.

493
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,160
Right, I'll
do my best!

494
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,459
Now, it's time for
the next two teams

495
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,045
in the first round of the
Gaen Cup to step forward.

496
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,338
But at the request
of both teams,

497
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,840
there's been a special
exception made.

498
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,759
All players will now be named
before their games begin.

499
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,096
First up, is Team
Three Brothers Konmae!

500
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,223
I'm Akaoni.

501
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,350
And I'm Aooni.

502
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,478
And this is my match,
I'm Kurooni.

503
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,357
And we three brothers are gonna
take this tournament by storm!

504
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,025
(crowd whispering)

505
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,486
It's not surprising
that the crowd's unsettled.

506
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,363
I mean, everyone knows
that two of the brothers

507
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,450
are criminal fighters who were
arrested by the Buddy Police.

508
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,161
Akaoni and Aooni have been
trying to change their ways,

509
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,621
so we gave them special
permission to participate.

510
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,540
We've always made an
effort to give offenders

511
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,208
second chances
when they're due.

512
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,918
Competing in this
tournament will help them

513
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,379
complete the transformation
of their characters.

514
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,549
It's in the very spirit
of Buddyfighting.

515
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,593
There's no other
game quite like this.

516
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,303
So please join me now,

517
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,847
and welcome these
fighters here today.

518
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,140
(indistinct whispering)

519
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,226
And their fierce opponents are
Team Darkness Masterminds.

520
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,062
Featuring Aibo student council
president Magoroku Shido

521
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,107
and well‐known cheat,
Davide Yamazaki.

522
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,068
Is it just me or is it weird
that they know each other?

523
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,029
And hey, where's
the third member?

524
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,406
Let's just say
we're keeping him on ice.

525
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,408
We plan on sweeping
the first two games,

526
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,160
so he's not needed yet.

527
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,286
What'd you say?

528
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,497
You think you're
any match for us?

529
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,415
Come over here
and say that!

530
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,667
I can see that your
pride's been hurt,

531
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,378
but we're superior
in every way.

532

Believe what he says for
the world we fight for

533
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,219
is none other than the
Darkness Dragon World!

(breathing heavily)

537
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,684
There's no
doubt about it.

Katana World's new impact card:

Well, when you set the
spell and pay one gauge,

566
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,176
all of the ninja cards that a
player has out on the field

get a boost of
1,000 power and defense.

the card already starts
strengthening your ninja.
