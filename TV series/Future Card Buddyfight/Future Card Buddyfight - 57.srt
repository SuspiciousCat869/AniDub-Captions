and for that
I'll punish you.

a spell or a monster?

Captain Answer's card.

455
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,948
When it's played,
the fighter must predict

456

if the top card
in the deck is

457

a spell or a monster.

458

And if he chooses correctly,

459
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,870
