Winner:

both of my tuners
with such ease.

What?

Is that a problem for you?

No, it's just I‐‐

You'd like to join but
you have some conditions.

176

Mm‐hmm.

177
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,483
You must promise not
to ask me about my past.

178
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,734
Does this have
something to do

179
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,736
with what happened to
you before I found you?

180
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,947
Lying unconscious in
the underground maze?

181
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,031
Yes.

182
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,282
Very well.

183
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,036
I promise I'll never
ask you to speak of it.

184
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,373
But I could sense that my
words didn't mean much to her.

185
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,375
I believe she only
accepted my invitation

186
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,502
because there was
something she was seeking.

187
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,462
Something she
needed to prove.

And what a
beauty she is!

236
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,486
Our mystery girl
really cleans up good.

237
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,947
FYI, we've learned that she's
currently serving double duty

238
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,241
as her middle school's
secretary of the student council

239
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,909
and its vice president.

240
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,869
Everyone knows the president
does all the work.

241
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,789
They'll see how useless she
is when she loses her match.

242
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,915
I don't know.

243
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,458
I hear she's
pretty tough.

244
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,418
Though I'm surprised
that she's even here.

245
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,503
When she went missing,

246
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,588
I assumed you'd banished
her to your dungeon.

247
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,923
What? That's ridiculous!

248
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,259
You'll get me in trouble
starting rumors like that!

249
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,344
Besides, if you must
know, I'm a pacifist.

250
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,720
(chuckles)

251
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,348
I wonder who's responsible for
letting her out of the maze.

252
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,269
Someone's been sticking their
nose where it doesn't belong!

253
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,020
Looks like an
interesting fight.

254
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,605
I certainly hope so.

255
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,940
As we were saying earlier,

256
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,609
in order to spread the
popularity of Buddyfighting,

257
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,778
maintaining high
ratings is paramount.

258
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,447
Miss Kuchinawa,
you've more than exceeded

259
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,700
my expectations this time.

260
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,951
Draw.

261
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:04,122
Charge and draw.

262
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,832
Are you sure about her?

263
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,333
I am.

264
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,418
See for yourself.

265
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,460
It's obvious.

266
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,213
The Dark Core has
completely accepted her.

267
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,633
With her potential, she'd be
a perfect fit for Disaster.

268
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,136
Even so, she's been
at it a while and yet,

269
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,181
continues to be
a disappointment.

00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,223

00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,143
I've seen enough.

273
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,645
She won't amount
to anything.

274
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,772
You're making a mistake!

275
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,316
Huh?

276
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,067
I'll prove you wrong!

277
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,278
I have the power within!

278
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,447
See, I told you
she could do it.

279
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,242
She's awakened the Disaster
Force in record time.

280
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,827
That troublesome
girl was supposed

281
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,163
to fight
against Mikado.

282
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,040
But it doesn't
really matter now.

283
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,542
I have a new plan.

284
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,919
I draw!

285
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,630
Now, I charge and draw!

286
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,465
Come on.

287
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,009
This'll be
her last fight.

288
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:02,138
I call Stheno to the center,
and Euryale to the right!

292

Euryale gains

way strong.

Tetsuya cranks it up.

301
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,912
Time to flip the
script and draw.

302
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,498
Charge and draw!

303
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,876
I call to the center,
Great Duke Astoroth, go!

304
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,379
That monster has
a one card soul guard.

305
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,673
No matter what
you do, it's useless!

306
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,424
You could never
win against me!

307
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,843
Why don't you
just give up already?

308
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,262
I think she likes you.

309
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,847
Usually when girls get
this mad, it means something.

310
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,974
‐For real?
‐Huh?

311
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,393
Why are you telling him
such complete nonsense?

312
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,145
My mama always told me that
I should just be myself,

313
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,647
so that's how I roll!

314
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,524
I cast Nice One!

315
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,985
Astoroth's ability increases
the number of cards

316
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,903
in Tetsuya's
hand at no cost.

317
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,280
I knew he had it in him.

318
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,617
I call to the left position,
Demon Realm Architect, Gamigin.

319

(chuckling)

320
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,288
If you're calling me,
you must want a set spell.

321
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,914
So, what is it
you want me to build?

322
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,249
If it's cool,
could you hook me up

323
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,042
with a Solomon's
Great Barrier?

324
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,210
Yeah!

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,629
That spells changes all

a special rare!
