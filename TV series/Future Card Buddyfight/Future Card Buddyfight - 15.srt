00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,792
Both of today's teams
are from elementary school.

167
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,669
They beat the tough
middle school competition

168
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,670
to get here.

169
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,588
And each fighter
uses Dragon World

170
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,591
so you'll be glad you
showed up for this one.

171
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
What's with Gao?

172
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,678
He's totally creeping me
out with his rage face.

173
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,429
Now let's check out
the player interviews

174
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,682
we did before the
tournament started.

175
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,058
So, I'm Gao Mikado.

176
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,143
I'm in sixth grade and
I fight for Dragon World.

177
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,480
I want to shout out
to my team, Balle du Soleil.

178
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,607
Many of us also
affectionately know Gao

179
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,942
as the king of dumb luck.

180
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,610
Now let's meet his opponent,

181
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,654
the number two ranked
fighter in his grade,

182
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,614
Noboru Kodo!

183
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
I don't know, I guess
I went with Dragon World

184
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,951
'cause the
Dragon Knights rock.

185
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,661
Better than Armor Dragons.

186
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,287
Those guys are weak.

187
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,039
That was Team Rising Tiger.

188
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,916
Now let's get
this party started.

189
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,751
Hey, Noboru.

190
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,086
Huh?

191
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,630
Isn't there something
you forgot to tell me?

192
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,757
Thought you'd actually
get away with it, huh?

193
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,677
Huh, what's he
talking about?

194
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,429
I wonder what
I did this time?

195
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,182
I really can't ever catch
a break in this place.

196
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,852
Uh, who cares,
I'll play along.

197
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,019
I'm leaving anyway.

198
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,814
It'll be easier if
he stays mad at me.

199
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,691
With bravery and honor,

200
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,817
by order of the dragon,

201
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,611
the trusty sword
that reigns over villainy.

202
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,196
Time to luminize!

203
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,490
Knights unleashed!

204
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,785
Showering the sky
with scorching sun rockets,

205
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,162
luminize!

206
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,080
Select dragon deck.

207
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,498
How does the saying go,

208
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,877
when in doubt,
buddy...

209
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,754
Fight!

210

‐With pride, we raise the flag.

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,053

Noboru, just know that
I'll never forgive you, man.

217
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,939
Whatever, quit with the
yapping and start playing.

218
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,817
Come on, bring your worst.

219
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,069
I remember
when he transferred

220
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,072
to Aibo Academy
three years ago.

221
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,617
He always seemed to be alone.

222
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,579
Hey, Gao, that is your name,
isn't it, pal?

223
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,081
Why are you sitting
here by yourself?

224
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,832
It is recess, you know.

225
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,211
I'm just chilling.

226
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,713
Get real, come and play
some dodge ball with us.

227
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,006
We need a fourth.

228
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,633
Uh, for reals?

229
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,718
Well, I wouldn't
be asking if I wasn't.

230
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,678
Cool.

231
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,640
Back then, when I asked
him to join our game,

232
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,810
I didn't really
think anything of it.

233
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,731
Crash, Drill Ram Bunker!

234
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,732
End of loop.

235
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,109
That's what I call
an opening move.

236
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,361
Gao buddy calls
and challenges Noboru

237
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,695
with a direct attack.

238
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,906
Hey, you know that day
we first met each other

239
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,241
back in the third grade?

240
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,742
How can I forget?

241
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,952
You were sitting
all by yourself,

242
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,578
looking all sad and lonely.

243
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,747
I just had to
take pity on you.

244
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,207
I'm gonna buddy call.

245
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,126
Dragon Knight, El Quixote
to the right.

246
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,211
Here we go, Rocinante.

247
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,587
People used to avoid me,

248
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,090
and then one day you started
including me in things.

249
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,925
So why was that?

250
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,678
I felt sorry for you,
looking like a loner.

251
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,763
So I asked you to
play some dodge ball.

252
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,932
I call Red Baron
to the left.

253
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,642
In trust, I trust.

254
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,644
You have no idea
how stoked I was

255
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,271
that you let me
play with you guys.

256
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,605
Huh, whatevs.

257
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,983
We just needed an even
number of players is all.

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,362
I equip Twin Dragonblades,
Dragoanthem.

259
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,780
We would have asked
anyone to play,

260
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,284
it didn't have to be you.

261
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,077
I know that one.

262
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,121
He's using the Gao formation.

263
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,748
Guess you've got to
fight fire with fire.

264
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,127
Hey, stop copying my
big brother's moves!

265
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,628
Does she have a mute button?

266
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,965
I don't know, do you have
a fast forward button?

267
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,801
Uh, you guys, you're
harshing my mellow.

268
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,428
Quit embarrassing me,
all right?

269
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,971
Prepare for my attack.

270
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,140
You really don't get it.

271
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,476
Haaaa!

272
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,145
Aah!

273
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,730
Grrrr!

274
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,815
You won't get rid
of me that easy.

275
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,775
Oh, yeah.

276
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,904
But I wanted to fight.

277
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,031
Uh, that's not good.

278
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,533
An assault of glory.

279
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,828
Aaagh!

Uggh.

282
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,167
End of move.

283
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,086
Total bummer losing Drum
so early in the match.

284
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,965
Dragoanthem's double attack
is a wake up call for sure.

285
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,470
Yeah, his soul guard
was basically useless.

286
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,512
Well, that's a surprise.

287
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,681
I was expecting to see
different fighting styles.

288

It seems these two are a lot
more similar than I thought.

00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,893
for making me
look bad in judo.

329
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,022
Thousand Rapier, attack
him together with me!

330
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,023
Hah!

331
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:35,815
Whatever your reason,

332
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,983
it's because
of Buddyfighting

333
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,360
that I was able to
make friends again.

334
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,947
By using Dragoknuckle,
Gao's gauge jumps up to three.

335
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,992
Noboru's down to
just four life points.

336
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,910
Let's see how he responds.

337
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,870
Your move.

338
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,080
Guess that was my bad then.

339
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,166
You're clueless,
but hang on.

340
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,169
You're about to be
severely enlightened.

341
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,466
It was like a bad dream.

342
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,176
I couldn't
believe that you,

343
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,218
a Buddyfighting newbie,

344
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,804
actually opened
a buddy rare card.

345
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,974
And then followed it up
by beating Tasuku Ryuenji

346
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,434
in front of the whole school!

347
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,895
You know how long
I'd wanted to do that?

348
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,147
I used to be number one
at whatever I tried.

349
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,940
But now it seems
like everyone's

350
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,650
getting better
than me at stuff.

351
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,402
It's not fair!

352
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,322
And it's not fun losing
to you all the time.

353
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,491
I've played this
game for longer.

354
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,326
Do you expect me
to just give up

355
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,578
and tell you I don't
have a chance against you

356
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,996
as a Buddyfighter?

357
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,040
No, but you sure
could have told me

358
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,584
a few other things, man.

359
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,961
It's real easy
for you to say.

360
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,340
You hardly ever
have to admit defeat.

361
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,092
I want to be the best.

362
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,843
I will be number one.

363
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,097
And I won't let
anyone get in my way.

364
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,890
You'll learn what
it's like to stand by

365
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,350
while the winner
gets the applause.

366
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,560
Then maybe you'll
understand what it feels like

367
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,062
to be me.

368
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,647
Let's see how you like this.

369
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,314
‐Stop!
‐Stop!

370
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,399
Huh, huh?

371
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,943
What's going on, Noboru?

372
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,528
You're letting
his talk distract you.

373
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,403
Yeah, calm down.

374
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,531
Hey, what are you
guys doing in there?

375
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,032
You been here
the whole time?

376
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,534
We thought you
might need some help.

377
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,952
And I guess we were right.

378
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,121
That is what team
mates do, after all.

379
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,372
Right, team mate?

380
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,999
We were simulating tons of
game scenarios all morning

381
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,210
to prep for today's match.

382
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,130
We even did one for
the current situation.

383
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,382
No thanks, I can
handle it on my own.

384
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,591
It's under control.

385
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,053
Why don't you listen to some
friendly advice for a change?

386
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,931
Mmm, sorry, you're right.

387
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,474
Think of us as
knights in training.

388
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,600
What he said.

389
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,269
Fighting with
bravery and honor.

390
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,021
I never, well, thought
of you guys like that.

391
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,023
Well, I guess it's time
you started, huh?

392
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,400
Let's share
our feelings later

393
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,068
'cause now you gotta draw.

394
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,903
First I'll
analyze it for you.

395
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,073
Yeah, well I'm pretty sure
it's a little late for that.

396
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,117
You still have a
charge in draw, too.

397
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,994
Come on, just give it a shot.

398
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,412
Besides, we might
actually pull this off.

399
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,247
You don't know what
you're talking about.

400
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,124
We can't get
out of this one.

401
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,333
Let's try it anyway.

402
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,793
It's the knights code

403
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,588
to never ever give
up without a fight.

404
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,839
Draw.

405
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,757
♪

406
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,092
Hmm.

407
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,260
Green dragon shield.

408
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,679
So you're gonna charge
Dragon Knight, Masamune then?

409
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,182
Yeah, charge and draw!

410
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,936
‐Huh?
‐Nice one.

411
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,272
That's just the card
to help us get out of this!

412
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,107
You really think
it could help us win?

413
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,567
Abso‐freakin‐lutely.

414
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,277
You're a wicked
player, Noboru.

415
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,945
Drawing Slash
Strike, Dragoslasher

416
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,448
with the game on the
line is major league.

417
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,657
What's the hold up?

418
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,951
This plate armor isn't as
comfy as it looks, you know.

419
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,455
And it's not very noble
to keep an old man waiting.

420
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,457
Sorry, let's do this.

421
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,666
‐Go get him!
‐Go get him!

422
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,043
I'm gonna own this.

423
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,046
I call Dragon Knight,
Vlad Dracula to the left.

424
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,297
Here we go again.

425
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,381
Noboru's paid three gauge

426
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,425
to bring out that
powerful size two monster

427
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,052
that defeated
President Shido,

428
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,721
Dragon Knight,
Vlad Dracula!

429
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,599
I've arisen to quench my thirst.

430
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,227
Let us once again mark
our time together in battle,

431
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,354
young dragon warrior!

432
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,188
If you didn't know,

433
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,940
Vlad Dracula's
critical increases

434
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,317
with each Dragon Knight
that's in the drop zone.

435
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,778
Exactly how many are
there in the drop zone?

436
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,612
There are four.

437
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,073
Translation,
we're gonna kick it.

438
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,158
Vlad has four
critical points.

439
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,159
Good work, guys.

440
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,994
So let's see what
this guy can do.

441
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,706
Now I cast Slash
Strike, Dragoslasher!

442
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,209
Slash Strike,
Dragoslasher?

443
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,126
This isn't good.

444
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,171
That spell increases
his Dragoanthem attack.

445
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,172
To be more specific,

446
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,007
When there's a Dragon
Knight in the drop zone,

447
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,343
5,000 power can be
added to an item.

448
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,344
What?

449
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,430
That means Dragoanthem's
power is now 10,000.

450
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,059
And Noboru is able to defeat
any monster that's out there.

451
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,395
I move Halberd
to the center area.

452
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,397
♪

453
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,232
That's it, Gao,
you show him!

454
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,733
Show him what, kid?

455
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,444
That suped up Dragoanthem
is a major pain.

456
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,487
Doesn't look good.

457
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,196
Huh?

458
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,156
Hear me roar!

459
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,868
I cast Wrath of Dragon!

460
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,912
You shall not pass!

461
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,038
Say what?

462
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,708
The Wrath of Dragon spell
adds 6,000 power

463
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,044
and defense to an Armor Dragon
already on the field!

464
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,381
Which means Halberd Dragon
now has 12,000 defense,

465
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,550
so even Dragoanthem's
10,000 attack

466
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,386
can't defeat
Halberd Dragon now.

467
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,388
Not so fast!

468
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,556
Having said that,

469
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,182
Wrath of Dragon's
only effective

470
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,768
on the first attack
and not on the second.

471
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,728
Gotcha!

472
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,687
Arrgh!

473
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,773
Wow, Dragoanthem did
have a second attack!

474
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,234
Cool, this is so exciting!

475
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,402
I want Gao to win,

476
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,447
but I think Noboru
is super cool, too.

477
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,949
Hey, El Quixote,
go attack Gao again.

478
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,326
Right.

479
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,453
Let's ride, Rocinante!

480
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,372
An assault of forged
steel and courage!

481
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,290
Aargh!

482
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,751
Attack with Bloody Charge!

483
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,128
Noboru's in the zone.

484
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,089
Totally savage,
he can do anything.

485
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,343
People used to say that
about me all the time.

486
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,553
You're leaving
tonight, right?

487
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,721
Huh, sorry.
