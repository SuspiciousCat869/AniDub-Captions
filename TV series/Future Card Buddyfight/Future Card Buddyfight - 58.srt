monsters into reality.

As you know,
unlike previous rounds,

13
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,416
the fight pairings
for today's final

14
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,917
have been selected for us.

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,169
They are as follows:

16
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,504
Gao against Tasuku.

17
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,298
Zanya will be
fighting Rouga.

18
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,091
And Tetsuya will be
facing our school's

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,926
former vice president, Sofia.

20
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,597
Lucky for us, we
have a lot of Tasuku

21
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,641
and Rouga's matches on video.

22
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,808
So you two should
look at them

23
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,268
and familiarize
yourselves with

24
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,269
their fighting styles.

25
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,855
‐Good idea.
‐I'll memorize them all!

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,814
Hmm.

27
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,442
Our only unknown is Sofia.

I'm afraid we don't
have much data on her.

30
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,157
Until now, she's never
actually participated

31
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,700
in an official fight.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,785
Yeah, bro.

33
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,787
So Kuguru and I
are gonna recreate

34
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,247
the entire fight she
had against Kanahebi.

35
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,374
Sounds fly.

36
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,958
Can I do a cameo?

37
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,169
We got time to get
some popcorn so we can

38
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,254
get our snack on
while we watch?

39
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,637
‐Time to raise the flag.
‐Time to raise the flag.

00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,055
I'm with Katana World.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,057
I fight for Legend World.

42
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,975
The first thing
Sofia did was

43
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,477
charge and draw.

44
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,187
And then she said...

45
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,315
"I call Sirius
Lailaps to the center.

46
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,442
Now, go attack the fighter."

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,361
(grunts)

48
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,655
He used his set spell
Dark Ninja Technique,

49
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,658
Poison Mist Formation
to reduce Sofia's life points

50
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,742
on each turn.

51
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,496
Then played final showdown
on the Great Gojo Bridge.

52
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,748
With this spell card,
neither player can attack

53
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,875
monsters in the
right or left areas.

54
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,836
And with the Fire
Streak Ninja, Gokuen

55
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,921
in the center, he can
increase his defense

56
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,297
if he discards
the ninja cards

57
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,298
in his hand.

58
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,341
If I was Sofia right now,

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,176
I'd be shaking in
my high tops thinking,

60
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,303
"How am I gonna
attack this guy?"

61
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,139
You're telling me, Tuke.

62
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,516
I attack Lailaps
using Gokuen.

63
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,309
And I open up your
center and inflict

64
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,020
two damage using
Yoichi and Yamigarasu.

65
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,606
This is where Sofia's
skill really shines.

66
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,526
I call to the left
Moon Celestial, Selene.

67

To the center
Sirius Lailaps,

to the right

Stellar Deity, Astraeus.

70
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,701
A Buddy Gift gives me
back one life point,

71
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,286
and since I'm on a roll,

72
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,745
I'll set a spell.

73
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,206

probably look
something like this.

This'll help a lot.

But I kinda doubt her
basic fighting style

126
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,201
will alter that much.

127
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,204
A style that doesn't let
opponent's do anything.

128
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,330
I thought of that.

129
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,791
The key to the game
will be this:

130

Great Fate, Frozen Stars.

take a little break?

No way, man.

We haven't even caught
half of Tasuku's fights yet.

138
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,518
We don't have
time for a break!

Although it's essential
to do research on your

opponent before a match,

144
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,778
it's even more important
to go onto the stage

with your body and
mind in tip top shape.

care of the body part,

now just try and relax

the only contest

that Master Kyoya
cares about is the one

205

between Gao Mikado
and Tasuku Ryuenji.

206

So, I think you
should forfeit.

It may be
meaningless for you,

something to us!

You hear me?

213
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,666
Why don't you be
the one to forfeit?

214
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,544
Master Kyoya and everyone
else knows that your friend

increased his gauge

497
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,101
with Key of Solomon,
First Volume.

498
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,312
I cast Great Spell,

499
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,481
Devil's Rock and Roll.

500
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,775
Homie should've
started dancing sooner.

501
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,318
That spell returns
all monsters

502
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,487
to the player's hands.

503
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,905
I see what he's
trying to do.

504
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,407
Let's just hope it
gives him enough time

505
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,283
for it to work.

506
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,326
What a move!

507
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,412
By sending Sofia's
units back to her hand,

508
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,122
Great Fate's
ability has nullified

509
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,581
and the freeze is undone.

510
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,834
Plus, Tetsuya's
Solomon's Great Barrier

511
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,002
is reactivated.

512
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,338
What's more is that Devil's
Rock and Roll's ability

513
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,758
lets Tetsuya call as many
72 Pillars monsters as he wants

514
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,593
from the top five
cards in his deck.

515
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,096
Demon Sommelier, Zagan.

516
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,848
Yo, yo, yo.

517
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,100
Fallen Angel of Rage, Beleth.

518
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,520
Yo, yo, yo, let me
hit 'em this time, yo.

519
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,692
And my favorite homeboy and
buddy, Demon Lord, Asmodai.

520
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,818
In the house.

521
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,863
Hey, A‐Dawg, here's
something I just remembered.

522
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,697
Hm?

523
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,866
What I really want
that girl to know

524
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,868
isn't her history or info,

525
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,037
I wanna tell her how
fun Buddyfighting is, yo.

526
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,913
A'ight.

527
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,498
Now, let's get
back to biz.

528
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,585
It's a mass attack
by the 72 Pillars army.

529
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,545
I have something for you.

530
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,297
This time I won't miss.

531
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,801
♪

532
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,887
Here's the finish.

533
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,306
You haven't seen
the last of me!

534
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,560
Game over.

535
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,062
Winner: Tetsuya Kurodake.

536
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,314
We rockin' the bananas

537
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,900
and soon'll be chillin'
in our pajamas.

538
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,901
We rockin' the bananas

539
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,903
and soon'll be chillin'
in our pajamas.

540
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,321
I didn't think
it was possible

541
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,864
for her to lose.

542
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,075
Many gifts are found
in the unexpected.

543
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,119
(chuckles)

544
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,246
(groans)

545
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
Hmm?

546
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,208
What are you doing?

547
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,710
What if someone saw
you using those powers?

548
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,505
I guess I'd just
erase their memory.

549
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,965
Even you get
frustrated when you lose.

550
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,844
You killed it out there, man!

551
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,263
You talking about his
cardfighting or his dancing?

552
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,807
Okay, we're up next.

553
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,099
So, are you ready?

554
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,643
Nin.

555
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,520
(panting)

556
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,028
Hey.

557
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,488
Remember me?

558
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,533
Why, of course
I do, Tetsu dear.

559
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,784
Ugh, what?

560
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,869
You're one of
Asmodai's doubles?

561
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,830
What's the matter?

562
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,289
All I said was that
you should look up

563
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,415
in the balcony.

564
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,917
I never told you
that Terumi was

565
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,752
actually here, did I?

566
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,796
You're supposed to
be my homie, A‐Dawg.

567
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,797
What did you expect?

568
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,549
I am a demon.

569
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,175
Hmm.

570
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,011
I guess it's what
I needed to win.

571
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,054
Thanks, yo.

572
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,348
Hey, it was easy,
just like magic.

573
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,307
(giggles)

574
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,267
All right.

575
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,810
Let's give 'em
a victory dance.

576
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,311
Yo, yo.

577
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,146
Yo, yo.

578
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,565
Yo, yo.

579
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,985
Buddyfights sure look
like they'd be a lot of fun.

580
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,319
‐‐our pajamas.

581
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,904
Don't let our
dance moves fool ya.

582
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,116
On the Buddyfight stage,
we'll school you, yo.

583
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,117
Word!

584
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,494
It's time for‐‐

585
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,829
Tasuku and Gao's‐‐

586
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,497
Card of the Day!

587
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,915
Today we're gonna
tell you all about

588
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,001
the amazing card
Great Fate, Frozen Stars.

589
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,003
If you use it and have
star attribute cards

590
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,671
in your left
and right position,

591
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,922
you can nullify
the abilities

592
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,340
of all the cards
in your opponent's

593
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,717
field and soul.

594
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,468
And if you have
Stellar Deity, Astraeus

595
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
in play, then the star
attribute cards in your

596
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,222
left and right area
can't be destroyed.

597
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,724
It's a tough combo
that's sure to give

598
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,684
your opponent
a big surprise.

599
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,852
So, what do you think, guys?

600
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,562
You think you can
open up one of these?

601
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,522
You'll never know
until you try!

we all know Rouga's been
living in Kyoya's shadow,

607
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,788
but in the middle of
his fight against Zanya,
