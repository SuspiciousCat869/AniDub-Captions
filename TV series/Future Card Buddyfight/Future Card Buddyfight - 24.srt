168

Mimic with a Prize is
a pretty fun card to use.

169
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,327
Whenever it's destroyed we both
have to check the top card

170
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,788
in our decks, and as long
as it's not a monster,

171
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,665
then you're golden.

172
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,835
I get back one life point.

173

And what if it
is a monster card?

174
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,340
Ah, Thousand Rapier.

175
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,509
You receive one damage point.

176
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,679
‐What a burn!
‐End of move.

177
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,848
But what if your card
had been a monster?

178
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,684
I would've suffered
one point of damage too.

179
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,312
So it's kinda like a
game of chance then.

180
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,023
‐That sounds fair.
‐Whether you're lucky or not,

181
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,525
if you want something you
should go out and take it.

182
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,695
So basically we
create our own luck.

183
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,989
‐Exactly!
‐What a kook.

184

Chatting all
friendly‐like with her?

185

could lose the entire match.

186

You ready to go down the
rabbit hole again, my friend?

that I haven't been
able to do anything.

196
