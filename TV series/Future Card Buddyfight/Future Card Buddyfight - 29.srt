If I beat someone

much for you to handle?

146
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,925
Don't worry,
I got it covered!

147
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,968
That's not allowed!

148
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,678
There must be a
rule against this.

149
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,430
He's always fought
for Dragon World.

150
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,808

up at the last second?

151
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,393

He just threw this deck
together last minute.

00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,711
you aren't using your
buddy skill in this fight.

Let me get this straight.

166

He's got a buddy, but he
doesn't have a buddy skill?

167

‐That's right.
‐It's so lame.

doesn't use one, yo.

not have a buddy skill?

fancy stuff.

178
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,036
His buddy is some rookie

179
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,540
who can't even get
him a buddy skill.

180

This is in the bag.

I'll reclaim the number one
spot in no time at all.

182

Since you're at such
a clear disadvantage,

183
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,467
let me come down to your level
to balance the playing field.

Whoa, thanks, man!

You're actually a

You think?

I doubt you'll
be saying that

art of strategy, Mr. Mikado.

Perfect.

Emperor Beowulf!

Normally Beowulf would
be my ace in the hole

then I would
save him for later,

have a very weak attack,

00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,097
Actually, you
got to zap me.

326
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,140
Say what, bro?

327
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,683
But you're my favorite!

328
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,643
Why would I want
to zap Gao‐wow?

329
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,062
(laughing)

330
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,521
This is too much!

331
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,523
Telling his own monsters
to damage him?

332
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,817
Does the mighty sun fighter
have sun stroke?

333
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,320
I knew his inexperience
with that Magic World deck

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,821
would play in my favor.

335
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,157
I never thought Gao would
try something like that,

336
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,367
but Axia's ability lets
him cause one damage

337
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,161
to either the fighter
or the opponent.

338
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,121
The guy's a total genius!

339
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,625
Hey, Axia, trust me
and just do it, okay?

340
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,169
‐I don't know.
‐Oh, come on!

341
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,254
But I don't want
to hurt him.

342
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,839
We need you
to do this.

343
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,801
You told me you'd do anything
I asked you to, right?

344
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,846
I did, but I never imagined
it'd be something like this.

345
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,641
I don't think I could harm
someone I care about.

346
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,851
I can't believe I actually
have to listen to this.

347
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,645
Are you going to
blast him or not?

348
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,022
Okay, this might
sting a bit.

349
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,191
Thunder Shock!

350
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm ready.

351
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,446
(grunts)

352
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,198
He took one for
the team, yo!

353
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,282
Now I get it.

354
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,868
By having Axia zap him,
he set up his next move.

355
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,328
He jumped through
all the hoops.

356
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,580
Now he gets to call
on Magician Drum.

357
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,040
No, not yet.

358
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,834
He's still missing
one gauge.

359
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,293
When did that happen?

360
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
How did his gauge
drop down to five?

361
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,382
This is like a major
emotional roller coaster!

362
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,591
Buckle up, Tets.

363
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,261
He used one gauge when
he called Axia out to play.

364
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,972
Then why'd he have himself
zapped down to five life points?

365
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,890
After I defeat you,
you'll have to tell me

366
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,518
how it feels being damaged
by your own monster.

367
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,728
Increasing my gauge
also confirms the fact

368
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,397
that you're not
a great fighter.

369
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,731
Quite the opposite.

370
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,316
Your skills and
playing style

371
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,569
are the very height
of dumb dumbitude.

372
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,197
I cast!

373
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,408
I'm gonna use Gotcha!

374
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,617
Gotcha! is a spell card

375
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,245
that lets the fighter
use the opponent's gauge.

376
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,289
So, during this turn
if Gao needs gauge

377
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,748
for any of his
monsters abilities,

378
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,750
he'll be able to pay
with Raremaro's gauge

379
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,752
as well as his own.

380
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,254
That's stealing!

381
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,964
The bro set himself
up perfectly.

382
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,383
Melerqim's ability
increased both their gauges

383
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,968
and by using
Raremaro's gauge,

384
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,761
now he can activate
Magician Drum's

385
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,388
Mega Blast Bunker ability.

386
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,640
Now, I'm gonna take
three of your gauge.

387
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,225
Please don't.

388
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,768
Nice use of the combo.

389
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,353
That's why I
threw it in there.

390
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,646
We've got the gauge!

391
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,273
Time to let 'er rip, Drum!

392

Gao has caused four
damage points to Raremaro!

And it's still his turn!

illustrious president?

Okay, Axia,
go zap him!

With pleasure.

405

Because I didn't use any hate
cards if that's what you think.

435
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,840
Grendel was just a card

want to say to you too, Mikado.

486
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,325
You would never be able to
beat me with that silly deck.

487
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,120
Built for your
own amusement.

488
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,997
I want to fight against that
kid I faced back at Aibo!

489
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,417
The one with passion
and courage!

490
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,377
That demands ignoring
everything else!

491
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,005
Focusing all your energy
and power on victory alone.

492
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:19,593
Give me that fight and
I'll take you any day!

493
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,679
I cast Drago Energy!

Final Phase!

It was impressive.

499
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,026
Probably the greatest Buddyfight
I've ever been a part of.

No, wait a second!

You don't understand
the truth!

take the next fight.

Okay.

505

Mikado should
know better.

506
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,916
You should teach him.

507

Of course.

508

And don't mess around,
you hear me?

509

I'll fight with honor
and spirit as I always do.

510
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,051
You should expect
nothing less.

511
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,220
Then, do it.

512
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,805
Our time has come.

513
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,266
I got to find a
way to tell him!

514
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,602
That wasn't the real
me fighting that time.

515
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,980
I promised myself we'd
become friends one day.

516
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,690
Oh, Drum!

517
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,650
Not again,
back off!

518
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,611
I'm so happy we won!

hugging team.

Mega Blast Bunker.

What's a little hug
between friends, huh?

Somebody get this
lizard off of me!

Hey, Gao!

526
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,752
So, tell us, how
was Magic World?

527
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,253
It was a total blast!

528
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,088
But I couldn't have
done it without you

529
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,674
and that Magic Guts
deck you built for me.

530
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,926
About that, bro.

531
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,928
We're all kinda wondering
why you called it that.

532
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,596
Where'd you get
that name, huh?

533
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,680
You remember.

534
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,933
I got it from you, man.

Thing about
deck building,

543

all about guts.

points to the fighter,
