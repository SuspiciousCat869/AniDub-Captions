We haven't had the pleasure.

329
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,083
It's Mr. Neginoyama, isn't it?

330
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,794
You're quite correct,
and your concerns are valid.

331
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,840
However, there is another
surprise that I've prepared

332
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,383
for the fans.

333
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,679
Please, take a closer look
at Mr. Aragami's core gadget.

334
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,472
(grunting)

335
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,266
It's called the
Dark Core Deck Case.

336
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,685
My applied sciences division
of the Gaen Financial Group

337
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,978
developed it.

338
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,231
I was led to believe that any
and all core deck cases are

339
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,775
issued directly from
the Buddy Card Office.

340
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,944
Exceptions can be made,
and this was done

341
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,613
with our official approval.

342
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,033
Just what made you decide
to develop such a thing?

343
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,368
Progress is often misunderstood.

344
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,120
Did you hear that?

345
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
You're aware that sometimes
Buddyfight cards connect

346
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,958
to parallel worlds and
cause monsters to appear

347
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,168
here on Earth?

348
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,377
Yes, of course, but‐‐

349
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,129
Then you'll also know
that the mechanism behind

350
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,590
this phenomenon is
shrouded in mystery.

351
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,509
My company was researching this
very thing when, by accident,

352
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,679
we discovered that spell and
item cards can also connect

353
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,139
to parallel worlds.

354
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,308
And in an effort to
materialize these things

355
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,311
at will, we developed
the Dark Core.

356
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,147
As you've just witnessed,
it has unbelievable effects,

357
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,482
but don't take it from me.

358
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,484
Let the people decide.

359
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,112
(crowd cheering)

360
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,406
Oo, so you're saying
that by using those things,

361
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,326
anyone can cast
spells into reality?

362
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,452
We're not sure.

363
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,496
We're currently asking
several fighters to use

364
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,999
Dark Core Deck Cases in
an experiment of sorts.

365
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,126
As you know, casting
spells into reality is

366
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,504
not against the
rules of the game.

367
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,423
However, having just one player
in a match able to wield

368
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,760
such power would obviously
be an unfair advantage.

369
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,473
That's why he's here.

370
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:42,603
You agree not to use the Dark
Power again in this match?

371
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,855
You got it, boss.

372
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,943
Hmph.

373
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,571
Now then, let's
resume the fight.

374
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,614
All right!!

375
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,533
After a brief but
exhilarating break,

376
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,995
it's time to get
back to the action.

377
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,871
Let's go, Durandal.

378
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,164
All right.

379
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,960

Aaah!

00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,175
End of move.

383
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,887
Ugh, you've improved
since last time.

384
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,142
He's one smooth operator.

385
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,810
What are you talking about, yo?

386
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,646
I don't think what just
happened was actually planned.

387
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,981
Why do you say that?

388
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,401
Just a hunch, but I think for
some reason Rouga was unable

389
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,696
to control that Dark Power
of his, and that spell card

390
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,615
accidentally activated.

391
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,035
Guess you could say
he's playing with fire.

392
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,412
Ah?

393
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,418
Being the quick thinker
that he is, Kyoya made up

394
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,629
a convincing story on the fly.

395
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,924
Cloud of Doom!

396
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,844
I will rise again.

397
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,012
Argh!

398
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:02,183
Equipment change, Divine
Protection Prydwen!

399

(roaring)

400
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,063
That item card allows a
player to pay two gauge

401
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,398
and reduce their
damage by two points.

402
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,484
(grunting)

403
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,028
Hey, Rouga looks
almost as mad as you did

404
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,571
when I ate your last pudding!

405
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,824
Yeah, right, it does seem like
he's kinda worried, though.

406
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,162
Rouga's wiped out all
of Kirisame's monsters!

407
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,539
That Thunder Devastation
spell kicks.

408
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,627
It destroys all monsters with
5,000 defense or less, yo!

409
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,879
Nothing can even
touch that guy's vibe.

410
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,923
His focus is so crazy!

411
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,259

00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,261

Your move.

414
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,725
Kirisame has only two
life points remaining.

415
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,644
This could be his last chance.

416
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:51,023
I call Galahad to the left,
and Percival to the right.

417
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,567
I discard the Holy
Grail card from my hand,

418
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,236
and Equipment Change.

419
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,988
I return Prydwen
to my hand and...

420
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,784
Who dares to pronounce
himself worthy of my blade?

421
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,993
I have chosen.

422

I acknowledge thee as my
master, Shosetsu Kirisame.

the King, Excalibur!

I will use this mighty,
ancient sword to fight you

with all of my strength!

427
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,386
Not bad.

428
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,430
That item has double attack.

429
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,267
Rouga has 10 life left, but
it's too late, don't you think?

430
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,687
Not at all, he can cut
that down in one turn.

00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,367
five life points, and his
opponent's not done yet!

know, Excalibur has...

No, you're wrong.

Kyoya is just a friend.

446
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,482
I answer to no one.

447
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,233
Did he say friend?

448
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,485
I think you're lying.

449
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,528
How dare you say that?

450
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,114
Back when I was concerned
only with strength,

451
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,911
and becoming all‐powerful,
you were... well, you seemed

452
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,915
to have an unexplainable power,
far greater than anyone else's.

453
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,461
I was naive to admire you the
way that I did, because now...

454
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,922
Now it's clear that you're
just someone living in fear

455
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,048
of his master!

456
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,051
You've got a lot
of nerve, Shosetsu!

457
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,553
But the reason for
your fear escapes me.

458
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,889
Could it be that you're
afraid of having it all

459
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,432
taken away from you?

460
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,601
That's enough!!

461
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,394
Don't you know that
power isn't something

462
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,605
that someone gives to you?

463
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:58,150
It's something you
must grasp for yourself.

464
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,486
This Sword of the
King taught me that.

465
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,239
Take it from me, you can free
yourself from his control.

466
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,951
I said that's enough!!

But this time it was
an item card attack.

a monster to your
center position.

489
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,258
But that doesn't matter, man!

490
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,843
Who needs an open
center when you've got

491
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,344
the Gao Formation, am I right?

492
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,055
It's a card that's a perfect fit
for any Danger World player.

493
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,517
Yeah, where power and strength
are totally where it's at.

494
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,685
So what do you think, guys?

495
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,312
You think you can
open up one of these?

496
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,064
You'll never know
until you try!

497
00:23:19,064 --> 00:24:45,943

498
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,907
Next time, Team Seifukai
fights Team Destiny

499
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,159
in the final match
of the first round.

500
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,120
But who's this guy
fighting Genma?

501
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,955
He looks kind of familiar to me.

502
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,248
