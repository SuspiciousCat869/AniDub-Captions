he can defeat Genma?

190

He's been gone a while,
maybe he's got

191

some wicked new skills?

Yeah, right.

Like you once told me,
I used to bolt and run away

from the idea
of being number one.

247
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,824
I couldn't handle it
when I lost and realized

248
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,952
I couldn't be the best,
and whenever I'd think about it,

249
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,831
I'd get scared
and avoid fighting anyone.

Dragon Knight Red Baron.

00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,838
But I learned something
when I lost to Gao.

253
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,926
If I wanted to be number one,
I needed to be stronger,

254
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,303
and keep trying,
no matter what,

255

just like my Buddy taught me.

I equip Carry Me and Fly,
Cavalry Dragon, Hyperion!

Hey, is that an item card?

258
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,733
Noboru has somehow
become one with the monster!

259
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,610
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

260
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,778
He's a Dragon Knight!

261
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,073
I can't believe he actually
found a way to become one.

262
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,450
Whoa, I never even knew
that card existed.

263
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,536
It has 7,000 power
and a critical of two.

264
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,872
If his attack works,
he will also increase

265
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,208
his gauge by one.

266
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,669
Now I get it;
you have the sun's strength

267
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,671
shining within you, too.

268
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,673

272
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,934
Since ancient times,
it's been said that wherever

273
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,978
there is light,
there will be shadow.

You're amazing, kitten shirt.

484
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,181
Guess we got another team
to be worried about, guys.

485
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,143
They're definitely
the ones to beat.

(cheering)

487

This wasn't part
of the plan at all.

488

I'm very sorry, sir.

489
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,317
I have no idea
how a stray cat...

490
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,737
I mean, Tiger...
wandered in like that.

491
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,739
What's that?!

492
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,367
There better be
a good reason for this.

493
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:11,205
Indeed, my battle arena
has been completely destroyed.

494
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,584
Yeah, Gao helped me, too.

495
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,670
Like you, I realized
it's never too late

496
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,631
to make some changes,
become a better person,

Between you and me,
we're secretly working

Uh...not that he
can't handle himself.

503
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,814
We just don't want him to worry.

504

Promise not to say anything?

Today, we're gonna talk
about the new ace card

512
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,500
in the Dragon Knights deck:

513

Calvary Dragon, Hyperion.

514
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,880
It's a super‐awesome card
with 7,000 power

515
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,256
and a critical of two!

516

It limits you,
'cause you can only call

517
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,843
Dragon Knight monsters,
but if you destroy

518
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,095
an opponent's monster
or deal any damage,

519

you'll increase
your gauge by one.

If you're using
a Dragon Knights deck,

you've gotta have this card.

So, what do you think, guys?

523

You think you can
open up one of these?
