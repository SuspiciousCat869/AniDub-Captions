But they were nice to me.

172
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,841
Don't you think
a true ninja

173
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,259
should be nice back?

174
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,344
Ow, let go!

175
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,262
Sorry I didn't tell
you where I was going.

176
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,221
That hurts!

177
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,890
We're leaving.

178
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,642
Hey, what's with
the 'tude, bro?

179
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,185
Why are you being
such a buzz kill?

180
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,354
You got a problem?

181
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,897
It'd be great if
you could, I don't know,

182
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,107
maybe say good luck in
the big match tomorrow.

183
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,442
Whatever you say!

184
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,654
Just stay away from me!

185
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,738
Huh?

186
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,323
Hey, there's nothing
to be scared of.

187
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,158
You should come
on in and join us.

188
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,910
Even rivals can
chill together.

189
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,786
What?

190
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,870
We're not rivals.

191
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,414
Is that your idea
of a bad joke?

192
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,874
I give you two turns.

193
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,709
What's he talking about, yo?

194
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,710
It's trash talk.

195
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,962
Katana World players
pray on opponent's moves.

196
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,256
A one‐turn victory
is impossible.

197
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,759
So he thinks he can
beat us in two turns.

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,927
(growls)

199
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,387
Prey‐‐I'm a predator‐‐

200
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,138
Who cares about tomorrow.

201
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,139
Some final.

202
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
Genma's the one I
should be fighting against.

203
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,309
It makes sense.

204
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,769
You wanna face him
because he beat you

205
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,062
in last year's final.

206
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,814
It's about time
I proved myself.

207
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,607
I just gotta keep
getting better and better

208
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,733
with every match.

209
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,611
But this term it's a bit
of a gong show anyway.

210
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,320
Wait up!

211
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,280
Sorry, guys!

212
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,365
Bye.

213
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,866
What's Zanya's deal, yo?

214
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,076
I don't like him.

215
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll teach him to be
afraid of the ladies.

216
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,372
I've never seen
Genma fight.

217
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,082
He must be pretty good.

218
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,500
I'd be bummed out
too if I couldn't

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,460
get a rematch against
the guy who beat me

220
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,837
in such a big fight.

221
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,800

222
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,594
Hmm.

(gasps)

224
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,934
Hey, Gao.

225
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,852
Thought I'd bring
the crew down

226
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,478
this morning to see
what you're up to.

227
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,813
We figured after last night

228
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,148
you'd be going
to look for Genma

229
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,274
and Doai.

230
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,817
(chuckles nervously)

231
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,318
I thought I'd try.

232
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,486
Well, we can help.

233
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,239
I'm not just good for rapping
and Buddyfighting, ya dig?

234
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,365
Not much time.

235
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,992
What are the chances
you'll be back in time

236
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,035
for your match?

237
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,287
I, uh, didn't
think about it.

238
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,913
I sure wouldn't
go out of my way

239
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,998
for Zanya, bro.

240
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,167
But knowing you,
you're gonna do it anyways.

241
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,128
I just get how it
feels to lose your rival.

242
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,047
You can't risk
missing the fight.

243
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,256
We'll take over the search.

244
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,258
Yeah, let us find
those disappearing

245
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,259
Seifukai, yo.

246

in your sleep.

It's cool that you came.

I almost didn't,
but Baku made me.

Come on, the
sooner we find him,

all over and I can

Yota always carried.

I've always been so unsure

about this
Buddyfighting.

263

strange judgment.

Is this really
about a favor

for an opponent
he's about to fight?

'cause Genma beat him
at last year's final,
