00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,255
Get ready for a cool new
card game that connects

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,965
to a parallel universe.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,177
Special cards act as portals
bringing monsters to Earth

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,638
to become buddies with humans,
and through friendship

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,974
and courage help them take
on fight challenges.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,769
It's called Buddyfight.

7
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,730
Come on, Drum.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,525
Stop being such a grump.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,568
We're no longer buddies!

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,655
Whatever, stay
here and sulk then.

11
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,822
Huh!

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,200
Huh!

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,165
Hmmm.

16
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,919

So what's the deal this time?

24
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,185
Arguing over the last donut?

25
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,814
No, it was chocolate pudding and
I didn't even know it was his.

I just wanted a snack and
he freaked out as usual.

The guy's way too
emotional about food.

I'll show him emotional and
I'll teach him to steal my food!

It's nice to meet all of you.

33
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,930
I shouldn't have
called him lizard brain.

I guess he must be
pretty mad at me.

Thank you, Kiri, hmm?

You saved me from those bullies.

I've been telling
everyone what you did.

Right, so how's it going?

41

I can't believe I'm actually

Looks like you've
got a fan, Gao.

Okay, Kiri, we're about
to start the lesson now.

45
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,957
Right.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,502
My name's Gao Mikado
but you can call me Gao.

47
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,712
The way you handled those
bullies, I was sure you were

48
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,172
in junior high school.

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,549
Yeah, I get that a lot.

50
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,384
Guess I'm mature for my age.

51
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,553
I'm just really happy
I got into this place.

52
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,430
I wasn't sure if I'd
be accepted or not.

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,807
I mean, Aibo Academy is one
of the super elite schools

54
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,685
in the country for
training buddy fighters.

Guess Gao's got a new pal.

61
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,206
This is so weird.

62
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,208
It's not like him to miss lunch.

63
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,212
I'd never hear the end of
it if I ate both of these.

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,797
So what should I do?

65
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh, man, oh.

00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,217
Hey there, Gao!

67
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,719
Uh, uh, Kiri!

68
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,722
Do you mind if I sit here beside
you and join you for lunch?

69
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,891
Uh, no, not at all.

70
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,437
I sure hope Drum's
not still mad at me.

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,441
Ah, I'd better find him
and smooth things over.

72
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,734
Oh, hi there, Gao!

73
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,027
Uh, oh, hey.

74
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,278
Want to walk home together?

75
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,324
That's totally cool that
we're going to be in the same

76
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,117
Buddyfight class.

77
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,453
Yeah, I was kind of
hoping you could coach me

78
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,746
in Buddyfighting.

79
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,748
I don't know, I just
started Buddyfighting

80
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,833
so I'm not sure I'm
the right teacher.

81
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,418
Oh, I understand.

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,836
Hey, I got it!

83
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,589
I'll introduce you to
the best teacher I know.

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,511
Relax, you're not too
young to Buddyfight.

85
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,805
I've even seen five
year olds playing it.

86
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,265
Yeah, well, I didn't start
playing till sixth grade.

87
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,559
Okay, first up you
gotta choose a world.

88
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,769
Ginga!

89
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,270
Huh, coming.

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,605
Is that a robot?

91
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:18,318
He's a Superspace Robo Galaxy
Demon and he's my buddy.

92
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,903
It's important to remember that
cards are grouped according

93
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,030
to their type.

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,658
Now we call these
different groups worlds.

95
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,701
The Dragon World cards are
pretty cool 'cause they have

96
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,454
a good balance of
offense and defense.

97
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,623
While the Danger World cards
are known more for their

98
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,959
super powerful and
speedy attacks.

99
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,086
They're both relatively
easy to handle.

100
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,005
Hey, maybe you should
pick Dragon World like me.

101
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,133
‐I can be the same as you?
‐Hee!

102
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:46,012
Even though I want to be
like Gao, I won't improve

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,683
just copying him all the time.

104
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,143
Okay, I think I'll
go with Danger World.

105
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,979
All right, then, why
don't we get started?

106
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,689
‐What?
‐Hee.

107
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,317
I'm gonna give Gao
a piece of my mind!

108
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,027
(stomach growls)

109
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,487
Right after I eat.

110
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,616
Whoa something smells good.

111
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,328
Instead of me explaining
the rules to you,

112
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,874
I think you'll learn way faster
by playing the game yourself.

113
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,292
Your chariot awaits.

114
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,502
Let's go, ha!

115
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,129
I'll go get everything ready.

You know how lucky we are to be
using the castle fighting stage?

119
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,932
I can guess.

120
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,601
‐Huh?
‐Epic, right?

121

I'll be here if you need help.

123
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,023

00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,826
Super Demon Helmet.

127
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,203
That outfit is sweet!

Ha‐ha.

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
Are you ready, Kiri?

130
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,585
To start the proceedings we'll
each have 10 life points, okay?

131
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,421
And the first one to drop
all 10 loses the fight.

132
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,175
Okay, so if I inflict 10
damage points against you first,

133
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,260
‐then I win?
‐You got it, little dude.

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,888
Okay, now let's
luminize our decks.

135
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,931
Uh?

136
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,601
Trial deck luminize.

137

‐What's this?
‐An all‐purpose core gadget.

138
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,774
By putting your deck on top
of it, you can luminize it

139
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,485
even though you don't
have a core deck case.

140
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,153
Luminize!

141
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,404
‐Ah!
‐Ha!

142
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,616
Okay, so next you need to charge
two cards in the gauge zone,

143
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,909
all right?

144
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,869
The core gadget will
automatically set them for you.

145
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,413
They're those big, glowing
cards to your left.

146
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,248
I'll tell you all
about gauge later.

147
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,793
You've got enough on
your plate right now.

148
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,171
Listen up, now when I give you
the signal, you need to call out

149
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,090
raise the flag, Danger World!

150
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,758
‐You got it?
‐Um.

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,009
Ready?

152
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,636
Buddyfight!

Danger World.

156
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,353
Since this is just
a practice game,

157
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,939
we won't be using
a Buddy monster.

158
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,316
In order to explain
everything to you properly,

159
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,776
I'll need to see your cards.

160
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,152
Why don't you go first?

161
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,863
Call a monster, any one you
want, just be sure to call it

162
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
to the center.

163
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,951
I call this one to the center.

164
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,247
Ogre!

165
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,498
‐Ah!
‐Good call.

166
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,125
He looks pretty strong.

167
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,794
Buddyfight is one
ultra fast game, dude.

168
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,839
Remember, the guy who goes
first could attack only once.

169
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,800
Now it's time to give that
mighty monster of yours

170
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,968
a command!

171
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,972
Armorknight Ogre, go
and attack the manager!

172
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,807
Ogre!

173
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,017
Come on, bring it!

174
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,978
Ogre!

175
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,604
O‐burn!

176
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,985
End of move.

177
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,194
‐Yes!
‐Ah?

178
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,822
You see, Ogre's critical
is two, leaving the manager

179
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,032
with eight points.

180
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,409
Wow, Buddyfighting is super fun.

181
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,663
Get your dumplings,
red hot dumplings here.

182
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,665
You must be from Dragon World.

183
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,376
Do you have any Earth
money, by chance?

184
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,839
Is your buddy nearby?

185
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,592
I don't really have
a buddy right now.

186
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,512
I used to but we're
kind of on the outs.

187
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,723
Here, eat this.

188
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,932
Are you sure?

189
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,809
It's my treat.

190
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,771
Hmm, they're delicious!

191
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,105
Glad you like them.

192
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,525
My family's recipe has been
handed down for generations.

193
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,403
Maybe I can give you some
friendly advice about the whole

194
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,906
situation with you
and your buddy.

195
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,534
Try looking him in the eye and
listening to what he has to say.

196
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,453
Take it from me,
these disagreements

197
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,206
tend to resolve themselves.

198
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,417
Have these, you can share
them with your buddy, 'kay?

199
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,002
Wow, thanks.

200
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,215
Yeah!

201
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,009
‐Yeah!
‐Woo, cool!

202
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,350
The player who starts the
game can only attack once.

203
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,269
The one going second draws
a card and begins the game

204
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,188
with a hand of seven cards.

205
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,608
So who has the advantage, the
fighter going first or second?

206
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,361
You'd think going first
would be best, huh, dude?

207
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,072
But according to the stats,
the winning percentages

208
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,990
are just about even.

209
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,868
Get ready, 'cause I'm
gonna call my monster.

210
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,163
I call Bronze Shield
Dragon to the center.

211
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,501
Argh!

212
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,797
And I also call Extreme Sword
Dragon to the left position.

213
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,258
♪

214
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,426
Yah!

215
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,678
Two of them?

216
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,097
All the monsters come
in different sizes.

217
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,266
Whatever you call can't
add up to more than three,

218
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,686
like three size one monsters
or one size three monster.

219
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,937
Exactly.

220
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,065
Now I'm gonna attack you
with my two monsters, 'kay?

221
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,444
But oh, no, I can't 'cause
you got Ogre at your center!

222
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,988
Ogre!

223
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,115
As long as a player has
a monster at the center,

224
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,908
they can't be directly attacked.

225
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,369
So it's, like, protecting me!

226
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,787
I have no choice.

227
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,373
Extreme Sword Dragon,
attack Ogre!

228
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,003
In a fight between
monsters like this,

229
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,380
their power and
defense become key.

230
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,840
‐Uh?
‐Take a look.

231
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,302
Extreme Sword Dragon's power
is 5,000 and Ogre's defense

232
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,639
is just 3,000, so when power
is greater than defense...

233
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,976
♪

234
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,269
Ogre!

235
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,480
And just like that your
center monster is toast.

236
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,484
Bronze Shield Dragon,
attack Kiri!

237
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,403
‐Uh!
‐Ah!

238
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,821
End of move.

239
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,531
Now over to you, Kiri.

240
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,908
Your move.

241
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,868
Draw a card.

242
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,495
Just touch the core gadget
and it'll draw for you.

243
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,832
Huh?

244
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,543
Each time you draw a card,
they're automatically shuffled

245
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,754
so your opponent isn't able
to see what you're up to.

246
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,005
Wow.

247
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,299
You remember charging those
two cards in the gauge zone

248
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,176
at the beginning, right?

249
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,510
Yes.

250
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,429
Well, you're allowed to put
one card from your hand

251
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,265
onto the gauge
and draw another card.

252
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,350
Hang on a sec.

253
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,018
If I charge one
card from my hand,

254
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,062
am I allowed to
draw another card?

255
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,814
Uh‐huh, but only
once during each turn.

256
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,526
We call this charge and draw.

257
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,196
So can you tell me now
what the gauge is for?

258
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,406
When you play stronger
cards, you pay a cost.

259
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,743
The gauge is what you use to
make these so‐called payments.

260
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,079
Then it's like depositing
the cards in a bank?

261
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,247
You're catching on.

262
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,707
Try and add to your
gauge every turn.

263
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,709
What's this?

264
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,878
Boulder piercing spear?

265
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,339
You got the boulder
piercing spear?

266
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,549
That there is
called an item card.

267
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,760
You equip yourself with that
and then you can take part

268
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,970
in the battle.

269
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,429
Go on, equip yourself.

270
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,599
'Kay, equip boulder
piercing spear.

271
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,646
‐Cool!
‐You're frying my brain.

272
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,398
With that card, you've
just gained the ability

273
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,443
to attack with 2 critical
points and 3,000 power.

274
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,071
But remember, you can't use it
as long as there's a monster

275
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,907
in your center because
then you'd end up attacking

276
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,575
your own guy in the back.

277
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,245
Okay, I guess I'll
call Armorknight Ogre

278
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,414
to the right!

279
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,374
And I'll call Armorknight
Minotaur to the left!

280
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,587
The triple offensive maneuver,

281
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,133
oh, man, that's
my favorite formation.

282
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,594
Gee, thanks, Gao, your
support means a lot.

283
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,931
Sorry to dampen your excitement,
guys, but at my center I have

284
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,768
Bronze Shield Dragon
with 6,000 defense.

285
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,438
My boulder piercing spear
has only 3,000 power

286
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,025
and Ogre and Minotaur
have just 5,000 power each.

287
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,401
It won't be enough.

288
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,569
‐Kiri?
‐Huh?

289
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,862
You should use a link attack.

290
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,155
Link attack, what's that?

291
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,906
By attacking with
the two things at once,

292
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,117
your power becomes
the total of the two.

293
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,120
So if I combine Ogre's
power with mine...

294
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,789
That'll be a total
of 8,000, not good!

295
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,126
Ogre, let's attack Bronze
Shield Dragon together!

00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,495
Systemic Dagger Dragon
has 3,000 defense.

325
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,372
What happens when
they're the same?

326
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,541
Attacking side wins.

327
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,918
This is for Ogre!

328
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,086
Rarh!

329
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,213
Elyrseagard, attack the manager!

330
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,798
‐Cast!
‐What's that?

331
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:28,052
I'll pay one gauge
for dragon breath.

332
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,720
Ah!

333
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,764
Minotaur, attack the manager!

334
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,560
Cast the Green Dragon Shield.

335
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,186
(roar)

336
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,355
End of move.

337
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,690
Your move.

338
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,608
The Green Dragon Shield
guarded against the attack

339
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,236
and I get a life point back.

340
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,905
Draw, charge and draw.

341
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:52,160
I call Thousand Rapier
Dragon to the center

342
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,121
and also cast dragonic destroy!

343
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,541
I'm gonna pay two gauge
to eliminate one monster!

344
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,589
Thousand Rapier and
Extreme Sword, attack Kiri!

345
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,675
Yah!

346
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,843
End of move.

347
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,263
Uh, sorry, sometimes I
get a little carried away.

348
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,556
Your move.

349
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,434
Mm, and draw.

350
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,560
Oh, no!

351
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,437
Come on, you still
have a chance.

352
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,231
Charge and draw.

353
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,774
‐Yes!
‐What?

354
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,819
Did you just draw the most
powerful monster in the deck??

355
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,655
Go, Kiri, give him
everything you got!

356
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,032
Okay.

357
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,577
I'll pay three gauge and
call Armorknight Black Drake

358
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,995
to the left.

359
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,957
♪

360
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,210
(roar)

361
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,129
But I have Thousand Rapier
Dragon at my center.

362
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,798
You'll have to remove him with
your boulder piercing spear

363
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,051
and what'll you do after that?

364
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,345
Your monster only
has four critical.

365
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,431
With my six life points,
it's not gonna be enough.

366
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,475
‐What if I use this?
‐What?

367
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,393
I thought you hadn't
even noticed that card.

368
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,603
This is bad.

369
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,482
I cast crimson slash!

370
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,566
Ah!

371
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,069
Huh, Black Drake,
attack the manager!

372
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,659
Rah, have some of this!

373
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,702
Oh!

374
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,915
And a bit of this!

375
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,208
Keep going, Kiri!

376
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,168
Ha, yah!

377
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,545
Ah!

378
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,589
Uh, you got me.

379
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,509
Game over, winner, Kiri Hyoryu.

380
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,760
Whoo!

381
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,014
(applause)

382
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,183
Wow, Buddyfight is amazing!

383
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,518
You know it!

384
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,436
All the huge monsters
and powerful magic,

385
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,273
I can't believe
I never tried it before.

386
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,358
This is the greatest
feeling ever!

387
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,529
But you're still missing
one thing... a buddy.

388
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,198
Having a great buddy
like Drum makes the game

389
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,200
even more exciting.

390
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,288
Wait a sec, did he
say "great buddy"?

391
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,792
Buddyfighting as a team is epic
no matter if you win or lose.

392
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,337
‐Yeah?
‐Nope, only if you win.

393
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,714
So you're a beginner.

394
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,300
Well, the Danger World
is an excellent choice.

395
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,135
Excellent choice.

396
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,095
Yeah, I thought so, too.

397
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,513
‐Hey, kid?
‐Yes?

398
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,223
Now that you've
picked the Danger World,

399
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,101
you'd better be prepared
to show some determination.

400
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,728
Determination?

401
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,772
No matter who you fight,
do what you must to win.

402
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,109
That's what'll make you
stronger, trust me.

403
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,322
Uh, you mean if I try hard,
even I can get good?

404
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,573
Of course.

405
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:39,619
Just remember this, the only
thing of any value in this world

406
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,662
‐is winning.
‐Gotta win it.

407
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,248
‐I don't think so.
‐Huh?

408
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,000
Sure, winning's
pretty important.

409
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,753
I mean, you won't hear
me arguing about that,

410
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,380
but I don't think
it's the only thing.

411
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,007
Who are you?

412
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,427
My name's Gao, Gao
Mikado, to be exact.

413
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm kind of new to Buddyfighting
but I know that doing your best,

414
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,392
win or lose, is what any game
is all about, am I right?

415
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,228
Trust me, in the world of
Buddyfighting sometimes doing

416
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,855
your best isn't enough.

417
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,483
Wait till you have a few losses.

418
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,734
Later, kids.

419
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,985
Later, kids.

420
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,614
Hey, it's those
two from the alley.

421
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,074
Huh?

422
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,451
I'm gonna pay you back
for the other day,

423
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,911
you whatchamacallit fighter.

424
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,329
What are you doing here?

425
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,747
Hey, it's not me.

426
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,624
This'll be fun.

427
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,042
Really?

428
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,044
You're banned from the store
'cause you threatened kids

429
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,005
and tried stealing their cards.

430
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,592
Yeah, right, why don't you
fight us for the cards then?

431
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,221
It's okay, I can take
these guys on my own.

432
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,473
But, Gao, your buddy's
not even here, dude!

433
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,266
Huh?

434
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,603
Forever alone, ha ha ha!

435
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,480
‐Hey!
‐Huh?

436
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,441
You're not bothering
my buddy here, are ya?

437
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,777
Hey, heya, pal!

438
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,612
You think we're gonna
run away just 'cause

439
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,863
your buddy showed up?

440
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,240
I don't think so.

441
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,283

Dragon World.

443
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,037
Prepare to lose, punks.

444
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,622
Danger World!

445
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,209

Ah!

448
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,178
Game over, winner, Gao Mikado.

449
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,181
Yeah, now that's how it's done.

450
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,559
I'll get you for this.

451
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,353
That was amazing.

452
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,941
Hey, uh, well, I'm really
sorry about what happened.

453
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,822
What do you mean?

454
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:44,034
Gah, so you're not going to
make this easy for me, huh?

455
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,870
Even though I didn't
know it was yours,

456
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,082
it was still my fault for
eating your pudding, sorry.

457
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
Here, you want some?

458
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,628
Uh, maybe... what is it?

459
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,797
They're probably
cold by now, though.

460
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,009
I love octopus dumplings
even when they're cold.

461
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,385
Huh?

462
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,096
Hey, there's only one
dumpling left in the box!

463
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,307
Now you know how I
felt about the pudding!

464
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,268
No way, maybe if I'd
eaten four helpings!

465
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,855
You gonna eat it, 'cause
if not, I'll have it.

466
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,776
Someday, I hope to be lucky
enough to get a buddy like Drum.

467
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,451
A mine in Mount Fuji?

468
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,620
That's where you'll
find the photon mill.

469
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,623
I'd like you to retrieve
some and bring it here.

470
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,124
Whatever the cost?

471
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,003
Do what is necessary, Aragami.

472
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,547
So is that an
official order then?

473

Always questioning my authority.

Hello there, I'm Paruko,
here to guide you through

496
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,873
the world of Buddyfight.

497
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,833
You already know that
a core deck case is given

498
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,669
to a Buddyfighter from the
Buddycard office, right?

499
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,588
Well, did you know that
even if your opponent

500
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,047
doesn't have a core deck case,

501
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,133
the deck can be
temporarily luminized

502
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,677
with the use of an
all‐purpose core gadget,

503
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,679
because when a
deck is luminized,

504
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,890
monsters and spells and
all kinds of crazy things

505
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,560
appear to make the fight all
the more super exciting, right?

506
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,228
Can you open a Buddy rare card?

507
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,646
What do you think?

508
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,783
The mysterious Buddyfighter
Wolf somehow makes the power

509
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,745
of the cards real, like
real weapons and magic.

510
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
This isn't Buddyfight!
