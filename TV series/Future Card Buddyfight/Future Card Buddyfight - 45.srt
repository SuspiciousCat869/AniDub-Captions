00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,792
End of move.

331
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,877
I'm so bored.

332
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,420
When you said you'd
be using a new deck,

333
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,380
I was expecting
great things.

334
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,799
I fought grannies
who are better than you.

335
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,885
The basic strategy
of Buddyfighting

336
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,470
is clearing a
path to the fighter.

337
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,971
Once the center
position is open,

338
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,265
you're free to
deal him damage.

339
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,850
All decks should
be built with cards

340
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,102
that can destroy an
opponent's center monster

341
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,230
and with cards that
can protect your center.

342
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,234
To win, one must be
patient and calculated.

343
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,360
That was fast!

344
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,446
Gao only has two
life points left.

345
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,657
Kabala took advantage of his
formation's lack of defense.

346
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,285
But that's the core
of his fighting style,

347
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,954
and why Explosive
Dragon Fang exists.

348
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,997
Yeah, I know.

349
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
The deck isn't about
off setting weaknesses.

350
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,626
It's about boosting
the strengths.

351
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,296
It's a deck I built so that Gao
could do whatever he wants.

352
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,759
Explosive Dragon Fang is for
soaring to the highest point.

353
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,304
Now, things are
gonna get serious.

354
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,472

355
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,516

357
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,144
Charge and draw!

358
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,315
I call Boomerang Dragon
to the center position!

359
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
Let me at 'em,
let me at 'em.

360
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,777
That's it!

361
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,279
The card that can turn
things around for us!

362
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,574
What's a Size Zero monster
from Dragon World going to do?

363
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,992
I'm not done yet!

364
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,454
I equip my Dragon
Blade Drum's sword.

365
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,289
Cornered like a scared rat.

366
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,042
Why else would he give up on
his Gao Formation technique

367
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,877
and shift to
protecting his center?

368
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,630
The kid definitely has
a gift for improvising!

369
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,925
Thousand, attack
Tsukikage in the center!

370
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,385
‐Yes, sir!
‐No, not him!

371
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,428
Impero Veritas!

372
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,055
Body Replacement!

373
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,473
♪

374
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,724
Drum, attack him again!

375
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,892
It's useless.

376
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,561
I'll just continue
discarding non‐monster cards

377
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,728
and he'll keep coming back.

378
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,815
Nanomachine
Body Replacement.

379
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,068
Yeah, but now you've used up
all the cards in your hand.

380
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,528
Say it's not so.

381
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,655
Then I guess poor Tsukikage
will be destroyed

382
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,948
in your next attack.

383
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,659
No matter, it's the last
one you'll be able to make.

384
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,870
When you equipped that
big sword back there,

385
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,913
you sacrificed
valuable life points,

386
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,207
and failed to clear
the monster from my center,

387
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,418
which means, you
can't attack me.

388
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,587
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

389
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,381
Get a load of the
evolved Gao Formation!

390
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,591
Let's go!

391
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,634
Let fly, Boomerang Dragon!

392
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,470
I'm going off like
a frog in a sock!

393
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,724
(grunting)

394
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,933
Oh, no!

395
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,895
You wouldn't want to
meet me in the Outback.

396
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,938
See what I did there, mate?

397
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,150
Watch out,
I'm coming back at ya!

398
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,694
It's returning to
the cards in his hand?

399
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,322
As we know, after the card
goes back to the hand,

400
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,741
it's possible to
attack using an item.

401
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,576
It'll be a quadruple attack.

402
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,077
And don't forget, you guys,

403
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,038
when a monster returns
to the hand or deck,

404
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,957
the Drum sword gains
one extra critical point.

405
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,001
‐Oh, yeah!
‐Check this out.

406
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,837
The next generation
Gao Formation!

407
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,131
(grunts, screams)

408
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,302
(Kabala laughing)

409
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,553
Love it!

410
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,680
What a wonderful
display, Mikado!

411
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,141
Say, would you consider
joining our team?

412
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,267
In your dreams.

413
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,644
I can't be friends
with people

414
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,105
who think it's okay to use
machines to control buddies.

415
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,482
Don't be naive.

416
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,817
What's the harm in
removing unpredictability?

417
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,070
All we seek is to
create a simple world

418
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,406
where everything is
completely under control.

419
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,868
If you ask me, mathematically,
it's beautiful!

420
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,828
How do you figure?

421
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,164
Mathematics is
precise and exact.

422
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,042
An aesthetic pursuit
that delivers beauty.

423
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
When searching
for a solution,

424
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,837
you follow the
simplest path possible,

425
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,048
and you're always left
with the most elegant way

426
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,174
to solve the problem.

427
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,801
I guess I kind of
see what you mean.

428
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,635
You do?

429
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,178
And anything
aside from logic,

430
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,390
for example, the bond between
a fighter and his buddy,

431
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,309
all that should be erased
according to you, huh?

432
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,144
Yes, when rounding off
to the nearest decimal,

433
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,272
some things just
don't make the cut.

434
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,856
Then you're saying
that you would get rid

435
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,026
of a monster's free will and
spirit just so he'd obey you?

436
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,529
I like kids who are
quick to understand.

437
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,781
Tell me, Zanya,
would you be interested

438
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,658
in joining our
little team?

439
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,534
Huh!

440
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,952
Let me ask you
something.

441
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,539
Do you know why Tsukikage
chooses to be silent?

442
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,498
Do tell.

443
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,874
It's not that
he can't talk.

444
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,419
He's just made a conscious
decision not to speak.

445
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,837
By committing to
a vow of silence,

446
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,214
he strengthens his will
and his inner spirit.

447
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,549
That's why he was
the only buddy

448
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,009
who couldn't be
fully controlled.

449
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,053
I can't believe that sneaky
ninja's been holding out on us!

450
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,390
Even now as he stands there
his training continues.

451
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,685
Which would mean that Tsukikage
hasn't lost his spirit at all,

452
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,645
wouldn't you agree?

453
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,023
Is there a point
in there somewhere?

454
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,899
Oh, there's
a point alright.

455
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,778
Your device didn't remove his
will, it just suppressed it.

456
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,822
And just barely by
the looks of it.

its own free will,

and you have to use whatever
means are necessary.

You've clearly become
a great deck builder,

Even cards that usually

The enemy cannot benefit from
their unique fighting style,

First, there's
Shadow Dive.

513
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,668
An ability that
allows a monster

to bypass the opponent's
center monster

damage to the fighter.

Next is Spectral Strike.

517

After destroying a monster,

518
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,887
it also applies
damage to the fighter,

519
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,555

it can be used

So then you can totally call
him to the center, repeat...

And the center
monster will disappear,

again using your equipped item.
