1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,713
Get ready for a
cool new card game

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,007
that connects to
a parallel universe.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,302
Special cards act as portals,
bringing monsters to Earth

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,346
to become buddies with humans,

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,764
and through
friendship and courage,

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,891
help them take on
fight challenges.

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,727
It's called Buddyfight!

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,731
It's impossible!

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,941
It's so impossible!

10
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,693
The possibility of
it's not possible!

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,819
Relax.

12
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,821
Yes, it's true
that a sixth grader

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,324
is the winner of
this year's ABC Cup.

14
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,034
Gao's not going anywhere.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,661
You'd do best to accept it.

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,870
How could this happen?

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,873
As student council president,
I'm accountable to a point,

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,583
but none of the
middle school teams

19
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,543
could defeat him either.

20
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,878
Take away the luck,
and he's nothing more

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,130
than an unranked
junior fighter.

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,967
My worst nightmare
has come true!

23
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:50,842
It's their fault.

24
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,387
They call themselves
formidable dragons.

25
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,765
Ha, we'll see just
how tough they are.

26
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,850

27
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,852

28

Huh, ouch, cut it out, Sophia!

29
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,024
Using disaster force
is prohibited!

30
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,359
Ah!

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,029
A fighter and buddy are
one in body and soul.

32
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,489
Where are you going?

33
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,702
Master has sent my orders for
the next phase of our plan.

34
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,414
Effective immediately,
I'll be leaving Aibo Academy.

35
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,707
Huh, and me?

36
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,251
You are to remain here
and continue your cover

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,629
as the clumsy, ineffective
student council president.

38
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,047
How did Master put it?

39
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:33,051
A role you were
clearly born to play.

40
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,720
Wait a minute, come back!

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,013
Ah!

42
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,224
(whimpering)

43
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,436
What hurts the most is if I
actually had my real Buddy,

44
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,230
none of this would
have ever happened!

Thanks for coming, everyone.

51
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,017
I'll start with Magic World.

52
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,228
This world's good for
changing up your game.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,980
The spell cards
are the coolest.

54
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,690
You can use them to
increase your gauge

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,692
or even add more
cards to your hand.

56
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,361
The monsters have low power,
but their abilities can

57
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,029
definitely make up
for it in battle.

58
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,407
Take the combo cards Knights
of Light and Darkness,

59
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,533
Licht and Dunkelheit.

60
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,702
If called together,
their power and defense

61
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,912
can increase by 3,000.

62
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,999
Lady Suzuha's Buddy,
Center of the World, Mary Sue,

63
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,250
has an uncanny ability.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,085
She can select one
spell card from the deck

65
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,754
and add it to my
beautiful lady's hand.

66
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,216
With my center of the world,
everything revolves around me.

67
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,427
Oh, and don't forget
about her Great Spell,

68
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,095
My Grandfather Clock.

69
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,556
It allows the fighters
to enjoy another turn.

70
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,391
It also lets cards
in the drop zone

71
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,726
be returned the deck.

72
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,019
This helps one end the match

73
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,730
with a universally
striking finish, my lady.

74
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,900
My Angel Queen Serenade deck's
full of little miracles.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,860
A lady can never
be too prepared,

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,738
which is why I also brought
my own tea from home.

77
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,032
The Magic World isn't
just spells though.

78
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,742
It has some
heavy‐duty demons.

79
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,536
The toughest are the
Solomon 72 Pillars.

80
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,914
If you're lucky enough to
have these on your side,

81
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,334
you'll be pulling a win
out of the hat in no time.

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,755
Let's feast on some
Katana slime for lunch.

83
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,175
With not one soul,
but two, plus a Soulguard,

84
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,761
Great Duke Astaroth's
one fly card,

85
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,888
and my buddy A‐Dawg's
the hoppinest,

86
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,264
most legit guy around.

87
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,351
Just check out his
dangerous backdrop, yo.

88
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,519
Yeah.

89
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,604
You're pretty
bananas yourself,

90
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
am I right, people?

91
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,107
(laughing)

92
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,027
That was very thorough and
well‐explained, little one.

93
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,738
Sadako, Mitsuko,
see to our host.

94
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,740
Uh, thank you.

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,742
It sounds like you
weren't just monitoring

96
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,619
Team Balle du Soleil,
but keeping record

97
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,663
of the entire tournament.

98
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,081
I'm not a great player yet,

99
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,916
but from watching
you guys so closely,

100
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,126
I like to think I'm a bit
of a Buddy scientist.

101
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,336
I know the feeling.

102
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,462
You don't have
to be in the game

103
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,588
to be really into the game,

104
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,714
you know what
I'm talking about?

105
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,924
How 'bout you?

106
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:41,925
All right.

107
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,135
Which world's up next, bro?

108
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,806
Actually, the next one on
my list is the Katana World.

109
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,057
Oh.

110
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,975
Oh, wicked!

111
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,603
That's, like,
my favorite world!

113
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,649
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

114
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,775
Thanks a lot, Mom.

115
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,111
Sorry, but everybody just
keeps wanting to drop by.

116
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,947
It's all right,
food'll be right up.

117
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,824
Go ahead, play
with your friends.

119

Chop‐chop, kid.

We're starving out there.

121
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,538
Yeah, yeah.

That's it, done.

If there's nothing else,
I'm out of here.

That was fast, it seems like

Special detectives.

During a recent

it's been revealed that

00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,758
Thanks to his buddy
monster, Tsukikage,

166
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,344
he can use the Nanomachine
Body Replacement ability

167
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,179
to dodge attacks.

168
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,430
Nin!

169
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,100
But Tsukikage isn't the only
monster your brother can call.

170
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,434
The Katana World has tons

171
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,354
of impressive units
to choose from

172
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,022
like Electron Ninja, Shiden.

173
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,358
This guy lets you draw
two new cards to your hand.

174
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,984
I pay one gauge and discard

175
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,112
one Ninja Arts
card from my hand,

176
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,571
and I draw two cards.

177
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,700
And Phantom Ninja, Kashinkoji
has the amazing ability

178
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,910
of being able to look at
the opposing player's cards.

179
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,912
Clairvoyance!

180
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,539
(laughing)

181
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,915
But compared to
the Ninja Arts,

182
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,458
you're just a bottom feeder.

183
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,794
Extermination Ninja,
Slashing Asura!

184
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,755
This guy's ability can destroy
an opponent's monster when‐‐

185
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,550
well, Zanya's
demonstration says it all.

186
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,802
I activate Ninja Art,
Asura Bakugan

187
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,972
by sacrificing one life
point and my entire hand!

188
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,432
Ah!

189
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,351
Aha!

190
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,521
My stunt double's
almost as smart as me.

191
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,189
(laughing)

192
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,442
Skull Warriors are
menacing monsters

193
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,485
that have been destroyed
but then get resurrected.

194
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,321
They're crazy strong,
but most of them disappear

195
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,656
once the turn is over.

196
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,908
This is why I don't
watch scary movies.

197
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,328
Somebody tell me
when they're gone.

198
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,997
‐To darkness.
‐My buddy,

199
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,665
Evil in Heart, Yamigitsune,

200
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,501
lets me draw a card when
I send any Skull Warrior

201
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,588
that's caused damage to my
opponent to the drop zone.

202
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,757
And most of you will
remember the spell

203
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,425
that lets me keep
bringing back a monster

204
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,635
from the drop zone
to haunt the fight.

205
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,345
Do you fear the undead?

206
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,556
I always say they aren't
destroyed for nothing.

207
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,476
They can always be revived.

208
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,352
Sounds like you
need reviving.

209
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,937
You forgot your best card.

210
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,565
Karakurenai is a
special impact card

211
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,900
that deals four damage

212
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,069
and can only be cast
when your opponent has

213
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,528
four or less life points

214
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,989
and two or fewer
cards in their hand.

215
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,076
Demon Way, Karakurenai!

216
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,245
(whooshing)

217
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,416
Huh?

218
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,211
‐A ghost!
‐Ah!

219
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,923
(shouting)

220
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,719
He a friend of yours, A‐Dawg?

221
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,638
Yeah, we hang out sometimes.

222
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,722
Hmm?

223
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,099
(laughing)

224
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,185
It's not funny to scare
people, Yamigitsune!

225
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,063
Well, it's funny to me.

226
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,856
Probably Jin's big idea.

227
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,274
I actually thought
you'd all be

228
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,610
a little more
scared than that.

229
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,988
Uh, okay, I guess that's it
for Katana World, you guys.

230
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,448
It's great for
surprise moves,

231
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,117
but if you don't plan
far enough ahead,

232
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,702
it's harder to find a way
to finish off your opponent.

233
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,079
Oh, really?

234
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,288
You better watch what you say

235
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,501
when you talk about
Katana World!

236
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,169
Huh‐‐hey, big Z.

237
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,255
Why didn't you
tell me you were here?

238
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,756
I was just passing by.

239
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,259
S'up, Zanya, haven't seen
you since the big fight.

240
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,636
There will payback, just wait.

241
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,721
I see there are girls here.

242
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,183
Just, uh, don't diss
Kanit World‐‐Katana!

243
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,062
I gotta be somewhere.

244
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,565
I really don't
get him sometimes.

245
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,024
Nobody does.

246
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
Next up is the Danger World.

247
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,903
Uh‐‐uh, huh?

248
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:58,283
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

249
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,450
♪ Oh ♪

250
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,661
Not now!

251
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,454
Huh?

252
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,414
Habit.

253
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,250
The Danger World, well,
it's got Armorknights

254
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,627
and sweet Duel Dragons.

255
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,546
That's the world
President Shido

256
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,881
used in his first match.

257
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,965
Now, attack!

258
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,925
It has lots of
high‐powered monsters

259
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,845
who are awesome with
face‐to‐face attacks.

260
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,181
(shouting)

261

(slamming)

262
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,813
My Duel Dragons
never back down.

263
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,609
Like me, full of honor,
they never have any regrets.

264
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,154
President Shido's Emperor
Dragon, Gael Khan is amazing!

265
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,865
Just by calling it, all
opponent monsters in the field

266
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,202
are immediately destroyed.

267
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,329
Stick to your
plan for victory!

268
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,497
Strength is so 20th century.

269
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,458
Now, it's all
about flexibility.

270
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,168
Yeah, anyway,

271
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,503
one of the things I like
most about Buddyfighting

272
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,172
is battling
alongside the monsters,

273
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,132
and the fact that all
of them are so different

274
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,217
just like my friends.

275
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
Kiri, come on, you're
getting a little off topic.

276
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,262
Tell us more
about Danger World.

277
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,182
Mm, but while I'm on the
subject of strong monsters,

278
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,309
I just gotta bring up
the Ancient World.

279
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,228
Hey, that's the world
President Shido

280
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,938
and Genma fought for
in their battle.

281
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,523
Before that, I had no
idea it even existed.

282
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,692
That's 'cause you're a
Buddyfight newbie, bro.

283
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,860
Only the choicest fighters

284
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
can deal with
Ancient World powers,

285
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,198
so there aren't really
many dudes who use it.

286
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,741
You did not just do that!

287
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,702
Ancient World is known to have
the most powerful dragons,

288
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,871
including primordial dragons,

289
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,082
Wild Dragons,
and Dragon Lords!

290
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,625
Lots of these guys
are size three,

291
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,587
and sometimes all you really
need to win is one of them.

292
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,299
One dragon, Dimensional Demonic
Dragon, Ladis the Tyrant,

293
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,009
has the ability
to attack twice

Martial Arts Dragon
Emperor, Duel Sieger.

298

To become more powerful,
Genma used Lifelink

which united them as one,
so if Sieger was defeated,

300

he would have lost
five life points.

But we found out
that when defeated,

If Duel Sieger is defeated,
I can call him from the hand.

Once he appears, the
Lifelink is cancelled

But it can come back again
in its ultimate form.

Amazingly,
if Spartand's destroyed,

Sieger can return as Duel

Sunshine impact card

Everyone was so surprised

Sun Fist card.

It's unfortunate, especially

Please, what did you learn?

359

We've been observing the Boy
Wonder Cop, Tasuku Ryuenji.

360

During his battle
against Aragami,

361

he somehow acquired the ability

362

to wield the true power of
the cards in the real world.

363

from the Mighty Sun Fighter.

487
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,853
Fight alone, huh?

488
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,813
Interesting.

489
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,277
(indistinct chattering)

490
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,028
It's not a cat!

491
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,699
I told you it's a tiger!

492
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,160
Okay, that's all
of them, guys.

493
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,870
Thanks a lot for
listening to me.

494
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,664
All right, let's show 'em
our Aibo appreciation.

495
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,040
Say it with me now!

496
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,959
Buddy...

497
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,960
...fight!

498
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,254
(laughing)

499
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,972
Well, that's about it, Yota.

500
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,308
Oh, and I was able
to win the ABC Cup

501
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,935
thanks to you and your card.

502
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,813
I hope you were watching.

503
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,525
Yota, ever since we lost you,

504
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,403
I've been so focused on
protecting Gao and Hana

505
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,905
that nothing else mattered.

506
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,449
But, you know, they're okay.

507
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,701
And starting today,

508
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,829
things will be a lot
different around here.

509
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,081
What do you mean?

510
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,125
Well, I've been waiting
for the right time,

511
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,293
but now's as good as any.

512
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,670
I've been asked to go
teach in North America.

513
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,214
You're kidding me, right?

514
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,340
You're leaving for real?

515
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,133
Dad, come on, say something!

516
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,384
I think she should go.

517
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,469
She'd already be over there

518
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,638
if she wasn't so
worried about you guys.

519
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,600
I was hoping you'd
be happy for me.

520
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,393
There's no way we're
gonna be all right.

521
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,146
Without you around, Gao won't
get out of bed in the morning.

522
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,440
Besides, who's gonna
make my favorite snacks

523
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,901
and remind me to clean
behind my wings and stuff?

524
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,237
(clearing throat)

525
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,863
Please, Gao, help me out here.

526
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,406
I'm begging you,
don't let her go!

527
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,575
You know, I've
changed my mind.

528
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,119
On second thought, I really
think you should go.

529
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,621
You don't have to
worry about us.

530
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,331
Besides, I'm sure those
kids will teach you

531
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,751
how to be an even cooler mom.

532
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,837
I'm glad you understand.

533
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,923
Gao, if she goes, does
that mean no more pudding?

534
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,299
We'll be okay, Drum.

535
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,677
My mom deserves to be
happy too, you know?

536
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,803
That rocks!

537
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,973
My mom is gonna work
in another country.

538
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,475
Well, I guess people are
gonna say that this family

539
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,103
is pretty unconventional,
that's for sure.

540
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,771
Unconventional?

541
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,772
That's it.

542
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,483
Like Father said, it's
why I became buddies

543
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,193
with this kid in
the first place.

544
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,696
But that still
doesn't help me know

545
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,657
what I'm supposed to do.

546
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,329
Hello there, I'm Paruko,
here to guide you

547
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,039
through the world of Buddyfight.

548
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,292
So how'd you like
the ABC Cup?

549
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,334
I thought it was great,

550
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,128
especially once
Genma returned.

551
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,212
I got to hand it to Gao.

552
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,590
He surprised us all with
that super‐rare Sun Fist

553
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,258
Sunshine impact card.

554
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,676
But what about
these bad guys?

555
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,679
They look up to no good with
their powerful Disaster Force.

556
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,056
And Drum looks
totally bummed out.

557
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,727
I sure hope him and Gao
are gonna be all right.

558
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,270
Can you open a
buddy rare card?

559
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,690
What do you think?

560
00:23:19,690 --> 00:24:46,443
♪

561
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,949
Next time, Gao and
the gang board a ship

562
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,119
to check out a Buddyfight
party hosted by Kyoya Gaen,

563
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,621
but things get fishy when
someone rocks the boat.

564
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,375
Next episode,
"Evil Power, Disaster Force!"

565
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,335
It'll be titanic.
