Well, the enhance card,
the Wydar Sarkal,

205
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,064

to a counter spell.

What's all the fuss?

210
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,155
She just used a link attack.

211
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,200
Ocker could defeat that
Venus flytrap on his own,

strategy all the way.

It's like this, bro.

215

If Kazane had only
attacked with the Ocker,

216
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,292
Kemura could have
cast the Wyder Sarkal

217

hitting her with a counter,

218
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,878
so with the link attack,

219
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,589
she protects her unit and
guarantees taking his out.

Either way, if someone does

Walk up to him and tell him how
you feel about what he did.

Maybe, but he's
the one who's wrong.

If he's your real
friend, he'll apologize

Uh, cause
there's no point?

she just played.

Yeah, he couldn't knock
her life points down to zero

even if all his
monsters joined up.

410
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,637
So, he switched his assault

00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,348
to the two units
on the sides instead.
