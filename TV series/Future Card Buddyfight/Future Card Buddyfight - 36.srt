To call him, place
him on top of Jack.

489
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,718
He has Soulguard, plus
he gains the Move ability.

490
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,637
And, if you evolve him from
Jack when he already has a soul,

491
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,723
then the Soulguard
gets an increase too.
