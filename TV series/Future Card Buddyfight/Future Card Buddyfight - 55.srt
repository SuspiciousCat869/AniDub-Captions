takes to Buddyfight?

Choose your favorite
world and use special cards

monsters into reality.

Challenge other fighters,

5

ally to fight by your side.

6

Get ready to raise the flag!

I disagree, I have
faith in Tasuku.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,110
Even if some momentary
lapse in judgment

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,821
led him to join this
Disaster or whatever,

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,491
I'm sure he'll
regain his senses soon.

I wonder if Gao Mikado
would agree with you.

Probably‐‐he's the
Mighty Sun Fighter.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,337
He's always trying to see things
from others' perspectives,

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,673
but getting caught up in
other people's business

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,301
can cause you to lose your
focus and your motivation.

18

It's the same with Zanya
with his hero joining Disaster.

It's no surprise that
he's a little bit shaken up.

He's not himself because of it.

When I agreed to this,
I didn't think things

Adding Jack to the mix is
gonna take some time, kid.

A new deck with Jack in it?

What's he talking about, bro?

55
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,160
He's gonna help
to get Tasuku back.

He's gonna fight
alongside us in the semis.

You wanna mess with the
Explosive Dragon Fang deck?

It'll totally throw
its balance way off!

481
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,429
Okay, Gallows,
attack the fighter!

482
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,557
‐I don't think so.
‐What's happening?

483
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,977
Looks like you've
fallen right into my trap.

484
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,187
That's impossible!

485
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,689
I've done everything I
possibly can to avoid it!

486
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,276
I pay three gauge and
activate Super Lethal Formation!

487
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,403
Secret Sword, Morning Star!

488
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,322
That tricky set spell.

489
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,157
It's activated when
an opponent's monster

490
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,619
with 3,000 power or
less attacks the fighter.

491
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,288
Stop transmitting this
broadcast immediately!

492
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,290
This fight is
hereby disqualified!

493
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,085
‐Daddy, save me!
‐I'm here for you, my son!

494
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,420
Aww, I almost feel compassion!

495
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh, wait, no, I don't.

496
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,135
(screaming)

497
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,849
Game over.

498
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,893
Winner: Zanya Kisaragi.

499
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,103
He did it!

500
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,355
Never doubted it for a second!

501
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,735
We're up‐‐let's keep this going.

502
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,363
Both teams are tied
with one win apiece,

503
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,865
and the fate of
advancing to the final

504
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,285
hangs on the shoulders
of each team's leader!

505
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,620
‐It's time for...
‐Tasuku and Gao's...

506
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,164
‐...card of the day!
‐... card of the day!

507
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,207
Today we're gonna talk about

508
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,835
the Great Evil Dragon,
Samael Apocalypse.

509
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,546
It has 8,000 power
and a double attack!

510
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,756
And each time it destroys
an opponent's monster,

511
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
its Spectral Strike
ability causes two damage

512
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,594
to the opposing player!

513
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,178
It takes out your
opponent's monsters

514
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,722
and life points
at the same time!

515
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,307
That's what I call
an ace in the hole

516
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,559
for Darkness Dragon World.

517
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,852
So what do you think, guys?

518
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,478
You think you can
open up one of these?

519
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,273
You'll never know until you try!

520
00:23:19,273 --> 00:24:46,360

521
