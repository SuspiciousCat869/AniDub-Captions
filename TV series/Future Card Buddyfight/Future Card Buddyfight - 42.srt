166
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,455
And if you haven't noticed,
I always work solo.

167
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,166
Come on, our friend
was attacked!

168
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,127
We want to help, too!

169
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,921
‐Ill‐mannered mongrels!
‐You'll just slow me down!

170
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,464
I know what you're afraid of.

171
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,883
Let's test out my theory, 'kay?

172
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,218
(chuckling)

173
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,970
Ahh, okay, you guys can help!

174
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,221
(glasses shattering)

175
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,100
From what he told me,
Zakoyama was attacked

176
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,476
somewhere around here.

177
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,145
I live really
close to that park.

178
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,147
A lot of people hang out
there during the day,

179
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,898
but hardly any at night.

180
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,150
And with all those bushes,

181
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,193
there are lots of places
someone could hide.

182
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,237
Well, the Reaper's
been attacking

183
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,156
multiple times at
the same location.

184
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,743
I think our best shot would be
investigating that area first.

185
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,536
It just might be
our lucky break.

186
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,746
I agree.

187
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,914
Just remember to
be careful, dudes.

188
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,207
I'd hate to see any of you

189
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,043
get your buddies
taken away from you.

190
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,086
‐Right!
‐Right!

191
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,173
So that leaves Baku and me
to take the west side.

192
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,507
Hang on, bro.

193
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,343
That would mean we're sending
the girls out there all alone.

194
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,428
That's not cool.

195
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,555
No matter what, we need
at least one Buddyfighter

196
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,016
in each group to draw
the Reaper out of hiding.

197
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,851
All right, then Drum
and I will head over

198
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,145
to check out the
west side with Kuguru.

199
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,438

Guess we're together.

00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,191
Don't worry, we'll protect you.

202
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,359
I won't permit any
shenanigans, mister.

203
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,360
Save it for Reaper.

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,030
Let's stick together
and keep our eyes open.

205
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,365
‐Nin.
‐I'll lead us out.

206
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,534
If you see someone that
might be the culprit,

207
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,952
contact the rest of us,

208
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,829

every ten minutes

209
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,789
just to be safe.

210
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,249
I agree, regular
contact is imperative.

211
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,417
Good luck, everyone.

212
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,544
Are we gonna catch
this guy or what?

‐Yeah!

criminal fighter on my own.

Hmm.
