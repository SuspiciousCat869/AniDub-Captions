165

What's taking them
so long, anyway?

166
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,957
Maybe they stopped for snacks.

167
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,835
So, should we announce the loss?

168
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,962
No need, they're already here.

169

Hey, check it.

171

Whoa, off the charts, yo.

173

Hey, did anyone order a chopper?

174

175

Oh, man!

180
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,322
I like big blimps

181

ways Lady Suzuha gets around.

According to Buddyfight rules,

215
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,462
players must shuffle
their opponent's deck

216
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,881
before beginning a match.

217

That's okay, I don't care.

Besides, you seem pretty
trustworthy, Lady Suzuha.

219
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:22,056
Trust is exactly the reason
why we should shuffle the decks.

220
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,392
Buddyfighting is a
fair and honest game.

221
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,477
Accordingly, as an
act of sportsmanship,

222
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,729
we shuffle each other's deck.

223
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,938
If we wish to compete

224
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,150
in the tournament,
we must follow protocol.

225
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,528
Now then, please place
your deck on the tablet.

226
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,156
You shuffle my deck,
and I'll shuffle yours.

227
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,659
And just remember,
there's no peeking.

Yes, well it is.

232
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,502
Buddyfighting is fun, but it's
also about respect and honor.

233
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,213
Not just towards your opponent,

234
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,631
but for yourself.

235
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,799
I guess, in a way,
buddyfighting is based

236
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,302
on the same codes
as Aiki jiu‐jitsu.

237

Hello there, I'm Paruko,

492
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,124
here to guide you through
the world of Buddyfights.

493
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,168
The shuffle is where you mix
up your cards before a fight.

494
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,004
And not just your
own deck, either.

495
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,423
Be sure to shuffle the cards
in your opponent's deck too.

496
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,342
This way, you can make sure
neither of you is cheating.

497
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,636
Just remember what
Lady Suzuha told Gao.

498
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,973
It's about respect and honor
for your opponent and the game.

499
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,728
And, just common courtesy
among Buddyfighters.

500
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,354
Can you open a Buddy rare card?

501
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,981
What do you think?

502
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,200
The second match has
Zanya Kisurahi facing off

503
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,996
against team Seifukai, but their
fighter's nowhere to be found.

504
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,420
You don't want to miss
this next buddyfight.
