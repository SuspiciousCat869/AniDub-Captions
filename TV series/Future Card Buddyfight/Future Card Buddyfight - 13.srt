00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,329
I'm Paruko,
here to guide you

496
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,456
through the world
of Buddyfight!

497
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,668
So, how about that
Tasuku Ryuuenji, eh, guys?

498
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,211
And that Jackknife Dragon!

499
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,546
They made a new impact card.

500
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,591
I guess that's how they formed
Gargantua Punisher, too.

501
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,467
Wish I had skills like that.

502
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,012
Now I totally understand
why both of them are working

503
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,847
for the Buddy Police.

504
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,682
I tell you one thing,
I wouldn't wanna be

505
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,768
a criminal fighter
facing those two.

506
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,353
Can you open a Buddy Rare Card?

507
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,563
Why do you think?

508
00:23:19,899 --> 00:24:49,780
♪

509
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,450
Don't miss it when Noboru Kodou
takes on Magoroku Shidou.

510
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,744
There was a strange connection
between these two during

511
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,413
last year's ABC Cup.

512
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,081
On the next episode, it's...

513
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,502
