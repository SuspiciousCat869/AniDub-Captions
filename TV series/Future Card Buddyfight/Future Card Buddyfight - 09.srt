It's not Halloween yet, is it?

509
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,134
It's Lady Suzuha Amanosuzu.

510

Amana‐who‐soo?

511

Wait a sec, that
name sounds familiar.

512
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,433
I'm really not surprised
you've heard of it.

513
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,268
I mean, the Amanosuzu Group

514
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,311
is one of the top ten

515

international super companies.

516
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,357
It's the largest transportation
equipment manufacturer

517
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,984
in the world.

518

Lady Suzuha

It has been my pleasure

522
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,077
to observe your card fighting
skills here this afternoon.

523
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,538
But after watching you
fumble your way along

524
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,541
I am most certain that
I can tear you to pieces

525
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
in a Buddyfight.

526

You think so, huh?

527
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,964
I must say that that
was a most elegant

528
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,424
declaration of war, Lady Suzuha.

529
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,010
You agree with me,
of course, don't you?

Student Council President.

531
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,808
Of course, my lady.

532
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,434
Forgive me for being so bold,

533
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,772
but you're looking
particularly radiant today.

Our three teams,

along with team Seifukai,

538
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,447
will be the four teams
representing the middle school

539
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,782
in the tournament.

540
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,826
Seifukai?

541
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,662
They uphold the moral
standards of the Academy.

542
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,165
The group members are mainly
from the school cheering squad.

543
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,834
They're given the
special privilege

544
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,211
of being able to
participate in the ABC Cup

545
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,172
without having to
compete in the qualifiers.

546
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,801
So what you're saying is
they're pretty powerful, huh?

547
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,344
Yes.

548
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,304
Without question.

549
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,556
(laughs)

It's gonna be an
interesting tournament.

I'd like to introduce you
to the pride of Aibo Academy,

560
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,670
our one and only world
famous fighting stage.

561
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,046
It's a massive stadium

562
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,882
that has a super cool
elevated battle ground

563

that was built exclusively
for Buddyfighting.

The upper level

for well over 1,000
cheering spectators.

I know that sounds like a lot,

you get a decent spot.

Can you open a buddy rare card?

570
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,439
What do you think?

Noboru Kodo learns the
truth about Tasuku Ryuenji.

And it'll surprise you.

575
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,917
The card of heroes.

576
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,169
It's party time, people.
