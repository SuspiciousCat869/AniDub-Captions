336
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,527
ahead of me anyways?

337
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,779
Best start focusing
on your own actions

338
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,865
instead of the
actions of others.

339
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,158
I know that.

340
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,619
I buddy call El Quixote

341
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,703
to the center.

342
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,246
No, the right.

343
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,249
You've got a Twin Dragonblades,
Dragoanthem item card

344
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,459
in your hand.

345
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,670
How in the world
can you not use it?

346
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,880
Fine then.

347
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,632
Buddy call El Quixote
to the right.

348
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,218
And equip Twin
Dragonblades Dragoanthem.

349
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,594
Hey, if you win your next fight

350
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,762
you'll go through.

351
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,971
Duh.

352
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,056
There are actually
a couple of fighters

353
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,807
who are only one win away.

354
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,809
We'll be fine.

355
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,561
He's done it!

356
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,857
Let's hear it for the third
team to qualify, Rising Tiger.

357
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,277
That's Noboru Kodo, the second
ranked fighter in his grade.

358
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,820
Nice moves back there.

359
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,197
Congrats, dude.

360
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:15,326

Awesome card fighting, man.

364
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,833
It must feel good to advance.

365

Oh, please.

366
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,296
I'm the second ranked
fighter in my whole grade.

367
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,547
It was obvious to everyone

368
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,967
that I was gonna make
it past the qualifiers.

369
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,135
On the other hand, it'd
be a major accomplishment

370
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,805
for you to advance all
the way to the ABC cup.

371
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,139
Wouldn't it, Gao?

372
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,599
It's too bad in a way,

373
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,810
because I would have
really enjoyed beating you.

374

That's awesome!

375
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,356
On my honor as the
Mighty Sun Fighter

376
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,401
I'll do what I can
to make sure I qualify.

377
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,194
So just wait for
me at the finals

378
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,198
of the ABC Cup.

379
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
Gao, we've got to hurry.

380
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,243
Right.

381
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,704
As you know, three teams
have already advanced.

382
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,373
We're now waiting to find
out who the fourth will be.

383
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,250
Here are the groups
moving forward.

384
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,418
We have Team Kisaragi

385
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,462
with top ranked
fighter Zanya Kisaragi.

386
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,715
Next is the biggest
surprise so far,

387
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,967
the rap dancing
team Tetsu and Dai

388
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,427
with Tetsuya Kurodake

389
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,721
and his amazing buddy, Asmodai.

390
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,055
Last, but certainly not least,

391
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,557
is team Rising Tiger

392
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,644
with second ranked fighter
in his grade, Noboru Kodo.

393
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,479
Now let's check out
the match that'll decide

394
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,523
which team is gonna advance.

395
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,900
Looks like we've got a
size three Armorknight Demon

396
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,360
who's got a critical of three

397
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,238
and the ability to
attack twice in one turn.

398
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,198
Already down to just six points,

399
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,700
Gao Mikado's pending defeat

400
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,244
seems more likely
than tomorrow's sunrise.

401
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,458
Gao!

402
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,753
Attack Gao again.

404
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:55,259
Blue Dragon Shield.

What, what, what?

406
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,304
An unexpected counter spell.

407
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,805
A startling upset.

408
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,184
Gao Mikado just barely
manages to survive this turn.

409
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,311
Come on, bro, you can do this.

410
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,938
But he only has
three life points left.

411
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,108
If he doesn't win
in this turn then...

412
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,735
Your move.

413

It's too bad in a way,

Now get your head out
of the clouds, kid.

Yeah, sorry.

419
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,501
But I think I just
figured out my next move.

420
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,543

2,000 is added to
Dragoknuckle's power.

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,116
Hm, an odd number.

501
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,577
I think I have an idea.

502
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,246
Hello there, I'm Paruko,

503
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,540
here to guide you through
the world of Buddyfight.

504
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,293
The Aibo Buddy Cup
has finally begun.

505
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,502
Take the A from Aibo,

506
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,336
the B from Buddy,

507
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,379
and the C from Cup

508
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,839
and you get ABC Cup.

509
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,173
Hang on a sec, folks,

510
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,092
that sounds like
we have two "cups".

511
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,177
Well, I guess we won't
worry about that now.

512
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,680
The ABC Cup is Aibo
Academy's biggest event

513
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,140
of the entire year.

514
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,683
So who do you think's gonna be

515
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,311
the big champion this year, huh?

516
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,021
Can you open a buddy rare card?

517
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,607
What do you think?

518
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,699
To help Gao overcome
his weaknesses,

519
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,576
Baku and Kuguru suggest
he try a new deck,

520
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,078
but Gao refuses.

521
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,581
And just what is this Jin
Magatsu guy up to anyway?

522
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,291
The stolen dragon deck.

523
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,544
It's gonna be a good one.
