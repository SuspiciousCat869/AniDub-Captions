491
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,557
If you mean kicking
their butts, you bet!

492
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,891
All right.

493
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,393
Charge and draw!

494
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:37,731

496
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,656
(roaring)

497
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,745

Card of the Day!

499
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,332
Today we'll introduce you

500
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,167
to the card Death
Ruler, Gallows.

501
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,920
Its attack and defense are low,
but it has a cool ability

502
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,589
that lets it bypass
the center monster

503
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,424
and attack the fighter directly!

504
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,009
It's known as Shadow Dive!

505
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,553
What's cool is it can
also regain one life point

506
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,054
whenever it inflicts damage!

507
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,181
Yeah, man, it's
definitely a card you want

508
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,726
in your Darkness
Dragon World deck!

509

So what do you think, guys?

510

Think you can open
up one of these?

511
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,647
You'll never know until you try!

512

00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,327
is a special rare

516
