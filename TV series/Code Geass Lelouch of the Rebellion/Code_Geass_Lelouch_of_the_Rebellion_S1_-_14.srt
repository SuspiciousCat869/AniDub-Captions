1
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:07,779
The actions one takes are answered
by consequences waiting at their conclusion.

2
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:09,864
There are no exceptions,

3
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:13,095
and even Lelouch's power cannot change this.

4
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:17,437
Despite his absolute ability to make anyone obey him,

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:20,111
there is no escaping the inevitable.

6
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:24,137
Lelouch has acted to avenge his mother's death,

7
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:28,712
and to create a world where his
younger sister, Nunnally, can find happiness.

8
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:33,391
Now he is confronted by the results of his acts;

9
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,418
consequences he never imagined.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,668
And there are more to come.

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,766
If these unintended consequences
help to create new worlds,

12
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,052
who will bear the blame for the sins that are committed?

13
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,311
Who will take the punishment?

14
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,531
And who will measure it out?

15
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,703
Command to 4-0-1!

16
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:29,353
Move in to contain the enemy!

17
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,555
All Knightmare units!

18
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,546
Alpha-Niner, confirm status!

19
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,840
Unit 9-0-3! Alpha-Niner, confirmed!

20
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,482
Enemy sighted, bearing 7 o'clock!

21
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,838
Intercept now!

22
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,648
Underwater red leader...

23
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:42,769
No wait!

24
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:43,971
Do not pursue!

25
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:47,011
Protecting the viceroy has top priority!

26
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,873
Zero! Come in!

27
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:49,988
Zero!

28
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:53,153
Ohgi? Is that you? It's C.C.

29
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:54,720
Yes. How's Zero doing?

30
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,607
He's okay, but he can't move now.

31
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:57,934
Order a retreat.

32
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,946
If we drag this out, we'll be slaughtered.

33
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,521
Uh, yes. I understand. Got it.

34
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,388
Hm?

35
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,644
Is that what you wanted?

36
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,323
Uh. Yes...

37
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,682
This is pathetic.

38
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:11,100
You're so shook up, you can't even issue orders.

39
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,005
And Cornelia will...

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,492
Listen to me! My handgun is missing!

41
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,061
Whoever has it now must have
taken it from me when I was unconscious.

42
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:21,465
If that's true... It means they saw your face.

43
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,328
There were at least two of them.

44
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,898
One who fired and one who got shot...

45
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:27,013
Two.

46
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:35,815
Shirley?

47
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,494
What are you doing up so early?

48
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:41,757
Is that a letter?

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,232
I-It's uh... Oh, it's nothing.

50
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,495
I bet it's a love letter, huh?

51
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,965
Something special for Lelouch?

52
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:51,169
Mm... In a way...

53
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:56,857
You want to meet Princess Euphemia?

54
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,167
To thank her!

55
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:00,007
I just wanted to thank her...

56
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:03,523
She risked her life to protect
Nina during the hotel hijacking!

57
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:06,550
She stood right up and said, "I'm Euphemia!"

58
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:08,170
...Right? ...Really?

59
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,600
I want to meet her, too!

60
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,394
Why is that?

61
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,957
She's a real princess! I could marry into royalty!

62
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:16,230
I'm sure that you will never
meet her with such impure motives.

63
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,519
Impure?

64
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,732
That's a little harsh, isn't it, Nunnally?

65
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,676
You're on my side, aren't you, Madame Pre...

66
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,490
Don't kiss up to me just
because Lelouch isn't hanging around.

67
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,621
Nunnally saw right through you and so do I.

68
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,319
Anyway, I'd like to meet
Princess Euphemia, too, if I could.

69
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,614
Huh?

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,467
Oh... What's the matter, Suzaku?

71
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:39,536
Uh, it's just she's a member of the royal family and...

72
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:44,314
Hello, Ashford Academy student council.

73
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:46,252
Huh?

74
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:48,518
Suzaku?

75
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,826
Lelouch?

76
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,881
Is there... anything unusual there?

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,137
Yeah, there is...

78
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:55,720
You're not here.

79
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:56,982
Oh, right...

80
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,346
Shirley didn't show up either, by the way.

81
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,468
You know, Lelouch, you've been cutting classes lately.

82
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,384
You need to take school more seriously!

83
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,309
Right, "Mister honor student."

84
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:09,431
Can you give Nunnally a message?

85
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:11,221
Tell her I'll be late tonight?

86
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,729
Did you say "tonight"? More like every night.

87
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:16,724
What's the point in going to
the same school if I never see you?

88
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,557
Hm? What's going on?

89
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:20,374
Uh, nothing!

90
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,509
Uh... Hey! Arthur! Ar... Ow!

91
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,938
I wonder what's going on over there? Hm.

92
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,088
So then it seems like...

93
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,530
Right. It appears he doesn't know about me.

94
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,733
That eliminates one group...

95
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,060
The military.

96
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,412
Aside from them and the Black Knights,

97
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,837
I can't think of anyone else who would have been there.

98
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,238
Someone from the Japan
Liberation Front could have survived.

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,359
And they only stole your gun?

100
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,085
I think I'll have Ohgi check out the black market then.

101
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,586
And the blood?

102
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,705
It'll take time to analyze.

103
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,697
There's something else...

104
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:53,931
I thought I saw Shirley there.

105
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,328
Oh, the girl who kissed you?

106
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,769
Give it a rest, will ya?!

107
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:01,778
Just making sure I got the right girl, lover boy.

108
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:06,345
But if she was there, then there's something
we need to know, and we better find out fast.

109
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:10,112
In this last operation and also at Narita,

110
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,804
they were specifically targeting you, Your Highness.

111
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:15,287
Eliminating the leader's a standard tactic.

112
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,997
They also eliminated Prince Clovis.

113
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:21,354
Zero is not merely fighting Britannia...

114
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,866
He has a deep hatred for the royal family,

115
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,097
and he wants blood.

116
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:25,985
Hatred?

117
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:27,286
Euphemia...

118
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:30,287
You were willing to sacrifice yourself for the commoners.

119
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,644
You haven't changed.

120
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,193
Careful, Euphy.

121
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:34,964
Huh?

122
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:37,609
I don't want another crisis like at the hotel.

123
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,936
Why not assign a knight to her?

124
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:40,747
A knight?

125
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:44,204
Yes. If we assign one knight as a permanent sentinel,

126
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:47,564
then we can build a complete royal guard unit around him.

127
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,051
As sub-viceroy,

128
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,003
Princess Euphemia has the right to a personal champion.

129
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,935
This thing about "saving people's lives,"

130
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:59,109
at first I thought he was just, y'know, sensitive,

131
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,574
but now, I mean it's more like an obsession, isn't it?

132
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:05,746
His performance data is still solid, right?

133
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:09,021
Is this a good time to put
that new thing to a test with him?

134
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,671
But we're still fine-tuning.

135
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,648
What I'm saying is, treating Suzaku like he's just another

136
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:16,092
part of the machine could have serious consequences.

137
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:18,313
We better deal with the human issue here first.

138
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:23,076
Pardon me, but really, aren't you
taking care of him in place of someone else?

139
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,604
I'm not sure about that, but...

140
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,522
Hm?

141
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,198
You're quick to catch on to something silly, aren't you?

142
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:32,137
I'm the boss so you're stuck with me!

143
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:36,001
Hey, what are you doing out here by yourself?

144
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,027
I'm waiting.

145
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,933
I need to wait till they finish disinfecting my room.

146
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,303
Why should I have to go
rifling through some girl's underwear?

147
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:45,913
This is going to cost you!

148
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:47,230
It always does.

149
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,580
Hmph! You could do this solo,

150
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,239
and she'd be thrilled to know
the man she loves went searching through...

151
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,665
That's my business.

152
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,294
Once again, making a big deal out of nothing.

153
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,754
Well, there's no sign of that gun in here.

154
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,487
And her diary only goes up to the 14th.

155
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,529
Fourteenth?

156
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:03,307
Yeah.

157
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,719
But that's the day that her father had died.

158
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,353
What?

159
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,608
They're a bunch of photos of you.

160
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,442
Of me?

161
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:15,041
How could our suspect be so sweet?

162
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,878
Ah, just can the sarcasm, would ya?

163
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,229
Narita?

164
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,986
Lulu, how could you do this?

165
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,267
Yes, how could he?

166
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:47,968
A fine very memorial.

167
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,414
Isn't that right, Miss Shirley Fenette?

168
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:51,607
Who...?

169
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:56,302
Man, it was so close! We had her right there!

170
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,500
Next time, I'll beat that white Knightmare.

171
00:08:58,527 --> 00:08:59,736
Aw, don't sweat it.

172
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,299
Yeah, Tamaki got thrashed in the first minute.

173
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,410
The JLF war ship...

174
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:07,061
Huh?

175
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:08,405
Why'd it blow up?

176
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,936
It self-destructed.

177
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,399
We did contact them and say we would help, right?

178
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,520
Yo, that's why Zero took action.

179
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,309
I know! They wanted to see his face!

180
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,383
You're not doubting Zero again, are you?

181
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:22,565
Well, it's just that...

182
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,170
Yes...

183
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,950
It's just that the timing was too convenient, right?

184
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:29,218
So what are you going to do
if you find out Zero was behind it?

185
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,858
What are you trying to say?!

186
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,121
Yeah, Diethard!

187
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,437
I heard you got wussy and ran away!

188
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:39,330
A gutless Brit's got a lot of kahunas
talking trash to his superiors like that!

189
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:42,028
I was making an assessment; that's my new job here.

190
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,491
Ohgi, you agreed to it, too, didn't you?

191
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,180
Huh?

192
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,457
Uh, that's right. And Zero did approve it.

193
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,477
So, do you love her?

194
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:54,454
This girl called "Shirley"?

195
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:55,903
Don't know.

196
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,279
Do you hate her?

197
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,026
Don't know.

198
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,093
Then why are we going to Narita?

199
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,669
You know the reason why.

200
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,713
'Cause she may have discovered who I am.

201
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,697
What if she really does know?

202
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,152
Are you going to kill her?

203
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:11,166
If you have someone you don't want to lose,

204
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,132
you should keep them at a distance.

205
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,921
So is that... from experience?

206
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,830
No. It's a way of life.

207
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,532
He's a cruel man, isn't he?

208
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:23,490
Lelouch?

209
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,413
H-How do you know about Lulu?

210
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,288
Aw, he deceived you.

211
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:28,901
Never told you he's Zero.

212
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,204
Who are you?! What do you want?!

213
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:34,220
The same mouth that ordered your father's death

214
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,953
stole a kiss from your tender lips.

215
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:39,860
He's a very bad man, and you like it!

216
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:43,047
Punishment must be measured out.

217
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:45,426
To him... and to you.

218
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:46,319
To me?

219
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,166
I know everything.

220
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,278
All that happened that night...

221
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,615
Is that Zero?!

222
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,017
Well, well, what a shocker.

223
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,305
The student is Zero himself!

224
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,365
A Britannian.

225
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,156
When I bring him to Viceroy Cornelia,

226
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,719
she'll make me a noble...

227
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,726
not just a Knight of Honor, real nobility!

228
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,890
And he's still alive, too!

229
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,785
What kind of grand execution
will they have in store for him?

230
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,030
Of course, you'll be rewarded, too.

231
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:33,684
Stupid of me! He's your boyfriend, isn't he?!

232
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:34,899
Lulu!

233
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,521
So you're a killer, too.

234
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,256
Just like Zero.

235
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,874
No! That's not true, I just...

236
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,338
And you actually used your
father's death for your own gain!

237
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:51,275
No! I just... I just...!

238
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:52,929
Cunning little woman!

239
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,168
You knew he'd feel sorry for you, didn't you?

240
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,134
So you played it for all it was worth.

241
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,409
No! You're wrong!

242
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:00,893
Did his sympathy make you all tingly?

243
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,081
Stop it!

244
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,439
Playing the tragic heroine again?

245
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,409
No! I'm not doing that!

246
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,499
A girl who kills and then goes fishing for attention?

247
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,728
Only evil witches do that.

248
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,427
I didn't... I never meant...

249
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,792
You knew there was another girl who liked Lelouch,

250
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,893
and you wanted to get him away from her.

251
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:23,163
Now you have to pay the price, Shirley.

252
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:30,265
Do you want to carry these feelings around

253
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,272
for the rest of your life? All by yourself?

254
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:36,144
Unless you atone and completely free your heart,

255
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:39,354
you and Lelouch will both be lost in your sins.

256
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:40,615
Forever.

257
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,057
I thought she'd be here.

258
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,915
We'll have to split up and look for her.

259
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,846
Do you even know what Shirley looks like?

260
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,288
What's with you now?

261
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:02,783
The chance is so slim, I doubt she's even here.

262
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:05,292
What if she really does know?

263
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,733
Are you going to kill her?

264
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,467
No, wait. There was someone else here.

265
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,601
Where'd they go?

266
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,753
And what were they doing with Shirley?

267
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:14,833
Calm down.

268
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:16,408
Work from the beginning.

269
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:20,147
It's Shirley!

270
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,233
I'm here.

271
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:22,637
Where're you calling from?

272
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,516
Where indeed?

273
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:26,765
Who are you?!

274
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:31,921
You scum!

275
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,648
What have you done with Shirley?!

276
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:36,923
Ooh, I like it! The scary face!

277
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:39,865
The face of a man whose woman was stolen away!

278
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,473
What the hell did you do with her?!

279
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:42,634
You want to know?

280
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:45,244
Then you'll have to accept my challenge.

281
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:47,238
You specialize in this.

282
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:48,349
Don't you?

283
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,591
Are you familiar with Balinese art?

284
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,984
I don't have a photo, but I can paint her in Batuan style.

285
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,779
What, I'm supposed to wait around here while you do that?

286
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,749
I don't think so.

287
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,624
Why don't you go ask the police or the soldiers?

288
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,278
I'd like to avoid that kind of dull crisis.

289
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:07,158
Then why don't you climb up on
something tall and look around?

290
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,079
Very well, nevermind.

291
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,080
Hm? What's Lelouch up to?

292
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:14,502
Huh?

293
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,541
It can't be! Mao!

294
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,725
Is he the one? Our other eye-witness?

295
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,179
I'm sure this chess game is just a ploy.

296
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:35,411
His real goal is to lure me to an isolated place.

297
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,336
You know, I've never actually
played this game before, don't you?

298
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,297
Calling on my mobile, was he just being theatrical?

299
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,862
No... He didn't know what I look like!

300
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,747
That means he didn't see me that night,

301
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,000
and he didn't have time to find a photo of me.

302
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,640
He hasn't planned this out.

303
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,582
He's wingin' it. Which means...

304
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,724
There's an opening you can use?

305
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:57,815
Shouldn't you be thinking about the game a bit more?

306
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,422
You could lose.

307
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,328
You liar, you have played this game before!

308
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,240
Lelouch, even you...

309
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:11,630
No, because it's you, you can never beat Mao!

310
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,370
Impossible.

311
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,704
He's got me trapped?!

312
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,681
So, can we just call it my game?

313
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,574
Hm?

314
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,740
How could he predict every move I made?!

315
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,038
Who is this guy?!

316
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,598
Didn't C.C. tell you about me?

317
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:35,283
Well done!

318
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,704
In one lightning moment,

319
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:39,959
you came up with 14 possible identities for me.

320
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,142
And one of them is precisely correct.

321
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,675
He has Geass, too!

322
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,132
Let's see now, for your Geass,

323
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:50,731
you have to look directly into someone's eyes.

324
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:53,590
Oh, I know all of the rules for your little gift.

325
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,002
You can read minds!

326
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,386
You could call my Geass "mind reading."

327
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,155
What the hell did you do to Shirley?!

328
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,139
Tell me! What did you do, kill her?!

329
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,495
Of course not.

330
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:05,973
It's Shirley!

331
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,789
So now then, let the vital punishment games begin.

332
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:12,489
Zero...

333
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,315
You weren't yourself yesterday.

334
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,420
Why do I have this feeling?

335
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,129
Are you all right?!

336
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,152
Talk to me!

337
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,190
Hey! C'mon!

338
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:30,368
You're alive!

339
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:34,582
So... it's you...! Zero!

340
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,681
Shirley, that gun is...

341
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:41,990
Yes. It's Zero's.

342
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:43,609
Your gun, Lulu.

343
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,187
Why don't you use your Geass?

344
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,536
I'm pretty sure you haven't used it on her, right?

345
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,801
Of course if you do, I'll just shoot you, myself.

346
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,812
Can he read any thoughts?

347
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:58,574
Or only those on the surface?

348
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,633
Are there conditions to his Geass?

349
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:02,700
A time lag? Time limit?

350
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,219
And what's he after?!

351
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,972
If he plans to kill me, then...

352
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:07,360
Keep thinking about it.

353
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,220
That's your strong-point, right?

354
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,023
Thoughts spinning round and round and round...

355
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:11,914
Shut up!

356
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:16,030
This is a fitting death,
poetic justice for a thief like you.

357
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:16,605
Huh...?

358
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,719
Lulu, die.

359
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,685
We'll atone for our sins.

360
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:24,021
We have to! I'll die with you!

361
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:24,541
What?

362
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,489
She's already killed one time.

363
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:28,642
She shot the person who saw your face.

364
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,790
All to protect your little secret.

365
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,690
Then, that blood was...

366
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,476
It's time to end this together, Lulu.

367
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:38,175
Yes, yes, sinners must be punished.

368
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,206
You put her up to all of this!

369
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:44,376
I see. He reads her mind, and then
it's easy for him to confuse and control her.

370
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,359
Yes! That's right!

371
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,893
No, don't let him trick you!

372
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:48,783
Shirley, he's just...

373
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:50,893
Come now, are you actually saying this?

374
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,636
The guy who lied to her from the start?

375
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,651
No! Stop it!

376
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:56,854
If murder's a sin, then this absolutely increases the sin!

377
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,438
Oh, I like the rhetoric! Very pithy!

378
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,511
Shirley, did you really kill somebody?!

379
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,394
And if you did kill, was he
the one who was controlling you?!

380
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,628
Shirley pulled the trigger and she knows it.

381
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:09,364
When you hide away your sins, it only get worse.

382
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,108
He's trying to confuse you, Shirley!

383
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,627
Why don't you just shut up?!

384
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,685
What are you hesitating for?

385
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:39,927
He's the one who killed your father!

386
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,626
Don't you know he's a sinner? Kill him now!

387
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:43,523
But...

388
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:45,934
Shirley!

389
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,406
I just... I don't...

390
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:50,379
What the heck's up with this girl?

391
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:52,341
Her thoughts are just a jumble now.

392
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,576
I'll just have to do it...

393
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,179
Stop it! Just stop it!

394
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,015
Fine, consider it stopped.

395
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,738
You two just do whatever it is you want.

396
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:06,626
Shirley!

397
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,960
What a pain.

398
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,104
It was so dramatic and juicy...

399
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,761
Now I'll have kill them the old boring way...

400
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:18,315
Who did that?! Why didn't I sense them there?!

401
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,168
It couldn't be...

402
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,418
C.C.!

403
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:28,008
I just knew it!

404
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,061
We finally meet again!

405
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,687
It's you! It's really you!

406
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,229
Are you awake, Mao?

407
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,530
Forgive me, Mao.

408
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:39,698
Thank the way. See, Mao? You can do it!

409
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,774
Thank you, Mao.

410
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,245
You look beautiful, C.C.! I love that new look.

411
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,097
C.C.! I'll come to see you as soon as I can!

412
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,484
I promise. I promise!

413
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:53,162
Mao...

414
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:57,334
I never thought you would come out among people.

415
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,931
It's all right now.

416
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:00,158
It's over.

417
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:03,557
Lulu, I really did kill someone.

418
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,883
That's why I...

419
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,119
It's because of me.

420
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:07,614
It's not your fault.

421
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,355
And I shot you with your gun.

422
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:11,983
I'm still alive.

423
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,999
But... I did it!

424
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:18,105
Shirley, any sin you committed is mine to bear.

425
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,794
I wanted you to be kind to me...

426
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,375
What's wrong with that?

427
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:24,620
Even though my father died...

428
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:27,891
Don't worry, it's time to forget all
the bad things that have happened to you.

429
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,036
I can't!

430
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,132
Yes, you can!

431
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,994
I'll help you forget all of this.

432
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,934
Impossible.

433
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,991
Shirley, I'm sorry about your father.

434
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:41,953
If I could be reborn into a new life... I would.

435
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,465
Lulu... No, don't!

436
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:55,297
Oh, hello.

437
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,048
Um, did you lose someone in your family, too?

438
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,303
No, not someone from my family.

439
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,454
It was a friend.

440
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:07,403
Someone, well, very... important.

441
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:09,416
I understand.

442
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,031
But I didn't know...

443
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,605
I didn't know until after I lost her.

444
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,844
Then I realized how much she meant to me.

445
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,212
How her smile saved me.

446
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:24,562
And how I'll never be able to
argue or laugh with her like that again.

447
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,404
I see. You loved her, didn't you?

448
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,414
You must feel terrible.

449
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,749
Right now, I don't know anymore.

450
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:37,465
Well, the morning always comes again.

451
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,160
What?

452
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,796
I have to say, it's funny.

453
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,804
I know that I came out here for some reason,

454
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:44,191
but I can't remember exactly what it was now.

455
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,233
Maybe it's because I already
put the whole thing behind me,

456
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:49,082
something I wanted to let go of.

457
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,973
Maybe it was something I thought I couldn't forget.

458
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:54,345
Maybe I was full of sadness.

459
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,962
But morning still comes, right?

460
00:21:57,198 --> 00:22:00,022
That's why you shouldn't try to
hold back your thoughts like that.

461
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,188
Yes, you're right.

462
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,200
I feel the same way now.

463
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,109
Thanks a lot...

464
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,645
...for everything.

465
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:08,819
Huh?

466
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:51,719
Maybe I was too soft.

467
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,617
Maybe it would have been better to just kill Shirley.

468
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:55,821
But...

469
00:23:56,008 --> 00:24:00,320
Geass, the power of the king,
will condemn you to a life of solitude.

470
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,906
So I need to harden my heart even more.

471
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,701
Then, it's me and Mao.

472
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:06,940
Payback!
