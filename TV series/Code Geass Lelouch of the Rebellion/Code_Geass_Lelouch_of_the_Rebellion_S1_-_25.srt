1
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:08,791
I see...

2
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,820
So you were Zero...

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,735
...the entire time.

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,057
Darlton was right.

5
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:20,401
He said it was someone with a grudge
against the Britannian imperial family.

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:24,116
Y-You did this... for Nunnally?

7
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:25,337
Correct.

8
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,552
I will demolish the present world,

9
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,131
then build a new and better one in its place.

10
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,508
You killed them all for the sake of that madness?!

11
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:34,712
Clovis?

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,235
Even Euphy?!

13
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,475
You're one to talk, my dear sister,

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,077
considering how you idolized
my mother, Marianne the Flash.

15
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:45,489
It would seem... that talking with you further...

16
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:48,006
...will prove to be utterly pointless.

17
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,227
Indeed.

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,543
Well then...

19
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:53,804
Lelouch vi Britannia orders you to answer him!

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,235
Go on.

21
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,258
Sister, are you the one who killed my mother?

22
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,573
I'm not.

23
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,173
Then who was it?

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,404
I don't know.

25
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:12,825
But you were put in charge of
her personal guard, were you not?!

26
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,764
Yes.

27
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:16,262
Then why did you withdraw her escort?

28
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:17,882
I was asked to.

29
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,873
By whom?!

30
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,550
Lady Marianne.

31
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:22,673
Mother did?!

32
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,379
That's impossible!

33
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,241
My mother knew she would be attacked that day?!

34
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,820
No... That can't be!

35
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,925
If she did, she would have gotten us out of there!

36
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,742
What really happened back then?!

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,956
Who killed her?!

38
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,895
Who killed my mother, dammit?!

39
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,485
Uh...

40
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:43,998
You don't know the truth?!

41
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:45,102
Then who does?!

42
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:46,895
Someone must know!

43
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:49,400
You, yourself, investigated what occurred that day!

44
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,662
I remember His Majesty the Emperor

45
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:54,549
ordered Schneizel to transport the body out of there.

46
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,558
The body? You mean Mother's?!

47
00:01:56,612 --> 00:01:58,399
Then... what was in that coffin?

48
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,350
Hey, get back in here!

49
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,434
I know! The government bureau's
defense forces will be here soon.

50
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,875
No! Your little sister's been kidnapped!

51
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,580
Hm?

52
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,871
C.C., this is not the time for jokes!

53
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,606
We'll take Cornelia back to
the command center as our hostage.

54
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,840
She's been taken!

55
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,093
I just know because she's the reason you live!

56
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,943
She's on Kamine Island!

57
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,393
Kamine Island?

58
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,164
All hail Britannia!

59
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,709
Mr. Zero?! Can it really be?!

60
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,048
What?! Oh, what luck! What fate!

61
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:30,359
What evil fortune!

62
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,983
Is that you, Orange Boy?

63
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:36,174
Oh! Ohh! I beseech you!

64
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,031
I'm begging you, please die!

65
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:39,551
Damn! Get Cornelia!

66
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,767
I'm already on it!

67
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:47,677
Zero!

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,176
I...

69
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:52,357
...must rid the world of the empire's enemies!

70
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:54,512
Yes! And so...

71
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,725
All hail Britannia!

72
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,470
It's a damn disgrace!

73
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,954
If we report to the prince what happened here...

74
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,997
It's only his emotions running wild.

75
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:06,150
His behavior's too hard to predict right now!

76
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,757
I wish we could communicate with him!

77
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,534
Get through to him somehow!

78
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:11,901
Out of the way!

79
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,576
Zero!

80
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,796
Currently passing through Ozuite Area...

81
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,069
Why did you try to stop Suzaku?

82
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,692
I'm a military contractor.

83
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,381
You didn't want him killed, did you?

84
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:57,823
Why should I care?

85
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,774
You know as well as I do...

86
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:00,489
Uh?

87
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,135
The biggest human flaw is that we're so pitifully fragile,

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,598
in our bodies, our hearts,
and our relationships with each other.

89
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:11,485
Nevertheless, you can't bend the world
or people any which way you want.

90
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,421
I want every part in my mechanisms
to function exactly as I wish.

91
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:19,124
If we lose Kururugi, we'll
just have to find another Devicer.

92
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,662
Be careful, please!

93
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:25,019
Any Knightmare entering
the field will shut down immediately.

94
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,476
Understood.

95
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:31,268
Hmph!

96
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,386
He's very good.

97
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,828
Ohgi, it's Zero.

98
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,062
Zero! Thank god!

99
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,401
Hm? What?

100
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:37,782
Minami, where's Ohgi?

101
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:38,915
Someone shot him!

102
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,683
We're treating him, but he's unconscious.

103
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,284
And the culprit who shot him is still...

104
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,239
All right, you'll do.

105
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,823
The girl in the wheelchair...
do you know where she is right now?

106
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:48,223
Uh... Isn't Ohgi more important?

107
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,192
I'll arrange for his replacement later!

108
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,120
The girl in the wheelchair comes first!

109
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,134
His replacement?!

110
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,814
Confirm her location! Hurry!

111
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,979
All of the students we had
confined alone have disappeared.

112
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,658
In the confusion when Ohgi was shot...

113
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:00,808
Bring as many as you can.

114
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,996
Medicine, too. Hang in there, Ohgi!

115
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,471
Lelouch! This is a bad time.

116
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,316
Is Nunnally there with you?

117
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,095
No, she's in the clubhouse.

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,037
We're just a short distance away.

119
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,120
Understood!

120
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:15,216
No! Wait! Hey, where are you, anyway?!

121
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:22,700
Damn, I can't get through to Nunnally or even Sayoko!

122
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,852
Lelouch, you know I'm here with you as your accomplice.

123
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,101
But also as your ally.

124
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,269
So I should trust you?

125
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:30,551
Take the word of a woman who won't give me any reasons?

126
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,367
Look, I don't want you to die.

127
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,882
At least that's true.

128
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:36,671
Hmph. That's just a one-sided convenience!

129
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,596
Third Squad, enemy aircraft!

130
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,211
Sync fire and shoot it down!

131
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:40,915
Roger!

132
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,657
Tracking enemy... Fire!

133
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:51,327
I see them...!

134
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,578
Wh-What the hell is that?!

135
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,668
Captain Kagezaki...!

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,834
Zero! Zero!

137
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:01,719
That's it!

138
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,195
I don't have time to fool with cannon fodder like you!

139
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,354
C.C.! Get to 12th Street now!

140
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,795
Talk about one-sided convenience!

141
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:12,932
You missed!

142
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,548
You can't hit me... Jeremiah Gottwald!

143
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,651
You're wrong, Orange Boy.

144
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,181
You're being hit right now.

145
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,331
Coward! Behind from back?!

146
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:23,439
Be crushed to dust, you relic!

147
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:28,325
All right... Now to get Nunnally.

148
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,359
Damn, that's a thick hatch!

149
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:35,795
Wish we had the sword with the rotating blade.

150
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Tamaki!

151
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,587
What do you want us to do with them?

152
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,342
Should we lock them in the dorms
or the gym with the other students?

153
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,289
Students?

154
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,398
Call Zero!

155
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,327
I guarantee you that Zero wants us to be safe!

156
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,984
If not, something's wrong! He's trying to guard us!

157
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,050
Aw, shut up!

158
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,976
Zero and me, we're tight, and
I know the man better than anybody!

159
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,904
And he's not gonna hesitate
to shoot anyone at a time like this!

160
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:57,482
Stop!

161
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,181
Huh?

162
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,361
Ho! What's this?

163
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,994
The Japanese knight comes out to help the Brits, huh?

164
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,109
Suzaku...

165
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,426
That white Knightmare is all we came here to get.

166
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:09,659
A dirty traitor like you can die right there!

167
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:13,809
Arthur!

168
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:17,622
Stupid ass cat! Screw this, just kill all of 'em!

169
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:20,496
Good evening, everyone!

170
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:21,376
Huh?!

171
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,580
Retreat! Let's pull out!

172
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,360
You're kidding!

173
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:30,260
That Earl of Pudding actually
came out to the front lines?!

174
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,227
Rakshata... I thought it was you.

175
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:33,979
C'mon!

176
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:34,989
Huh?

177
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,190
Halt! You...!

178
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,293
Well, Miss Cecile? How are the test parts working out?

179
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,401
They're ready to be practically applied.

180
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,598
It's back on!

181
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,028
Unlock your fuel hatch.

182
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,720
We'll replace your energy filler.

183
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:54,434
Right.

184
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,723
But why did you come out here, too, Miss Cecile?

185
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,831
Good question. Why did we, Lloyd?

186
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,932
Why else? To recover the Lancelot!

187
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,874
And to do a few other things, as well.

188
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:08,160
It's a Sutherland arm, is it showing contact?

189
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,921
They've cleared the compatibility check.

190
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,920
Good. Now leave this place to us.

191
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:13,531
You go after Zero!

192
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:16,046
Thanks to you, I will.

193
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,719
Please protect Ashford Academy and everyone here!

194
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,002
Yes. After all, my fiancée is here, too.

195
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,717
Hm? Royal private channel?

196
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,491
K-Kururugi...?

197
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:31,904
Viceroy Cornelia!

198
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,193
Damn their tenacity! I'd expect that of Cornelia's elite!

199
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:41,945
Tohdoh!

200
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,436
Hm?

201
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,246
From here on, I'm leaving all operations in your hands!

202
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:46,519
Ohgi's been wounded.

203
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,028
Have Diethard assume his duties!

204
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,095
Hold on a second!

205
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,483
What do you mean, leaving them to me?!

206
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,859
I'm afraid there's another
urgent matter that requires my attention!

207
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:56,986
I won't respond to any further communications from you!

208
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,099
W-Wait!

209
00:09:58,124 --> 00:09:59,955
What else could be more urgent than this, Zero?!

210
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,343
Seventh Squad wiped out!

211
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,209
What?!

212
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,040
Remain calm!

213
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,793
You're safe, so wait your turn!

214
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,679
Youngest students go first!

215
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:11,973
We've gotta fall back!

216
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,839
Destroy any records you can't take!

217
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,287
Hurry! Hurry!

218
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,620
This battle situation...

219
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,124
...bodes victory for my forces.

220
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:29,517
Am I clear?

221
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:33,097
Do all you can to hide the fact that I've been wounded.

222
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:35,022
It'll only upset them...

223
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:38,643
Guilford... the Glaston knights...

224
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,794
You're the only one...

225
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,955
...I can tell...

226
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,785
Don't try to talk any more.

227
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:48,273
Kamine Island... that's where Zero's headed.

228
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,790
Any more than that...

229
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:54,057
It's no use... I can't remember...

230
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,076
Geass!

231
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:58,148
Y-You're Euphy's knight, aren't you?

232
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,281
Then you must go and clear her dishonored name!

233
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,529
Yes!

234
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,037
I know... this is a bit informal...

235
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,753
But I dub thee Knight of Honor of Britannia.

236
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,567
You are now a knight in both name and station.

237
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:15,109
Go, Suzaku Kururugi!

238
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,146
Yes, Your Highness!

239
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:22,606
What?! Does this mean that Zero's disappeared?

240
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:26,130
Not at all, he simply transferred
command to us on-site here.

241
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:27,773
Right.

242
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,416
Why? Why now, of all times?!

243
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,398
I wanna know why Ohgi was shot!

244
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,705
And where the hell is Zero?!

245
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,024
I said I don't know!

246
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,966
Can't someone get a hold of him?!

247
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,400
It makes no sense.

248
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,354
He had no reason to run away.

249
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,776
In spite of Tohdoh's experience,
if he doesn't see the entire picture...

250
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,752
Zero... I don't know what to do next.

251
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:49,456
Kallen...

252
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,788
Ohgi! Are you all right?!

253
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:52,817
Yeah...

254
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,617
Kallen, listen to me...

255
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,304
Go after Zero!

256
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,085
Hm?

257
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,965
There's must be a reason...

258
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,013
he's acting this way...

259
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,522
Save him...

260
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:04,955
Zero...

261
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,259
The one who will realize...

262
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,700
...Naoto's dream.

263
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,809
But... How do I find him?!

264
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,722
You should see it soon...

265
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:16,171
That's... the Lancelot!

266
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,495
What would be drawing him away from here?

267
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:22,575
Rakshata... put a transmitter... on it.

268
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,558
Understood.

269
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,488
Supply corps!

270
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,796
Send a captured air transport to me ASAP!

271
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,404
It's top priority!

272
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,882
Dammit!

273
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,923
Can't we at least hold this place?!

274
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,316
It will only be until all the
students have boarded the ship.

275
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,350
Hang in there.

276
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,527
Yes I will.

277
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,792
Why am I reading a thermal reaction in there?!

278
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,118
A Knightmare!

279
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,067
What in the world is that antique doing here?

280
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,409
Ganymede...?

281
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,272
Nina!

282
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,211
Oh, hell! Cease fire!

283
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,316
That goes for you, too, Black Knights!

284
00:12:58,341 --> 00:12:58,930
Huh?

285
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:01,859
Call a temporary truce! We can't fire on that!

286
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,684
Listen, everyone, do as he says!

287
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,018
Hold your fire!

288
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:07,916
If it's got Lloyd that panicked, then...

289
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:13,593
Nina, did you complete it?

290
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,608
There wasn't enough time to test it.

291
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:17,788
I don't know if it'll explode.

292
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:20,105
Still... I'll try to.

293
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,575
Nina! What did you mean by "explode"?

294
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,612
It's dangerous! Stay back!

295
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,695
You see, if her theory is correct,

296
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,858
that thing may destroy the entire Tokyo settlement.

297
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:31,661
But that isn't possi...

298
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,518
Believe it!

299
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,620
She's even using Sakuradite!

300
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,148
Zero, where is he?

301
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,103
Tell me where he is!

302
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,880
Princess Euphemia will be avenged!

303
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,881
Where is Zero?!

304
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,694
If I've lost Nunnally,

305
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,340
then what have I been fighting for till now?

306
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,867
What's the point of this war of independence?!

307
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:56,154
Why did Euphy have to be sacrificed?!

308
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,766
Kamine Island in sight.

309
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,757
I'm taking Nunnally back!

310
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,038
No matter who tries to stop me!

311
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,679
It figures it would be here.

312
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,294
Do you have some sort of connection to this place?

313
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,576
Not this one.

314
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,273
Hmph.

315
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:24,961
Meaning there are other places similar to this one.

316
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,335
Does Nunnally's abductor have a Geass power?

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,662
I don't know that much.

318
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,002
It's the truth.

319
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,269
I don't doubt it.

320
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,599
We're still accomplices, so at the very least,

321
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,929
I should give you the benefit of believing you.

322
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,495
Thank you.

323
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,063
What's the matter?!

324
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,374
I see! This is...

325
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:44,999
What?!

326
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:48,041
Calm down!

327
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,451
We're caught in a trap that was set for intruders.

328
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,960
The one who activated it...

329
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,782
What is this?

330
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,316
The past?

331
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,307
C.C.!

332
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,387
No!

333
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:04,867
But...

334
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,242
Hold it right there?!

335
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,495
Stop it...

336
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,182
Stop it!

337
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,779
C.C., these... visions...

338
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,212
...are these of your...

339
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:34,387
All I have left are my memories from when I was a witch.

340
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,769
Other than that, I don't even know
if I was ever human to begin with.

341
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,628
Every person who has ever hated me,

342
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:42,528
and each and every one that has shown me any kindness...

343
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,924
are gone... forever.

344
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:46,332
They've vanished into the current of time.

345
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,949
Always existing with the endless flow of eternity...

346
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:52,024
...I am utterly alone.

347
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,116
You are not alone!

348
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:54,992
Huh?!

349
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:57,659
We're each other's accomplice.

350
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,031
Therefore, if you're supposed to be a witch,

351
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,887
then perhaps I should be a demon.

352
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,007
Odd thing to say at a time like this.

353
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,310
C.C., you okay?

354
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:15,460
Don't you know who you're talking to?

355
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,614
Zero! It is I!

356
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,104
Repent is now!

357
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,308
Stubborn ass!

358
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,759
The section Cornelia damaged before!

359
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,129
There's one shot left in the Hadron canon!

360
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,803
It's time for my wonderful vindication!

361
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,759
Insidious isolation impudence!

362
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,279
I'll handle this lunatic!

363
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:49,679
You go after Nunnally!

364
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,490
But... we're out of energy!

365
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,020
I'll be all right!

366
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:57,002
Well... I am nervous.

367
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,073
Hm?

368
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:01,495
You have to prevail, over your own past,

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,390
and over the outcome of your own action.

370
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,166
C.C., don't die.

371
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,726
Who are you talking to?

372
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:16,670
You have a point.

373
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,974
I've found him!

374
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,917
You're not my first pick to commit suicide with, but...

375
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:40,878
Hold your ground!

376
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,339
Victory's within our reach! Be strong!

377
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:44,829
Dammit, we can't hold out!

378
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,992
Enemy reinforcements will be here soon!

379
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:48,476
What should we do?!

380
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,455
Inoue...?

381
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,758
Where the hell is he?!

382
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,433
Zero!

383
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,771
All forces, charge!

384
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,376
We'll smash these filthy rebels with one blow!

385
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:03,819
Fight till your last breath!

386
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:04,867
Stop at nothing!

387
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:08,714
Because if they break through here,
our forces will collapse completely!

388
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,933
It's not that Tohdoh isn't a brilliant military leader...

389
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,595
He simply lacks the incredible charisma Zero possesses!

390
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,169
We need him! He can't run out on us, not now!

391
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:22,383
Oh Zero, have you really abandoned us?

392
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,176
Have you abandoned Japan?!

393
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:35,897
That trap at the entrance was designed to buy them time.

394
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,951
Was I the intended target?

395
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,774
Or was it C.C.?

396
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:41,247
No matter.

397
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:44,229
The first thing to do is make sure Nunnally is all right.

398
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:53,242
Turn and face me... very slowly.

399
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,538
Dammit! Why now?!

400
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,976
Didn't you hear me... Zero?

401
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,502
I said turn and face me... very slowly.

402
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:08,324
Euphemia randomly murdered
throngs of innocent Japanese people.

403
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:10,192
You'd fight for a woman like...

404
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:13,334
Your Geass power is quite convenient, isn't it?

405
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:18,338
You get to hide in the shadows while
others take all the blame for doing your dirty work.

406
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,360
You're just an arrogant coward.

407
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,968
That's your true nature, the "real you."

408
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:24,010
Kallen!

409
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,187
Don't you want to know Zero's true identity, too?

410
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,835
What are you saying?!

411
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,176
You have a right to bear witness.

412
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:33,718
No, wait!

413
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:03,670
But how...?!

414
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:05,426
How could you?!

415
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:15,555
I didn't want it... to be you.

416
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,025
L-Lelouch is...?

417
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:20,607
Yes. I am Zero.

418
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:22,806
The man who leads the Black Knights,

419
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,623
who challenges the Holy Britannian Empire,

420
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,877
the one who holds the entire world in his hand.

421
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,869
You used us, the Japanese people?!

422
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:35,432
You used me?!

423
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,940
And as a result, Japan will be freed.

424
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,436
You certainly can't complain about that.

425
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,093
I should have arrested you when I had the chance.

426
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,607
You knew it was me?

427
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
I wasn't sure at first.

428
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,916
So I convinced myself that it wasn't true.

429
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,208
I really wanted to believe in you.

430
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,801
But you were lying to us, to me...

431
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:57,438
...your sister, Euphy...

432
00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:58,730
...and Nunnally!

433
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,435
Yes.

434
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,676
And now, Nunnally's been kidnapped!

435
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,740
Please, Suzaku, can't we call a temporary truce?!

436
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:05,750
I need your help!

437
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,534
Together, we'll be able to save Nunnally!

438
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:10,730
There's nothing in the world
that you and I can't do together!

439
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:12,371
I'm done with that.

440
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,803
Had you only joined up with
Euphy first, we wouldn't be here!

441
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:18,815
If you and she had combined
forces, things would be different!

442
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,386
The world could have...

443
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,462
That's all in the past!

444
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,661
Over and done.

445
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:22,632
Past?!

446
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,706
You killed your own father, didn't you?!

447
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,269
Wallow in remorse when you have time for it!

448
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:29,711
N-No! You're hopeless!

449
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:30,373
What?

450
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:34,060
I know you! In the very end,
you'd betray the entire world!

451
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,051
The way that it's betrayed you!

452
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:39,039
I'm not going to let your sick, twisted dream be realized!

453
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:39,896
You fool!

454
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,250
You think ideals alone can change the world?!

455
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:45,060
Fine! Then go right ahead and shoot me! Come on!

456
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,202
Set your aim on this liquid Sakuradite!

457
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,009
If my hearts stops, this vial will explode!

458
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,431
You'll both die with me!

459
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,583
Damn you!

460
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,523
Listen, I'll make a deal with you.

461
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,703
I want to know who told you about Geass.

462
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:58,822
Did they abduct Nunnally?!

463
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:02,396
Nothing that happens now... is any of your concern!

464
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,245
Your very existence is a mistake!

465
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,661
You need to be erased from the face of the earth!

466
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,469
I'll take care of Nunnally!

467
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,428
Suzaku!

468
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:14,309
Lelouch!
