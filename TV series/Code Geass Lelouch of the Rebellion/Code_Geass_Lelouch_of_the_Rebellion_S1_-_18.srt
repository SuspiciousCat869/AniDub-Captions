1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:07,594
The young Britannian, Lelouch, is faced
with a choice between two divergent paths.

2
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:11,894
One leads to the past in a quest
to find his mother's enemies.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,103
The other way takes him to the future

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,898
where he will create a world in which
his little sister, Nunnally, can live happily.

5
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,521
Only Lelouch can choose which direction he will go...

6
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:26,202
Will he follow the path that
ends in destruction of the world?

7
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:29,898
Or will he travel the road to building a bright new one?

8
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,790
We used to have trouble getting even a single motorcycle.

9
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:20,398
Now we have a submarine.

10
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:25,073
The military district of India will be
in big trouble if the Britannians ever find out.

11
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,603
How'd she do it?

12
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:30,994
Now then, due to our recent reorganization,
a few changes have been made.

13
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:34,409
Our new Chief of Military Affairs will be Kyoshiro Tohdoh.

14
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,161
Taking charge of all intelligence, espionage,

15
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:42,030
and public relation matters, Diethard Reid.

16
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,248
This Britannian pretty boy?

17
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,273
Not to mention his media ties.

18
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:48,086
Zero, I'm not a racist,

19
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:51,844
but what's your reasoning for placing
one of "them" in such a sensitive position?

20
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:52,873
Reasoning?

21
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,817
And what of me, I ask you?

22
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,315
I'm not Japanese either.

23
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,771
You all know this.

24
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:01,571
What matters is the ability to produce results.

25
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:04,878
Who you are and where
you're from are of little consequence.

26
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:06,569
All right, all right already...

27
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:09,338
My deputy commander will be Kaname Oghi.

28
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,505
Who, me?

29
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,605
You object?

30
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,880
Uh, no...

31
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:15,515
Well, you were our leader to begin with, weren't you?

32
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,317
A newbie can't take that job, right?

33
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,759
And for research and development, Rakshata.

34
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:20,825
Who else?

35
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,375
Captain of the Zero Squad, Kallen Kouzuki.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,625
The Zero Squad?

37
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,159
An elite guard under my direct command.

38
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,636
Think of yourselves as my personal force.

39
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,230
An elite guard... Zero...

40
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:35,405
Captain of the First Squad will be Shougo Asahina.

41
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,577
Second Squad, Ryouga Senba.

42
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,935
Third Squad, Kizuna Kagesaki.

43
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,605
And Tamaki will lead the second special forces.

44
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,463
That is all.

45
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:49,669
I'm the man!

46
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,886
There's no position for C.C.?

47
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,682
Zero. May I add something?

48
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:58,648
Hm?

49
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:01,725
There's one issue that still needs to be dealt with.

50
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,052
Who cares if he's an honorary Britannian?

51
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,327
Knighting an Eleven is just...

52
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,425
And broadcasting it live...

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,325
How'd he ever win her favor, I wonder?

54
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,071
Well, even a princess has needs, right?

55
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:17,650
Are they kidding?!

56
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,190
No, this can't be happening!

57
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,307
They're making him a major! An Eleven!

58
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,873
Suzaku Kururugi.

59
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:26,523
Wilt thou, upon this day, pledge thy fealty to Britannia

60
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:28,965
and stand as a Knight of the Crown?

61
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:30,950
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:33,536
Dost thou wish to abandon thy self

63
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:36,994
and be sword and shield for the sake of the greater good?

64
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,998
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:56,580
I, Euphemia li Britannia,

66
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:00,224
do hearby dub thee Sir Suzaku Kururugi.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,778
So whose payroll is he on now?

68
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,995
I believe Lloyd's already working on that.

69
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,676
You mean... with him?

70
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,664
Yes, well, it's not like I've ever met him, of course.

71
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,711
Suzaku Kururugi.

72
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,638
He's become a focal point among Elevens
who are Britannian supporters.

73
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,145
I recommend he be assassinated.

74
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,767
Assassinate him?

75
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,649
He may be right.

76
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:06,115
You've been the focus of the resistance movement.

77
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,807
The servile masses lack such a hero.

78
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:11,499
People aren't moved by ideology alone.

79
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:14,732
But the Brittanians will hold this boy up as a symbol.

80
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,713
I think that taking him out
would be the smart decision right now.

81
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:19,536
I object.

82
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:20,036
Hm?

83
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:23,370
The Japanese would be revolted by such a cowardly act.

84
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:24,513
Yeah!

85
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,420
And the Black Knights are not in
the business of killing the defenseless, either!

86
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,969
What do you want us to do?!

87
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,520
Get him when he's alone, and kill him straight out?!

88
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:33,811
Calm down.

89
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm merely suggesting we minimize
a risk in the most efficient way possible.

90
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:40,103
But it's Zero's call, of course.

91
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,576
What's so complicated?

92
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,059
Just use your Geass on Kururugi.

93
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:45,990
Drop it.

94
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,140
So stubborn...

95
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,790
Why not? Because he's your friend?

96
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,057
Or is it pride?

97
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,715
All of it.

98
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,532
You might have to kill him, otherwise...

99
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,011
You haven't said anything about it yet.

100
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:03,809
Appointing a knight is a privilege of royalty.

101
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:06,811
It's out of my hands, even as viceroy.

102
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:10,127
Don't you see? Suzaku Kururugi is an honorary Britannian,

103
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:13,054
and he's proved himself more than worthy of knighthood.

104
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,438
Sister, even you have to...

105
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,196
It's Viceroy.

106
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,681
Viceroy, even you must know that he's deserving.

107
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:22,137
Discrimination against the Numbers is our national policy!

108
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:24,496
Then it's time I tried to change that!

109
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:29,190
Oh, is it now, Sub Viceroy?

110
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,946
Well, when you become Empress, feel free to do so.

111
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:38,349
Construction of the thought
elevator is proceeding as scheduled.

112
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes... I understand.

113
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,411
What, Schneizel?

114
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:48,961
Yes, Majesty. Your orders?

115
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,025
You needn't interfere.

116
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,175
If he's that sure of himself, let him challenge me.

117
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,825
Okay guys, time to raise a glass to Kururugi here,

118
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,170
valued member of the
student council and knight of the realm!

119
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:03,602
Now let's get this party started, huh?!

120
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,953
Congratulations!

121
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:11,023
You've Nunnally to thank for all of this.

122
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,464
I'm sure you've tired of the celebrations.

123
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,761
If you don't mind, we want to honor you too.

124
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,619
Not at all.

125
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,445
It's really kind of you.

126
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,825
Oh... What am I gonna do...

127
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,613
Princess Euphemia...

128
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,263
Good afternoon!

129
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,080
Have you seen Major Kururugi?

130
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,566
They said I could find him here.

131
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:37,111
Ooh, looks like you're working on some fun stuff!

132
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,480
You know what it is?

133
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:41,448
Oh, I can tell a uranium isotope when I see one.

134
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,098
Wow, you know your stuff!

135
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,018
And if you can get that uranium to absorb active neutrons,

136
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,626
then it should split into high speed neutrons,

137
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,029
and atomic nuclei!

138
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:53,169
The problem is, you'd need
to fuel the reaction with U-235,

139
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:56,110
which only makes up 0.7% of all natural uranium.

140
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,070
So even if we came up with some means of inducing fission,

141
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,887
we'd never have enough raw materials.

142
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:01,999
That's why...

143
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,880
Hey Prez, where's Nina?

144
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,686
I told her to be here.

145
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,489
Oh. Hey, Kallen!

146
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,641
Can you help me set out more pizza?

147
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:31,002
Hey, are you listening?

148
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,043
This is for Zero, Kallen.

149
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,646
If you don't do it here...

150
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:40,828
Hey! I think Shirley wants you to give her a hand.

151
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:44,314
I'm sorry, but I'm right in the
middle of something at the moment.

152
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,542
What're you doing? Maybe I can help out.

153
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,222
Hey.

154
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:49,998
I'm sorry, I got held up.

155
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:50,648
Huh?

156
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,923
No problem!

157
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:54,350
I'm just happy you could be here.

158
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,606
Hey, what did you wanna talk about?

159
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,797
You said it was kind of important, right?

160
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:01,035
Oh... yeah, uh...

161
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:02,458
Just forget it.

162
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,243
Huh?

163
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,524
Bad news, Suzaku!

164
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,363
You just got even more work to do, I'm afraid.

165
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,638
Oh, right...

166
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:10,788
You know him?

167
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,156
He's my boss.

168
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,139
Lloyd, is something wrong?

169
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,542
Oh... Do you guys know each other?

170
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:17,683
We're to be married.

171
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,292
Huh?!

172
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,484
Huh?!

173
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,412
Isn't that right, honey bunch?

174
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,437
Uh... Yeah...

175
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,720
Secret's out.

176
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:25,578
So you knew?

177
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:26,644
Mhm.

178
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,616
Whoa! Whoa! What's goin' on here?!

179
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:31,641
Who is this guy?

180
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,791
Earl Asplund.

181
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,999
Earl?!

182
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,591
It's an honor, Your Lordship.

183
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,461
Now, what did you say your relationship was again?

184
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:39,819
She and I are betrothed.

185
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,844
No!

186
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,369
You were serious then?

187
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,053
So do I have military duties, then?

188
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,411
Yes. An important someone-or-other is arriving by boat.

189
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,747
We're off to meet him.

190
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:54,642
Along with the Lancelot, and Princess Euphemia, naturally.

191
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,951
Why Shikine Island?

192
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,226
The Tokyo Settlement would've been a lot safer.

193
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,751
Yes, I'm curious about that myself.

194
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,443
Wha...?! You're saying you don't know either?

195
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:12,968
Ditto.

196
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:13,799
Huh?!

197
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,822
You still shouldn't have said anything.

198
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,930
After all, your loose lips
got our plans leaked onto the net.

199
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:22,622
That girl was so charming though, I couldn't resist.

200
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,710
Euphemia is going to that island
to meet a noble from their homeland.

201
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,820
Her knight, Suzaku Kururugi, will be accompanying her.

202
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,156
That far out at sea, the enemy's strength will be limited.

203
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,282
It is a golden opportunity.

204
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,094
Our objective is the capture of
the Lancelot and Suzaku Kururugi.

205
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:43,018
Once we've won the battle,
I want Kururugi taken safely into custody.

206
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,908
So what happens after we've got him?

207
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,225
Don't worry. Just leave that to me.

208
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,496
That's our spot, huh?

209
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,022
You suppose it's going to work?

210
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,547
I think we'll be fine.

211
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:01,738
The stealth effect we get
as a byproduct seems to be working.

212
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,162
How can you tell?

213
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,021
The Britannians haven't found us, have they?

214
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,303
What's that tell you?

215
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,245
Oh, I see. You're right!

216
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,904
It is just a first step, though.

217
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,203
Diethard, what did you talk Kallen into doing?

218
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,570
I told her to dig up what she could on Kururugi.

219
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,820
Maybe I implied a little more than that...

220
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,040
Don't overstep your bounds.

221
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:24,812
I don't recall ordering his assassination.

222
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,777
You want us to be the hammer of justice, right?

223
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:31,328
We can't have people thinking
of us as cold-blooded killers, I know.

224
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,339
But we can hide the truth using the media.

225
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:38,071
You can't change the world
without getting your hands dirty.

226
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:39,655
Am I wrong?

227
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:41,128
Diethard...

228
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,986
What are you really after?

229
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,286
You may have been demoted, but you're still a Britannian.

230
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:50,919
You don't need to join the
Black Knights to change the world, do you?

231
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,126
I never mentioned this,

232
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:56,448
but the first time I ever saw you
was the night you rescued Kururugi.

233
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,087
And I trembled!

234
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:01,952
It was like a new era had
taken form and appeared before me!

235
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,694
I wish to document you, Zero,

236
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:07,641
as you build your organization and topple over the empire,

237
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,103
then take this world for your own.

238
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,858
I wish to be there documenting history as it's created!

239
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,274
Nothing has ever made my heart dance more!

240
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,466
Documenting?

241
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,116
You're right in the thick of it.

242
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,145
I'd say you're fabricating history.

243
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,420
Objectivity is a fairy tale.

244
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:28,452
In the end, journalism is a product
of the human mind, like everything else.

245
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,304
You're not to interfere with military matters.

246
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,123
Yes, of course.

247
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,868
Arrival time's right on schedule.

248
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,099
We've prepared a room for you back at headquarters,

249
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,498
if you'd care to wait there.

250
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,715
Is it safe to assume that the ship is docking here?

251
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,392
Yes, that hasn't changed.

252
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,932
This will do fine, then.

253
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,147
Very well, I'll just arrange for an escort.

254
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,071
Huh?

255
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:52,486
Terrorists?!

256
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,052
But how did they get here?!

257
00:13:57,412 --> 00:13:59,519
First Squad, continue advancing!

258
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:02,458
Zero Squad, I want you covering them from their flank!

259
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,100
Filthy Elevens!

260
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,186
She sure packs a punch, huh?

261
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:15,754
Impressive.

262
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,639
It's no wonder Tohdoh held off the Britannians once before

263
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,621
without a single Knightmare.

264
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,069
Now I only have to wait for Euphemia
to receive word of our visit...

265
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:27,229
Headquarters appears to be under some sort of attack!

266
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,588
We'll withdraw to the settlement.

267
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,007
Can you arrange an escort unit for her?

268
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:33,907
It's too risky to leave right now.

269
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,986
They're jamming us with
some kind of wide-range interference.

270
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,602
You're going to be fine.

271
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:41,406
Don't worry, Princess, I won't let any harm come to you.

272
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:44,821
No, Suzaku, you should help these men fend off the attack.

273
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:45,405
Huh?

274
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,673
But Sub-Viceroy, he's an Honorary Britannian!

275
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,437
We're almost certainly dealing
with the Black Knights here.

276
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,689
What if he turns the Lancelot against us?

277
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:58,075
Uh, you do realize you're
criticizing a member of royalty, right?

278
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,880
Oh, uh, forgive me, I didn't mean to...

279
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,248
Kururugi.

280
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,809
Demonstrate your valor for us today

281
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,964
so that we may finally silence all these nay-sayers.

282
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:08,847
Right!

283
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,552
Worthless garrison unit!

284
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,271
I'll finish the job! Huh?!

285
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,843
Zero... There you are...

286
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:33,440
That's right, Suzaku. Come!

287
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,259
Confirming target.

288
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,551
All units assume formation three and fall back!

289
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:41,022
Do not fire on the target!

290
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,979
I repeat, do not fire!

291
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:45,617
Yes, thanks to the Special Corps.

292
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:46,433
What?!

293
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,157
But that would mean...

294
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:50,647
Yes, Your Highness!

295
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,272
He's not equipped for that sand he jumped into...

296
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,544
Could he be drawing me into a set up,

297
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,281
using himself as bait?

298
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:04,685
Fine then!

299
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,942
Zero! I got you...

300
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:12,850
...right where...

301
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,111
...I want you.

302
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,519
What the...?!

303
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:27,065
It's frozen?

304
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,228
No good!

305
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:34,063
We need to talk, Kururugi.

306
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,805
I suggest you come out.

307
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:39,596
Your secondary systems should still be functioning.

308
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,767
You'll be treated as a prisoner under international law.

309
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,509
Of course, if you don't care to talk,

310
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,440
we could just gun you down.

311
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:50,446
I don't care!

312
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,813
Tell Suzaku to abandon the unit!

313
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,495
What could possibly be wrong with it?

314
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,687
How come it won't move?

315
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:59,182
Something's happened to the Sakuradite
that's powering Suzaku's Lancelot.

316
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,832
Somebody is interfering with it!

317
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,569
A Gefjun Disturber.

318
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:03,350
You mean...

319
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,611
But they're actually using it as a jamming mechanism.

320
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:10,122
I thought it only theoretical. What a fool I am.

321
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:12,355
It really is you, Rakshata.

322
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,775
It's looks like the range and
endurance still need a little work.

323
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:21,206
I'll get straight to the point, Suzaku Kururugi.

324
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:22,810
I want you to join me.

325
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,239
Is that a threat?

326
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,556
Well you can forget it.

327
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,122
I already told you.

328
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,409
Results gained through
contemptable means are worthless to me.

329
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:35,084
So you wouldn't describe the
peace we have now as worthless?

330
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:39,386
If Japan had resisted to its
very last breath seven years ago,

331
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,637
what do you think would have happened?

332
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,903
The Chinese and the E.U. would have
stepped in, and split Japan in three.

333
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:48,151
They'd be fighting even now.

334
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:53,105
Our current peace is the result of
Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender.

335
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,769
That's right.

336
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,643
And I've been fighting to preserve my father's peace,

337
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,168
ever since it began!

338
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,417
You're wrong.

339
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,560
Prime Minister Kururugi, elected by the people,

340
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,168
didn't choose surrender.

341
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:09,276
That decision was selfishly made by his killer.

342
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:15,814
With the government thrown into chaos,
surrender became the only logical choice.

343
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,802
The will of the people was stolen from them

344
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,573
by a lone criminal pursuing his own selfish agenda!

345
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,035
Can you hear them at all?

346
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,300
There's too much static on the mic!

347
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,478
H-How on earth do you know that?

348
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:32,211
There's only one way for you to atone now.

349
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,138
Huh?

350
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:38,007
Present the Japanese people with
the choice they weren't able to make then.

351
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,998
The path they were robbed of seven years ago...

352
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,477
Fighting Britannia.

353
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:44,724
Fighting them? That again?

354
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,244
It's an option worth exploring.

355
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:52,031
Or would you rather drive the masses
towards a future dictated by your own egotism?

356
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,759
You call that peace?

357
00:18:57,258 --> 00:18:58,592
...Major Kururugi?

358
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,042
Please respond!

359
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:00,756
May I?

360
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:01,933
As you wish.

361
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,622
This is Lt. Col. Fayer, commander here on Shikine Island!

362
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:09,179
We're launching surface-to-surface
missiles against the terrorists!

363
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:13,064
Major Kururugi, your orders are to keep Zero there!

364
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,322
They're giving him up to die!

365
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,644
Kururugi, what're you...?!

366
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,809
I can't approve of your methods!

367
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,253
All I can do right now is this!

368
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:25,364
Why you little...!

369
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,601
Don't move! The field'll affect you too!

370
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,821
But Zero!

371
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,148
We're assigning Portman here to escort them.

372
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,318
The Sub-Viceroy should be...

373
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:34,806
Wait!

374
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,547
You're going to destroy the Lancelot?!

375
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:40,058
Kururugi is holding Zero there.

376
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,921
This is our chance to kill him!

377
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,984
And whose idea was this?

378
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,473
Major Kururugi's my personal knight!

379
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,548
It was a para-level one order.

380
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:52,692
It can only be countermanded by
the consensus of at least three ranking generals

381
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,551
or the Viceroy herself, I'm afraid.

382
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:57,243
Then who exactly issued this order, Captain?

383
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,174
Get me a line to them immediately!

384
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,283
Para-level one order, Princess Euphemia.

385
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:05,296
Out of my way!

386
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,771
Sub-Viceroy!

387
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,213
Contact the base!

388
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,683
Tell them there's a chance I'll be caught in the attack!

389
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,795
See if they'll initiate their launch then!

390
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,058
Please stop this! Think what you're doing!

391
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,345
But they'll stop with the princess out there...

392
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,828
I'm not sure they will, unfortunately.

393
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,504
Incoming missiles confirmed!

394
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,516
Damn!

395
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,571
Hold on! I'm coming!

396
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:29,499
Dammit!

397
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,993
You're gonna die here as well!

398
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,934
You don't have a problem with that?!

399
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,257
Your sacrifice isn't in vain, Major!

400
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:42,828
We're about to put an end to the most
dangerous criminal our homeland has ever known.

401
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:46,029
They'll speak of your bravery for generations to come!

402
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:46,886
Shut up!

403
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,315
All Knightmares, target on
those missiles and throw up a barrage!

404
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Empty your guns if you have to!

405
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,754
Suzaku, let Zero go!

406
00:20:57,779 --> 00:20:59,351
It's me... Suzaku!

407
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:02,011
It's Kallen Stadtfeld, from the student council!

408
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,153
Look at me!

409
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,391
Suzaku... You can't die now!

410
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,734
A soldier must always follow his orders!

411
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,731
Certainly easier than following your own heart!

412
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:18,256
How do you feel about this?!

413
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,033
You're wrong!

414
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,720
I have rules that I made and need to live by!

415
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:33,326
They completed a float system?

416
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:35,290
Well I'm not done...

417
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,898
That's... my brother's Avalon!

418
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:52,096
No, it can't be!

419
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:57,195
Damn it, Suzaku! Do something! You're going to die!

420
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,928
Better that than breaking the rules!

421
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,779
You stubborn fool!

422
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,728
My Geass is the power to command others.

423
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:54,558
None can disobey...

424
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:56,480
Those I turn it on

425
00:23:56,555 --> 00:24:00,138
find their ethics, their thoughts, and their feelings

426
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,111
crushed beneath its power.

427
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:07,149
And knowing all of that, I use it... on Suzaku.
