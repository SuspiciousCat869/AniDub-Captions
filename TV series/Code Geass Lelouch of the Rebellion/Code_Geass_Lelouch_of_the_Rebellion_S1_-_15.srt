1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:06,862
In this world, evil can arise from the best intentions.

2
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:10,545
And there is good, which can come from evil intentions.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,972
How then should Lelouch's actions be taken?

4
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,682
Every man has his day of judgment, does he not?

5
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:20,415
Geass...

6
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:25,181
He who uses this inhuman
power will find his heart isolated,

7
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,700
whether he wants it that way or not.

8
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:32,406
Thus, he plummets into the abyss
that lies between good and evil.

9
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:36,729
But if a man can climb out of that abyss into the light,

10
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:40,732
then that man has the soul of a king.

11
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:19,972
All right, first, I just want to confirm this:

12
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,127
Are you my enemy or my ally?

13
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,707
Where's this coming from?

14
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,482
Hmph.

15
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:29,292
Mao's Geass lets him get right into someone's head
and hear what they're thinking and planning.

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,140
I've got that right, don't I?

17
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,027
Yes.

18
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:35,450
The way Geass manifests is different for each person.

19
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,065
If Mao concentrates,

20
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,996
he can hear thoughts up to 500 meters away.

21
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,629
And he can read clear down
to your subconscious if he wants to.

22
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:45,950
For someone like you who fights with his head,

23
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,950
he's the worst possible enemy.

24
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,561
Five hundred meters...

25
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,854
Well, it doesn't really come as a surprise to me.

26
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,984
I knew there must be others who had the power of Geass.

27
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,290
Did you make a contract with him?

28
00:02:58,389 --> 00:02:59,702
Eleven years ago.

29
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,813
So, he's my predecessor.

30
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:05,269
Is there some reason that
this forerunner is also my enemy?

31
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,669
Mao's after me.

32
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,290
He may be your enemy, but he's not targeting you.

33
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,015
Yeah, well I can see that.

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
He could have revealed my true identity
and told the police or the military who I am,

35
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,750
but the only one he told was Shirley.

36
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,671
Are there limits to his powers?

37
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,324
Mao's Geass is very potent.

38
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:24,473
He can use it as many times as he wants,

39
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:27,252
and he doesn't need direct eye contact like you do.

40
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:29,136
Does he have any weakness?

41
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,224
If you press me, I guess it's
that he can't turn his power off.

42
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:37,452
In a crowd, he hears all the minds
roiling and writhing around him,

43
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,298
whether he wants to or not.

44
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:04,711
I understand, Mao.

45
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,709
Don't worry, Mao. I'm not going to die.

46
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,304
Mao! Mao!

47
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,473
Are you awake, Mao? Oh, Mao, how silly of you!

48
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,685
C.C., I can't live without you.

49
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,318
See, Mao?

50
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:17,570
Wait for me, I'm coming to you!

51
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,612
If Mao read my mind,

52
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:25,343
then he already knows my
weak points, and that's where he'll strike.

53
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:28,464
It's been a long time since
we spent time by ourselves, huh?

54
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,856
You know, even Sayoko needs
a little time off now and again.

55
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,724
Starting today, I'll be staying home for a while.

56
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,514
Lately you've been out of the house so much,

57
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,695
I was curious, have you found
some really fun game to play or something?

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,749
Sort of.

59
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,106
My current opponent's pretty hard to beat.

60
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:47,422
That's funny.

61
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:51,372
Only our big brother Schneizel
would ever make you say something like that.

62
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:57,949
Sorry, but I can't sell you
one without a permit... It's illegal.

63
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:00,411
Besides, you're from the Chinese Federation, aren't you?

64
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:03,547
Uh... true. But you sell them to the Black Knights.

65
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:04,892
Last Tuesday,

66
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,375
twenty-three hundred hours.

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,963
Your contact was named "Wolf." An alias, of course.

68
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:11,388
Who are you?!

69
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,678
You will kindly accommodate me.

70
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,240
Won't you now?

71
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,222
And?

72
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,926
I know that you want to protect your sister and all,

73
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,492
but you can't just sit around here and wait for him!

74
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,715
I've got the Black Knights hunting for him.

75
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,855
What if he's not in the ghetto like you think?

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,101
What if he's right here in the Tokyo Settlement?

77
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:32,459
Then you'll have wasted all that
precious time when you could just use me as bait.

78
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,442
I'm Mao's target, so I should be...

79
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,784
Tell me, if I keep using my Geass, will I become like him?

80
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:43,409
Or did he end up the way he is
because he didn't fulfill his contract with you?

81
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:47,165
The more you use your Geass, the more powerful it becomes.

82
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,492
Those who cannot control the power
are ultimately ravaged and consumed by it.

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,386
And even though you knew everything about that,

84
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,953
you still offered these contracts?!

85
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,390
To me?! And to Mao?!

86
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:57,373
That's right.

87
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,865
You're a cruel girl.

88
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:01,519
I don't know why anyone would chase after you.

89
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:04,692
Mao couldn't fulfill his contract with you,

90
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,392
so you cut him loose.

91
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,621
What were the terms of the contract?

92
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,862
You're a monster!

93
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,056
Why didn't you finish it when you cut him off?!

94
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,740
You should have taken his power back, or taken his life!

95
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,398
Because you left things half-finished, Shirley was...!

96
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:26,696
We should split up while we're dealing with Mao.

97
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,142
Starting today, I'll stay in the next hall.

98
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,621
You can't.

99
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,906
The student council and the culture clubs meet there.

100
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,390
I don't care about that.

101
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:35,602
You work it out.

102
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,615
A medical check up?

103
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,894
Just regulations.

104
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,779
It's required for all Knightmare pilots.

105
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,740
I understand.

106
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,512
Good. Tomorrow then, after your school gets out.

107
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:50,667
Right. Thanks.

108
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,050
Oh, Miss Cecile...

109
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,706
Do know of any way I can get in to see Princess Euphemia?

110
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,481
Huh? You want to meet her?

111
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:57,302
Forget it.

112
00:06:57,327 --> 00:07:00,469
You have to be at least a Knight
of Honor to get an audience with her.

113
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:03,358
But an earl could arrange it, if he really wanted to.

114
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:04,283
Who? Me?

115
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:05,221
Yes.

116
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,200
Huh?

117
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:09,090
Lloyd, you're an earl?! You never told me that!

118
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

119
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,762
The prodigal son of nobles...

120
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:15,854
He can't really separate work from play.

121
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,979
Wow...

122
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,283
You know, it would be just for a few days.

123
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,262
If you can keep the clubhouse off limits,

124
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,537
that would really help out.

125
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:26,140
Well, it's not like I can't do it, but...

126
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,373
Say, did someone find out you're a prince?

127
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:30,440
Hopefully, that secret's still safe.

128
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:33,881
Only the Ashford family knows
that I'm still here and still alive.

129
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,975
The all-knowing Ashfords...

130
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,308
Is something wrong?

131
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,562
Oh, Lelouch, they've got another blind date set up for me.

132
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,962
I may not be able to wriggle out of this one.

133
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:44,671
What do you think I should do about it?

134
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,035
Well... That is...

135
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,815
Madame President!

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,542
Hm?

137
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,492
Shirley!

138
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,184
Were you back at morning practice?

139
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,894
Yeah, it just started again today.

140
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,408
You can't stay sad forever!

141
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:00,623
I should take lessons from you on positive thinking!

142
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,118
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,464
You're way more...

144
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:04,814
Huh?

145
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:06,906
Aren't you're the boy from...

146
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:08,596
You go to school here, too?

147
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:09,981
Are you putting me on?

148
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,475
We're in the same classes.

149
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:12,423
Huh?!

150
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,285
No! I don't think we are!

151
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,081
Hm... Are we?

152
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,387
Please, that's enough now.

153
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,829
Shirley, we're ready to start!

154
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,146
I'll be right there!

155
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,283
See you later, Prez!

156
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,602
Mm-hm...

157
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,265
What was that about?

158
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,198
We... had a little fight.

159
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:32,573
So she's playing strangers? Oh, that is so cute.

160
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,779
Sorry, but could you play along with us?

161
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,612
Until she gets over it, y'know.

162
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,302
I guess I could.

163
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,425
Think it'll take long?

164
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,489
Yes, I'm afraid so.

165
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:47,406
I'm not looking for a refrain dealer!

166
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:50,512
I said, a Chinese guy named Mao, did you hear me?!

167
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:52,370
Believe me, I have no idea.

168
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,937
The only Chinese around here are pushers or gang labor!

169
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,843
Go ask the cops or something!

170
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,191
I don't like cops!

171
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,731
Then ask the Black Knights about him!

172
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:02,090
They're all over the underground;

173
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,074
they're wired into the settlement and the ghettos.

174
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,185
Everyone tells me the same thing!

175
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,108
'Cause it's obvious!

176
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,635
Huh? That's strange!

177
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:14,381
Where is it?

178
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,865
What's the matter Shirley? what are you looking for?

179
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,682
My diary. It's gone. I can't find it anywhere.

180
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,108
Huh? Did you take it somewhere?

181
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:24,808
'Course not!

182
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,691
Right. I'm sorry, Zero.

183
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,716
We haven't found this Mao guy yet.

184
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,514
I see.

185
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,991
Should we check our contacts in the Kyoto network?

186
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,056
No, just stay with the Kanto block.

187
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,358
If you come up with any leads, let me know.

188
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:42,606
Yes, will do.

189
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,343
All right, I'll get back to you.

190
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:49,454
If I get within 500 meters of Mao, he can read my mind.

191
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,198
That's what he wants.

192
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,256
But knowing that, I should be able to guess his next move.

193
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:58,287
I could put him in check, if I just had one...

194
00:09:58,312 --> 00:09:59,752
Missing piece?

195
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,264
You and I are thinking exactly the same thing.

196
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,387
So it seems.

197
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,469
Then we should work together on this, don't you agree?

198
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,524
I do. Hm?

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,569
Hmph.

200
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,754
Yes?

201
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,200
It's me, Lulu!

202
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,400
C.C.'s there too, isn't she?

203
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:25,219
I want to talk to her alone. Put her on.

204
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,400
Are you waking up now?

205
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,665
Yes...

206
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:38,342
What were you doing in that place? Passed out like that?

207
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,831
What's your name?

208
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,461
I, uh... My name is...?

209
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,198
What is my name?

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,019
You don't remember?!

211
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,911
What about Zero? You were talking about him before!

212
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:51,965
Who's Zero?

213
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:57,009
What am I doing?! I practically betray him, and why?!

214
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,619
But I don't know anything...

215
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:01,957
...nothing at all.

216
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:03,209
Uh... Sorry.

217
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,877
I was able to undress you with my eyes closed,

218
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:08,227
but getting your clothes back on wasn't so...

219
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:11,959
But I turned up the heat, so I thought you'd be all right.

220
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,190
Mm. Thank goodness.

221
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:14,988
Uh?

222
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:16,957
Anyone could have picked me up out there,

223
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,524
but I got someone nice.

224
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,461
Huh?

225
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:24,202
You should be happy about this, Lelouch.

226
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,533
We're finally going our separate ways.

227
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,392
I made up with Mao.

228
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:30,186
You're betraying me?

229
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,142
Are you actually saying that?

230
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,842
When were you my friend? Never.

231
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,084
We were just co-conspirators that's all.

232
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:37,896
Wait!

233
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,759
Well, here's a surprise.

234
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,534
You sound just like Mao.

235
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,146
C.C...

236
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,891
You know way too much about me now.

237
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,327
I can't let you walk away like this.

238
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:52,724
Don't go!

239
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:55,582
C.C.! Stay here with me!

240
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,688
Geass does not work on me.

241
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,123
Didn't I mention that?

242
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,827
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about you.

243
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:11,323
You can keep your Geass, too.

244
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,407
And Mao won't bother you anymore.

245
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,300
He'll never cross your path...

246
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:18,961
So all your obstacles are gone: Congratulations.

247
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,357
And farewell.

248
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,900
The test results came out fine.

249
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:36,742
Though you seem to pay extreme attention to
discipline and to weighing the value of human life.

250
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,840
Is that going to cause problems?

251
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,396
These are positive traits for a soldier.

252
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,173
Do you think subconsciously,
you're comparing yourself to your father?

253
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:48,960
That may be the underlying cause of your insecurity.

254
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,773
It's quite common in the children of famous people.

255
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:55,765
Your father. Genbu Kururugi,
the former prime minister of Japan...

256
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,537
He was a great man.

257
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,527
Urabe and the others are late.

258
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:03,191
Well, this sure is an ironic meeting place, isn't it?

259
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,681
The grave of Prime Minister Kururugi.

260
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:08,547
The traitor who told us to fight to the end,

261
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,572
then committed suicide himself.

262
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,445
Enough.

263
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,973
General Katase also committed suicide,

264
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:16,002
and he was a true patriot.

265
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,440
Fugitive Tohdoh, identified.

266
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,389
All units, prepare to move in.

267
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,073
Yes, my lord.

268
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:28,516
Yes, I've read through your proposal
for reorganizing the Black Knights.

269
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,115
I've got a few changes,

270
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,239
but overall, I like where you're going with this.

271
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,308
I'll run it by Ohgi tomorrow.

272
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,920
Thanks, I appreciate that.

273
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,937
Next draft, I'd like you to insert a chart

274
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,854
that forecasts how the cell-based
structure will be implemented.

275
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,691
That's all.

276
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:47,000
So that was the final test; I guess I passed.

277
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,022
Diethard... Though he's Britannian,

278
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,425
he's proving even more useful than I'd hoped.

279
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,287
Still, he could be a spy; I can't rule that out yet.

280
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:56,400
Hm?

281
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,362
Right... It recorded them.

282
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,667
C.C.!

283
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,782
Your mind is so quiet!

284
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,174
It's the only one I can't read!

285
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:26,456
You really are the best there is!

286
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,534
As childish as ever, I see.

287
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,786
I'm a prince on a white stallion!

288
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:33,781
And a prince has to rescue the princess!

289
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,190
Does that make you happy, C.C.?

290
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:40,786
Mao, we talked about this before.

291
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:41,769
I told you that you and I...

292
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:43,794
Those were all lies... Lies!

293
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:46,682
C.C., you love me, and this is how I know...

294
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,386
Thank you, Mao.

295
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:50,373
Mao... Mao.

296
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:51,417
Stop it!

297
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:53,869
Be quiet!

298
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,740
Don't listen to them.

299
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,803
Just listen to the sound of my voice.

300
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,896
That's it...

301
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,205
Since my mind is the only one you can't read,

302
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,718
and you can only be happy when you're with me...

303
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,147
I will stay with you always.

304
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,449
Yes... I'm right here.

305
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,644
So you don't need to worry.

306
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:18,387
C.C., you're the only one!

307
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:20,773
The only one I want, forever!

308
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,674
Lelouch doesn't matter at all.

309
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,127
If you just come with me...

310
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,170
Stop it!

311
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,665
I should have done this a long, long time ago!

312
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:36,023
It's me, C.C.

313
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:37,175
Mao.

314
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:40,023
I'll be at Clovisland. Come alone.

315
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:43,588
Ugh, You're as selfish as ever, I see.

316
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,817
If you don't come,

317
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:47,616
I'll just have to tell the police who Lelouch really is.

318
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,472
I can have him eliminated any time I want.

319
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,865
You should be happy about this, Lelouch.

320
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,901
We're finally going our separate ways.

321
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,978
She comes and goes like the wind.

322
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,238
I can't read her.

323
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,085
I can't fathom how such a twisted girl thinks.

324
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:04,580
Idiot!

325
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,877
I knew it! I knew you couldn't pull the trigger!

326
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:11,189
That's 'cause you really love me, C.C.!

327
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:16,267
You're wrong! I was just using you right from the start!

328
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,140
What are you saying?

329
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,282
You shouldn't tell lies like that, you really shouldn't.

330
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,445
Lies are very, very wicked!

331
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:24,482
Wicked lies!

332
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:27,612
Don't worry.

333
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,579
I understand!

334
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,254
C.C., you must listen to me.

335
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,117
I've built a big, brand new house in Australia.

336
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,598
A very quiet, white, immaculate special house.

337
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:45,048
But to get to Australia, you'll need to take an airplane,

338
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,099
and there isn't very much room.

339
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,515
The thing is, C.C.,

340
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,034
you're a little too big to bring on a plane.

341
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,078
So, that's why...

342
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm going to make you compact!

343
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,074
It'll take no time at all!

344
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,546
Is this your revenge?

345
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:04,882
You're punishing me?

346
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,861
Oh, no. I'm not.

347
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,323
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not at all!

348
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,624
I'm showing you my gratitude!

349
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:13,948
So this is the place that you picked.

350
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:17,395
A place where there'd be
no one else's thoughts to bother you.

351
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,690
That narrowed it way down.

352
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:20,753
Lelouch!

353
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,551
Since your Geass has a total maximum range of 500 meters,

354
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,005
it can't reach me here at Tokyo Tower.

355
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,972
That's true, that's very true!

356
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,933
But what can you do from so far away, hm?

357
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:37,265
After taking all that trouble to hack into the system,

358
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,860
what's your grand plan?

359
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,517
A remote control attack with some battery-operated toys?

360
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:45,657
Or a tongue lashing to lecture me into submission?

361
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:49,264
Aah, cat got your tongue now.

362
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,632
If you want C.C., then you're gonna have to come...

363
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:55,436
Mao, think! You don't believe
C.C. is her real name, do you?

364
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,518
She never even whispers it to anyone.

365
00:17:58,805 --> 00:17:59,511
Huh...?

366
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,626
But I know it, though. She told me her true name.

367
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:09,612
Is that right, C.C.?

368
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,263
You never told me, ever, ever!

369
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,091
But you told it to him?!

370
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,625
You know why?

371
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,663
Because C.C. is mine.

372
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,324
C.C. belongs to me, in every possible way.

373
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,141
No! She doesn't!

374
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,827
She doesn't, she doesn't, she doesn't!

375
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,816
She was mine long before she met you!

376
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,588
I have gained every single thing from her,

377
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,774
including all of the parts that YOU have never seen.

378
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,972
All of them.

379
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,381
Lelouch...!

380
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,340
Face me!

381
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,245
Lelouch! Come here!

382
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,895
Come here so I can look into your mind!

383
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,095
I'll see the truth.

384
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,061
I'll see what a liar you are!

385
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,419
Liar!

386
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:52,114
Mao... You've lost.

387
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,438
What are you talking about?!

388
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:57,115
I don't care; I'm gonna to be with C.C.!

389
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,286
Is that Lelouch?

390
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,466
But he's too far away...

391
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,011
Sounds! Everywhere!

392
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:13,889
All those voices!

393
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,350
Hold it right there!

394
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,034
Drop the weapon and surrender!

395
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,815
What are they doing here?!

396
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,923
Remain where you are!

397
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:24,384
Drop down your weapon and raise your hands!

398
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,104
It's the police!

399
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,271
Who contacted them?!

400
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,936
Lelouch! What are you doing here?

401
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,032
It can't be!

402
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:42,115
He was just at Tokyo Tower, he can't be here now!

403
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,948
Are you that slow?

404
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:46,840
That was all a recording.

405
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,061
That's a lie!

406
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,048
You... You were talking to me! Answering me!

407
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,817
Your thoughts are simple.

408
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,609
Since you read minds, you've never resorted to cunning.

409
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,842
You predicted every one of my answers?!

410
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:59,811
Don't play games with me, punk!

411
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,540
If these cops arrest me, I'll be back out in a heartbeat!

412
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:14,294
Shut up! Just stop taunting me!

413
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,861
C.C. told me you can't turn off your Geass.

414
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,477
And your reach is erratic.

415
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:22,671
If you don't concentrate, the range gets very short.

416
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,879
So you used the monitor to keep me distracted?

417
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:27,213
Even so...

418
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:30,402
I can still defeat you; I'll have you ruined!

419
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:33,631
The moment you try is the moment you die.

420
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,447
Lelouch, wait! If I talk to him, I can get through!

421
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,088
You think I'll die?!

422
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,759
Listen, cops, you know who that guy is?!

423
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,677
He's the terrorist you want!

424
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:43,157
He's...

425
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,182
Fire!

426
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:48,692
Oh, Mao!

427
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:52,602
Zero...

428
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:59,957
Mao was only 6 years old
when I made my contract with him.

429
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,009
He was an orphan who'd never known the love of a parent.

430
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,304
He couldn't read or write.

431
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,496
And he knew nothing of good and evil.

432
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:08,438
This is Echo-3.

433
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:11,015
I've released the hostage into the ghetto as ordered.

434
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,609
What? Your orders were to take her to the hospital!

435
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,713
When I gave the Geass power to Mao, it isolated him.

436
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,094
In his mind, I became his only friend and his lover,

437
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,677
though I was still a perfect stranger.

438
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:28,588
I'm the only one he even thought of as human.

439
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,594
I was Mao's entire world.

440
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,198
C.C...

441
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:37,211
Listen to me, I won't let Geass destroy me.

442
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:40,427
I will conquer its power and bend it to my will...

443
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:42,938
And use it to change the world.

444
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:46,350
I'll fulfill your desire and my own.

445
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:50,623
And I will complete the contract that he couldn't achieve.

446
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:51,722
So, please...

447
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:53,071
Lelouch, tell me.

448
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,471
Are you trying to comfort me?

449
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,852
Pity me?

450
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,965
Or is this part of your obsession?

451
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:03,413
It's a contract.

452
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,300
This time, it's from me to you.

453
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:11,511
Very well, then. I accept your contract.

454
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,390
Now is the time to move forward!

455
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,811
To smash Cornelia and get the truth!

456
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,482
And to make a place for Nunnally in this world.

457
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:59,232
These tiny battlefields are meaningless now!

458
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,493
We're taking over the Tokyo Settlement!

459
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,076
We'll expand our military might and extend our contacts.

460
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:07,426
I'll use every piece in the game.
