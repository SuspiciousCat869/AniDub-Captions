1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:08,285
Lelouch, a young outcast prince of
Brittania, possesses two great powers:

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,038
One of them is Geass.

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:14,175
The absolute ability to compel any
person to do whatever he commands.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:16,011
The other is the Black Knights.

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:21,716
His military force assembled with the intent of
destroying the Brittanian Empire ruled by his father.

6
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:26,226
Veiling his true identity behind
a mask, and the code name "Zero,".

7
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,461
Lelouch has made his move to avenge his mother's murder

8
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:33,781
and to create a world in which his
younger sister, Nunnally, can find happiness.

9
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:36,585
What will the be the final outcome of these actions?

10
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,417
At this point... no one can predict.

11
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:18,296
...clearing the last of the debris from
around the Lake Kawaguchi Convention Center Hotel.

12
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:21,151
It's been two weeks since Zero unveiled his Black Knights,

13
00:02:21,176 --> 00:02:24,176
but there's still little insight
into the man behind the mask.

14
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,145
They weren't able to track his escape route?

15
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:29,355
They let the hostages go and
somehow made it to the other shore.

16
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,213
Unh! Kallen... I mean Miss.

17
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:46,595
Forgive me. I didn't wish to wake you...

18
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,459
Again?

19
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,676
I'm sorry, it was the step ladder this time, it broke...

20
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,987
Well, just get it cleaned up!

21
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,588
And be quick about it, I have to leave for school.

22
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:55,522
Mistress...

23
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:57,915
You've been attending school quite a bit lately.

24
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,078
Making any friends there?

25
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:01,308
I don't see how that's any of your business!

26
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,794
Just go, will you...?

27
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,485
I know it's for welfare,

28
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,901
but why waste it on the Elevens?

29
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,435
That's why I'm selling it to you, my friend.

30
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,164
The Eleven population could use a
little thinning out, if you ask me...

31
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:29,885
Your payment'll be transferred to your wife's account.

32
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,741
Princess Cornelia is a soldier.

33
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,404
This sort of thing doesn't interest her all that much.

34
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,254
Hit the lights! Turn 'em on!

35
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,377
You're... You're the...!

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,893
The Black Knights!

37
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:51,873
Huh?

38
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,624
That's not like you, dozing off in class like that!

39
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,150
Well... I, uh...

40
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,512
You could learn a thing or two from Lelouch.

41
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,762
He's an expert at sleeping in class.

42
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,339
Huh? He's not sleeping now, is he?

43
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,961
I dunno what he's up to, night after night,

44
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,841
but he sleeps through about half of 'em these days.

45
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:20,532
The E.U.'s starting an offensive
along the El Alamein front.

46
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,255
We can't go on dragging our feet around here.

47
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,748
I want to solidify domestic affairs.

48
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:29,287
It's high time Area 11 was made a satellite nation.

49
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,854
For that to happen, we need to
stamp out terrorism, of course.

50
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,323
But another major problem is the rampant
abuse of "Refrain" amongst the Elevens.

51
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,157
Productivity is plummeting.

52
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:43,102
It's coming in on the Chinese Frederation's Kyushu route.

53
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:44,648
We have to put an end to it.

54
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,852
Yes. But be careful.

55
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:47,736
You as well.

56
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:49,623
I don't want you leaving the settlement.

57
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,554
Cornelia... What about the Black Knights and Zero?

58
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,641
I'll let them roam free a bit longer.

59
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,871
I owe them that for saving your life.

60
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,422
However, upon my return...

61
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,227
Once I've cleaned up this area, I'm entrusting it to you.

62
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,742
Try to stay out of harm's way from now on.

63
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:10,263
All right, Euphie?

64
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:16,731
Because Clovis was an offspring of the Britannian emperor.

65
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,116
That reminds me...

66
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,686
You're one of his children, too, aren't you?

67
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:24,415
But I suppose for now...

68
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:28,461
When he spoke to me that night...

69
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,275
...what was he alluding to?

70
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:35,104
Suzaku... What would you make of all this?

71
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,052
About what Zero is doing...

72
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,202
And of me.

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,633
Man, this double life sure is a killer...

74
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,598
C'mon, Suzaku, hold him down!

75
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,578
Dammit, Suzaku, cut it out!

76
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,344
Stop it! I'm not kidding!

77
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,950
Sorry, Lelouch, but it's the president's orders.

78
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,815
Yeah, like you're not enjoying this at all?!

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,416
Will you hold still?

80
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,675
Huh? Good meowning!

81
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,909
Good... morning, I guess...

82
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:03,427
Huh?

83
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:04,909
What is all this?

84
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,852
Whaddya mean, didn't we tell you?

85
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,952
It's our welcome party for Arthur.

86
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,498
Sounds like fun...

87
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:13,234
Well, classes are postponed, we
might as well have some fun, right?

88
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,086
I set some stuff aside for you.

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,375
Over here!

90
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
To make up for all my getting so upset before.

91
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:19,841
Take your pick!

92
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,138
What? For me?

93
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,767
She doesn't need a costume.

94
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:23,291
Wha...?

95
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,594
You're already wearin' a mask, right?

96
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,587
You really are a riot, you know that?

97
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,342
You oughta be on television.

98
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,202
What do you think, Miss TV Star?

99
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,102
Oh, I thought she meant Lelouch.

100
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,067
Would you quit joking about that?

101
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,473
The whole thing's a huge pain in the butt!

102
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,003
We've been hounded with questions day and night!

103
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,057
Even in the bath!

104
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,388
We haven't been able to leave school grounds in a week.

105
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:50,790
Not that I don't feel for you, but I
don't see why we can't leave either!

106
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,731
Hmm, that's the price of friendship!

107
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,375
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

108
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,166
"It matters not that we were born apart,

109
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:58,360
upon this day we die as one."

110
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,044
Is that you're idea of a love quote?

111
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,894
If I go down, then we all do.

112
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,975
That's a little dark. Right, Suzaku? Huh?

113
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,389
I'm glad...

114
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,402
...that we could all be together again...

115
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,661
Ya know, like this...

116
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,853
Come onnn...

117
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,641
Hey! We're s'posed to be unwinding in here!

118
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,371
That's what's so refreshing about Suzaku though!

119
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:23,655
Yeah. Though once in a while, you
just want him to get a clue, ya know?

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,090
Oh. Sowwy 'bowt dat.

121
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,878
Ah, you love it, Putty-Tat.

122
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:31,077
It's so funny to think I helped save their lives...

123
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,047
Ever since we made our big splash at the hoteljacking,

124
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:37,802
the Black Knights have taken the world by storm.

125
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,150
We've become a friend to the weak,

126
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:42,536
just as Zero proclaimed we would.

127
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:46,994
Terrorists who involve civilians, overbearing military,

128
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:50,614
criminal syndicates, corrupt politicians and profiteers...

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,995
If the law would not punish them, then we would.

130
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:57,835
In the blink of an eye, we'd become heroes.

131
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,666
Support for us has swelled,

132
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:02,533
and we've even gotten our hands on some Knightmares again.

133
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,522
Of course, no one could show that in public...

134
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:06,919
because...

135
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,596
Stop pretending you're a Black Knight!

136
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:10,617
But why?!

137
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,194
You musn't ever say anything against Britannia!

138
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,210
We're Elevens, have you forgotten that?!

139
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,989
...because our leader, Zero, had killed Prince Clovis.

140
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,977
There are many in our ranks who
wish to know his true identity,

141
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,421
myself included.

142
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,256
But if we push too hard, I suspect that he would vanish...

143
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,309
And without him...

144
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,077
...I'm fairly certain we'd be finished.

145
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:35,023
Hey there, pal.

146
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,815
Haven't seen ya much lately.

147
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,140
Really?

148
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,098
Yeah, really.

149
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:47,841
Are you all right, young lady?

150
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:55,095
Why would the masses flock
around those who saved Euphemia?

151
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,945
Even Kyoto has said that they would
send the Black Knights the Guren MK-II.

152
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,415
To those would-be Robin Hoods?

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,077
They're not part of the resistance.

154
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:05,129
Killing Kusakabe was proof of that.

155
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,286
The colonel killed himself, didn't he?

156
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:09,520
Well, I hear they didn't try to stop him.

157
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:13,051
In any case, Lt. Colonel Tohdoh, we can't let this stand.

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,393
Mistress Kallen!

159
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:21,607
Mistress Kallen!

160
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,302
Madame President?

161
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,236
I just dropped by to give you something.

162
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:26,818
Huh...?

163
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,373
Where would you like me to show her to?

164
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,011
The parlor perhaps? Or maybe...

165
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,325
We'll be in my room.

166
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,267
As you wish.

167
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:37,360
Oh. I heard you had a friend down here.

168
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,179
I was sure it would be a boy.

169
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,121
Out all night and missing school,

170
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,325
not to mention all your visits to the ghetto...

171
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:46,064
You're lucky your father's back in the homeland.

172
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,056
No fighting one's blood, is there?

173
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,955
You're the one who's enjoying Dad
not being around here. Aren't you?!

174
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,851
Oh, dear, what have I done?

175
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,831
What's wrong with you?!

176
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:03,790
Forgive me, milady.

177
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,687
Forgive me...

178
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,494
Can't you do anything right?

179
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:08,775
Besides selling your body, that is...

180
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,908
Quite the complicated home life you have, isn't it?

181
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,186
So what was it you wantd to give me?

182
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,221
Grandfather asked me to pass this on.

183
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,570
You mean the principal?

184
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,127
Your transcripts since middle school.

185
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:25,026
I thought I'd better give them
to you off of school grounds.

186
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,618
So my secret's out then.

187
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:28,922
Isn't it?

188
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:32,299
That I'm actually an Eleven and Brittanian half-breed.

189
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,545
That was my stepmother down there.

190
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,644
My real mother was that clod of
a maid who knocked over the vase.

191
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,200
And your father...

192
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,480
Is he the head of the Stadtfeld family?

193
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:47,750
My mother is such a fool...

194
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,196
In the end, she wound up a servant.

195
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,723
She doesn't have any real skills,

196
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,578
and no matter who's ridiculing her,

197
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,558
all she can do is laugh like it's nothing.

198
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:59,622
She didn't have to choose to stay in this house, ya know?

199
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:02,462
She just clinging to some old lover who's jilted her...

200
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:05,067
You really hate your mother, don't you?

201
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,811
I just find her depressing...

202
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,767
Wow, this is getting a little heavy.

203
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,753
Imagine, the wife, and the daughter,
and the "other woman," all living together.

204
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,045
Ah, it could be worse.

205
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,837
Three square meals and a roof, right?

206
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,274
I mean, it's not unbearable...

207
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,015
Most of the time, anyway...

208
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,022
That's good.

209
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,654
Still... some things in life
we can bear on our own, but...

210
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:28,413
when you add 'em all up, they eventually break you.

211
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:31,429
Oh, don't worry.

212
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,912
I won't lie, I'm always hungry for secrets.

213
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:36,095
But I'd never talk about this.

214
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,874
I can't believe you teared up...

215
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,034
It's so embarrassing..

216
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,480
It's called "honesty."

217
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,392
Well, good thing the Black Nights were there to save 'em.

218
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,845
That's all I can say.

219
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,865
If they wanted to catch criminals, they
could've joined the police force, ya know?

220
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,422
Why don't they, I wonder...

221
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,536
They probably don't think the cops are up to the job...

222
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,037
I tend to agree...

223
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,318
The police may not be that effective right now,

224
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,170
but they could evoke change from within!

225
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:26,304
Yeah, and in the process they get all
tangled up in red tape and bureaucracy.

226
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,431
If they had done everything in their
power to change things, that might hold water!

227
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:34,112
As long as they don't, then all of
it's just self-righteous posturing!

228
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,693
Self-righteous?

229
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,159
And what constitutes "evil" in their eyes?

230
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:39,725
What standards are they using?

231
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,551
It's noting but self-satisfying gratification.

232
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:46,851
Oh? It's just you two?

233
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:49,223
Anyway.

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,853
I guess I've gotta go back to the base pretty soon.

235
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:52,864
See you around, Shirley.

236
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:53,952
Uh, ah...

237
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:55,726
See ya later!

238
00:12:58,364 --> 00:12:58,891
Hmph.

239
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,119
So, Lulu!

240
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,666
I was, um...

241
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:13,855
I was thinking, if you had some time, You and I...

242
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,188
"Back" to base, now that was
an interesting choice of words...

243
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,191
Go back...

244
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,500
Implying that's where he thinks he belongs.

245
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,262
Refrain?

246
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,737
It's a psychotropic.

247
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,880
Makes ya think you've gone back to the past.

248
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,262
Must be all the rage here in Japan...

249
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:30,791
Yeah, well...

250
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,165
Who doesn't long for the days
before the occupation, right?

251
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,470
This stuff was specifically targeted at the Japanese.

252
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,937
We can't very well ignore it.

253
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:42,729
Soon as the Burais are stocked, we move.

254
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,732
Supplies keep rolling in.

255
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:47,143
And I hear lots of people are ready to join us...

256
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,341
Black Knights sure are popular, huh?

257
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,664
Well, we are the heroic Knights for Justice.

258
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,564
I'll call ya when the ammo gets here.

259
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,495
C'mon, Eleven! Say something!

260
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,287
You are sorry, aren'tcha?!

261
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:03,018
Bowin' your heads is what you Elevens do best, right?!

262
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:03,768
Eleven...

263
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,201
Eating bad food really makes us want to off somebody!

264
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:07,040
Lelouch!

265
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:08,878
No, there're five of them.

266
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:10,476
You wouldn't stand a chance at all.

267
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,374
So you think I should just ignore it?!

268
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:14,428
Go on, take a good look at that Eleven.

269
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,732
C'mon, what's the matter?! Aren'tcha gonna cry?

270
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:17,737
C'mon, buddy! Just say you're sorry!

271
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:19,791
If we intervene and help him win,

272
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,244
he wouldn't be able to sell a thing tomorrow.

273
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:25,730
It was his choice to become a Britanninan slave.

274
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:29,514
That's just the price you pay
for working in the settlement.

275
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,806
Well even so...

276
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,493
You got a problem over there?

277
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,830
Not feelin' sorry for this Eleven, are ya?

278
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:37,855
Nah, they feel the same way we do, don'tcha guys?

279
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,886
Not quite.

280
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,843
But you're tired of beating up Elevens now, aren't you?

281
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,012
Yeeah, this is boring.

282
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:51,666
You guys wanna hit the arcade?

283
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,146
I got no cash!

284
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:55,564
Well, they got bored pretty quick, huh?

285
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:56,265
Oh...

286
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,024
Hey, are you all right?

287
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,713
Huh...? A Britannian student!

288
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,855
Wh-What can I get for you?

289
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,409
How about a nice California hotdog, miss?

290
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,326
Ah! I-Is this your boyfriend?!

291
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:12,893
I can get him something, too!

292
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,757
I have ice cream, if you like!

293
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,238
In some ways,

294
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:19,343
Area 11 is better off now than the old Japan ever was.

295
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:24,460
Being made a colony of the empire has stablized
its military and economic position in the world.

296
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:29,107
Elevens can even attain full
citizenship through the legal process.

297
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,289
It's easy to become an honrary Britannian.

298
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,768
Just a question of pride really.

299
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:36,670
Though, I can certainly understand why they'd resist...

300
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,220
And?

301
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:39,159
Hmm?

302
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,279
Knowing all that,

303
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:42,810
what does Lelouch Lamperouge think about it all?

304
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:44,562
What do you wanna do?

305
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,649
Nothing.

306
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,579
You know, you've got a lot of brains

307
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,562
but you don't seem to be doing much with them.

308
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,187
It's all Shirley talks about.

309
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:54,897
Saying how intelligent you are, but
how you barely ever apply yourself.

310
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,759
That's why I don't do anything.

311
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,942
That Eleven we saw back there could tell you.

312
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,374
He can lead a better life, as long
as he bows his head to Britannina.

313
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,817
You must think you're pretty cool, huh?!

314
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:13,687
Just playing the critic and
judging the world from the sidelines?!

315
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,950
Guess I was a fool to expect anything more from you.

316
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,478
You know, I really thought
you were a better man than this!

317
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:24,659
Hmph.

318
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,194
So, about this Orange thing...

319
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,176
Sorry to bring it up.

320
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,455
Is this whole thing true, though?

321
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,666
That you can't remember anything about
when Private Suzaku Kururugi was taken?

322
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,568
I don't expect you to believe me.

323
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,323
No, it's just that...

324
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,057
During the whole Shinjuku incident,

325
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,459
I suffered some sort of memory lapse also.

326
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,152
You did?

327
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:53,036
By the time I regained my senses,
my Sutherland had been stolen.

328
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,732
But right before that entire gap in my memory,

329
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:57,933
I remember running into some high school kid.

330
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,791
So what you think it was that student?

331
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,503
I can't remember his face,

332
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:04,251
but there may still be a way to get to the bottom of this.

333
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,845
What the hell is Zero thinking?

334
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,375
After all his talk about bringing down Britannia,

335
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,953
he's just got us running around helping the police.

336
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,172
Still feels pretty good to have the
will of the people behind us though.

337
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,550
Yeah, he's right. We're totally heroes on the net.

338
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:22,601
Are we in the right? I don't know anymore.

339
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:23,889
Kallen...

340
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,551
There's the signal from Zero!

341
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,359
I can't believe he got in there.

342
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,444
How many tricks does this guy have up his sleeve anyway?

343
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:39,055
Is the shipment for Nagoya ready?

344
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,274
Nice 'n safe here in the settlement, huh?

345
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,713
The Black Knights have arrived!

346
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,234
Intruders!

347
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:52,949
A Knightmare!

348
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:54,213
Screw this!

349
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,226
These Knightmares really are amazing.

350
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,286
Each one is an army unto itself!

351
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,485
Japan! Japan! Japan!

352
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,794
That's right! I'm getting married next month!

353
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,051
I've been promoted.

354
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,170
I'm going to the Paris office!

355
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,107
You'll see the fireworks with me, right?

356
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,215
Leave it to us!

357
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,782
Japan is on the vanguard of technology!

358
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:22,940
Refrain...

359
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,692
I'm studying abroad! I can't believe I got in!

360
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:30,102
When you add 'em all up, they eventually break you.

361
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,138
That's right. Which is why I'm here!

362
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:35,880
Careful! It's dangerous to run like that!

363
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:40,778
Mother?!

364
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,331
Really, Naoto!

365
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:51,178
Please, I need you to keep an eye on your little sister.

366
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,972
My god how weak a woman are you, Mother?

367
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,614
First you give in to Britannia,
then to a man, and now this!

368
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,664
My brother is gone forever!

369
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:01,590
Let him go!

370
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,949
The Knightpolice?!

371
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:11,418
Isn't that a police unit?

372
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,191
They're in on this deal? Tamaki!

373
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:13,904
Don't look at me!

374
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,310
When I checked it out, there weren't any cops involved!

375
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,839
Corrupted filth!

376
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,466
You're in the way!

377
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,220
Dammit! I don't need you!

378
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:38,590
I don't want you!

379
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,985
Kallen... Naoto...

380
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,266
It won't work on a Knightmare!

381
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,087
Go on... run!

382
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,948
Get moving, you idiot!

383
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:10,951
I'm here for you.

384
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,510
I'm here for you, Kallen...

385
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,226
I'm here, as I always have been.

386
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:20,484
Then that's...

387
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,695
That's why you stayed in his house?!

388
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,684
You stayed there for me...?

389
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,319
You fool!

390
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,910
Or maybe, I'm the fool.

391
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,468
Kallen!

392
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:00,690
I'm so happy for you.

393
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:03,803
You can finally become a Britannian now, Kallen.

394
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,965
Nobody will ever be able to hurt you now, darling.

395
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,081
And you're free to travel and
use the phone any time you want.

396
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,645
So this... is her mother?

397
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:18,408
False tears bring pain to those around you.

398
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:21,520
A false smile brings pain to oneself.

399
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,394
It's an aftereffect of refrain.

400
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,110
She's unable to talk much.

401
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,560
She'll recover eventually, but it will take time.

402
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:37,822
Mother, your sentence... You got twenty years.

403
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:41,552
But you wait!

404
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:45,035
I'm working to change things
when you get out, I swear to you!

405
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:48,552
I'll make a world where you and
I can live a normal life again.

406
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:51,048
So, please... Mother...!

407
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:56,139
Hang in there...

408
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,010
Huh?

409
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,138
Hang in there, Kallen...

410
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,342
My little girl...

411
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,233
Don't you worry.

412
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,543
I will. I promise you!

413
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,236
Memories of the past?

414
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,584
Those who indulge in them are foolishly happy...

415
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,054
because they assume that tomorrow is coming...

416
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:59,027
But really... what guarantee is there of that?

417
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:02,213
If Kallen is struggling to dispel such illusions...

418
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:03,468
I'll stand by her.

419
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:07,586
All we can do is live each day, one moment at a time.
