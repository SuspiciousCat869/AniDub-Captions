1
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:04,691
Lelouch, a youth of Brittania,

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:08,024
had been granted special abilities by a mysterious girl.

3
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:09,267
Geass.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:13,144
The power to command others. To do absolutely anything.

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:20,218
And Lelouch is determined to use that power
to bring the Britannian Empire to its knees,

6
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:22,872
to avenge his mother, and create a world

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,012
where his younger sister Nunnally can find happiness.

8
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,855
All the while knowing at the end of his quest,

9
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,891
the Britannian Emperor, his father, awaits.

10
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,058
Or at least.

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,502
that was the hope Lelouch carried in his heart back then.

12
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,692
Do you know anything about this weapon,

13
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,811
Suzaku Kururugi?

14
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,805
It was the one used to rob Prince Clovis of his life.

15
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,920
The barrel striations leave no doubt.

16
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:25,537
And we've done a little homework on you as well.

17
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:29,991
You're the eldest child of Japan's
last acting Prime Minister, are you not?

18
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,603
Your motive here is clear.

19
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,355
You're making a mistake.

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,504
I have never even laid eyes on that gun.

21
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,325
We found your fingerprints all over this weapon.

22
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:43,555
You're also suspected of
murdering members of the Royal Guard.

23
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:47,262
Come clean now, and you'll be judged
as though you were born a Britannian,

24
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,665
not some worthless Eleven.

25
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,221
You're wrong! I've done nothing!

26
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,387
That was Suzaku they mentioned on the news, wasn't it?

27
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:58,771
Yep. It looks like he's still alive.

28
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:00,751
Yeah. It's been ages.

29
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,943
We haven't seen him since the war ended.

30
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:03,856
Even we...

31
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:06,914
And, Lelouch?

32
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:07,705
What is it?

33
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,153
It wasn't true what the news said, was it?

34
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:10,871
Of course not.

35
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,945
Suzaku would never do anything like that.

36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,320
They've just made a mistake.

37
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,443
Yeah... Must be.

38
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:22,084
Right. Well... Good night, Nunnally.

39
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,801
That's why we should've issued
a friggin' statement sooner!

40
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,651
We could've taken credit for it!

41
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:35,977
Naoto... I'm not cut out for this.

42
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,507
I'm no leader...

43
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,704
Yes, everything is just as you requested.

44
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,247
We have the best in the business working on it.

45
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:47,316
Once the slide system is in order, it's all yours.

46
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,211
Once I've erased all of the evidence, I
should forget this ever happened, right?

47
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:57,709
Truly this has been a painful incident for all.

48
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:04,100
The Viceroy of Area 11, our beloved
Prince Clovis, has been lost to us forever.

49
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:08,573
However, we can and will bear the weight of this tragedy.

50
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,840
And from this darkest of hours, draw strength.

51
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,333
We've lose the most crucial part of the equation...

52
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,756
Can we do it without him?

53
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,388
Don't I wish.

54
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:21,448
The other units never let go of a good pilot.

55
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:24,712
And even if we got one, they'd never match his readings...

56
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,364
His operational efficiciency clocked in at 94%!

57
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,759
And you wanna replace him?

58
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,708
You should tell them that, perhaps they'll let Suzaku go.

59
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,383
He's an honorary Britannian, they'd never listen.

60
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,868
Ever since General Bartley's disgrace, the
purebloods have the military in an iron grip.

61
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,041
The purebloods what?

62
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:44,007
Well, from what I understand, they're
saying that only pureblood Britannians

63
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:45,726
should be allowed to serve in the military.

64
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:49,538
Their view is, one of their own can never be a criminal.

65
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:52,426
But if the criminal is an Eleven,

66
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:58,427
it paves the way for Margrave Jeremiah to shut
down the practice of granting natives Honorary status.

67
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:00,616
And what of Suzaku?

68
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,965
His fate's all but decided.

69
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,408
Hey, Lelouch, you got anything goin' on later?

70
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,776
After all, classes have been canceled for the day.

71
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,697
Folks have been askin' for a rematch!

72
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:12,428
You are not gambling, you guys!

73
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,237
C'mon, don't be such a stick in the mud.

74
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:16,290
She's right, though, maybe it's time to quit.

75
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:16,752
Huh?!

76
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,741
I've found a better opponent, actually.

77
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:20,856
You did? I don't get it?

78
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,506
You're cuttin' me in on the action too, right?!

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,800
Better not. It's not really up your alley.

80
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:34,073
Britannia's resounding victory over
Japan opened the unenlightened nation's eyes

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,708
to its true place in today's world order.

82
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:41,943
Since then, the Empire and Area 11 have
walked hand in hand down the road to revival.

83
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,343
Sixteen hundred hours at Tokyo Tower.

84
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:46,333
Why here of all places?

85
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,210
It was Kururugi who contacted us, wasn't it?

86
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,529
Hard to say.

87
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:53,992
Yeah, but he might have been arrested
after his communciation with Kallen.

88
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:56,225
Then we're in danger here, we should go...

89
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,883
Attention please.

90
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,350
Paging a Miss Kallen Stadtfeld of Ashford Academy.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,037
One of your personal effects has been turned in
at the kiosk on the observation deck. I repeat...

92
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,443
Hi, I'm assuming this phone is yours, ma'am.

93
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,199
Um, something wrong, it is yours, isn't it?

94
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,636
Uh... Yeah. Thank you so much.

95
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:20,533
Oh yeah, there's no debating it,

96
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:22,966
life is better here thanks to Prince Clovis.

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,978
I mean, it's all due to Britannia that
we could rebuild as quickly as we did.

98
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:27,799
I'm happy about that...

99
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:28,698
Zero?

100
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:33,952
Um... Hello?

101
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:37,158
I want you to board the outbound train on Loop Line 5.

102
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,311
And bring your friends.

103
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:38,901
What?!

104
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:42,796
You handled His Highness's memorial program very well.

105
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,233
A little too weepy for my tastes, but...

106
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:48,736
Yes, well, the masses tend to
like tearjerkers, Your Excellency.

107
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,867
Spoken like a true TV man.

108
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,685
Still, I have to acknowledge the finesse you've shown.

109
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:55,776
You did well in the short time you had.

110
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,574
One would almost think you were expecting

111
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,755
His Highness to meet his untimely end.

112
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:04,354
It's quite common for memorial programs
to be set in advance for important people.

113
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:06,291
Does that include me as well?

114
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,837
Recent events may've bumped you
up the list a bit, Your Excellency.

115
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,847
I wasn't deemed important enough till now, is that it?

116
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,444
How forthright of you.

117
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,938
I'm afraid so, sir.

118
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,301
Ever thought of enlisting?

119
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:19,216
The army could use more men like you.

120
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,267
I don't think it would be a very good fit.

121
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,787
Not really my cup of tea.

122
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,221
You prefer the civil sector, I take it?

123
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,907
No matter. I have another favor to ask of you.

124
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,991
Tomorrow night, Suzaku Kururugi will
be transferred to his court martial.

125
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,581
We should line the road with good, patriotic Britannians.

126
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:38,311
Excellent, you catch on quickly, don't you?

127
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,723
Be sure the rabble can see his face.

128
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,912
Lord Jeremiah.

129
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:45,822
There are those among the Elevens
who see Private Kururugi as a hero.

130
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:48,401
Some might very well make an attempt to free him.

131
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,112
I'll be there personally aboard my Sutherland.

132
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,937
If anyone even thinks of causing
trouble, they'll be executed on the spot!

133
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,705
Attention, all passengers.

134
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,972
If you become aware of any suspicious items onboard,

135
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:05,553
please alert metro personnel by using the nearest...

136
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,524
What now?

137
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:06,989
Uh.

138
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,596
Face forward and look to your right.

139
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:13,972
What do you see?

140
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:15,984
The Britannian city.

141
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:20,247
It was stolen away from us... and built on our sacrifice.

142
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,811
And on the left?

143
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:24,788
I see our city.

144
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:29,257
Remants of a desiccated city
after the Britannians sucked it dry.

145
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:30,571
Good answer.

146
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,694
Now make your way to the front of the train.

147
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,670
The next stop is Okubo. Okubo is next.

148
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:46,818
Those wishing to transfer to the Chuo Soubu Line
should exit at the next stop. Okubo will be next.

149
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:52,396
Once again, those wishing to transfer to the
Chuo Soubu Line should exit at the next stop.

150
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,769
Was it you... on the phone?

151
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,894
Whoa... Do you think it's a trap?

152
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,280
Well? Was that you in Shinjuku?

153
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,783
Was that cease-fire your doing?

154
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:17,024
Hey, we're talkin' to you!

155
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,288
What do you think of my tour of the settlement?

156
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,381
Your tour?

157
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:27,051
Aw, come on, there's no way it was this joker.

158
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,657
I wanted you to fully grasp the two.

159
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,063
The settlement and the ghetto.

160
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,365
Yeah, we know.

161
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,348
There's a difference between us and them.

162
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:36,944
A very harsh one.

163
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:38,710
And that's why we resist them.

164
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:39,672
You're wrong.

165
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:42,167
Britannia will not fall to terrorism.

166
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:43,642
Fall...?

167
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,497
It's little better than childish nuisance.

168
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:47,392
What was that?!

169
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:49,155
You callin' us a buncha kids?!

170
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,819
You should know your enemy.

171
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,385
It is not people... but Britannia itself!

172
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:57,751
It is a war you must wage, but not on the innocent!

173
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,818
Take up your sword! Fight for justice!

174
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:03,678
Heh... Oh, please.

175
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,664
That's all easy enough to say, isn't it?!

176
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,103
Hiding behind that mask.

177
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,676
Why should we even trust you?!

178
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:09,552
She's right!

179
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,901
Lose the mask!

180
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:13,574
Right. Are you going to show us your face or not?

181
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,639
Very well. I'll show you.

182
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,551
But rather than my face, bear witness to my power.

183
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,175
If I deliver to you the impossible,

184
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,592
then I might have earned your trust.

185
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,849
He killed a Prince of Britannia!

186
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:30,406
Suzaku Kururugi should be treated as a hero!

187
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,181
But he's an honorary Britannian!

188
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,347
Prime Minister Kururugi was his father!

189
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,080
So what!

190
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:36,603
The bastard gave up Japan!

191
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,351
Our people don't know that about him!

192
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:41,843
The whole Shinjuku business was the
work of Kouzuki's group, wasn't it?

193
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:45,057
Yes, sir, they're being led by
a man named Ohgi at the present.

194
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,004
Hmm...

195
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,101
Has Kururugi's family said anything?

196
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:52,522
No, sir, they broke contact with
him once he joined the military.

197
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,619
Tohdoh, what are your thoughts?

198
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:57,931
We should not become involved in this public execution.

199
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,975
That's cowardly.

200
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,037
You're Tohdoh the Miracle Worker, right?

201
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,235
There is a difference between miracles and foolhardiness.

202
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,062
Congratulations!

203
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:11,136
Those two you asked me about
weren't on the list of casualties.

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,351
That's good to hear...

205
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,980
Not much luck on your end though.

206
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,489
You may be getting a trial, but no
one is pulling for you, certainly.

207
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,698
But the courts are where truth comes to light.

208
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:24,126
I expect there'll be more smoke and mirrors than anything.

209
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,887
"The truth" is scarce of late...

210
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:28,068
If that's how the world works, then...

211
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,901
...so be it. I've no regret.

212
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,493
Any moment. Any moment now.

213
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:40,296
It's a sight to see.

214
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,760
The throngs lining the route.

215
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:44,027
All of them waiting on bated breath.

216
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:48,045
Waiting for the accused murderer
of Prince Clovis to pass by.

217
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,606
Honoary Britannian, and former Eleven, Suzaku Kururugi.

218
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,224
Camera five's a little slow.

219
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,580
Talk to me, Charles. Your team been deployed yet?

220
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,595
What? The studio? Let 'em wait.

221
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,709
Nothing's been pushed back,
everything's going according to plan.

222
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,164
Here we go.

223
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,367
I-I can see them!

224
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,541
They have the suspect!

225
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,945
Suzaku Kururugi is headed this way!

226
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,178
Like clockwork.

227
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,897
Heh. What a circus this is.

228
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,622
And I'm as corrupt as any of 'em.

229
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,214
This is insane. We know that Suzaku is innocent.

230
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,517
The court deemed our testimony inadmissible.

231
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,334
There's nothing we can do.

232
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:32,165
Yes, but...

233
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,847
Is that altruism or humanitarianism?

234
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:37,166
This isn't the time for a game in semantics!

235
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,512
Not much else to do.

236
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,436
We both know where this case is headed, don't we?

237
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,347
We couldn't reach him at the summit.

238
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,930
All we can do is cut our losses, really.

239
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,457
Voices of scorn, growing ever louder.

240
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:52,748
Voices bearing testament to a
people's love of their prince.

241
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,450
Raining their judgment down on a terrorist.

242
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,284
Suzaku!

243
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,083
Margrave Jeremiah,

244
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:05,555
integral in settling this case, will be
presiding over the trial as acting consul.

245
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:13,398
No way the three of 'em can pull this off on their own.

246
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:16,480
He told us...

247
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,605
He said he'd make the impossible possible...

248
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:24,424
He gave his word... to save Suzaku Kururugi.

249
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:29,089
Right. No need to turn back. The die is cast.

250
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,377
Acting Consul Jeremiah!

251
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:33,231
What is it?

252
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,614
Vehicle approaching the main highway from Third.

253
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,144
We just let it through, as you instructed, but...

254
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,108
Do you believe the target could be a terrorist vehicle?

255
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,045
Well, sir... it's Prince Clovis's car.

256
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,455
The prince's car?

257
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,608
Well, looks like we've got a comedian.

258
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:50,083
Don't worry about it, just let him through to us.

259
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,254
All forces, halt here!

260
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,837
Hey, they stopped, they really did.

261
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,389
It's just a coincidence.

262
00:13:56,414 --> 00:14:00,664
Yeah but he said Jerimiah would try to hog all
the limelight and make some sort of stand about it.

263
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:01,804
Coincidence!

264
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,461
This is not a scheduled stop.

265
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,538
Could there have been some sort of accident?

266
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,342
This is site five.

267
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,975
There's a vehicle approaching them.

268
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,316
Hmph.

269
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,503
It's... It's Prince Clovis's personal transport!

270
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,536
And it's heading straight for the cavalcade!

271
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:16,761
He's heading straight at 'em...

272
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,544
What's he planning?

273
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,747
Hope they can't tell it's fake...

274
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,647
I see. Just you two then.

275
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:33,084
I'm sorry, we just need a little more time.

276
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:34,673
If more people understood what we...

277
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:37,086
No, the two of you will do just fine.

278
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:40,743
Come on, that's ridiculous, there'll be too many of them!

279
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,393
With your help, clearing the
task at hand will be child's play.

280
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,243
I'll need this by tomorrow.

281
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,358
All that matters is the exterior...

282
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:54,335
You dare desecrate His Highness' transport?!

283
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,703
Come out of there!

284
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:00,723
Huh?

285
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:01,661
Huh?

286
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,243
I am...

287
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:04,389
...Zero!

288
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:05,516
Zero?

289
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,173
Wh-Who is this person.

290
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,030
This man calling himself Zero,

291
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,705
standing before a full military convoy?!

292
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,449
What is all this?

293
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,406
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

294
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:21,906
Who is this man calling himself Zero?!

295
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:22,792
Ladies and gentleman...

296
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,043
Zero? Whaddya mean, like "nothing"?

297
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,916
Are we gazing on a terrorist?

298
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,490
Certainly not the wisest if such is the case.

299
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,957
Is he... an Eleven?

300
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:34,667
Now to return the favor, Suzaku...

301
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:38,790
I've seen enough, Zero. This little show of yours is over!

302
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,649
First things first.

303
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Why don't you lose that mask?

304
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,271
What in the...?!

305
00:15:58,296 --> 00:15:59,842
Lord Jeremiah, be careful, he's got the...!

306
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,439
Yes, Jeremiah...

307
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:06,206
You never saw inside this thing,
so you assume it holds poison gas.

308
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,944
Wait, you don't understand... Ah!

309
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,846
Can all of you watching at home see this?

310
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,302
It's some sort of device,

311
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:13,944
although it's purpose is unclear.

312
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:18,136
Stay with us, and we'll see if this
so-called terrorist has anything to say.

313
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,929
You... bastard...

314
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:24,053
He's taken every Britannian here hostage.

315
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:27,356
And he's done it without them even knowing it!

316
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:30,517
You intend to shoot?

317
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,161
I think you know full well what...

318
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,795
Unit six, bring up the sound!

319
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,868
And get that camera right in his face!

320
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,913
Sir, it's too hairy out here.

321
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:39,707
Amateurs.

322
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,896
Fine. What are your demands?

323
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,670
An exchange. This for Kururugi.

324
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:48,110
Like hell!

325
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,467
He's charged with high treason for murdering a prince!

326
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:52,971
I can't hand him over!

327
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,959
No. You're mistaken, Jeremiah.

328
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,645
He's no murder...

329
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,154
The man who killed Clovis...

330
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,027
...was myself!

331
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:07,608
Ah-ha.

332
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,669
Unbelievable!

333
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,245
The real culprit, eh?

334
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,832
What? Wh-What does this mean?!

335
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,616
This masked man called Zero...

336
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,364
No, we can't be sure who he is.

337
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,451
But in any case...

338
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,465
...he claims to be the real assassin!

339
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:22,089
So, where does this leave the
current suspect, Private Kururugi?

340
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,908
Ah, crap, there's no way outta this!

341
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,430
We are so screwed.

342
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,000
For a single Eleven,

343
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,890
you'll save scores of precious Britannians.

344
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,474
I find that to be a bargain.

345
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:36,484
This is all one big performance to him!

346
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,087
He's mad, I tell you!

347
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,002
Disguising this truck as His Highness's!

348
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,355
He'll pay the price for mocking the crown!

349
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:43,372
Careful.

350
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:46,370
You don't wish the public to learn of "Orange," do you?

351
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,052
Huh?

352
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,790
Orange? What's he talkin' about?

353
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:49,547
I don't know.

354
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,490
If I die, it'll all go public.

355
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,406
If you don't want that to happen...

356
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:00,964
What are you talking about? What is this?!

357
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,456
You'll do everything in your power to let us go.

358
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,366
Your prisoner as well!

359
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,798
Right, understood.

360
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,701
You there, release the prisoner!

361
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,628
What on earth are you doing, my lord?!

362
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:22,324
Get that man over here!

363
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,017
Huh?!

364
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,497
Should we? But...

365
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,323
Hand him over! Nobody gets in his way!

366
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,729
No, what are you thinking?!

367
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,012
You can't do this!

368
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:32,353
Lord Kewell, this is an order!

369
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,196
It's hard to tell what's happening from here,

370
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,800
but it seems that Kururugi's release has been brokered!

371
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,358
So, who the hell are you... Uh!

372
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:50,464
As I thought, they didn't allow you to speak.

373
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:57,218
If they get away, we'll lose everything!

374
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:58,855
It's time to go, Zero.

375
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,086
Well then, till next time.

376
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:05,949
You cowardly Eleven!

377
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,807
Lord Jeremiah, what are you...?!

378
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:10,032
You heard me, stand down, now!

379
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,821
They're not alone at all! They jumped right off!

380
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,493
It worked! Now we can...

381
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,932
You imbecile! There's nowhere for you to run!

382
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,197
Lord Kewell!

383
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,337
Are you going to follow orders or not?!

384
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,931
And believe me, there will be repercussions.

385
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,349
All units, do I make myself clear?!

386
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,499
Do everything in your power to help them get away!

387
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,141
Man... I didn't really think he could do it.

388
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,166
Yeah, who is this guy?

389
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,483
That's crap!

390
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:52,211
How many times can a bluff like that work, anyway?

391
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:54,174
Ya gotta give the guy some credit, though.

392
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:54,652
Huh?

393
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,729
Gotta admit it, nobody else could 'a pulled that off.

394
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,126
Not the Japanese Liberation Front.

395
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:01,779
Certainly not me.

396
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:07,708
We've always thought that a full on war
with Britannia wasn't a possibility at all.

397
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:10,085
But maybe with him... it is.

398
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,244
It looks like they treated you rather roughly.

399
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,554
Now you know what they're really like, Private Kururugi.

400
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,711
Britannia is rotten.

401
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:24,372
If you wish to bring change to this world, then join me.

402
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:25,603
So is it true?

403
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:28,336
Are you really the one who killed Prince Clovis?

404
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:30,092
This is war.

405
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,861
Why wouldn't I kill an enemy commander?

406
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,846
And the gas? Those were civilians out there!

407
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:38,254
A bluff. To help things along.

408
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,434
The result: Not a single death.

409
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,534
The result?

410
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,418
That's all that matters to you, I suppose.

411
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:45,431
Hmph.

412
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,172
Come, join me.

413
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:50,285
The Britannia you serve is a worthless dominion.

414
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,035
Maybe that's true. But...

415
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,874
But this nation, it can be changed for the better.

416
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,360
And from within.

417
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,517
Changed?

418
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:03,578
And any ends gained through
contemptible means aren't worth anything.

419
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,540
Wait! Where are you going?!

420
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,569
My court martial begins in an hour.

421
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:09,963
Are you mad?!

422
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:13,414
The only reason they're giving
you a trial is to find you guilty!

423
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,746
The judge, the prosecution, and defense!

424
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,208
Rules are rules.

425
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:22,584
And if I don't go, they'll start cracking
down on Elevens and Honorary Britannians.

426
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,372
But you'll die!

427
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,474
I don't mind.

428
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,144
Don't be an idiot!

429
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:30,161
An old friend of mine always used to tell me that.

430
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:31,648
He'd say I was a fool...

431
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:34,336
It's my weakness, I guess.

432
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,420
I'd try to bring you in, but you'd just end up killing me.

433
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:42,309
And if I'm going to die, it'll
be in the service of the people.

434
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:44,580
Even so. I thank you.

435
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,430
For saving me.

436
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,176
You... fool!

437
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:57,291
Yes, apparently.

438
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,972
Private Kururugi has made conatct with the authorities.

439
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,200
It would seem this Zero has released him.

440
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:05,818
However, now that the original charges
against him have been thrown into question,

441
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:09,582
it's very possible Kururugi will
be found innocent and acquited.

442
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,938
Thank goodness.

443
00:22:13,557 --> 00:22:14,653
Miss Sayoko?

444
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:51,526
So naive...

445
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,884
I was sure Suzaku would understand.

446
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,840
Change the system from within?

447
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:56,904
Ridiculous!

448
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,502
The system will just swallow him up!

449
00:23:58,527 --> 00:23:59,731
It'll eat him alive!

450
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:02,766
I can't beg for their charity to live my life.

451
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:06,753
I just can't! I won't live by their "rules" anymore!
