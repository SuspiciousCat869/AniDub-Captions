1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:05,281
Code R... I see.

2
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:08,496
You've given me an abnormally
high active electric potential

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,571
and boosted my neurofilaments.

4
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:12,711
Oh, how understanding is such a happiness.

5
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:15,712
You want me experimented
in order to recreate it, didn't you?

6
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:16,947
This affliction of hers.

7
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:19,020
Stop it! Code R is not an invalid!

8
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:20,878
Regardless, won't you just please calm down?!

9
00:00:20,903 --> 00:00:23,919
Your brain cells were destroyed
past the Circle of Willis arteries, so...

10
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,402
Spare me excuses!

11
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:27,221
You're the one who gave me like this

12
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:29,517
because you hated me for sending you back to the Homeland!

13
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,792
Look, I promise I'll hear anything you have to say,

14
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,442
but first, let's return to the Homeland!

15
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,550
We can't carry on a proper conversation in this situation!

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,235
Hear me, Britannia!

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,933
This is Zero!

18
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:40,857
Zero?

19
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:43,673
A rebel against oppressors who abuse their power!

20
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:45,365
We will wait until midnight!

21
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,368
You have till then to surrender to me!

22
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:48,976
Through the entire settlement?!

23
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,834
He's on every communication channel.

24
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,556
Do we have any communication to the outside?

25
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,501
Use this opportunity to confirm the enemy's formation.

26
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,130
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,785
I'll have vengeance for my sister Euphemia,

28
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,352
and I'll take it right here and now, Zero!

29
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:07,170
Fairly, out in the open, and face-to-face.

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,241
A rebel against oppressors who abuse their power.

31
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:11,949
We will wait until midnight!

32
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:14,106
You have till then to surrender to me!

33
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,048
Surrender at midnight!

34
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,061
Hand over the whole settlement to them...

35
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:19,777
Hey! Wh-What are you doing?!

36
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,363
Stop it! You know what'll happen if you do that?!

37
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,238
Would you please not interfere?

38
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:25,854
This is no time to be screwing around!

39
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,379
If you don't stop it...

40
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,564
Are you ready to commence the air raid?

41
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:37,952
Strike is synchronized.

42
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:38,656
Good.

43
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,612
Assume the position to fire!

44
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:47,864
Cornelia, I'm afraid a direct confrontation

45
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,430
with me in battle will be your undoing.

46
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:58,848
What?!

47
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:03,743
An earthquake?!

48
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:13,240
A layered structure, built to be earthquake resistant.

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,167
But if you demolish all of
the floor sections simultaneously,

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,483
you won't find anything to be more fragile.

51
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:23,381
By lining up at the city's perimeter to
engage the Black Knights, you sealed your fate!

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,348
I'm not beaten yet!

53
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,097
Damn, you really are one amazing dude, Zero!

54
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,674
Wow! Did they destroy entire settlement?

55
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,944
I heard only the outer perimeter was affected.

56
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,758
There are some facilities in it
that we're going to need later.

57
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:48,551
Still... How were Zero's underground
collaborators able to pull this off?

58
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:52,764
I'm guessing that Villetta's and
Jeremiah's theories must have been true.

59
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,139
Heh, then this is magnificent!

60
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:59,441
Yes... The world is a game, and people are mere pawns!

61
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:36,932
This will do.

62
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:41,413
Once we broadcast images to the
world of their government bureau falling to us,

63
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:45,057
along with our declaration of
independence, he'll be forced to face me.

64
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,634
And if I can get him...

65
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,750
Get the Britannian emperor to meet me one on one,

66
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,755
then all the pieces will fall into my hands.

67
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,797
How does the enemy's air power look?

68
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,223
Our allied groups are concentrating
on striking them hard in each sector.

69
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:03,063
The rest are around the
Izu areas, Sado, and Awaji islands.

70
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,213
Then the time is right. Now's our chance!

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,323
Attack!

72
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,604
Third Squad, take the media sector!

73
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,165
Sixth Squad, take the harbor!

74
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,568
Special forces, suppress the lower levels!

75
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:16,437
All remaining, push in from the front!

76
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,212
Gather intelligence on the enemy forces that are left!

77
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,249
All forces, hear me!

78
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:23,914
Fall back to the Britannian government bureau!

79
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,522
Yes, Your Highness!

80
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,452
What's wrong?

81
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:29,251
If you're having trouble controlling it,
just attach the cockpit block.

82
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:32,668
No, Princess Cornelia,
forget about me and get to the bureau!

83
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,027
Cornelia's been found! Surround her!

84
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:40,310
Meet your fate!

85
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,744
Tohdoh! You phantom!

86
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,770
No, Princess! Stand aside! Leave him to me!

87
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:48,118
Guilford!

88
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,657
Well, it's the one from Narita!

89
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,613
Get away while you can, Princess!

90
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:55,387
Do you expect me to simply abandon my men and run away?!

91
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,062
Your Highness, you must survive!

92
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,349
For Princess Euphemia's honor, as well!

93
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,819
Go now!

94
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:04,490
Because, m'lady, I am the
knight you chose to champion you!

95
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,803
That sword's the same one as the Lancelot's!

96
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,495
Therefore, I must be the one who stays and fights!

97
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:12,957
So be it.

98
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:16,785
Then, Guilford, your orders are
to come back alive, my knight.

99
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,832
Yes, Your Highness, I will return.

100
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,607
The school area is a priority

101
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:23,596
for the special force and the Zero Squad to take over.

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,850
We'll use one of the buildings for a command center.

103
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,733
What? At the school?

104
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:30,229
Ohgi, you stand by out there, as well.

105
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:31,427
Ohgi!

106
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:34,318
Uh... Right. Understood, Zero.

107
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,838
You're planning to go to the Tokyo settlement, aren't you?

108
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,844
However... You can't have it!

109
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:52,694
The A.S.E.E.C. exists for research and development.

110
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,237
It appears our duties here have wound to an end.

111
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:58,579
And we haven't been ordered
by the viceroy to go out there, either.

112
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,195
Leaving would be a violation of orders, right?

113
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,232
Suzaku, I know how you feel, but...

114
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,029
Oh, no you don't!

115
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,673
Listen to me. Zero's in Tokyo,

116
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,100
and I'm gonna finish him with my own hands!

117
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,651
I won't let you stop me!

118
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,010
I'm doing this!

119
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:25,665
Colonel!

120
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,443
Lt. Colonel, should we pursue?

121
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,868
Where are the other units?

122
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,523
They're approaching, climbing up from the side... Hm?

123
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,617
The Glaston Knights!

124
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:38,209
Lord Guilford, we're holding
a position just ahead of here.

125
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:39,317
Please head back.

126
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,401
I appreciate that. I'm grateful.

127
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,942
Think nothing of it, sir.

128
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:46,616
Originally, we were all subordinates
under General Darlton's command.

129
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:48,988
We still don't know if he's alive or dead.

130
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,814
But our duty to Viceroy Cornelia comes first!

131
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,173
Do you know the situation?

132
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,616
The enemy's frontal assault is a diversion.

133
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,860
But if we beat them here,
the rest are simply militia forces.

134
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:00,968
I mean... They're just rabble.

135
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,917
Diethard! Enemy air power's been taken care of!

136
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,573
Kaguya will command the G1.

137
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,636
Move to your assigned location immediately!

138
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,379
Understood.

139
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,035
Yoshida, get the Raikou ready!

140
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,644
Yes, sir!

141
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,686
Tamaki, do you know Rakshata's status?

142
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,663
She's on the move!

143
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,527
Kallen, go provide her group with back-up!

144
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:23,084
Right!

145
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,515
Tohdoh, you know what to do if you see the target.

146
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,416
Understood.

147
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:27,283
Okay...

148
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,562
Now, what's the name of the collaborator, Ohgi?

149
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:32,277
Uh... I have it as Sayoko Shinozaki.

150
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,418
Contact's been lost with the Hiroshima settlement!

151
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,215
Uprisings have broken out in
the Sapporo settlement as well!

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,637
And Chinese Federation naval fleets
are massing in the East China Sea!

153
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:44,119
The Chinese Federation, too?!

154
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:47,041
That's all we need with His Majesty still not present!

155
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,971
He must be there again.

156
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,575
Lord Odysseus, our troops are
standing by, ready for deployment.

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,433
You need to choose a commander, now!

158
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:57,033
We mustn't be too hasty here, gentlemen.

159
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:00,346
What Euphemia did was clearly an abominable blunder.

160
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,167
Handle this rashly, and it may spread to every Area.

161
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,932
My lord! We must go to help Princess Cornelia!

162
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:08,041
Brother, why don't I go? Send me there.

163
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,913
Y-You're serious?! Would you really go there?!

164
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:14,225
Doesn't it sadden you to see
those people killing each other?

165
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,726
Super electromagnetic shrapnel cannon, fire!

166
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:25,299
First special forces, move in!

167
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,891
They only seem to be defending
the government bureau right now.

168
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:49,156
As expected, they're trying not to
scatter themselves while waiting for reinforcements.

169
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,506
Don't move! We're the Black Knights!

170
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:53,406
We've taken over this building!

171
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,641
Do exactly as we tell you to!

172
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,523
No...! It can't be!

173
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,444
Hello, Chief. I brought you an exclusive.

174
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,309
Shall we transmit this to the world?

175
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,210
The moment when Zero changes everything in our lives?

176
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,569
Now that's a scoop.

177
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:06,119
R-Right!

178
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:10,158
We'll give the public a spectacular show
that'll exceed whatever they hoped to see!

179
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,171
Huh?

180
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,273
That was it...

181
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,692
the last broadcasting station. They're all down!

182
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,413
Hands up and turn around!

183
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,111
The Black Knights control the school!

184
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,921
All of you are now our hostages!

185
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:23,164
Lower your guns!

186
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,538
Huh? That's a hell of a thing to say in this situation!

187
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:28,023
Rivalz!

188
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,543
C'mon, lemme be cool for once, okay?

189
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,068
I'll protect everyone!

190
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,676
Is that a fact?

191
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:34,857
Stop!

192
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:39,151
I expressly told you to avoid violence.

193
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:42,616
Yeah, but you also told us this was
gonna be our command center, didn't you?

194
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,100
Your command center?!

195
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,792
Why does it have to be Ashford, of all places?!

196
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:49,890
Your academy is strategically useful for our purposes,

197
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,379
therefore, we're turning it into a command center.

198
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,437
We're in no position to refuse you.

199
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,969
I guarantee none of you will be harmed.

200
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,779
Nunnally...

201
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:01,540
Until the fighting has ended, you'll be safe here,

202
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,651
protected by the Black Knights.

203
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:05,492
So please...

204
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:06,958
Like we can believe you?!

205
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,858
You guys are at war with us Britannians!

206
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,322
We're enemies, remember?!

207
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,137
Please, Rivalz, don't argue.

208
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:14,176
Do what he says.

209
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:16,965
Kallen!

210
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,316
Well, well... There's a surprise around every corner.

211
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:26,424
Do I have your word that no one gets hurt?

212
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,825
Not only us, but any of the student
body, faculty, or staff anywhere on the campus!

213
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,378
As long as nobody tries to leave the dorms
or administration offices, they ought to be fine.

214
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,962
I want... I want to know what you did to me!

215
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:38,590
Huh?

216
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,277
I was so terrified! You have no idea!

217
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,252
Both of you did something to me.

218
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:45,322
Tell me the truth! Didn't you?!

219
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:45,983
Huh?

220
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,913
How could you?! How could you?!

221
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,688
Zero! It's the Lancelot!

222
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,197
I knew he'd come!

223
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,746
Out of my way!

224
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:25,049
When I find you, Zero, I'm going to kill you!

225
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:26,282
Geass?

226
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:29,821
That's correct. Zero possesses a supernatural power.

227
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:30,888
Impossible.

228
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:34,766
Then how do you explain Princess
Euphemia's sudden and drastic change?

229
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,871
What about you?

230
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,938
The one who always follows the rules.

231
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,796
How do you account for your actions on Shikine Island?

232
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:41,726
In short...

233
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,911
The power to control people and erase their memories!

234
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:49,002
When you think about it, it makes sense
and explains everything that's happened till now.

235
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:53,438
And as a result of its aftereffects,
I fell in love with a damned Eleven!

236
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,336
That student... Lelouch Lamperouge!

237
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,361
He's responsible for all of it!

238
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,722
Suzaku!

239
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:04,568
Kallen?!

240
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,391
We meet in battle once again!

241
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,006
I'm sorry, but this time, you're going to die!

242
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,235
You're all fools!

243
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,071
You, the Japanese, he's lying to all of you!

244
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,888
I can't put up with that kind of ignorant drivel!

245
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:17,411
And what do you even know about Zero anyway?!

246
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,603
Well, tell me what you know about him then!

247
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:21,822
Tell me where Zero is now!

248
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,050
Come on! Answer me!

249
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,040
Where's Zero?!

250
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,685
Like I'd tell that to a filthy traitor like you!

251
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,284
Then let's finish this here!

252
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,775
Don't think you have the edge because you can fly!

253
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,868
Now I gotcha!

254
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:49,017
Die!

255
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,248
Tell me! Where is Zero?!

256
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:06,982
You know, I really hate pushy guys.

257
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,789
Okay... Then die here.

258
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,139
If you have any last words, say them now.

259
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:14,968
Wait!

260
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,613
Suzaku Kururugi,

261
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:22,815
my belief that you and I could be allies was incorrect.

262
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,385
I'm no longer gullible about our would-be partnership,

263
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,902
let's resolve this one-on-one.

264
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,751
Works for me! Let's do it!

265
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,643
Colonel?

266
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,854
Asahina. What about Urabe?

267
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:35,151
He's moving on the energy
filler repository right now, sir.

268
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,760
All right, then let's go rendezvous with Senba and Chiba.

269
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:40,138
Once we recharge, we'll surround the government bureau,

270
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:42,663
then we, as the main force, will push in from the front!

271
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:43,182
Roger!

272
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:44,902
Order Lord Crane to fall back.

273
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,480
Set up a defense line on the railway station grounds.

274
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,288
Yes, right away, Your Highness.

275
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:50,513
Princess Cornelia.

276
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,298
We've completed our formation.

277
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,114
What about a line of defense around the bureau?

278
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,910
You're to hold your position, Guilford.

279
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,669
If we can just drag this battle out,
it'll only go badly for the Black Knights.

280
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:01,117
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:03,222
Well? What did my older brother say?

282
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,751
He said the Pacific fleet should
arrive in approximately 75 hours.

283
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:11,665
Also, the Sado and Tori Island air divisions
have already been deployed within Area 11.

284
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,891
Meaning that they should be here in about 30 minutes.

285
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,258
Leak this information to the Black Knights!

286
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:17,950
Huh?

287
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:22,574
After that, you'll join Lord Guilford
in the defense line protecting the government bureau.

288
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,181
And you, my lady?

289
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,688
Oh, I'll be preparing the party.

290
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:29,082
Zero!

291
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,305
Can't you calm him down?!

292
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,001
I can't. His resistance is too strong!

293
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:33,695
We've mounted the radiator fins!

294
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,687
T4s headed for the government bureau?

295
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,633
Are the enemy air divisions here already?

296
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,533
No, only one unit so far.

297
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,874
Well, it shouldn't affect too many of us, then.

298
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,740
We're holding the school,

299
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,140
and Diethard's group is holding the media area.

300
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,873
Miss Kaguya's forces are standing by at our rear.

301
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:56,381
All we need to do is push in
on them from behind, and we've won.

302
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:59,627
We have to for Yoshida and all the others who died.

303
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,955
Deputy-commander, we've captured someone.

304
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,814
Is it one of the students? Don't worry, let him go.

305
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:06,948
We haven't got a reason to hold him here.

306
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,956
No, this one was caught sneaking in through the rear gate.

307
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,237
Sneaking in?

308
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,560
Chigusa!

309
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:20,145
Sh-She's a collaborator who reports directly to me.

310
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:22,104
Take her into one of the unoccupied rooms,

311
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,735
and I'll hear her report there.

312
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:25,153
Poor Nina.

313
00:16:25,178 --> 00:16:27,521
I wonder if she's still in the Ganymede hangar.

314
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,629
And Kallen's part of this whole thing?

315
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,824
Man, this sucks! What're we gonna do?

316
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:32,808
It's all right.

317
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,805
Huh? Hm?

318
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,212
The Black Knights...

319
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,170
Or Zero, rather...

320
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,463
They absolutely won't do anything to harm us.

321
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,784
But how can you be so sure of that?

322
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,298
Coward!

323
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:45,358
Huh?!

324
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,139
Hm?

325
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:51,342
You've taken them as your hostages?!

326
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,954
Some one-on-one fight this is!

327
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,265
You brought this all on yourself

328
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,123
when you rejected my bids to join me as my ally.

329
00:16:57,148 --> 00:17:00,674
Now you'll regret these
foolish moral standards you cling to!

330
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,243
Hey, isn't that the black Knightmare
that's been all over the news lately?

331
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:07,268
No way! Zero's not targeting this building, is he?!

332
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,965
He can't be! He can't! Because if he does...!

333
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:14,360
If I can get close enough to him to use the Harkens...

334
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:16,366
Zero!

335
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:19,747
Now!

336
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,183
What the...?!

337
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,594
I anticipated they wouldn't have adequate time
to come up with a countermeasure for this.

338
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,606
Zero, remember your promise.

339
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,081
Yes, you may do with the machine as you wish.

340
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,078
Zero!

341
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,678
You deceive the people who trust you to the very end!

342
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,881
You betrayer!

343
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:42,738
Hmph.

344
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:45,815
I've no time to argue which of us is the bigger hypocrite.

345
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,487
Farewell, Suzaku Kururugi.

346
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,402
Damn you!

347
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:11,166
Their defenses are strong, as expected.

348
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,693
Should you really be treating this so casually?

349
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,795
Enemy reinforcements are arriving.

350
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,030
If they start bombing us, it's all over.

351
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,749
Huh. But we have a replenished energy filler, haven't we?

352
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,937
Tohdoh, I'm going to move in
on the government bureau from above.

353
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:42,661
Hm?

354
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,641
Isn't it risky to rely on the abilities of that machine?

355
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:46,673
I know that.

356
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,874
I'm just going to create some confusion.

357
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:52,410
It appears to be...

358
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,678
Yes. Aries Villa.

359
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,646
What?! How do you know that?!

360
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,973
I'll tell you some day...

361
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,676
...when the time is right.

362
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,986
Welcome, Zero.

363
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:07,944
I figured you would show up here
as soon as you learned about the air raid.

364
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:12,603
Now... Join us for your welcome soirée!

365
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,306
Care for a dance?

366
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,763
Chigusa. Why did you come to this battlefield?!

367
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:20,663
We need to find some place safe for you.

368
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,212
Stay with me for now.

369
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,976
Uh... Huh..?

370
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,281
Look... I'm sorry I hid this from you.

371
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,922
But everything I'm doing is for the sake of peace!

372
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:33,965
If Zero succeeds in freeing Japan from Britannia,

373
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,781
then we can finally be together!

374
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,746
Oh, stop before I puke!

375
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,950
Me together with an Eleven like you?

376
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,539
What a horrible thought. Heh.

377
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:50,148
My name is Villetta Nu, and
I am a Knight of Honor of Britannia.

378
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,733
So I see, Chigusa...

379
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:58,826
You've gotten your... memory back...

380
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:04,531
Is it true?! Ohgi's been shot?!

381
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,145
Yeah, the medic's with him now.

382
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,822
And was it that woman who did it?!

383
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,307
We're still not sure. We're searching for her as we speak!

384
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:11,237
Wait!

385
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,405
Huh?

386
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,404
Don't tell anybody else about Ohgi.

387
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,002
The news would only rattle people.

388
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:17,860
Just find the girl and bring her back here!

389
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,752
Yes sir!

390
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,858
Oh! Now they've even got Suzaku!

391
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:23,068
Huh?

392
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,605
I wonder what's going on out there.

393
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,825
Now's your chance, please go!

394
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,396
Huh?

395
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,196
Suzaku needs your help! Go to him, please!

396
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,208
And we need his help. He's the best hope we've got.

397
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:40,164
It's pitch black.

398
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,448
You'd never know if the culprit was hiding in here.

399
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,890
Where's the light switch?

400
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:44,789
Dunno!

401
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,229
Zero! Princess Euphemia...

402
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,699
...will be avenged!

403
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,699
What's wrong, Zero?!

404
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,674
The specs on this thing are far superior to hers!

405
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,864
You're just a weakling!

406
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,976
I have you!

407
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,982
I have you right where I want you!

408
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,642
Your life is now in my hands!

409
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:22,640
Cornelia!

410
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:24,466
This is your judgment!

411
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,711
Princess, it's me, Darlton.

412
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,482
Why, Darlton, why?

413
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:36,849
Don't be afraid.

414
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,219
I haven't come to kill you, my lady.

415
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,011
Well, he made it.

416
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,953
I'm here to deliver you to Zero, Your Highness.

417
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,922
What have I done?!

418
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:51,614
Why, Princess?

419
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,362
Thank you, Darlton.

420
00:21:57,748 --> 00:22:01,297
Princess!

421
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:05,777
Uh?

422
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:09,332
Hello? Oh, who's there?

423
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:10,899
Is that you, C.C.?

424
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,256
No, it's not.

425
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,047
Hm? But...

426
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:15,851
Nunnally...

427
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,145
I've come to take you with me.

428
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:53,799
Cornelia, the second princess of
the empire, has fallen into my hands.

429
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,961
After I've questioned her about
the identity of my mother's killer,

430
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:59,492
I only need to hold her hostage, and I've won.

431
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:01,910
At last, for Nunnally's sake as well,

432
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:03,939
I will obliterate Britannia!

433
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,902
The country that abandoned us both!
