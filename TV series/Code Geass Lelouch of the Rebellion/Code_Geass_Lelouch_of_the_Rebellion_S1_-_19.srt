1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,714
Where's the Lancelot?

2
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:20,631
Zero!

3
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,005
It's no use.

4
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,027
I can't remember anything.

5
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:30,908
Where am I?

6
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:11,972
Just as I thought.

7
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:13,488
This is another island.

8
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:16,738
The vegetation and climate are the same as Shikine Island.

9
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,655
We can't be that far from it.

10
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:22,136
There's no way to contact anyone without an incom.

11
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,532
But what's more important right now is
to find a source of drinkable water and shelter.

12
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,905
Kallen? It can't be.

13
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,236
Excuse me!

14
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,936
Suzaku?

15
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:41,013
A Black Knight uniform?!

16
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,407
You mean that you're a...

17
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,739
I don't believe it.

18
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:45,882
It's really you?

19
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:53,797
Kallen!

20
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:55,868
Kallen Stadtfeld, I don't believe it! You're...

21
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,582
Don't call me by that name!

22
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,622
Kallen Kouzuki's my real name! I'm Japanese!

23
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,211
You're kidding, then you really are...

24
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:02,820
Yes!

25
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,226
I'm a Black Knight, got it?!

26
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,786
I'm not going to hide that anymore!

27
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,980
Well then, Kallen Kouzuki, I'm placing you under arrest,

28
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,786
for conspiracy and rebellion against Britannia!

29
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:12,582
Tsk!

30
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:15,511
Contacting Ohgi and the others is going to be a chore.

31
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:16,406
Although...

32
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,174
I suppose I could pass myself off as an ordinary person

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,658
and ask the Britannian forces to rescue me.

34
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:22,284
Huh?

35
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,836
I see.

36
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,199
Then you don't know what happened, either.

37
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,418
When you came to, you found yourself on this island.

38
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,339
Is that right?

39
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:35,746
So then you're stranded here, too, huh?

40
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,120
Serves you right.

41
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,553
When my people get here,

42
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,576
you're the one who'll be a prisoner!

43
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,405
You mean Zero will come to save you?

44
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,570
Without a doubt.

45
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,784
Okay, before he does, tell me one thing.

46
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,003
Tell me who he really is.

47
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,944
Why don't you find out for yourself?

48
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,345
Oh, I see.

49
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:52,709
You don't know, either.

50
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,347
How did...?

51
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:55,553
I knew it.

52
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:56,703
You tricked me?

53
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,271
Isn't masking one's identity a bigger fraud?

54
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:01,799
I'm curious, why do you follow Zero?

55
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,293
I dunno. Figure it out for yourself.

56
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,820
Lelouch.

57
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,436
Lelouch, it's you, isn't it?

58
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:17,082
I haven't told anyone about you. I swear!

59
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:19,830
Please... before you shoot...

60
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:22,159
Let me at least see your face.

61
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,822
Lelouch!

62
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,724
Underground probe radar team,

63
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,165
move from section D to section F.

64
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,103
Establish a 5 second silent interval...

65
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,057
Find her!

66
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,759
Whatever it takes, find Princess Euphemia!

67
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:02,684
Why couldn't she behave the way
a sub-viceroy figurehead is expected to?!

68
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,047
What a situation!

69
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,447
If Princess Cornelia hears about this...

70
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh, my!

71
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:13,201
Who would have imagined a floating aircraft carrier?

72
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,670
You told me to gather data before practical application.

73
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:17,281
Correct?

74
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:20,122
Because I'm extremely interested in whatever you create.

75
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:22,313
I needed to see if this could be made real.

76
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,920
And the hadron cannon?

77
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,976
We wanted to know if the thing worked.

78
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,813
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Cecile Croomy.

79
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:30,468
I am...

80
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:32,101
Prince Schneizel?! Right here?!

81
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,584
You impudent little...!

82
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,464
How dare you look down upon
the second prince of the empire!

83
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,153
G-General Bartley!

84
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,216
Nice one.

85
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:44,113
You're not injured, I hope.

86
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,853
Yes, I am Prince Schneizel el Britannia.

87
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,878
Please, give me your hand.

88
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,030
Yes...

89
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,111
Ugh! She's unworthy!

90
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:56,132
General, you're quite the devoted subject, aren't you?

91
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,990
Primarily because the prince is the one

92
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,714
who commuted my sentence and saved me

93
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,530
from being chained up deep beneath Temple Tower!

94
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,041
I wish you'd stop thinking of me so formally.

95
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,189
You've been a great help to me in this current matter,

96
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:08,922
as you were to my brother Clovis.

97
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,947
It is I who am grateful to you.

98
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,305
M-My lord...!

99
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,607
Please, Bartley.

100
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:16,568
Now, my lady Cecile, if you'll excuse me.

101
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,107
Y-Your Highness!

102
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:18,953
Farewell.

103
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,911
You can wait for me at the base, Cecile.

104
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,274
Huh? Where are you going?

105
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,647
Just a little errand.

106
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:26,907
While I'm doing that,
I'll use the Avalon to look for Suzaku.

107
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:29,524
It's hard to find devicers like that young man,

108
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,918
especially after yesterday's exploits!

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,057
Please wait.

110
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:35,353
Were those orders yesterday issued by the prince?

111
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:36,036
Silence!

112
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,401
You don't want to be in contempt of royalty, do you?!

113
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:40,513
Those orders were mine, Miss Cecile.

114
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:42,253
I also fired the hadron.

115
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:46,484
Even in a situation like that,
priorities mustn't be forgotten.

116
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,384
Besides, if something anomalous happened,

117
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,438
we would have still been able to rescue him.

118
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,961
That's what I gambled on.

119
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,203
He is, after all, Suzaku Kururugi,

120
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:56,859
ace pilot of the Special Corps and Euphy's knight.

121
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,176
Yes, my lord. I understand now.

122
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,036
And I sorely regret my rudeness.

123
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:02,978
I accept any punishment you decree.

124
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,199
Nonsense.

125
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,057
It's my fault for not protecting my subordinates.

126
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,024
Can you ever forgive me?

127
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,272
When did you figure it out?

128
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,222
Back during the hotel jacking.

129
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,197
I see...

130
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,609
At that time, I said too much without thinking.

131
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,551
Still, I wasn't convinced until now.

132
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,582
Hmph. I'm naïve as well.

133
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,171
Even so, why didn't you discuss it with Cornelia?

134
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:30,972
I didn't because my sister never listens to me.

135
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,220
Besides that...

136
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:35,426
I think things are depressing enough as they are.

137
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,422
Nunnally? How is she?

138
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:40,874
She's living with me.

139
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:42,771
But she's still blind and crippled.

140
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,076
The hatred you must feel for us...

141
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,136
I only want to find out one thing.

142
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,757
Do you know anything about the
circumstance in which my mother was murdered?

143
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,749
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,455
It seems my sister's investigated it extensively, though.

145
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:02,784
Cornelia thought a lot of
Lady Marianne and really looked up to her.

146
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,432
May I ask you something now?

147
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:07,066
Hm?

148
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,638
Are you Zero?

149
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,216
Or... or are you...?

150
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:14,468
I'm Lelouch.

151
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:15,743
Yeah.

152
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,745
Right here and now, I'm Lelouch,

153
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,491
the brother that you know, Euphy.

154
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,313
Oh, Lelouch...

155
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:31,755
I believe feeling relieved has made me hungry.

156
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,934
Are you sure that this will work?

157
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,334
From the paw prints and droppings,

158
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,984
I can tell that wild animals use this path.

159
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,880
I plan to set up a trap

160
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,249
that dates back to Medieval times!

161
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,207
Oh...

162
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:49,099
Gotcha, haha!

163
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,672
Oh wow! You're not bad at that!

164
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,295
Do you wanna try it, too?

165
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:55,391
I tell ya what,

166
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,116
I'll let you loose if you promise
to help me find food. Is that a deal?

167
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,586
Hmph. You're not gonna win me over, so why try?

168
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,261
What do you take me for?

169
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,788
Man, you're stubborn!

170
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,211
You're not anything like the way you are at school!

171
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,820
Even using... a lever...

172
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,845
Why don't you let me help you with that?

173
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,171
Manual... labor isn't... for a... royal princess.

174
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,372
Don't worry. My method's perfect.

175
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,805
Well, I suppose...

176
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,999
I could go and search for something, like fruit! Okay?

177
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,816
Be careful, Euphy!

178
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:28,732
Right!

179
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,625
Enemy battleship has passed us.

180
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,636
You've gotta be kidding!

181
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:49,390
A battleship that can hover in midair?

182
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,317
That's great!

183
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,386
We can't remain in this area any longer.

184
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:54,661
The risk is too great. We should pull out of here.

185
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,563
Mmhmm.

186
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,269
Ohgi. I disagree.

187
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,457
We ought to at least stay put and look for Zero.

188
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:00,630
He has a point.

189
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,657
But we can't send out a search party in this situation.

190
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,352
Even though we're able to hide, thanks to Rakshata,

191
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:09,436
there's no guarantee Zero and Kallen are still alive.

192
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:13,930
One wrong step, and we threaten
the very existence of our organization.

193
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,089
What do you mean?!

194
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,989
It's entirely the other way around.

195
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:19,859
This entire organization is built around Zero!

196
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,884
It's not a group without members!

197
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:25,575
The way you speak, you sound
like a typical Britannian to me.

198
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,359
All right, then, answer me this.

199
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:31,048
We have followers of almost every
ideology under the sun gathered here.

200
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,027
Yet how is it that the whole lot of them

201
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,709
can cooperate and work together toward the same goal?

202
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,494
Because of the results we get?

203
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,452
Tell me, who is it that gets us those results?

204
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,907
I'll be the first to admit that he does!

205
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:45,057
But is he worth the lives of everyone?

206
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:48,671
At times, the life of a single man
is worth more than those of a million.

207
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,971
I thought that would be common sense to a soldier!

208
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:52,288
You dare say that here?!

209
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:53,757
Easy, guys.

210
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,465
Oh, all right, then I'll tell you.

211
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,246
He's very much alive.

212
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,812
We've no time for your wishful thinking.

213
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:02,346
The information's true. I simply know it.

214
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,152
Oh, you're an oracle now?

215
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,886
I told you to shut your trap

216
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,246
and to get some training on a Knightmare, you dumbass!

217
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,084
Dumbass? Oh really?

218
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:13,675
It's been ages since anyone's dared
to refer to me in such a rude manner.

219
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,827
Like Zero's mistress has any right to get uppity with us!

220
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:18,238
I said you were wrong.

221
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:20,863
You're a man who only has vulgar ideas.

222
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,794
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to your superior like that!

223
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:26,288
Look, this whole conversation's gotten out of hand!

224
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,102
Okay, how about this?

225
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,121
We hang in a safe zone.

226
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,271
An ocean area just out of detection range

227
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,680
where we wait until the end of tomorrow.

228
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,738
How does that sound for a time limit?

229
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,447
All right.

230
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,498
Well, I suppose we have no choice.

231
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,121
For heaven's sake!

232
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:45,392
I was forced to talk with that boring little man,

233
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,292
thanks to your silly prank.

234
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,665
You sent Kallen to the island?

235
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:54,938
You have very poor taste
for being such an imperious observer.

236
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,291
What's wrong? They're quite tasty!

237
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,368
I'm sure you'll be able to
make your pitfall trap tomorrow.

238
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,155
Oh... I can't eat another bite!

239
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,689
Boy, am I stuffed!

240
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,630
So is this a glimpse of what you're really like?

241
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,530
Yeah, ya wanna make somethin' of it?

242
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:22,486
No, I think it's charming to see you
so much livelier than you are at school.

243
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,316
Hmph!

244
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:27,055
Kallen...

245
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,045
Leave the Black Knights.

246
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:31,451
It's not too late.

247
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,289
A captured terrorist never winds up with a happy ending.

248
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,618
I thought you weren't so bad,

249
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,184
and then you showed your true colors.

250
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,459
Well that won't work.

251
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:42,016
I happen to be the captain of Zero's elite guard.

252
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,276
And in fact, I fought you in my Knightmare.

253
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,509
Were you that red one?

254
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:46,330
Yeah.

255
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:48,347
And even if I lose my life doing it,

256
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,846
I'll beat that Knightmare of yours someday.

257
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,243
Using Zero's methods offers no future.

258
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:56,220
And what about your future, then?!

259
00:12:56,245 --> 00:13:00,509
To just live the life of a conqueror's
subjugated lap dog?! An honorary Britannian?!

260
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,034
Or to be the knight of the third princess?! Ha!

261
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,436
The name of Genbu Kururugi, the Last Samurai, weeps!

262
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,549
I am not you!

263
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:10,736
The world is wrong, and I'm trying to change it!

264
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,970
If I don't...

265
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:15,361
If I don't, my brother's death will have been for nothing.

266
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,641
That's my reason for fighting!

267
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,720
And I'll do whatever it takes to win!

268
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,776
Kallen, the truth is...

269
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,899
I killed my father.

270
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,376
My father didn't commit suicide.

271
00:13:31,963 --> 00:13:33,409
I took his life.

272
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,470
With this hand.

273
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,188
The stars haven't changed, have they?

274
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:44,289
They were the same back then.

275
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,541
Long ago, we all used to gaze up at the stars together.

276
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:52,561
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could live like that again?

277
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,336
I'd be so happy then.

278
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,455
Can't we go back to that?

279
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,520
Yes, you're right.

280
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,586
It would be so good to just go back to how things were.

281
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:07,896
Zero is a lot like my father.

282
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,668
He firmly believes that the
entire world revolves around him.

283
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:14,855
That's why he's able to justify
spilling the blood of so many people...

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,843
That's why you accept the way things are now?!

285
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,147
You call that peace?!

286
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,684
Some things are more important than your life, you know!

287
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,866
It isn't that I want you to give up.

288
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,638
I just want you to ask yourself:

289
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:29,145
When you gain results the wrong way,
what are you left with in the end?

290
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,014
Only dark regret and a deep
emptiness that have nowhere to go.

291
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,872
Then explain something.

292
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:41,326
What higher purpose did the death of my brother serve?

293
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,214
Who gets to sit in judgment?

294
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,539
Who decides whether it's right or wrong?

295
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:59,172
Euphy... Even for me to survive...

296
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,297
Even struggling with my shame...

297
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,026
I still search for a reason to go on living.

298
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:06,751
I'm a disgrace.

299
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:16,322
We couldn't find major Kururugi
washed ashore on the other island.

300
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,084
So it's obvious we should look here.

301
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,942
We'll send out a search party in the morning.

302
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,526
Hm... And this must be what you mentioned?

303
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:25,702
Yes. We uncovered it when the Shinjuku incident occurred.

304
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,618
Ahh...

305
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,709
Yes, I can see why this
would have attracted Clovis' interest.

306
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,363
Are you sure you really saw a light?

307
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,086
Yeah, I'm positive.

308
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:45,230
It must be a search party.

309
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,994
Once we learn who it is, we'll know how deal with them.

310
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,655
Deal with them?

311
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,751
A thought elevator, you say?

312
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,236
I'm afraid archeology isn't my strong suit,

313
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,678
especially this paranormal stuff!

314
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:00,828
Why you...!

315
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:01,861
Show some respect!

316
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:05,253
As I was saying, this is way outside of my field.

317
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,194
I wish you could have asked Cecile about this instead.

318
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:10,230
Please don't complain so much.

319
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,980
My father is infatuated with this as well.

320
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,289
Isn't that right, Bartley?

321
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:19,230
Yes. We've found artifacts similar to
these in a number of places around the world.

322
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:23,963
Except for this one that I discovered, all the
other sites are are directly under imperial control.

323
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,940
This is mere speculation on my part,

324
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:30,770
but I think the real reason we're invading
other countries is to obtain these objects.

325
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:34,349
And so, in order to analyze this ancient occult data,

326
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,813
you're going to use the Gawain's Druid System,

327
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:38,736
untuned prototype that it is?

328
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,302
That's why we called you in.

329
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,336
A-ha!

330
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,046
I think it was right around here.

331
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:52,430
Lelouch, if it is a search party,
then will our time be over here?

332
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,971
Yes, it will.

333
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,403
I'm such an undependable knight,

334
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:58,442
I couldn't even capture you any food!

335
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,272
And besides,

336
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,267
that's a job reserved for a real knight.

337
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,769
Your knight. Suzaku Kururugi.

338
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,372
Mind if I ask you?

339
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,797
Why choose an honorary Britannian?

340
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:12,221
Well, I...

341
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:22,167
What are those two doing together?!

342
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:23,989
Suzaku!

343
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:25,663
P-Princess Euphemia?!

344
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:26,726
Don't move!

345
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,709
This girl is my prisoner!

346
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:29,788
Zero!

347
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,369
Just follow my cue.

348
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,354
I'll take back my subordinate you have there!

349
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:35,992
We'll exchange prisoners!

350
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:36,767
Zero!

351
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,253
Once again, you...

352
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,340
Keep back!

353
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:42,163
Ha! You find my actions cowardly?

354
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,826
Eliminate terrorists, no matter what the sacrifice.

355
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:52,042
Do you intend to follow this rule
and let your mistress die?

356
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,729
In spite of the fact that your
integrity has already been broken?

357
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,409
Leave him alone!

358
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,326
Shut up, you royal puppet! You're useless!

359
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:02,519
You can't think for yourself or do anything on your own!

360
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:03,161
What?!

361
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:05,567
I'm not afraid of you,
and I don't care what happens to me!

362
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,175
Suzaku, I command you to fight!

363
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,097
Your Highness!

364
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,844
With pleasure!

365
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:11,969
You hardheaded fool!

366
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,088
Oh... not good.

367
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,605
Agh! My lord, please save yourself!

368
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,180
Major Kururugi!

369
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:37,530
And is that...

370
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:38,857
...Zero?

371
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,616
Don't shoot, you fools!

372
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,155
Princess Euphemia's with them!

373
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,830
Capture them! Capture them!

374
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:45,589
Tsk!

375
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,720
Look, Zero! That's a Knightmare over there!

376
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:50,055
Perfect! We'll use that! Let's go!

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,859
Right!

378
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:52,897
Suzaku!

379
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:00,082
Suzaku, what is it, what's wrong?

380
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,115
This is good!

381
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,269
Not only unmanned, but activated, too!

382
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,986
Form a wall in front of Princess Euphemia! Hurry!

383
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:13,057
What kind of Knightmare is this?

384
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,317
It's my lucky day!

385
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:19,413
Schneizel!

386
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,226
So that's him? That's Zero?

387
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:24,386
Agh! The Gawain!

388
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,490
Stop that woman now! Get that machine back!

389
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:30,001
We cannot allow it to fall into Zero's hands!

390
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,157
Schneizel! Next time!

391
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,996
Alert 1! Alert 1!

392
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,771
Sutherlands are blocking our exit!

393
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,740
Hang on tight! I'm going through them!

394
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:38,553
Huh?!

395
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,201
Disappear.

396
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,505
Damn! The weapons are incomplete!

397
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:57,619
Zero! Reinforcements!

398
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,401
Don't be worried yet.

399
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,519
Another system is operational!

400
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,134
We're flying?

401
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,261
This Knightmare can fly!

402
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,297
The Gawain! Our beautiful prized Gawain!

403
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,697
Well, it was only a test model.

404
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:21,705
Aside from that, I'm thankful you're both all right.

405
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,090
Oh Schneizel, I missed you!

406
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:29,086
Dear Euphy, I'm sorry it took us so long.

407
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:30,363
No, it's all right!

408
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,534
Your Highness, shall we keep to the schedule?

409
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,032
Oh. Right.

410
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:34,811
Uh...

411
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:36,617
Major Suzaku Kururugi,

412
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:39,855
you're under arrest for violation of military regulations.

413
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,267
What's the meaning of this?!

414
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,042
Major Kururugi's my knight!

415
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,186
You can't do...

416
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:46,769
This is something I can take care of later.

417
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,536
For now, let them be.

418
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:50,580
Um, did something happen?

419
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,459
I've contacted Ohgi!

420
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,186
We'll rendezvous with them out at sea.

421
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,659
Right! And one other thing...

422
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,138
The Guren MK-II...?

423
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,428
It was recovered.

424
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:01,617
You may thank Asahina and Chiba for that.

425
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:02,755
Yes, sir!

426
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:05,188
Suzaku, forgive me.

427
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,189
I never intended to use the power on you, but...

428
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:13,359
Live!

429
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,413
Major Kururugi, follow your orders!

430
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:26,332
Shut up!

431
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,770
Who cares about them?!

432
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,553
I have to live!

433
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,551
I have no idea how you got out of the Lancelot.

434
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:35,741
But you blew a golden opportunity

435
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:39,291
to put an end to Zero in order to
save your own life, according to this.

436
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,474
Are you going to protest this evidence?

437
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,124
Was that... really me?

438
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,907
This is nothing less than insubordination!

439
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,028
Kururugi did that?

440
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:52,178
Yes. The details are unknown.

441
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,018
Dammit.

442
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,749
And just when I thought we had nailed the lid on Ishikawa.

443
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:56,732
Your Highness!

444
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:58,455
What now, Guilford?

445
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:01,403
The enemy has destroyed the
Great Kanmon Bridge in Kyushu block!

446
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:02,320
What?!

447
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,082
They also cut off vehicle access at four other points,

448
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:08,547
and large numbers of assault
landing craft are moving into the Genkai Sea!

449
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:10,520
The Chinese Federation?!

450
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,603
But have they made a declaration of war?

451
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:15,499
No, Highness! The craft are bearing the flag of Japan!

452
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,321
What was Schneizel doing on that island?

453
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:54,421
Was there something hidden in that area?

454
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:55,401
And Euphy...

455
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:56,868
I think I can trust you for now,

456
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,941
but I also need to consider
what happened with Kallen and Suzaku.

457
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:00,811
No!

458
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,620
First, we have to deal with Kyushu!

459
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:04,303
That will determine our future.

460
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:07,278
The future of both the Black Knights and myself!
