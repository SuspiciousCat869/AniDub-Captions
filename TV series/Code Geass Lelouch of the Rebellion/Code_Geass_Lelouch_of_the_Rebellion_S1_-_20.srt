1
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:13,716
We hereby declare the resurrection of Japan

2
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,825
as a lawful independent and sovereign nation!

3
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:22,574
Atsushi Sawasaki, leader of the forces
that have occupied the Fukuoka military base,

4
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:27,334
was Chief Cabinet Minister of the
Kururugi Administration in the former nation of Japan.

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,256
After the war, he fled to the Chinese Federation,

6
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:34,887
but is apparently making his move now
in response to the recent civil unrest caused by Zero.

7
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:38,841
Whether the Black Knights have played a role
in these unfolding events is still under investigation.

8
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,345
We're not part of it!

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,967
What does Kyoto say about it?

10
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:43,449
They didn't know this was coming.

11
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:47,856
They were just notified about his
unilateral claims over the Sakuradite mining rights.

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,583
Zero, it's our move.

13
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:50,817
What are we gonna do?

14
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,316
Sawasaki's group was working in
conjunction with a terrorist organization in Kyushu.

15
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:33,361
After cutting off vehicle access from Honshu and Shikoku,

16
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,853
and with support from Chinese Federation forces

17
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,835
from the Liaodong Military District,

18
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,293
they are expanding their occupation
around Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Oita.

19
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,870
According to General Tsao,

20
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:47,217
the Chinese Federation is providing humanitarian support,

21
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,284
and is not...

22
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,434
So how's Suzaku doing?

23
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,926
He says that he'll do whatever the mission demands.

24
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,993
I see.

25
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:56,303
And what about Prince Schneizel? Where is he?

26
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,917
In the Tokyo Settlement.

27
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,150
Got there after his run-in with Suzaku.

28
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:02,445
Avalon doesn't have its commander right now,

29
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,784
but we have to finish this up

30
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,648
if we want to counter the Gefjun Disturber.

31
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,396
I've dishonored you.

32
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:15,321
I'm not worthy to be your knight.

33
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,549
If this is about your disobeying orders,

34
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,525
my brother Schneizel said it was an unusual situation,

35
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,175
and you shouldn't be blamed for it.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,911
I can't forgive myself.

37
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:25,096
Please...

38
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,372
Has knighthood become a burden for you?

39
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:29,843
Something that troubles you?

40
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,668
No, I'm grateful for it.

41
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:32,922
Then why?

42
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:34,590
I've remembered something.

43
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,826
I... I killed my own father.

44
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,114
I was never punished for it.

45
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,349
I just lived on like nothing happened.

46
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,335
And right now I'm being protected again!

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,110
While soldiers die and Elevens suffer, I'm unscathed.

48
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,728
A person like me doesn't deserve this!

49
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:54,689
You don't deserve it?

50
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,390
Then I don't either.

51
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,224
Princess Cornelia, we're taking too many losses!

52
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,898
This tempest is preventing us from using our air power!

53
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:11,316
We'll have to delay the landing
operation until the weather changes.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,126
It's a stroke of good fortune that this storm hit.

55
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,728
We must use it to tighten our grip on Kyushu.

56
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,116
You see, Gen. Tsao?

57
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,641
Heaven is on our side.

58
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,510
We're going to prevail in this battle with ease.

59
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,648
Martial law is not necessary.

60
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:29,464
Such measures would only upset and frighten people.

61
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:31,939
Contact E.U. Foreign Minister Gandolphi.

62
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:35,178
Oh, and put a call in to the Toromo Agency in Cambodia.

63
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:36,161
Prince Schneizel,

64
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:38,311
using the Toromo agency could be a...

65
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,729
Prime Minister!

66
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,671
Yes, Euphy. Something wrong?

67
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,446
Is there anything I can do to help?

68
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:47,135
I'm the sub-viceroy of Area 11, I should be assisting you.

69
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:47,948
Thank you.

70
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,253
Just your offer to help me is more than enough.

71
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:51,236
But I...

72
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:55,201
The viceroy gave strict orders that
you not be entangled in this matter, Princess.

73
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,234
She did?

74
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,891
Just because I chose my knight without her consent...

75
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,082
Oh, uh, no, that's not correct.

76
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,083
I think even the Kururugi matter...

77
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:04,754
Please understand, Euphy.

78
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,726
Cornelia can't take any chances now;

79
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,896
the situation is too treacherous.

80
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,173
You mean...

81
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,452
Darlton, concerning the matter we were discussing,

82
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,352
I know someone who has a way in with them.

83
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,710
So, I will ask for help.

84
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,124
Yes, Your Highness.

85
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,459
After all our hard work getting ready,

86
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:25,069
it looks like they're going to cancel the school festival.

87
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,789
That's hardly a huge consideration since we're at war.

88
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:28,986
Did you say war?

89
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,703
They're using this government in exile as a smokescreen,

90
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,969
but this is a war with the Chinese Federation!

91
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:35,040
Oh, I see...

92
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:38,545
Nina, what about the booths we were
planning to borrow from the art museum?

93
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,431
Uh, I'm going there today.

94
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,325
If I have some extra time,

95
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,751
I'd also like to drop into the science department.

96
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,276
Are you talking about that present of yours?

97
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,468
Huh? What present is that?

98
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,911
Professor Asplund said that I should ask him

99
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,915
if there was something special that I wanted.

100
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,190
You mean Lloyd?!

101
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,740
That philandering playboy?!

102
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:57,625
That's enough!

103
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,298
Could you get a little work done?

104
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:02,365
Easy for you to say; this is work for three people!

105
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,163
Suzaku's in the army, Kallen's in the hospital,

106
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:07,717
and that other fool's nowhere to be found.

107
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,771
There's something's really weird about Lelouch lately.

108
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,516
I was so shocked.

109
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,453
I'm still confused about it.

110
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,683
How can Lelouch be Zero?!

111
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,973
"I still haven't told anyone.

112
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:23,429
I want to meet you first and ask you face to face."

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,132
Did I really write that letter?

114
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:29,027
How is it possible?

115
00:06:29,109 --> 00:06:33,401
Why did I forget... that Nunna's big brother is Zero?

116
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:39,501
Z-01, float attachment, contact.

117
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,043
Control line, established.

118
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:42,717
That's really amazing.

119
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:44,867
You got a perfect rating on the float simulator.

120
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:45,849
Thank you.

121
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:49,900
Tell me, why did you want to
give up being a knight, Suzaku?

122
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,667
Well, because...

123
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:56,560
Princess Euphemia still approves of me even as I am now.

124
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,882
So if I caused her any trouble,

125
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,306
if I brought her dishonor or shame,

126
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:05,095
I had a feeling that she would end up hating herself.

127
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,606
A figurehead.

128
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:11,241
That's all I was from the start; I knew that.

129
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:15,332
But I thought if I gave my best effort,
maybe I could make some difference.

130
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,480
Forgive me, Clovis.

131
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:21,674
I met Zero face to face, but I didn't avenge your death.

132
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:25,398
I have to think of some way to save Lelouch and Nunnally,

133
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,750
but how?

134
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:30,299
I don't have the kind of power that my sister has;

135
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,591
I'm not like her or Schneizel.

136
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,470
No matter where I go, I'm just a burden

137
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,286
and I act selfishly though I don't mean to.

138
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:41,703
I chose my knight against my sister's advice.

139
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,136
And now he's resigned.

140
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,705
Oh yeah, they told me about you.

141
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,855
You need to have the documents signed today, right?

142
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,871
But a member of the royal
family is viewing the art right now.

143
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,979
Huh? Which member is it?

144
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,898
Uh, so you're saying...?

145
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,559
We aren't going to collaborate with Sawasaki.

146
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:06,979
He's not independent.

147
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,260
He's a puppet of the Chinese Federation.

148
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,045
But he says he's fighting for Japan!

149
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,011
We'd get a new name and a new master,

150
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:14,702
but nothing would change.

151
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,785
His Japan is a sham.

152
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:19,354
Yeah, so what you're really saying is...?

153
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,087
When Britannia strikes back, we play dead?

154
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:26,084
Zero, perhaps you'd better
clarify what our overall mission is.

155
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,167
Yeah, he's right.

156
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,159
Even leaving aside the Sawasaki matter,

157
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:31,068
what's our mid-term goal on this?

158
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,607
To make Tokyo an independent nation!

159
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:34,573
Independent?!

160
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,473
A nation?!

161
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,545
Are you serious?!

162
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,487
You mean us?

163
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:38,654
A country?

164
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:41,559
I thought so.

165
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,384
He's really going all the way!

166
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,336
Wait a minute!

167
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,067
No matter how much the Black Knights have expanded...

168
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,216
Our enemy is an empire
that controls one third of the world!

169
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,895
We can't pull that off alone!

170
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,214
Then answer this!

171
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:57,179
Are you just going to sit back and
wait for someone else to defeat Britannia?

172
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:57,939
Who?

173
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:02,711
You think if you wait long enough,
someday the right chance will finally come?

174
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,696
Don't be naïve!

175
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,815
If we don't stand up and do it ourselves,

176
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,943
that "someday" will never come!

177
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,431
Princess Euphemia!

178
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:17,933
Secure the perimeter!

179
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,363
Code Delta! We have a Code Delta!

180
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:22,516
Please! I just want to thank Princess Euphemia!

181
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,298
To get one look at her!

182
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:27,060
Repeat, lock down all gates leading into the building!

183
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:28,749
From the hotel!

184
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:31,201
We've caught a suspicious girl at the building perimeter!

185
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,290
Watch for any unidentified vehicles!

186
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,310
Stop it! That girl is a personal friend of mine!

187
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,235
Good. It's cleared up.

188
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,787
Now we can resume the landing operation.

189
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:46,703
And we'll try to put Prince Schneizel's plan into action.

190
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,212
You think the Special Corps can break through their line?

191
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:51,527
With Kururugi, it's possible.

192
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,890
Using him can also mean trouble.

193
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:56,036
But there's no commander on the Avalon now.

194
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,728
Earl Asplund isn't capable.

195
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:58,866
Incoming missiles!

196
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,009
Launch point appears to be Fukuoka base!

197
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,951
One minute, five seconds to impact!

198
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,041
Not bad!

199
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,815
They're well prepared against air raids as well.

200
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:11,184
Are we sending up a barrage?

201
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,019
We'll be fine in this position.

202
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,993
Direct hit confirmed!

203
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,818
The Avalon is destroyed.

204
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:22,898
Hmph! Even if it is state-of-the-art,

205
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,094
a single ship can't possibly hurt us!

206
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,530
Hm? What the...?!

207
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,164
Lancelot's shield was already proven on the battlefield.

208
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:37,893
Major Kururugi, I'm laying out
the mission plan for final verification.

209
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:42,746
This ship will breach the enemy's front line from
high altitude and move directly to the launch point.

210
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,368
The advanced weapon system
Z-01 Lancelot, using the float unit,

211
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:49,227
will attack the enemy headquarters at Fukuoka base.

212
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,791
The float unit consumes energy fast,

213
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:54,149
so pay attention to your operation time!

214
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,937
Yes, my lord.

215
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,175
M.E. boost...

216
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,281
Lancelot unit, now launching!

217
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,515
...launch!

218
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:22,004
The enemy ship seems to have launched a bomber,

219
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,154
but it's moving faster than a fighter plane!

220
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,429
I have picture!

221
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,052
A Knightmare!

222
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,466
It's not being transported,

223
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,075
it's just flying on its own!

224
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,517
That weapons report we got... could this be it?

225
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,308
You mean that novelty weapon?!

226
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,133
But then, the pilot is...

227
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,598
The military force that's
trying to occupy the Kyushu block

228
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,531
is fighting under ex-minister Atsushi Sawasaki.

229
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:54,321
If they lose him, the new Japanese
government will collapse very quickly.

230
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:59,273
In that case, the Chinese Federation will lose
their excuse for being here, and have to withdraw.

231
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,347
There it is. The enemy headquarters.

232
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,751
An open channel?

233
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,705
This is Minister Sawasaki.

234
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:32,601
Is that Prime Minister Kururugi's son in the pilot seat?

235
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:36,507
I see. I didn't know he had a son like you.

236
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:40,155
And then when you saved me, Princess Euphemia,

237
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,570
I'll never forget it...

238
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,916
You looked like some kind of goddess,

239
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,603
like you were bathed in radiant light.

240
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:48,211
Oh! Forgive me!

241
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,748
I should have thanked you for
these change of clothes you gave me!

242
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,074
Oh, don't worry about that, Nina.

243
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:58,365
Besides, I'm not all the wonderful person you think I am.

244
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,027
I'm no good compared to my brother and sister...

245
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,811
No, that's not true!

246
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,898
How can you say that about yourself?

247
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,591
There's not one good thing about me.

248
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:10,168
Really, nothing at all.

249
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,690
My parents are ordinary, I'm not the least bit pretty,

250
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:16,056
and there's just nothing special about me...

251
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,704
That's wrong, Nina.

252
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,777
I think you're a very cute girl.

253
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:23,442
Oh, no, I'm not really good for anything.

254
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,703
Not at all.

255
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,112
She hates herself.

256
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,156
But, so do I...

257
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:34,658
I guess I understand, but Suzaku makes me uneasy...

258
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:38,158
That's it. Suzaku feels badly too!

259
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:42,641
So please, oh please, don't say that
you're no good, Princess Euphemia, I beg of you!

260
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:43,828
Because...

261
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:49,785
Because I need you. I need your goodness.

262
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,106
Thank you so much, Nina.

263
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,286
I'm glad I got to know you.

264
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:57,277
You've really helped me understand!

265
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:59,307
This has nothing to do with my father.

266
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:01,416
I came here to put an end to this fighting.

267
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,230
I will accept your surrender.

268
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:06,630
You want to rob Japan of its dream of freedom?

269
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:10,875
Freedom has to come the right way, not like this.

270
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,108
You'll act out of selfishness?

271
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,227
It's justice without ideology.

272
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,545
No, you're wrong! That's not what I...

273
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,697
My V.A.R.I.S!

274
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,899
Those are Chinese Federation Gang Lous.

275
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,706
He allowed me to distract him. He still has much to learn!

276
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:33,594
Euphy?

277
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:34,560
Schneizel!

278
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,542
May I have access to a private communication line?

279
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,534
My energy filler!

280
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,149
Are you kidding?! They blasted off the float?!

281
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,799
The Avalon has to strike at the base!

282
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:50,367
No, the shield doesn't completely surround us!

283
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:52,764
One direct hit and we'll go down in flames!

284
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:53,397
Suzaku!

285
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:55,809
Reroute all power to combat and com-systems!

286
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:56,685
Got it!

287
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,296
You had better surrender, Suzaku.

288
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,478
Since you're Prime Minister Kururugi's son,

289
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:05,148
I guarantee that you'll be very well treated, my boy.

290
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,790
I decline. If I used my father's
name for this, I'd never forgive myself.

291
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,482
This is between you and me.

292
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:14,170
I see. You're very much your father's son,

293
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:16,654
as foolish and stubborn as he was!

294
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:20,178
Suzaku Kururugi!

295
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,240
Princess Euphemia!

296
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,701
Suzaku!

297
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,768
The truth is, you and I, uh, that is...

298
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,418
Sorry, but right now...

299
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:29,652
You see...

300
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,411
I hereby command you to love me!

301
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:34,377
Right!

302
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,014
Huh?

303
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,538
What?! What is it?!

304
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:40,115
Uh, sorry, but this is private.

305
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,341
And in return, I will love you!

306
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,419
Forever!

307
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,846
Princess Euphemia...

308
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:49,013
Suzaku, I love your stubborness
and your kindness and your strength.

309
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,420
Your sad eyes, your clumsiness,
and the way you have trouble with cats.

310
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:54,408
I love everything about you!

311
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:57,072
So please, don't hate yourself!

312
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:02,115
I see that I've made you
even more worried than I did before.

313
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,529
You really are...

314
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:06,515
Everything you do is impulsive!

315
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,801
When we first met,

316
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,665
when you told me you were a princess,

317
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:11,326
when you selected my school,

318
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,810
when you made me a knight... Always!

319
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,585
Yes, they were all sudden.

320
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,345
That's because I suddenly realized...

321
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,781
But then it's that spur of the moment
feeling that's opened so many doors for me.

322
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you!

323
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,971
What are you doing?! Stop him now!

324
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,902
Princess, can I make one final request?

325
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:32,844
Final?

326
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,576
If something happens to me, whatever it is,

327
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,247
please don't blame yourself.

328
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,084
Destroy all the records and erase every trace

329
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,984
so no one knows what happened to me.

330
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:45,017
I don't want my friends to be sad.

331
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,424
Just tell them I transferred
schools or make up some story.

332
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,570
Suzaku, don't tell me you're...!

333
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,122
Yes, the Knightmare's out of energy.

334
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:58,156
Oh, and please, say goodbye to Miss Cecile
and Lloyd and to Prince Schneizel for me.

335
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,060
I was stubborn all the way to the end.

336
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,752
Don't die, Suzaku!

337
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,582
You've got to live!

338
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,617
Wh-What the...?

339
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,835
And fire!

340
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:14,912
Huh?!

341
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:15,761
What was that?!

342
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,652
Something just appeared on the radar!

343
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:20,034
A stealth system! We've got picture!

344
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:24,610
That's...!

345
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:31,815
I see. So the famous white Knightmare is named Lancelot.

346
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
And he's fighting as recklessly as ever.

347
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:38,095
Yes, but this time he seems to be
following someone else's plan.

348
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,568
They sent a single fighter in
to try to disrupt the main force.

349
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,547
Even if he fails, Cornelia can move right in.

350
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:47,423
Schneizel... Is he behind this idea?

351
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:50,492
These people are in my way!

352
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,235
I thought the hadron cannon was still in development.

353
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,674
They made the beams converge?!

354
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:01,591
But I wanted to be the one to perfect that system!

355
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:05,751
Hmm, looks like integrating
the Gefjun Disturber has worked.

356
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:08,590
But that float system is more advanced than mine.

357
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:12,052
So my opponent is the Earl of Pudding, I guess.

358
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,424
We were collaborating inadvertently.

359
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,372
Oh, how distasteful.

360
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,597
Kururugi, is the Lancelot still operational?

361
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,722
Zero. I thought so.

362
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,761
It's Zero?

363
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:26,786
Is that an open channel?!

364
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:27,345
Yes!

365
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,241
Then stay with that source and find out what he's after!

366
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,155
An energy filler?

367
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,805
I'm going to take out the enemy command center.

368
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,323
What will you do?

369
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:38,975
What?!

370
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,063
Sorry Zero, but you're not going to get your wish.

371
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:53,782
I'm going to hit them first... my way.

372
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,118
Resume attack!

373
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:06,180
Stop them! Stop Kururugi and Zero!

374
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:15,308
Zero! Shouldn't we be fighting together as comrades?

375
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,983
Don't you care about Japan?

376
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,924
The Black Knights stand against anyone

377
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,990
who uses violence unjustly for their own selfish ends!

378
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:24,547
Selfish?! I'm doing this for Japan!

379
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:25,628
Sawasaki!

380
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:29,138
If this is for Japan, why did you
run away to the Chinese Federation?!

381
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,330
You should have stayed, for everyone's sake!

382
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,049
You're still a child!

383
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:38,609
A joint operation... Gawain!

384
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,215
Lancelot.

385
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,280
So Suzaku and Lelouch are...!

386
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,090
What?! Zero?!

387
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,156
Yes, he saved Kururugi.

388
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:52,362
Fighting on our side? What the hell is he thinking?!

389
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:56,566
So his tactic was to bring the
Gawain in alone to get past the Britannians.

390
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:57,726
That was brilliant.

391
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:01,400
Maybe, but the Guren MK-II
could have acted as a shield for them.

392
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,857
It's not like I can go home
or back to school at this point.

393
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,740
After all our battles, to be
working with the Lancelot is just...

394
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,234
What's necessary here is not victory.

395
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:14,778
The Black Knights' participation
in this battle is an undeniable truth.

396
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,787
Of course, it will never be officially reported,

397
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,834
but the rumors will spread and
everyone will know what happened here.

398
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,193
As Zero said, this will show
the world exactly where we stand.

399
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,900
Protecting the nation is our first commitment.

400
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,945
What's wrong with going to another country,

401
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,053
then waiting for the right moment to strike?

402
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,072
That's an effective strategy, isn't it?

403
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,956
We can set up a new line of defense at Kagoshima.

404
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,131
Right. I appreciate your help.

405
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,940
Huh? Huh?!

406
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:49,440
Sawasaki! That's far enough.

407
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,320
I-Impossible!

408
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:55,661
They took the largest fortress in
all of Kyushu with hardly any effort!

409
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:02,749
The terrorism in the Kyushu block led
by an anti-government group was stopped

410
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,971
by Princess Cornelia's sudden attack.

411
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:09,432
Atsushi Sawasaki and four members of
the former Japanese government were arrested.

412
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:12,703
Over half the Chinese Federation
troops were captured as well.

413
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:14,251
In response to this incident,

414
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:17,957
Chinese Federation leaders are
asserting this was an unauthorized action

415
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:20,593
by General Tsao of the Liaodong District,

416
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:25,649
and they are requesting all POWs be released
in accordance with the Tibet Convention.

417
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:30,636
Warrant Officer Kururugi, reporting for duty.

418
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:33,763
Welcome back home, Suzaku.

419
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,618
Uh, I...

420
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:45,643
I...

421
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,805
Suzaku, I finally understand my heart.

422
00:21:55,046 --> 00:22:00,054
It's not that I expect an ideal country
or perfect justice or anything complicated like that.

423
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:03,223
I just want to see people smiling, that's all.

424
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:06,306
The smiles of the people I love now

425
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,820
and the people I loved before as well.

426
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:11,718
Will you help me?

427
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:13,671
Will you be my knight?

428
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:17,293
I will, Your Highness.

429
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:53,014
Now that Sawasaki's been stopped,
we have to make our next move quickly!

430
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,994
Also I need to build a place where Nunnally can be happy.

431
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,824
And for that, I need to create a nation
that can drive a wedge into the world.

432
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,977
Things are proceeding well towards destruction.

433
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,343
And when the time comes, I'll deal with
Cornelia and Schneizel at the same time!
