1
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:07,814
Lelouch, a young, outcast prince of
Britannia, possesses two great powers:

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,866
One of them is Geass,

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:13,960
the absolute ability to compel any
person to do whatever he commands.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,878
The other is the Black Knights,

5
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:21,560
his military force assembled with the intent of
destroying the Britannian Empire ruled by his father.

6
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:26,163
Veiling his true identity behind
a mask and the code name Zero,

7
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:29,318
Lelouch has made his move to avenge his mother's murder

8
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:33,658
and to create a world in which his
younger sister Nunnally can find happiness.

9
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,580
What will be the final outcome of these actions?

10
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,327
At this point, no one can predict.

11
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:26,033
Hm? A Britannian?

12
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,058
Looks too confident to be a spy.

13
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,462
An extremist?

14
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,685
Isn't it wonderful how the
number of recruits keeps growing?

15
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,975
And it was simpler than I ever expected.

16
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,129
"While I bitterly hate the Britannians,

17
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:40,061
I refuse to condone terrorism."

18
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,617
That's the prevailing view of most Elevens.

19
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:46,687
Then basically, Elevens support
the Black Knights for the most part.

20
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:50,043
Which in turn, makes it easier
for us to operate as a whole.

21
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:53,804
It's a huge help that the people don't
report our activities to the Britannians.

22
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,935
Plus, I hear some group called "Kyoto"
offered to send us some Knightmares.

23
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,825
The number of informants has been increasing quickly, too.

24
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,721
The Japanese can't resist jumping on the bandwagon.

25
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:06,825
They hear a well-grounded buzzword, and off they go.

26
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,755
Hence the big "Knights for Justice" act?

27
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,785
Yeah, well, everybody loves a hero.

28
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,438
And what better hero than a knight.

29
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:16,325
I kinda doubt that's what a
real Knight for Justice would say.

30
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,527
You don't think so?

31
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,125
Yes, I was demoted from my position.

32
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,387
In very much the same way that you were.

33
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,979
We have no intention of letting
the situation end this way.

34
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:28,781
And we have the sneaking suspicion that you don't, either.

35
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,339
That so? Well, who can say?

36
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,590
We have a lead that might help us find Zero!

37
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:35,527
You're familiar with Ashford Private Academy?

38
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,004
I want to investigate a male student attending there.

39
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,919
I think he may be working with Zero.

40
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,425
Viletta and I are going to be shipping
out with the military soon for duty,

41
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,812
and we'll be stationed in the Narita mountains.

42
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:46,671
Therefore...

43
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:47,592
Narita?

44
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:51,929
Isn't that where the Japan Liberation
Front headquarters are rumored to be located?

45
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,540
You may be a bit too clever for your own good.

46
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,321
Heh, you overestimate me.

47
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,508
Wow, it's amazing!

48
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,219
These are Glasgows, aren't they?

49
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,390
Burais. A Japanese modification.

50
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:06,075
I've never seen these before!

51
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,496
Man, the Black Knights have got some serious muscle!

52
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,725
It wasn't easy to sign up with the B.K.

53
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,468
So, that makes us special, huh?

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,515
We're elite! I'm totally amped!

55
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,810
Those guys from Kyoto, they believe in us.

56
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,085
They sent us this.

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,133
A completely-made Japanese Knightmare!

58
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:22,504
The Guren MK-II.

59
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,777
Did you check out the manual?

60
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,146
The Radiant Wave Surger? What a weapon!

61
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,348
Heh, heh! I'm really lovin' this!

62
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,725
The big shots in Kyoto are recognizing us!

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,002
We've got their approval!

64
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,019
Tamaki-san!

65
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:33,602
Huh?

66
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,665
Would you show me how to use this equipment here?

67
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,223
Oh, sure, hang on! I'll be right there!

68
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,460
Newbies. What're you gonna do?

69
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:46,763
First Tamaki, and now Inoue and the
rest are treating this like a party.

70
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:47,352
Ah...

71
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:50,973
Kyoto is backing multiple resistance groups, correct?

72
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,529
Yes, which means that we finally made it in.

73
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,637
They know that we're worthy.

74
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,337
No, you're wrong there, Kallen.

75
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,923
This is merely a test they've put to us.

76
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,600
So, what if it is? This is still incredible!

77
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,000
You are an optimist.

78
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:07,565
What's this?

79
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,015
The Guren MK-II is yours now, Kallen.

80
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:13,775
Mine?! But we have a lot more people
now, and we can't afford to lose you.

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,556
We need the Guren's defenses to protect you...

82
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,092
You're a top-notch pilot.

83
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:19,543
I'm a commander. I'll use a Burai,

84
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,127
but you're our only ace to play during a battle.

85
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,757
Besides, you have reason to fight.

86
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:27,414
Right.

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,058
Zero. You got a second?

88
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,181
We got some weird intel here from a Britannian
who wants to join up with the Black Knights.

89
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:34,783
Hmm?

90
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:38,046
This may be a trap to draw us out.

91
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,705
I'd say even if we want to confirm the information,

92
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,850
it's too risky to contact him directly.

93
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,631
But news like this isn't something we can just ignore.

94
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:46,621
What should we do?

95
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,952
This weekend, we're going hiking.

96
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,808
What?

97
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,218
To the Narita mountains.

98
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,833
Very well, then.

99
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:59,117
Sayoko, we won't need any
breakfast for my brother this morning.

100
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,078
He's going out?

101
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:03,212
He'll be leaving on a three-day trip starting today.

102
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,404
Oh, I see.

103
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,785
My, your brother's been going out quite a bit recently.

104
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,004
Think it's a girlfriend?

105
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:10,350
Maybe it is...

106
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:16,145
Sector 5, nothing to report.

107
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,161
Right.

108
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,680
The next scheduled report will be in two hours.

109
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,410
Of course there's nothing to report.

110
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:25,087
This area's controlled by the Japan Liberation Front.

111
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,725
No one can just stroll in... Huh?

112
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,391
Huh?

113
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:28,840
Zero!

114
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,161
Relax. I only came to talk.

115
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,325
I want you to ignore any unusual
activity during your watch.

116
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,798
Sure, no problem.

117
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:44,947
C'mon, it's your turn.

118
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,684
What's the rush? We're just on regular duty, y'know?

119
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,063
I've confirmed the signal from Zero.

120
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,703
We're now moving to way point 2.

121
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,881
Hey, why doesn't Zero just use the radio in his Burai?

122
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:04,533
What d'ya suppose he meant when he said "hiking"?

123
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,523
Uh, military training, right?

124
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,749
Only with Zero in another location?

125
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,396
Maybe we'll dig a hot spring.

126
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,217
Is that why we brought those excavators?

127
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:13,690
Then hell, I'm all for it.

128
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,907
Kallen, you heard anything about this?

129
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:17,403
I haven't.

130
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,288
You, Ohgi?

131
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,683
Nope, not a word.

132
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,826
Zero isn't using the radio to avoid being traced.

133
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,337
Is he serious about this?

134
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,536
The day I've waited for has finally come, Cornelia.

135
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:29,680
Hmm?

136
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:35,374
We're certain that the Japan Liberation
Front's headquarters are in this area.

137
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,584
We've already split four battalions into
seven units and hidden them in the vicinity.

138
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,542
We've only to wait for the viceroy's signal, then
we'll surround them in one fell swoop and wipe them out.

139
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:48,348
And are you confident that the enemy
won't show up outside the encirclement line?

140
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:48,848
Hmm?

141
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:49,878
You mean Zero?

142
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,211
Have no fear about that.

143
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:55,830
As the operation begins, we'll be blocking off
the surrounding highways and mountain roads, also.

144
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,280
Plus, we have reserve units.

145
00:07:57,305 --> 00:08:00,286
If Zero's stupid enough to
show up, it'll be the end of him.

146
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:01,850
What?!

147
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,071
You wanna meet her?! Are you kidding?!

148
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:05,551
Do you know who you're talking about?!

149
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,892
She's a princess and you're just a citizen.

150
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,584
What do you have in common aside from that hoteljacking?

151
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:11,319
Yes, but...

152
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,618
As for Princess Euphemia...

153
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,644
I never got to thank her.

154
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,583
Hmm... There was a time when my family
name had the influence to arrange that.

155
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:23,669
So tell me, Nina, do you know what the
social status is of a Principal's granddaughter?

156
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,567
Um... not a very high one?

157
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,747
Correct. Not very.

158
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,209
C.C.! What are you doing here?

159
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:32,887
I said that I would protect you, didn't I?

160
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,385
Aren't you over doing it?

161
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,773
I've been wondering about something, Lelouch.

162
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:38,028
Why are you Lelouch?

163
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,634
I don't have time to discuss philosophy with you.

164
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,438
You changed your family surname to Lamperouge,

165
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:46,313
but you kept Lelouch, the name
that was given to you at birth.

166
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:49,480
How sentimental. You can't let go of the past.

167
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:52,147
Well, C.C. swings to the other extreme, doesn't it?

168
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,651
It's not a human name.

169
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:03,291
Lelouch... do you know why snow is white?

170
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:04,530
Hmm...?

171
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:08,693
Snow is white because it's forgotten
what color it's supposed to be.

172
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,617
All units are in position.

173
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:12,476
Understood.

174
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,696
Euphemia will provide logistical
support from G1, as planned.

175
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,297
Have her command the medical group.

176
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,584
Yes, Your Highness.

177
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,398
Princess Cornelia...

178
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,963
Guilford, let me guess:

179
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,677
This is about Euphy, isn't it?

180
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:24,465
Yes.

181
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,750
She really should be in a government agency, not...

182
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:29,333
But she's being unusually stubborn about this.

183
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:32,440
She told me she wanted to see actual combat for herself.

184
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,719
Hmm?

185
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,251
What's that unit there, holding to the rear?

186
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,921
Our reserve force with an Eleven pilot.

187
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,875
What?! You mean that's the Lancelot?

188
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,777
As a rule, Numbers aren't
permitted to operate Knightmares,

189
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,719
but that particular unit is an exception.

190
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,910
The second prince is the patron of that unit.

191
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,265
We have no say over their personnel selection.

192
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:54,290
But he said he wants them to have as
many chances at real combat as possible.

193
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,596
Are you really going through with this?

194
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,188
Our opponent is Cornelia,

195
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,859
whose forces are among the best Britannia has to offer.

196
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,642
Then why don't we cooperate
with the Japan Liberation front?

197
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,634
What was that?

198
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:09,321
Oghi, don't you believe in me any more?

199
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,554
What d'you mean?!

200
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,775
I was the one who asked you to be our leader!

201
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,831
Don't you remember?!

202
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,009
Then there's only one answer to give.

203
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,770
Uh. Right...

204
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,643
Viceroy, it's time.

205
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:22,096
Right. Commence operation!

206
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,356
You, the Japan Liberation Front.

207
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:29,098
You, who time has left behind.

208
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,332
You, who have forgotten basic human decency.

209
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:37,790
You and your dream of a bygone golden
age shall fall and rot to nothingness.

210
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,029
We're under enemy attack?!

211
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,727
Yes, sir! The Britannian forces have
completely encircled the Narita mountains!

212
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,597
We've counted over 100 units!

213
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,617
It's begun.

214
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:52,404
Huh?! What the hell...?!

215
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,046
You've gotta be kidding, Zero!

216
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,106
Those troops coming in have
this whole area totally surrounded!

217
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:58,048
There's no way out!

218
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,698
We've already been cut off!

219
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,524
Our only chance of surviving now is to fight!

220
00:11:03,138 --> 00:11:05,513
What?! We can't fight the Britannians!

221
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,552
Lemme get this straight:

222
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:08,461
We're surrounded, and you want us to fight them head on?!

223
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,373
And we'd be fighting against Cornelia!

224
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,719
Her forces are far stronger than any we've encountered!

225
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:15,494
Correct. It would be a miracle if we win this.

226
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,113
Zero, what're you saying?!

227
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:20,662
Even messiahs need to perform
miracles if they're to be acknowledged!

228
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,598
Therefore, we have to produce our own miracle, don't we?

229
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,740
Now look, pulling this off isn't gonna be cheap!

230
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,390
The price could be our lives!

231
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:29,652
I knew it was insane to make you our leader!

232
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,015
It should be me!

233
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,563
Our path of retreat has been cut off.

234
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,163
If you think you can win without me, then shoot me.

235
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:43,394
Someone. Anyone.

236
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,230
Since you've joined the Black Knights,

237
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,817
you have only two choices:

238
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,409
You may either live with me...

239
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,842
or you may perish with me!

240
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:11,267
We're completely surrounded, and our underground
reserve forces were captured all at once!

241
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,911
General Katase, we've received a message
from Cornelia's forces demanding our surrender!

242
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:20,546
Imbecile! If we fall here, then we've lost,
and the whole resistance movement falls with us!

243
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:21,407
Then, General...

244
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,295
Do we engage the enemy in battle, or do we dig in?

245
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,484
What about Tohdoh? Where is he?!

246
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,801
He's gone to Kyoto to get the custom Burais!

247
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,921
The four Holy Swords are traveling with him, too.

248
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,815
If they're on schedule, they
should be returning soon, but...

249
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,959
Tohdoh won't make it in time.

250
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,705
Prepare to send out the Burais!

251
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,300
We'll break the encirclement on one side and evacuate!

252
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,826
We'll show them the Japanese spirit and pride!

253
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:45,490
This is our moment of truth!

254
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,853
We believe that the enemy's main
base is located in the mountains here,

255
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,646
but we haven't pinpointed it yet.

256
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,388
However, until we obtain a list of their collaborators,

257
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:58,104
we can't burn down everything with our aerial bombing.

258
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,980
The enemy is engaging our encirclement, and
they'll try to break through at some point.

259
00:13:02,044 --> 00:13:04,694
From there, we'll be able to
ascertain where their base is.

260
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,984
Our forces are divided into three fronts:

261
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:11,749
The units led by General Darlton here,
General Alex here, and Viceroy Cornelia here.

262
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,786
As for our flanking forces... Wh-What...?

263
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,638
It's enemy ECM.

264
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:20,105
The main enemy force should be coming out any time now.

265
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,928
We're switching to ECCM mode.

266
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:23,673
Link up on channel alpha-four!

267
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:26,057
The enemy... what are we calling them again?

268
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:27,098
Burais, sir.

269
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:30,144
Right. They're rather like
pseudo-Glasgows, so watch out for em.

270
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,230
Yes, my lord!

271
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,953
How clever. They turned this
whole mountain into a fortress.

272
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,523
Your Highness, please fall back!

273
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,994
Guilford, don't treat me as
though I'm another one of your women.

274
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:45,888
Princess Cornelia!

275
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:47,423
It's... Cornelia!

276
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:49,480
Don't panic! Take out the leader!

277
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,071
Insolent worms!

278
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,292
Right. Well then, I'll cover you from the rear.

279
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,903
Heh.

280
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,159
Well?! Cornelia is here!

281
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,342
is there no one who will challenge me?!

282
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,197
What's wrong?

283
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,437
Challenge me, and try to take me down!

284
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,228
All right, fine! Do what you want!

285
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,212
We acknowledge you as our leader, Zero.

286
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,498
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

287
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,493
An evacuation order has been issued for this area!

288
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:24,801
Anyone remaining must evacuate at once!

289
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:27,126
I repeat, an evacuation order has been...

290
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,937
Why did they choose this place?

291
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:33,163
If the military should find the
experimental data on Code R, it's all over!

292
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,332
Oh my. Being inside the terrorist's area,

293
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,607
we thought it would be difficult for them to discover us.

294
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:41,565
This was all General Bartley's decision,
so there's no use complaining about it.

295
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,181
They're too fragile.

296
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,938
The enemy seems to be concentrated over here.

297
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:50,365
This may be the target!

298
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,055
Split up now!

299
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,355
No good! Our second attack wave had no effect!

300
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,254
Their sheer dominance is insurmountable!

301
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:03,628
General Darlton, based on the
analysis of the enemy's movements,

302
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:08,255
I've determined that the entrance to the JLF
main base is that lodge located up on that mountain.

303
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:11,430
I believe the proper word for this situation is "bingo."

304
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:13,223
Well, to be more precise, sir, it'd be...

305
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:15,843
Oh, just call it in already, Mr. Literal.

306
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,549
Is that... Darlton?

307
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,953
So, that's where the main enemy base is located?

308
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,394
Right. We'll be securing our position here.

309
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,814
Are you sure about this?

310
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,816
I don't need to steal achievements from my subordinates.

311
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,257
Send the reserve force to back up Darlton!

312
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,274
Looks like he'll be getting another medal.

313
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,742
Impressive as always, Cornelia.

314
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,242
A very logical deployment.

315
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:41,058
However, excellent though it is, it's also easy to read.

316
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,778
As is your location.

317
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:46,504
I thought the reserve units were
supposed to be assigned to General Darlton?

318
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,490
That's right, they were.

319
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,171
But our unit has to secure the
rear line of Viceroy Cornelia.

320
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,667
You mean this is the rear line?!

321
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:53,748
You can't get any farther away from the battlefield!

322
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:57,391
How am I going to redeem my reputation
out here if I'm not even near the fighting?!

323
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:00,390
We've lost contact with Nakamura's unit!

324
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:01,898
No response from Sector 3!

325
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,434
Major Tabata's been killed!

326
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,209
Kuroda and Kurata are gone, too!

327
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:06,400
What about Nagai?!

328
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:08,395
Where is Tohdoh?!

329
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:11,471
If only he were here, the divine wind would blow!

330
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:14,042
We'd have another miracle of Itsukushima!

331
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:15,159
Look out!

332
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:19,207
Sir, don't you think this is a little extreme?

333
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:21,852
Asahina, Chiba! Prep the custom Burais ASAP!

334
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,812
Tell Urabe and Senba behind us to do the same.

335
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:28,993
Traffic is blocked off all around
Narita, and they've already begun to attack!

336
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:30,987
I just pray that we're in time.

337
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,859
Now, any resistance still remaining in Area 11...

338
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:42,482
...will soon be finished.

339
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,796
Right! All preparations have now been completed!

340
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:48,249
Black Knights, prepare to move out!

341
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:50,800
Dammit, we have no choice!

342
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:51,883
I don't wanna die!

343
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,354
We'll make a miracle happen!

344
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,095
Yeah, we'll have Zero with us!

345
00:16:55,196 --> 00:17:00,266
We, the Black Knights, are going to launch a surprise
attack on the Britannians from the summit of the mountain!

346
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:04,045
Per my instructions, you will charge
en masse down toward point three!

347
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:09,047
And the intent of this operation is to
capture Cornelia, second princess of Britannia!

348
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:12,198
Our breakthrough route will be opened by the Guren MK-II.

349
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,630
Kallen! Use penetrating electrode number 3!

350
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,198
Settle things with one blow!

351
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,010
Got it!

352
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,321
Output confirmed.

353
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:24,307
Wave surger levels ready and holding.

354
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,407
Activating gauntlet now!

355
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:48,470
It worked!

356
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,048
What's happening?!

357
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:02,805
Is this an earthquake?!

358
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,132
At a time like this?!

359
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,219
What the hell?!

360
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,896
What's happening?!

361
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,751
Impossible! How could a landslide come out of nowhere?!

362
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:13,356
Alex's and Darlton's units are getting wiped out!

363
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,288
Climb! Get to higher ground!

364
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,040
Status report!

365
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,501
We're still trying to confirm!

366
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:21,561
Your Highness, pull back! You're in danger there!

367
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:23,298
I don't care! Forget about me!

368
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,685
Find out about Darlton! And where is Alex?!

369
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,915
Will this place hold together?!

370
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,832
The central area should make it through!

371
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:30,809
Oh, my!

372
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,121
At this rate, they'll be swept all the way to the bottom.

373
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,561
These heat readings are abnormal.

374
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,485
Do you believe a hydro-volcanic
eruption was artificially induced?

375
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,178
Impossible. Unless, of course, someone's
used Rakshata's Radiant Wave Surger.

376
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:42,876
Has something happened?

377
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:43,609
Uh-huh...

378
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,121
But it has nothing to do with us,

379
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,197
so just relax and continue waiting.

380
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:48,832
Ah...

381
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,996
Hmph... It's even more destructive than I anticipated.

382
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:02,932
We did succeed in isolating Cornelia's unit,
but we could have been a bit more accurate.

383
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,447
Perhaps I should have consulted a physics teacher?

384
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,472
Or asked Nina to tutor me in probability?

385
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,784
New enemy force confirmed moving in from the summit.

386
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,742
Carius unit is moving to engage them.

387
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:16,320
Hoping to take advantage of all the confusion, are they?

388
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,185
Emergency call from Carius unit!

389
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:19,297
What's wrong?

390
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,239
It's not the Japan Liberation Front!

391
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,114
They think it's... the Black Knights!

392
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,334
What?! Then it's...

393
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,255
Zero!

394
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:26,982
How dare he show up here?!

395
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,972
ZERO!

396
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:30,287
Lord Jeremiah, you can't just abandon your post!

397
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:32,110
This requires drastic measures!

398
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,510
If you want glory in life, then follow me!

399
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:37,809
Cornelia has only limited reinforcements headed her way.

400
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,289
Smash right through them!

401
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:40,981
Yeah! We can do this now!

402
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:44,012
All right, everybody, you know the game plan.

403
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,716
Our job is to watch their backs!

404
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,325
Get ready... FIRE!

405
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,622
The enemy's taken out Carius' unit?!

406
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,638
If I can finish this before
Zero reaches Princess Cornelia,

407
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,643
then I'll be golden!

408
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:57,852
Lord Jeremiah!

409
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,155
Viletta, you came!

410
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,568
I knew that you would!

411
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,364
Burn the bridges behind you,
and keep your back to the wall.

412
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,291
Classical strategies remain effective ones, don't they?

413
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:07,566
Zero!

414
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,270
Ugh! Dammit!

415
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:13,862
Is Zero here?! If he is, then face me!

416
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,576
Come forward, and fight Jeremiah Gottwald!

417
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:19,191
Well, well... it's been a while, Jeremiah.

418
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,773
So, you're still in the army?

419
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,980
I'd love to stay and catch up,

420
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,312
but I'm afraid I don't have time
right this minute, "Orange boy."

421
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:30,762
O-Ora-a-a-a-a-a-a... Orange?!

422
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,497
DIE!

423
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:38,673
Lord Jeremiah!

424
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:41,077
Stay out of this! This is my duel!

425
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:42,251
But look at it!

426
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:44,371
I've never seen a Knightmare like that before!

427
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,322
Is it possible that the Elevens have...

428
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:49,464
You think Elevens are capable of such technology?!

429
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:53,136
It's fast!

430
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:56,735
This thing...

431
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,829
Is this what destroyed Carius' unit?!

432
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:00,323
Yeah, that's right, Britannia!

433
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:03,060
We can finally go up against
you on an equal footing, head on!

434
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:06,633
And our counterattack begins
with this baby, the Guren MK-II!

435
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:10,690
Oh, hell! There's something on its right hand!

436
00:21:11,347 --> 00:21:13,039
But if I keep my distance...

437
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:14,784
What's this?!

438
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:20,646
Sorry.

439
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:34,098
Wha-What the hell's happening?!

440
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,497
Lord Jeremiah, eject!

441
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:38,181
I can't run now! Zero's right in front of me!

442
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,028
He's standing right here!

443
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:44,825
Dammit! The auto-eject! Don't you dare activate!

444
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,304
I can still get Zero...!

445
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:48,594
I know it! I know I can still get him...!

446
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,661
I won't lose. Not with this.

447
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,607
Guren MK-II!

448
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,976
She defeated Lord Jeremiah.

449
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,415
Who are the Black Knights? Who are they, these warriors?!

450
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,294
All our tasks at hand have been cleared.

451
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:12,988
The pieces are in position.

452
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:16,068
The only thing left to do is
check my opponent's stronghold.

453
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,904
Decision time!

454
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:54,604
Even Cornelia will lose with
only limited allied reinforcements.

455
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,752
Plus, we have the Guren MK-II.

456
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,948
I'll capture her.

457
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:00,660
Then at last I'll learn the truth about my mother's death!

458
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:03,085
And once she's my prisoner... I win.

459
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:04,960
Barring any unforeseen events,

460
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,266
my Black Knights will claim victory!
