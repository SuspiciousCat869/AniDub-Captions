1
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:29,977
Huh?

2
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:35,899
The date was August 10 in the
year 2010 of the Imperial calendar.

3
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:39,984
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

4
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:43,600
The far east island nation
had held fast to its neutrality,

5
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,202
and now Britannia looms as the world's only superpower.

6
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:51,690
Rights to Japan's underground
resources became a hotly disputed issue,

7
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:56,137
straining the already deep-rooted
diplomatic tensions between the two sides.

8
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:58,533
In the deciding battle for the mainland,

9
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:03,240
Britannian forces introduced into combat
the humanoid autonomous armored knight

10
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,380
known as the Knightmare Frame.

11
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,740
The enemies forces were far greater than anticipated,

12
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:13,634
and the Knightmares obliterated the Japanese
line of defense on the mainland with little effort.

13
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,894
Japan became a dominion of the empire.

14
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:21,394
The country was stripped of its freedom, its rights,

15
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:22,779
and its name.

16
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:24,617
Area 11.

17
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:29,811
The defeated and once-proud nation of
Japan was re-christened with a mere number.

18
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:36,117
I swear...

19
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:36,691
Huh?

20
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:39,128
I swear, Suzaku, so help me!

21
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,245
I will one day... obliterate Britannia!

22
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:31,283
This is Alpha 3.

23
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:36,558
Target is traveling from Delta-12 toward
Delta-14 at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour.

24
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,316
CCP to all mobile units.

25
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,850
Declaring a code 3 from floor 5 to floor 2.

26
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:44,078
All units, take 2-8-8. I want the target intact.

27
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,850
Here's video footage of yesterday's
terrorist bombings in Osaka.

28
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:52,136
The Secretary reported 59 casualties in this incident.

29
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,260
8 Britannians and 51 others.

30
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,166
You're out of time.

31
00:03:57,558 --> 00:04:00,350
From here on, you'll make your moves every 20 seconds.

32
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,928
Huh! Very well, I'm game.

33
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:09,082
Hm? Did your substitute arrive?

34
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,001
Thank heavan, I'm saved.

35
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,833
Are things going well at school?

36
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,710
What have we here? School boys?

37
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,313
Hmph.

38
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,853
Well, look at this, a nobleman.

39
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:25,183
I envy you kids today, you
have so much time on your hands.

40
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,831
Time for regrets...

41
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,058
What's your name?

42
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,324
Lelouch. Lamperouge.

43
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,575
Whoa, now wait a minute!

44
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,124
You can't win this one, it's impossible. Right?

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,501
Rivalz.

46
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:35,926
Huh?

47
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,783
When do you think we would have to leave

48
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,617
in order to make our next class?

49
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,908
Uh, 20 minutes, if we bust our hump.

50
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,492
Then be sure that you drive safely on the way back.

51
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,187
Huh?!

52
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,517
I'll need nine minutes.

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,461
And by the way, about yesterday...

54
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:52,033
Understood, sir. We'll discuss it later.

55
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,326
Nine minutes?

56
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,846
You only have 20 seconds per move.

57
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,408
Enough time.

58
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:58,111
Hm?

59
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,798
You start with the king?

60
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:04,742
Where's Lelouch?

61
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,117
He went somewhere with Rivalz.

62
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,433
What, maybe it's poker this time?

63
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,850
They seem to forget that they're on the student council!

64
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:12,566
They're off gambling for money!

65
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,017
Lulu may be smart, yet he
wastes his brain on stupid things!

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,141
If he'd only apply himself in
school, he'd get high grades!

67
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:23,053
"Oh, I wish my darling Lulu would be a serious young man."

68
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,492
How adorable is that?!

69
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,053
Uh. Please, Madam President...

70
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,015
Perfect!

71
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,316
After we finally steal this damn thing!

72
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:34,100
It's all because Tamaki couldn't stick to Naota's plan!

73
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:35,600
And now we've got a problem!

74
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,839
I love playing against the nobility!

75
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:41,102
When they lose, they always pay out of pride.

76
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,146
By the way, 8 minutes, 32 seconds is a new record!

77
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,786
He also didn't have much time to move, either.

78
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,347
And as opponents go, the nobles are tepid.

79
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,992
They're just over-privileged parasites, that's all.

80
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,338
Well then, why don't you challenge one of the Elevens?

81
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,183
They're nothing like us Britannians.

82
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:56,905
Huh?

83
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,662
What're they trying to prove by killing innocent people?

84
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,221
Those Elevens terrify me.

85
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,985
We apologize for the delay.

86
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:07,730
Now, His Royal Highness Prince Clovis, third
prince of Britannia, will address the nation.

87
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:11,381
To all my imperial subjects!

88
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,750
Including, of course, the many cooperative
Elevens who choose to serve the empire of Britannia!

89
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,915
We're not "Elevens," we're Japanese!

90
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,444
Do you not see my pain?

91
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,767
My heart was ripped from my chest only to be torn apart!

92
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,516
The remnants are filled with rage and sadness!

93
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:29,155
However, as ruler of Area 11,

94
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,946
I will not tolerate terrorism of any kind!

95
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,652
Because the battle we fight is a righteous one!

96
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,528
A virtuous battle to protect
the well-being of one and all!

97
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:39,995
Now then, everyone,

98
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:45,438
I would like you to join me in observance of
the eight who died for justice in the line of duty.

99
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,750
A moment of silence, please.

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,358
Well, aren't you gonna join in?

101
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:50,419
Aren't you?

102
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,658
Heh! It's sort of embarrassing.

103
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,199
And I agree with you.

104
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:58,071
Besides, spilling tears over those people
won't bring them back to life, now will it?

105
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,992
Dang! That's dark, buddy!

106
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:02,058
It's all about self-satisfaction.

107
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:04,134
Doesn't matter how hard you try.

108
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,433
You can't do it.

109
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:07,746
There's no way you can change the world.

110
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,707
You were magnificent, Your Highness!

111
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:13,867
One would never guess that you were
attending a party while doing that!

112
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,558
After all, the viceroy is the marquee actor of Area 11.

113
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:19,517
I need to change costumes quickly.

114
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,826
My! You're so self-confident!

115
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:23,492
It's all in the performance.

116
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:26,576
Since the media want a
charismatic prince, I give them one.

117
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:32,308
Untrue! Prince Clovis, our key purpose in life is
to support and assist your reign in any way we can!

118
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:34,350
His reign is a pathetic sham.

119
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,475
Y-Your Highness!

120
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,808
Huh? A soldier?

121
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,664
Gad, how boorish of you.

122
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,142
I beg your pardon, Your Highness, m'lord...

123
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,933
Not another appearance for him.

124
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:43,933
Hope it's not as dreary.

125
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,884
You fool!

126
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:45,617
Hm?

127
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:49,163
The police were informed that
it's medical equipment, that's all.

128
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:50,658
If we scramble the army, there'll be a record...

129
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,703
Deploy the Royal Guard! The Knightmares as well!

130
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,148
Alert 1! Alert 1!

131
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,950
4th, 7th and 8th Rapid Reaction Companies

132
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,339
as well as the 31st Air Assault Team, immediate scramble!

133
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,764
Special Division Nine, stand by for deployment!

134
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,325
That first move you made.

135
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,892
Hm?

136
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,491
Why'd you start with the king?

137
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:16,679
If the king doesn't lead, how can
he expect his subordinates to follow?

138
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,200
What's with that?

139
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,060
With what?

140
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:22,200
Do you fantasize about running a major corporation?

141
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,024
No way.

142
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,867
Ambitions like that will ruin your health.

143
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,182
Waaaagggh! We're gonna die!

144
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,140
You idiot! Watch where you're going!

145
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,957
No, not that way!

146
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,058
Eh... Was that our fault?

147
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,265
I don't think so.

148
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,027
Uh?

149
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,825
Control, the target has crashed at the
abandoned V.O. building construction site.

150
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,725
The military will take over General Bartley's command.

151
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:51,414
Him?!

152
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,421
We have to retrieve it at all costs!

153
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,410
That thing... in the wrong hands...

154
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,788
What the...?

155
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,600
Oh, man, this sucks!

156
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:02,867
Looks like the power line on the bike got cut.

157
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,142
Yeah... Rivalz, come check this out.

158
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,667
Hey! Over here!

159
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,870
Whoa... nasty crash.

160
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:10,725
What happened, some sort of accident?

161
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,875
Probably a drunk driver.

162
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,158
It's always some moron!

163
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:14,992
Hey, maybe somebody oughta go help.

164
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:17,350
Hmph. All those idiots...

165
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:20,950
Wait!

166
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,522
Look, the student rescue team has arrived!

167
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:30,044
So like, why doesn't somebody call for help, y'know?

168
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:31,486
Hey! Are you all right?

169
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,446
Yeah, yeah, I know it's the right thing to do,

170
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:41,767
but I wish the guy would quit flaunting
his pride and just give it a rest for a while.

171
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,012
Now we're gonna be late to school.

172
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,653
Nagata! Nagata!

173
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,265
Can you hear me? Are you okay?!

174
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:54,015
It's you... Finally, I have found my...

175
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,168
But where...?

176
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,258
Are you in there?

177
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,263
Stop! I'm in here!

178
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:08,847
So, would you call that a hit-and-run?

179
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,677
You'd think they'd stick a ladder on the inside, too!

180
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,158
Stop the vehicle!

181
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:17,243
Surrender now, and you'll get the
chance to defend yourself in court.

182
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,085
Stop and surrender at once!

183
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,297
Give up now, or we will shoot to kill!

184
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,142
Now whadda we do?! That's the Army!

185
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,703
Have you forgotten? That's what I'm here for!

186
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:32,975
If I jump out, I have the choice
of breaking my neck or getting shot.

187
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,632
I can try to call... Uh.

188
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:38,737
Can you enter the subway via the Azabu route?

189
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,408
Kallen! Let's use it here! Why not?!

190
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,263
Because that would mean a blood bath!

191
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,222
You're right...

192
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,350
I've seen her before...

193
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,700
Lelouch, c'mon, where are you?

194
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,600
We've gotta get to school!

195
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,917
Target is moving from the settlement toward the ghetto.

196
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:55,950
Copy that! Corner 'em!

197
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:56,801
Roger!

198
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,351
A slash harken?!

199
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:04,717
A Knightmare!

200
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:10,530
Crap! These guys are real terrorists!

201
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:13,847
You fellas know full well what this bad-ass mother can do!

202
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,600
The rest of you, back off.

203
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,995
I'll take this guy.

204
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:25,350
I can only assume you dug that
obsolete relic out of some scrap heap.

205
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:28,743
An over-the-hill Glasgow is no match for a Sutherland!

206
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:33,897
Not to mention a filthy Eleven who spurns
the compassion of our glorious emperor!

207
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:36,899
Kallen, we should both split up!

208
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,422
Both of us can't risk being killed! Run for it!

209
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:40,033
But...!

210
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,631
Heh. Simple-minded Eleven.

211
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,214
No way! It's stuck!

212
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,901
Secondhand junk!

213
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll admit, I really like your spirit.

214
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,425
However...

215
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,794
Tsk! No cell phone reception...

216
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,119
We're out of range.

217
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,658
Judging from the darkness and road surface,
we must be drivin' along the old subway lines.

218
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:12,008
They're headed for an exit somewhere in the ghetto.

219
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:13,600
Getting out will be dangerous.

220
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:15,743
Still... Okay, I've got it...

221
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,679
I'm not big on the military,
but I'll take their protection.

222
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,848
If I give them a terrorist communicator...

223
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,530
Oh, wait, I forgot...

224
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:27,075
Some friend! Leaving me behind like that!

225
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,488
Ah-ha!

226
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:29,778
What're you doing?

227
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,742
Looking at a man who blundered, am I right?

228
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,767
Why you...!

229
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,562
You really screwed this one up.

230
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,754
Terrorists came along and stole whatever

231
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,589
it was that you and Prince
Clovis were secretly working on.

232
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:43,867
Retrieving it is simple, but you want to
sweep up all of their compatriots, in addition.

233
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:46,839
Let the terrorists go, and
you can find their hideout, too.

234
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,700
Congratulations! Your reasoning was on spot on!

235
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,575
Uh, it was nothing. I just thought it was strange.

236
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,825
Okay, that's enough!

237
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,658
What is it the special corp wants outta this?

238
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,855
I'm merely saying that I'd
like to assist with the clean up.

239
00:12:58,975 --> 00:12:59,892
To assist?

240
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,985
Correct, because it's data I want.

241
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,140
Excuse me,

242
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,875
but what in the world have they just stolen, anyway?

243
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:07,767
Chemical weapons.

244
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,727
In other words... poison gas.

245
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,742
The terrorists are hiding in the subway system.

246
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,558
Your mission is to locate the weapon that they've stolen.

247
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:24,142
Investigate the old subway system that runs through

248
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,808
the Eleven residential district in the Shinjuku ghetto.

249
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,767
Report in the moment you spot them.

250
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,249
Recovery of the target will be
handled by us, the Royal Guard.

251
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,363
You people bear the honorary title of Britannians now,

252
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:36,975
but you were born Elevens.

253
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,017
Therefore, the stench of these
monkeys oughta be a familiar one.

254
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,325
If you want to earn the right to carry arms,

255
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,805
then show some results!

256
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:47,325
This is your opportunity to
show your loyalty to Britannia!

257
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,904
Yes, my lord!

258
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,767
An accident? Or else...

259
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,618
No... the tire's stuck...

260
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:09,078
Please, Ohgi... Find me...

261
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:20,152
4-0-4 has sighted the target.

262
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:21,923
Roger! Prepare for recovery!

263
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,941
Now I can use this chance to climb up.

264
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,271
Are you Britannian?

265
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,187
That's enough mindless murder!

266
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:36,367
Wait! I'm not one of...!

267
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,751
Planning to use poison gas?

268
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,362
Huh?!

269
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:39,742
Don't play dumb with me!

270
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:40,973
Get off me!

271
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,905
I'm not here by choice!

272
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,671
And if that's poison gas, it
was made in Britannia, wasn't it?

273
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:47,647
My god...

274
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,424
Mindless murder?

275
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,558
Then why don't you just obliterate Britannia!

276
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,676
Lelouch...

277
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,838
It's me. Suzaku.

278
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:01,494
You...

279
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,892
You became a Britannian soldier?

280
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:05,823
Yeah, and what about you? You're a...

281
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:06,889
What're you saying?!

282
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,785
That's not poison gas...

283
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:22,952
What is it?

284
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,693
In all the confusion, I left it in the coat.

285
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:32,600
It's okay.

286
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,200
The Glasgow's circuits are usable.

287
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,841
So, were we right?

288
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:36,650
Think so.

289
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:39,075
I bet it's poison gas, like intelligence said.

290
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,078
And Nagata?

291
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,827
I dunno. I think he made it underground.

292
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,325
Tell me the truth, Suzaku.

293
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,316
Poison gas? This girl?

294
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:53,501
Hey, it's what they told us in the briefing, I swear!

295
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:54,079
Huh?!

296
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,268
Stinking monkey.

297
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,848
Being an honorary Britannian will not excuse you!

298
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:03,367
Uh! But sir! I was told this was poison gas!

299
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,630
How dare you question orders!

300
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,358
This is bad.

301
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,775
A poisonous situation.

302
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:13,898
Which would pose a threat to
Suzaku's superiors if it's unleashed.

303
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:18,817
However, in light of your outstanding
military achievements, I'm going to be lenient.

304
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:22,230
Private Kururugi, take this and execute the terrorist.

305
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:24,680
But he's not a terrorist!

306
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,575
He's a civilian who got caught up in all this!

307
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,739
You insubordinate little...!

308
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,869
That's an order!

309
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:32,851
Didn't you swear your loyalty and your life to Britannia?!

310
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,906
Yes, but...

311
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,226
But... I can't.

312
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:36,933
Uh.

313
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,066
What?

314
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,771
I won't do it, sir.

315
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:41,808
I won't shoot a civilian.

316
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:43,862
I can't follow your orders, sir.

317
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,162
Very well.

318
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:46,993
Suzaku!

319
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:52,607
Well, Britannian school boy, not a good day to cut class.

320
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:53,959
Collect the girl.

321
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,143
After you've secured her, kill the student!

322
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,847
Yes, my lord.

323
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,873
Death to...

324
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,535
...Britannia...

325
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,898
Long live...

326
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:06,451
...Japan.

327
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,680
They got away?!

328
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,760
And you call yourselves the Royal Guard?!

329
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,492
Uh. Forgive me, my lord!

330
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,441
The blast was mainly directed upwards, but the bed...

331
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:21,039
Why the hell do you think I
only told you people about this?!

332
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:22,908
W-We'll continue the investigation.

333
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,668
The plan has moved forward to the next phase.

334
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:26,785
B... But, Your Highness!

335
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,819
If knowledge of her gets out, I'll be disinherited.

336
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,651
Tell them back home we're carrying
out a planned "urban renewal" here.

337
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:37,056
As Clovis, third prince of the empire, I command you!

338
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,089
Destroy Shinjuku ghetto! Leave no one alive!

339
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,381
W... Why are they doing this?!

340
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:53,394
Dear, let's go!

341
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,560
H... Hurry!

342
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,231
Okay, let's sweep the next floor.

343
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:02,743
The enemy is garbage that can never
hope to become even honorary Britannians!

344
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:04,564
Wipe out every last one of them!

345
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:06,811
Naturally.

346
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:08,547
Supervisor Jeremiah,

347
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,658
General Bartley requests that you take command...

348
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,575
Bartley has staff officers.

349
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:15,967
I haven't had this much fun on the front lines in ages!

350
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,072
Hmph.

351
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,603
What the hell are you?!

352
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,225
This chaos is all your fault, isn't it?!

353
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,579
Aaaggh!

354
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,043
Not only that but Britannia has...

355
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,040
They even killed Suzaku!

356
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:41,844
Not there?

357
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:43,801
It looks like he's gone to the front line.

358
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:46,183
Even though we brought the Lancelot here?

359
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,629
Now what'll do we do?

360
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,304
We steam rolled our way in here,
but we don't have a devisor to use it.

361
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,460
Stay quiet, and wait here.

362
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:58,919
Report.

363
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,781
We found only Elevens here, sir.

364
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,237
Ahhh.

365
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:03,908
You're sure of it?

366
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,433
That exit comes out here?

367
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:08,351
Yes, sir. It matches up with our map of the old city.

368
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,840
Hm?

369
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:18,455
Huh?

370
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:22,960
That jerk! He hung up on me! I can't believe it!

371
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:29,033
What an appropriate location
for a terrorist to meet his end.

372
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,312
You scum...

373
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,017
Still, you did well for a student,

374
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,707
but that's to be expected. You're a Britannian.

375
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,475
Unfortunately, my clever young friend...

376
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,394
...you have no future.

377
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:41,985
He mustn't die!

378
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,372
You shot her!

379
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:48,894
Hmph.

380
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:51,985
Our orders were to bring her back alive, if possible.

381
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,816
Oh well, nothing can be done about it now.

382
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:59,637
We'll tell our superiors that the Royal Guard
found the terrorist hideout and killed them all.

383
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:03,092
Regrettably, the female hostage
had already been tortured to death.

384
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,442
What do ya think, school boy?

385
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,397
How can this be happening?

386
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,933
First Suzaku's killed... then this girl...

387
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:13,398
Now I'm about to die...

388
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,482
...before I've had a chance to
do a single thing with my life.

389
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:18,323
It's gone in a heartbeat...

390
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,309
Nanally!

391
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:25,619
You don't want it to end here. Do you?

392
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:27,348
What?

393
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,679
You appear to have a reason for living.

394
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,602
The girl? That's impossible.

395
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,878
If I grant you power, could you go on?

396
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,890
I propose a deal.

397
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:43,162
In exchange for this power, you must
agree to make my one wish come true.

398
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:47,335
Accept this contract, and you accept its conditions.

399
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,392
While living in the world of humans,

400
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,567
you will live unlike any other.

401
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,305
A different providence...

402
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,730
A different time...

403
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:56,170
A different life.

404
00:20:57,142 --> 00:21:00,819
The power of the king will
condemn you to a life of solitude.

405
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:02,989
Are you prepared for this?

406
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,642
A convergence with the Ragnarok Connection?

407
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,694
So the myth is beginning once again?

408
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:12,358
Yes!

409
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:15,098
I hereby accept the terms of your contract!

410
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:20,567
Hm?

411
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:25,577
Say, how should a Britannian who
detests his own country live his life?

412
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,718
Are you some kind of radical?

413
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:28,773
Huh?

414
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,908
What's wrong? Why not shoot?

415
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,183
Your opponent is just a school boy.

416
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:35,355
Or have you finally realized?

417
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:39,039
The only ones who should kill are
those who are prepared to be killed!

418
00:21:40,502 --> 00:21:42,623
Uh... What's happening here?

419
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:45,350
I, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you!

420
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,650
Now, all of you...

421
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,356
DIE!

422
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,783
Happily, Your Highness!

423
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:00,678
Fire!

424
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,244
That was the turning point.

425
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,017
Since that day, I've lived a lie.

426
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,438
The lie of living.

427
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,859
My name, too, was a lie. My personal history, a lie.

428
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:22,875
Nothing but lies.

429
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,682
I was sick to death of a world that couldn't be changed.

430
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:31,123
But even in my lies, I refused to give up in despair.

431
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,851
But now this incredible power... it's mine.

432
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,707
Well, then!
