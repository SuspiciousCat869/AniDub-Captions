1
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:09,077
The date was August 10 in the
year 2010 of the Imperial calendar.

2
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,948
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

3
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:17,245
Confronted by Britannia's newest
weapon, the formidable Knightmare Frame,

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,839
Japan fell to its enemy in less than a month.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,795
The conquered nation was stripped of
its freedom, rights, culture, and dignity.

6
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,486
Finally, even its name was taken away.

7
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:28,727
Eleven.

8
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,889
The name of Japan and its people
was replaced with a mere number.

9
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,579
Why the hell are we letting the Elevens go?!

10
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,137
What about the poison gas they've stolen?!

11
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,587
But it's by order of Prince Clovis!

12
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,936
What about Bartley?!

13
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,649
Get the general staff on the line!

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,244
They're not at their posts, sir.

15
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:26,314
Are you telling me Prince Clovis is alone on the con?!

16
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,282
I'm overjoyed, Lelouch.

17
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,494
They said you died when Japan was brought into the fold.

18
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:35,579
What a blessing to have you back.

19
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:37,727
We should depart for the Homeland immediately.

20
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:40,081
So you can use me as a tool of diplomacy?

21
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:43,830
It seems you've forgotten why we
were used as tools in the first place.

22
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,077
That's right.

23
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,902
It was because my mother was killed.

24
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,385
Mother held the title of Knight of Honour,

25
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,264
but was a commoner by birth.

26
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,857
No doubt the other imperial consorts held her in contempt.

27
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,182
Even though you made it look like the work of terrorists,

28
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:08,641
I'm no fool...

29
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,990
You people killed my mother!

30
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,943
It wasn't me! I swear to you, it wasn't!

31
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:16,070
Then tell me everything you know.

32
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,961
The truth cannot be hidden from me any longer.

33
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,412
By whose hand was she slain?

34
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:35,498
My brother, second prince Schneizel, and
second princess Cornelia, they can tell you...

35
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:38,202
They were at the heart of this?

36
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:43,139
That's all that you know, isn't it?

37
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,085
I swear it wasn't me!

38
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,499
I had... nothing to do with it!

39
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,220
I believe you.

40
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,721
However...

41
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,261
Please, you can't!

42
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:00,229
We may have different mothers,
but you and I are still blood!

43
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:03,816
You can't change the world
without getting your hands dirty...

44
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:09,863
Wake up, Lelouch!

45
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,616
I know you were sleeping, your hand stopped moving!

46
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,039
Well ya don't have ta beat me up over it, do you?

47
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,256
Ahh, serves ya right for ditchin' me like that.

48
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:19,768
That's right. What was up with you yesterday?

49
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,003
Oh, well...

50
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,292
That's enough you guys. Let's not get sidetracked here.

51
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:29,648
If we don't come up with a fix for the club activities
budget, there won't be money left for anything at all.

52
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:31,298
And if it comes to that point...

53
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:33,404
The Equestrian Club'll be pissed!

54
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,789
We don't want 'em comin' in here on horseback!

55
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,921
Rivalz, can't you be a more
serious student council member?

56
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,184
You know, it woulda been nice of you if you
would've reminded us about this mess a day ago.

57
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,137
I would have to say a day
later, then we would've given up.

58
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,121
Good idea, we can still do that.

59
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,561
Guts!

60
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,884
Are you tryin' that "guts" spell again?

61
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:57,528
Yup. I want you people to
start putting your all into this.

62
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:00,229
I really don't think that your
magic's gonna do a whole lot.

63
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:02,787
Actually, it's got me going, Madame President!

64
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,771
Supple and willing, that's what I like.

65
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,997
I train hard in the gymnastics club!

66
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:08,813
That's not what I was getting at.

67
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:09,270
Huh?

68
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:10,687
You're a ten.

69
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:11,207
Huh?

70
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,750
From what I've seen in the girl's bathroom anyway.

71
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,045
You've been filling out in all the right places, huh?

72
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,802
Wh-What are you talking about, you perv?

73
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,637
Jeez, our president's just a dirty old man on the inside.

74
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:29,037
Sullying the meeting with her filthy mind.

75
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,028
Yeah, well, that's Milly for you.

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,452
Look on the bright side,

77
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:35,587
we got the budget balanced, didn't we?

78
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,212
They used poison gas?!

79
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:37,984
Huh?

80
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:39,619
Man, that's freaky!

81
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:41,798
Shinjuku's only 30 minutes from here!

82
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:43,504
Oh my god,

83
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,008
I saw smoke rising over in Shinjuku!

84
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,575
It musta been the gas.

85
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,992
Are they saying anything else about it?

86
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,413
Shinjuku?

87
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,203
I heard about it in real time from a friend.

88
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,069
That's why I called you yesterday.

89
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,640
Hey! Check out the footage of those dead Elevens!

90
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,498
Uh! Don't look at that!

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,323
This is strange... Why would they cover it up?

92
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,431
Are they hiding Clovis's death to fend off anarchy?

93
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,616
But if that's the case, when
they finally do announce it...

94
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:27,989
Hmph.

95
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,141
I guess that I'm not as tough as I thought I was.

96
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:37,605
That ex-civil servant is such a fool.

97
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,487
So, are you referring to Bartley?

98
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:42,845
The killer has breached our
heaviest security twice already.

99
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,264
This perfunctory inspection is a farce.

100
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,779
Margrave Jeremiah.

101
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:50,654
Now that Prince Clovis is out
of the way, we purebloods can...

102
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,288
Let me make that call.

103
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,863
We still need to woo everyone over.

104
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:57,016
Kallen! It's been ages!

105
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,137
Are you all right?!

106
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,431
Sophie's been worried sick all this time.

107
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,970
You're okay though, right?

108
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Yeah. I just have to go easy for a little while.

109
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,632
Of course, that's why she's so familiar.

110
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,279
Anyway, if I stay home any longer, I'll never catch up.

111
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:15,690
What's up, buddy? See something you like?

112
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,689
You've got a thing for her, don'tcha?

113
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:19,859
Just thinking this is a rare event.

114
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,090
She hasn't been here at school
since this whole term started.

115
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,546
Kallen Stadtfeld.

116
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,418
They say she's sick or something.

117
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,262
And she barely showed up school last year, either.

118
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:34,597
Still, her grades are at the top of the class.

119
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:37,622
And she's a member of the Stadtfeld family,

120
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:40,361
which means she's well-bred and rolling in money!

121
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,113
Man, you sure know how to pick 'em!

122
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:43,138
It's not like that.

123
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,702
Ah, ya don't hafta hide it.

124
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:47,104
A touch too sheltered, though, if ya ask me.

125
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,191
There's a bee! A bee!

126
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:52,648
Huh?

127
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,419
Oh my god, Kallen! Run!

128
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,784
Hurry up and run!

129
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,642
I don't get it. Why's a bee after me?

130
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,895
I wonder if there's a hive nearby.

131
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,853
God, I hate this!

132
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,743
I'm sick of acting like a freaking invalid!

133
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,928
Crap! He saw me!

134
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,408
There's no question it's her...

135
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:26,952
Can... Can I help you with something?

136
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:28,920
I want answers.

137
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,397
Of course.

138
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:39,742
Were you the one piloting the Glasgow in Shinjuku?

139
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:40,547
Yes.

140
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,053
Why terrorism?

141
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,622
Because I'm Japanese.

142
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,154
Though technically I'm half Britannian.

143
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,825
Half blood?

144
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,409
But why go so far?

145
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,057
Um... Did you want something?

146
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,644
No. I got what I wanted here.

147
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:05,451
Oh wait. Just to be sure...

148
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,770
Don't tell anyone about Shinjuku.

149
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:09,403
Uh?

150
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,939
What do you mean "about Shinjuku"?

151
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,900
Why would you say that?

152
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:15,645
Go back to class.

153
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,376
As soon as I get an answer to my question, I will!

154
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not working? What's going on here?

155
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,994
Hey, Lelou! Kallen!

156
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:31,186
You know it's time to head over to the Chem. Lab!

157
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:32,794
You better get a move on!

158
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,556
Ah, crap, it's my turn to set up for class!

159
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:39,072
It didn't work? But...

160
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,847
Well, what shall we do?

161
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,681
He may be late again this evening.

162
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:48,444
I'll wait. He said that we'd have dinner together tonight.

163
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:51,661
There now. This one's finished.

164
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:52,315
Uh?

165
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,568
A bird?

166
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,501
Yes. It's a crane.

167
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,602
Amazing. The Japanese are so skillful!

168
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,145
Lady Nunnally? Uh?

169
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,646
I'm sorry I'm so late.

170
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,855
Hi, Lelouche. Welcome home.

171
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,435
Yes, welcome home, my lord.

172
00:10:18,073 --> 00:10:20,769
No place like it, Sayoko. Right, Nunnally?

173
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,645
As you know full well,

174
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,711
the project was a complete failure.

175
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,837
Therefore, this research division is being gutted.

176
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:29,553
Wha...?!

177
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:30,143
Yes, but...

178
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,314
I've set up a place in Narita for you.

179
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:33,834
Move everything out there.

180
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,979
While we may have no memory of it,

181
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,827
the fact is, the other staff officers
and I left Prince Clovis on his own.

182
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,478
I'm gonna be called out on the
carpet for this back at home.

183
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,661
When that happens...

184
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,530
If His Majesty learns this experiment's

185
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,819
gone on without his knowledge, I...

186
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:50,803
Understood, sir!

187
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,311
We'll start prepping, immediately!

188
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:58,514
Miss Sayoko was just teaching me about the art of origami.

189
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:03,730
Fold a piece of paper the correct way and
you can make birds, boats, almost anything!

190
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:09,569
Uh, easy there, you don't have to
tell me everything all at once, you know.

191
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,465
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

192
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,622
Yeah, you're right. Thank you.

193
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,083
You're very welcome.

194
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:17,395
I'm so happy!

195
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:20,389
'Cause last night, you scared me a little.

196
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:24,696
Did I? Sorry, I just have a lot on my mind is all...

197
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:25,468
Hey.

198
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:26,150
Huh?

199
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:30,615
They say if you fold a thousand of
these cranes, your wish'll come true.

200
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:33,636
So if there's anything at all
that you've been wishing for.

201
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,280
No. Not really.

202
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,846
What about you? Do you wish for anything?

203
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,122
Hmm...

204
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:42,239
I wish the world was a gentler place.

205
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,729
When the day finally comes that you can see again,

206
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:46,193
I'm sure that it will be.

207
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:47,532
Really?

208
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,081
I promise.

209
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,509
The truth is...

210
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,332
...there are very few paths our future can take.

211
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:57,323
The Ashford family's sheltering us for now.

212
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,185
But how long can that last?

213
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,419
If our identity is exposed,

214
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,790
even Rivalz, Shirley, and the others will abandon us.

215
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:09,212
We'll end up political tools,
or a casualty of royal ambition.

216
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:13,280
I have to build a world where
Nunnally can at least find happiness.

217
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:15,941
Hm?

218
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,486
Sayako taught me this the other day.

219
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,511
It's called a Japanese promise.

220
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:22,439
<i>♪ Cross my heart, hope to die, ♪</i>

221
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:24,782
<i>♪ eat a thousand needles if I lie. ♪</i>

222
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,578
<i>♪ Pinky promise song! ♪</i>

223
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,308
Well, that's scary.

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,713
I may have to eat a thousand needles someday!

225
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:33,672
That's right.

226
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:36,122
So I better not catch you telling lies, okay?

227
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,351
Don't you worry.

228
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,195
I'll never lie, I swear.

229
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,723
Not to you, anyway.

230
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:56,872
This is the only weapon I have.

231
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,185
And I don't even know how to use it.

232
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,345
Lelouch!

233
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,815
Huh?

234
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,878
Class'll be starting any minute, you know.

235
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,245
Oh, yes, sir.

236
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:08,109
Um, sir?

237
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:11,343
What are the topics gonna be
for the essays on your next exam?

238
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,473
The Humiliation of Edinburgh,

239
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:16,920
the transfer of the Capital,
and north 'n south war topics.

240
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:19,647
So. I haven't lost the power then.

241
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,100
Sir?

242
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:22,727
Hm?

243
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,716
What exactly are the topics gonna
be for the essays on your next exam?

244
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:30,016
Right, very funny. Maybe you should try studying, huh?

245
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,261
Just apply yourself, you'll do fine.

246
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,450
Yes, sir.

247
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,331
As I suspected...

248
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,871
...I can only use it on a person once.

249
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,721
So, how's campus life treatin' ya?

250
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:42,746
Stifling.

251
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,936
I was stuck in history class yesterday.

252
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,110
Look, maybe I should just head back.

253
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,607
The army's on a high alert right now.

254
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,234
Stay there and let things cool off.

255
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,784
Like hell what about the voice on the radio?

256
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,951
Can't go lookin' for a voice. Besides...

257
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,300
...Naoto would be happy to see ya back in school.

258
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:05,745
Forget about Shinjuku for now. I'll be in touch.

259
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,689
Shinjuku... I guess he's right, but...

260
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,702
Don't tell anyone about Shinjuku.

261
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:16,517
No, it couldn't have his been his voice.

262
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,231
The aristocracy was highly educated.

263
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:24,100
With such an emphasis on edification and
training, they produced a superior breed of ruler.

264
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,067
And secondly, they possessed heightened efficiency.

265
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,227
Since only a...

266
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,715
Could be...

267
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:33,317
No. I can't remember well enough to be sure...

268
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,593
Good. That will do.

269
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,609
With the enthronement of Henry the 9th,

270
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,917
son of the great Elizabeth the 1st,

271
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,846
the golden age of the Tudor Dynasty...

272
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:45,224
All I did was simply mention Shinjuku... But...

273
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,067
If he knows who I really am, then...

274
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,300
At the first opportunity...

275
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,187
I need to take care of him.

276
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,103
And the research center?

277
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,206
Transferred to Narita last night.

278
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,064
Right then.

279
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,995
I pray you forgive me, Your Highness...

280
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,715
Why don't we all go for out for some tea?

281
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,197
Kallen, you should join us.

282
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:09,048
Yeah, tag along.

283
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,895
Hey, Lelou. You comin' along?

284
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,791
Sorry, maybe some other time.

285
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:13,874
Maybe I can.

286
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,211
Yeah, I thought so.

287
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,195
You've gotta go straight home then, huh?

288
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,690
What do you have, a curfew?

289
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:20,196
Hm? What's up?

290
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,946
You think that you could spare
a minute? I need to talk to you.

291
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,554
Huh?!

292
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,687
Huh?

293
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,530
Sure.

294
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:31,963
I was wondering when you were gonna ask.

295
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:32,628
Huh?!

296
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,449
I hope you can see how determined we are now!

297
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,492
But... I've already told you!

298
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:42,968
That you don't remember?

299
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:45,580
Still clinging to that ridiculous excuse?

300
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,176
Just ask the others! They'll testify that...!

301
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,333
Ducking the blame? You're pathetic!

302
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,979
You shant remain at his royal
Highness's side another minute!

303
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,424
I didn't even know this room existed.

304
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:59,915
It's the club house for the student council.

305
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,107
They built it as a ballroom for various special occasions.

306
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,894
And we won't be disturbed inside here?

307
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,373
Yes, that's correct.

308
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,348
Here it is!

309
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,811
I found it! Look! This is it, right?

310
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:14,999
Ah! What a relief you found our lab data!

311
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:17,841
Ugh, good. My ass is killin' me...

312
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:19,590
Were you able to find it?

313
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,132
I finished up on my end, shall we dig in?

314
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,001
Aww, wow!

315
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,583
Way to go, Milly!

316
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,798
You adore me, I know.

317
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,861
Um... what is all of this?

318
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,169
Lelouch, don't you know?

319
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,732
I thought that's why you brought her.

320
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,202
We're inducting Kallen into the student council.

321
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:37,525
It was my grandfather's idea, actually.

322
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,584
The principal's?

323
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:40,317
He thought it best with her poor health.

324
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,936
She'd have a harder time with regular club activities.

325
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,553
Oh! I'm Milly, the president of the council.

326
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:46,737
Pleasure to meet you.

327
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:49,327
Oh. Thank you, the pleasure's all mine.

328
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,109
I'm Rivalz, the secretary!

329
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,629
If there's anything you need help with, I'm your man!

330
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:54,857
Hi, I'm Shirley.

331
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,112
And I'm a member of the swim club. Welcome.

332
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,643
Um. Hi there. My name's Nina.

333
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,627
It's... nice to meet all of you..

334
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:03,652
Shirley? I'm sorry, but...

335
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,118
...do you think you could set these on the table for me?

336
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,775
Oh, sure, thanks, Nunna!

337
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,412
Nunnally, what're you doing here?

338
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,262
This is Lelouch's sister.

339
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:13,999
I'm still in the middle school group,

340
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,946
so I can't be on the council yet.

341
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,414
That's all right, you're an honorary member in our book.

342
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,036
Mh-hm.

343
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:22,247
Hello, there. It's a pleasure to meet you, Kallen.

344
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,834
Thank you. You as well.

345
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,773
Right! Shall we kick this off with a toast?

346
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,139
Huh? Champagne??

347
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,407
Yeah, but we're on the student council, we shouldn't!

348
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,515
Ah, c'mon, loosen up, you guys!

349
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,792
No way! We're gonna get in trouble!

350
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,324
What's going on?

351
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,655
Here, Nunnally.

352
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,678
Lelouch, heads up!

353
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,304
You're not getting away with this either, Lelou!

354
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,533
What just happened?

355
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:57,424
We have clothes for her?

356
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,038
Sayoko's on it.

357
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,760
This is why I hate Britannians...

358
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,243
It's Lelouch.

359
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,486
I brought you a change of clothes.

360
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:16,589
You can come in. I've drawn the curtain already.

361
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,805
Uh... sorry about all this.

362
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,084
I know they can be a little over the top.

363
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,359
That's okay.

364
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:28,299
Nothin' wrong with cutting loose
every once in a while, ya know?

365
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:30,740
These are some of my clothes, hope that's okay.

366
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,650
It's cool. Don't worry 'bout it.

367
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:36,427
That was fast. You went all the way to the boy's dorm?

368
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,336
Actually, I live here.

369
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,057
Uh?

370
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,837
It'd be pretty hard for my
sister to live off in the dorms.

371
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:45,829
The principal of the school lets us stay here, as a favor.

372
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,076
I see.

373
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:48,522
Anyway...

374
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:49,570
Hey, wait!

375
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,900
Can you hand me that pouch over there?

376
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,632
Sure.

377
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,773
You really are a live wire, aren't you?

378
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:13,455
Were you the one in Shinjuku?

379
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,593
What do you mean?

380
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:15,618
Don't play dumb!

381
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:18,123
You brought up Shinjuku the other day. Why?

382
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,077
Why do you ask, is there something wrong with Shinjuku?

383
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:23,375
Don't answer my question with a question!

384
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,165
Yes or no. That's all I wanna hear outta you.

385
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,680
If I don't answer it, someone'll come.

386
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:37,269
That okay?

387
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:41,005
Hello? Ashford Academy student council.

388
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:45,069
Uh. No, this is... oh...

389
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:46,732
It's for you.

390
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,161
He says he knows you.

391
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,052
Hello?

392
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:02,526
Glad you're still alive, Q-1.

393
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,486
Was I wrong?

394
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:11,676
Sixteen hundred hours, the day after tomorrow.

395
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,021
The observation deck at Tokyo Tower. Come alone.

396
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,830
Who are you?!

397
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,248
How did you arrange that cease-fire order?!

398
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,365
Uh! Hey! Don't hang up!

399
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,899
Did you say "cease-fire"?

400
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:28,523
Sounds like you keep dangerous company.

401
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,298
Oh, uh, that was...

402
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:31,267
Let me guess...

403
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,924
You're talkin' about a game? Something online?

404
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:37,954
Uh, yeah! You got me. 'Cause, ya know...

405
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,196
I've been shut up in my house so long.

406
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,187
That's what I was warning you about,

407
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,909
when I told you not to bring up Shinjuku before.

408
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:49,621
Seriously, some guys'll try to show you footage of
what happened that day, and it's pretty damn grim.

409
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,982
By the way... you know I can see you, right?

410
00:20:57,525 --> 00:21:00,689
Um, I won't tell anyone! Later!

411
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:05,858
I was wrong...

412
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,875
Glad you're still alive, Q-1.

413
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:14,989
Huh?

414
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,365
The council doesn't require much actual work, I guess.

415
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,811
Beyond occasional paperwork,
we'll sometimes plan school events.

416
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,579
So, you mean, like the Culture Festival?

417
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,396
Yup, like that, along with the Cross Dresser's Ball,

418
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,796
the Absolute Silence Party, and Swimsuit Day.

419
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,283
What's up with that? Blame our president.

420
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,440
You'll be spending a lotta
time with her. Hope you're ready.

421
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:38,056
Lelouch, it's awful!

422
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:38,862
What is?

423
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,181
Prince Clovis has been found dead!

424
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:42,698
They're saying he was killed.

425
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:46,999
Prince Clovis has been taken from us.

426
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,694
He fought for peace and justice
against all of the Elevens!

427
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,489
He died a martyr!

428
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:55,030
We must all bury our sorrow.

429
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,939
And carry on his will.

430
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,753
We interrupt this broadcast with breaking news.

431
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:03,792
The man suspected as the murderer has been captured.

432
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,865
According to this report,

433
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:08,129
the suspect is an honorary Britannian.

434
00:22:08,465 --> 00:22:09,288
What the...?!

435
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,302
Private Suzaku Kururugi.

436
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:13,749
A former Eleven and Honorary Britannian.

437
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:17,624
I repeat, Suzaku Kururugi, arrested for murder.

438
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:52,490
Shouldn't I be happy at this news?

439
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,173
Suzaku is still alive!

440
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,508
But... why has he been arrested in my place?

441
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:01,169
I have to save him... I don't care what it takes!

442
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,993
If I have to step up my plans... so be it!

443
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,126
For I have the power to do it!
