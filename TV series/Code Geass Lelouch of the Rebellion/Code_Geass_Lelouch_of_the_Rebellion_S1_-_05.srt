1
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,594
Open fire!

2
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,488
Gloucesters?!

3
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:18,169
They're supposed to be in Serupham!

4
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,557
Shoddy oversized imitation Knightmares!

5
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,922
They would've been wise to surrender from the start.

6
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:31,954
What?!

7
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,057
So, Cornelia, a single unit, did this?!

8
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,177
Another victory.

9
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,810
Area 18 has been established.

10
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,193
My Lady, about our next course of action...

11
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,301
Sorry to have you clean up
after my foolish younger brother.

12
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,148
Please don't apologize, milady.

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,435
We live to serve, and our place is with you.

14
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:02,395
Ha. Do you think Area 11 needs our usual treatment?

15
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:03,681
Yes, milady.

16
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:04,282
Good.

17
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,373
I'll drive you into the open, Zero.

18
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,798
Clovis will be avenged.

19
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,921
I'm back.

20
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:54,659
Welcome home, Lelouch.

21
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,505
I'm so glad. I was worried.

22
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,278
I'm assuming you ate out tonight,

23
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:01,913
judging from your appearance.

24
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,062
Thank goodness!

25
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:07,007
I thought maybe you'd gotten caught up
in all the uproar caused by that man Zero.

26
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:10,028
I tried calling you, but you
didn't answer your cell phone.

27
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,371
I wanted to tell you Miss C.C.'s
been waiting for you, as well.

28
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,075
C.C.?

29
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,528
Your friend goes by such an unusual name.

30
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:21,771
Only her initials.

31
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,811
Yeah...

32
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:25,868
I was just wondering, is C.C. your girlfriend?

33
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:26,280
Huh?

34
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:29,173
He made a promise about our future together.

35
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:29,960
Right?

36
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:30,553
Huh?

37
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:33,190
A future together? You mean marriage?

38
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:33,854
No!

39
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:36,511
No, that isn't what she was talkin' about.

40
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,008
It's like, uh...

41
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,526
She's kidding around.

42
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,375
No, I'm not.

43
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,974
Well, you're certainly doing this sooner than most.

44
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,948
But everyone's different, aren't they?

45
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,406
So I suppose it isn't that strange, and
if you feel like you're ready for... Uh.

46
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,645
Oh, C.C., look what you've done.

47
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,777
You're soaking wet.

48
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,327
C'mon, let's get you to the
bathroom into a dry change of clothes.

49
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,515
Nunnally, stay here, and I'll clean that up in a minute.

50
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:03,291
And she was kidding before. Kidding!

51
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,012
Just a dumb joke, that's all!

52
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,101
Who are you?

53
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,310
She said my name. I'm C.C.

54
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:15,414
That's not what I meant. Why aren't you...

55
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,865
Supposed to be dead?

56
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,079
So...

57
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:21,375
...do you like the power that I gave you?

58
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,859
As I thought. It was you.

59
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,893
Dissatisfied?

60
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,813
On the contrary, I'm grateful.

61
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:31,387
It allows me to speed up my schedule tremendously,

62
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,341
which is a huge help.

63
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,421
Your schedule?

64
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:36,675
Yes, my schedule for obliterating Britannia.

65
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:40,229
I'd have had to wait much longer
before I could've made the initial move.

66
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,427
You believe you can destroy it simply by using that power?

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,475
I intended to do it without this power.

68
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,835
I just knew that he'd turn out to be a fascinating guy.

69
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:52,490
What will you do now?

70
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,537
I'm sure the military is after you.

71
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,822
Not the entire military, only a small faction of it.

72
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,507
So it shouldn't be difficult to find a hiding place.

73
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:01,765
I can make do here.

74
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,027
What?! You expect to stay here?!

75
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,301
A gentleman would sleep on the floor.

76
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,704
Don't joke around.

77
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,522
My being caught would cause trouble for you, too.

78
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:12,435
It's dangerous to stay together.

79
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,625
If I wander the streets, they'll find me.

80
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,660
This isn't about you. It's my situation.

81
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,109
I hate stubbornness!

82
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,481
You sure take things casually, don't you?

83
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,941
How did you manage to survive before this?

84
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,463
What did you do before now?

85
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:29,021
And what's the deal with that
so-called "contract" you spoke...

86
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,495
Goodnight, Lelouch.

87
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,161
Fukushima, Kochi, Hiroshima.

88
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,920
This has been the seventh occurrence
since that man named Zero raised his head.

89
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:47,968
It seems that the other groups are following
his lead and putting up a valiant fight.

90
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:52,951
And now suspicions about that "Orange"
thing have cost Margrave Jeremiah his command.

91
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:58,203
Maybe he wasn't good enough. Thanks to him, connections
between the police and administration are screwed up.

92
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,267
It's made a fine mess for us, as well.

93
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,386
Help them, Tohdoh!

94
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,872
Zero has thrown the Britannians into chaos!

95
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:09,697
Now's the time for us in the Japan
Liberation Front to make our stand!

96
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,309
Calm down!

97
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:15,367
The information of Kyoto giving the
Guren MK-2 to Zero hasn't been confirmed.

98
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,584
If we pay too much attention to
Zero, we may trip ourselves up.

99
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,874
So, what did "Orange" turn out to be, anyway?

100
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,386
Hm?

101
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:26,631
Well?

102
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,675
You know, for someone who isn't
willing to answer any questions,

103
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,422
you certainly do ask a lot of them.

104
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:35,712
If you don't want to answer my questions,
you don't have to. Just as I don't.

105
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,314
There is no "Orange," it's something I made up.

106
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,510
But... the more they claim to be comrades of like mind,

107
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:46,232
the easier it is to divide
them with the thorns of suspicion.

108
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:47,491
Hm.

109
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,611
Everyone on Earth is looking for you.

110
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,459
Because of you, the world is going through an upheaval.

111
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:57,385
So....

112
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,162
Is this it? Is this what you wanted to see?

113
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,130
No.

114
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,603
This uproar is simply a means to an end.

115
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,882
The world is destined to descend into greater chaos.

116
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,311
Case number 107,

117
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,842
Private Suzaku Kururugi, Area 11 military forces.

118
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,785
In the murder of His Highness Prince Clovis,

119
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,508
you are no longer a suspect and
hereby set free due to lack of evidence.

120
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,393
What happened? I'm free.

121
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,858
Outta the way, please!

122
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,859
Look out below!

123
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,820
Uh... are you all right?

124
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:35,445
I'm sorry! I wasn't aware you
were down here until I had leaped!

125
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:36,858
Well, don't worry.

126
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:41,086
I wasn't expecting a girl to come falling
outta the sky and into my arms, either.

127
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:42,129
Oh, my!

128
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,978
Huh? Is there something wrong?

129
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,418
Yes! There is something wrong!

130
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:47,879
Huh?

131
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:50,853
The truth is, bad guys are chasing me.

132
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:54,148
So considering the circumstances,
could you help me, please?

133
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:59,735
We must get rid of this "Orange" character
before Princess Cornelia assumes her new post!

134
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:03,272
Now the loyalty of us purebloods
is being called into question.

135
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,526
Are the reports we've been hearing true?

136
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,107
Lord Jeremiah was bribed?

137
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,190
Do you know what this "Orange" means?

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,730
Uh...

139
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,618
In any case, Lord Jeremiah is definitely hiding something.

140
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,995
Saying he can't recall anything.

141
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,107
Bartley offered the same excuse.

142
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,915
Lord Jeremiah's memory is muddled.

143
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,939
Exactly like those of the men in
Shinjuku whose Sutherlands were stolen.

144
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,998
And...

145
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,801
We haven't introduced ourselves yet, have we?

146
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:35,791
My name is...

147
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,157
Euphy!

148
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:38,898
Euphy?

149
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:39,605
Yes.

150
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:40,598
My name's...

151
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,790
Don't tell me!

152
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:42,307
Huh?

153
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,150
'Cause I already know it. You're a celebrity.

154
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,492
Son of Prime Minister Genbu Kururugi,

155
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,716
Private Suzaku Kururugi.

156
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,267
Hm.

157
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:55,652
You lied before. There's no one chasing you at all, right?

158
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:56,698
Meow!

159
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:57,527
What?

160
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,067
Meow, meow!

161
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,544
Aw, does a kitty's paw hurt? Oh.

162
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,147
Meow, meow, meow!

163
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,923
Meow, meow.

164
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:15,761
Hm.

165
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:20,703
Oh, my.

166
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,401
We're running late.

167
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:26,548
I hope he's still waiting for us.

168
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:29,187
Considering the charge, did they really release him?

169
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:31,121
Yes, they had no evidence.

170
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:35,025
I'm sure they put him through the third
degree because of that Zero incident. Huh?

171
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,365
What? Why is he...?

172
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,256
Do you have trouble with cats?

173
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,519
Hm. I like them fine, however...

174
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,076
Hm. The attraction isn't mutual.

175
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,891
I think unrequited love is the mark of a kind person.

176
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,410
Oh!

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,130
Uh.

178
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,893
The kitty ran away.

179
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,320
Mm, Euphy...

180
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,786
Why did you tell me that lie when we met?

181
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,376
Do you ask because you're concerned about me?

182
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,125
Huh? Um, of course.

183
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:07,342
Good! Then you can accompany me some more!

184
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:07,932
All right.

185
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,377
C'mon, it'll be fun!

186
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:20,468
You know, being here is just like being in Britannia.

187
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:21,774
I feel right at home.

188
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,174
Are you from the Homeland?

189
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,579
Uh-huh! I was a student there up until last week.

190
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:29,065
Last week? So, what are you doing now?

191
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,004
By student, do you mean high school?

192
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,279
You can go sightseeing any time, can't you?

193
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:35,878
You ask a lotta questions.

194
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,393
Uh. Sorry...

195
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,419
Oh! No, I didn't mean it like that!

196
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:44,018
You see... today is the last day of my vacation.

197
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:49,026
I wanted to see as much of Area 11 as I could,
because I'd like to know what kind of place it is.

198
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,903
Well, you didn't need me for that.

199
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,544
No. I'm glad I could see with you.

200
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:54,992
Is that right?

201
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:57,940
Suzaku...

202
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:00,991
Would you mind taking me to one more place, please?

203
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:03,965
Your wish is my command, milady. Where to?

204
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,523
Take me to Shinjuku.

205
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,369
Suzaku Kururugi.

206
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,441
Please escort me there.

207
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,244
Lelouch?

208
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:20,777
Hm?

209
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,137
Do you have a minute?

210
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,149
Mh-hm. What is it?

211
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,756
About that phone call the other day...

212
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:27,838
Phone call?

213
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:31,688
Yeah... You know, when you and I were in the bathroom.

214
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:32,542
Uh-huh.

215
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,296
Can you find out what the caller I.D. was?

216
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:37,131
I want to contact that person again.

217
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:38,704
It was a school phone.

218
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,588
So I'm no sure, sor... Uh!

219
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,185
I see.

220
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,597
Makes sense. I should've known.

221
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:46,533
That girl.

222
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:47,968
Uh. What?

223
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,132
Is there something wro... Uh!

224
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,058
Huh?

225
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,068
No way...

226
00:11:58,738 --> 00:11:59,911
Excuse me.

227
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:01,604
What're you doing?

228
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,604
Ah. What indeed.

229
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,657
To think I'd return to the Homeland like this.

230
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,963
I wish I'd never involved that damned girl.

231
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:14,353
Are you insane?!

232
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:15,764
You can't go walkin' around!

233
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,277
Don't act strict with me.

234
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,774
I never leave the school grounds, so it's fine.

235
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:22,982
It's not! You can't do as you like here. You don't belong!

236
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,359
I don't belong anywhere.

237
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,500
Hm? What's with her?

238
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,106
Oh. Is she doing it again today?

239
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:31,946
Again?

240
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:36,660
She's going to be markin' the wall like that every day,

241
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,255
because I used my Geass on her to make her do it.

242
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,258
Geass?

243
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:41,737
The name of the power I have.

244
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,920
That's what I heard when we first made contact.

245
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:47,278
Hm. You're testing how long it lasts?

246
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,763
I need to know the specs of my weapon, don't I?

247
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,990
So behave, or I'll try it on you.

248
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,917
Would it work... on me?

249
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:54,642
Uh.

250
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,819
Oh, relax.

251
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,856
You and I are in this together.

252
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:02,417
I won't do anything to endanger
us or our unique partnership.

253
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:02,875
Hmph.

254
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,947
The Shinjuku ghetto. Ruined again.

255
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,054
The residents were starting to return, too.

256
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:23,411
Man, they didn't use R-G on the Elevens.

257
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,670
I figured they wouldn't.

258
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,510
Hey, look! Those are marks from hummer rounds.

259
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:28,510
Get a clear shot of it!

260
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:31,590
Say "cheese"! Got it! Okay, me next!

261
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:33,907
This is accurate?

262
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,624
This information about Zero?

263
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,818
Yes, sir. Lord Kewell contacted me.

264
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:38,570
Right.

265
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,728
Set up a cordon around Shinjuku ghetto sector 4 at once!

266
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:43,480
Cordon sector 4, roger.

267
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:47,481
Okay, ball's in your court now, Lord Kewell.

268
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,022
I wanted to put be through to Lord Jeremiah,

269
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,350
but it appears that you're too busy now.

270
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,768
Get out of here, you damn Britannian bastards!

271
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,015
Stay here!

272
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:02,196
How dare a lowly Eleven speak like...

273
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,383
Don't call me an Eleven! I'm Japanese!

274
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,986
Wrong, you seem to forget that you people lost!

275
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,542
You're nothing but a beaten dog!

276
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,167
You racist pig!

277
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,598
Stop, please! No violence!

278
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,075
Stay outta this!

279
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:16,705
You're that...

280
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,752
Are you... Suzaku Kururugi?

281
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,346
The guy who killed Clovis?

282
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,859
No, idiot. It was Zero who killed him.

283
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,037
Tch. This guy's nothing more than a slave.

284
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:30,590
Big deal, you're an honorary Britannian. Nobody cares.

285
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:33,252
You sold your pride, your people, your soul,

286
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,027
yet you call yourself Japanese?!!

287
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,286
No, you're wrong! I...

288
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:37,806
I am not wrong!

289
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,942
You stinkin' Britannian lap dog!

290
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,806
Stop, please!

291
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,118
I warn you, I've been trained for military combat.

292
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,876
Don't make me fight against my own people.

293
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,210
Like hell we're "your people"!

294
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,923
C'mon, just let it go!

295
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,538
Ugh! Lousy traitor!

296
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:02,267
Suzaku!

297
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:04,951
Oh, my! Are you okay?

298
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,971
Yeah, I'm all right.

299
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:11,152
Well, I'm not okay! Just look at my Prime G and my LX-4!

300
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,391
Why did you wait?!

301
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,962
Dammit, some honorary citizen you are!

302
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,976
Why'd you let 'em go?! You shoulda killed them!

303
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,634
What's a few dead Elevens to a guy like you?!

304
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,161
Who do you think's taken care
of you all of these years anyway?!

305
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,584
I'll not allow you to insult this man any longer, you oaf!

306
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:33,398
To use my Geass, I need to have
direct eye contact with the subject.

307
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:36,713
Transparent objects like eyeglasses present no problem.

308
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:40,599
The effective range is approximately 270 meters,

309
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:45,148
and the subject appears to have no memory of
events before, during, or after the power is used.

310
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:50,289
I think this is due to damage caused by the
Geass interfering with the brain of the subject.

311
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:53,513
Also, if the signal's optical, I can reflect it.

312
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,681
In the short time you've had it, you've learned a lot.

313
00:15:56,881 --> 00:16:00,813
My opponent is an empire that controls
more than one-third of the entire world.

314
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,973
There's no such thing as being too careful.

315
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,537
I'd understand if you were an Eleven,

316
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,200
but you're a Britannian, aren't you?

317
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:11,679
This opponent may be too large and strong
to fight with only Geass for a weapon.

318
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:13,139
Is it good to be strong?

319
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,003
Is it bad to be weak?

320
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,569
Back then, when I was ten,

321
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,304
the world seemed like such a terribly sad place.

322
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,065
A world without any hope at all.

323
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,762
Starvation.

324
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,369
Disease.

325
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:29,586
Filth.

326
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,663
Decay.

327
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:31,750
Racism.

328
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,992
Constant war and terrorism.

329
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,593
Living in a never-ending cycle of hate.

330
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,559
Rat's running in a wheel.

331
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,718
The cycle must be broken.

332
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,311
Somebody has to do it.

333
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,219
How idealistic.

334
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:49,241
Of course, it's doubtful that the one who
does it will make all the bad things go away.

335
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:52,513
I'm not that arrogant. And so...

336
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:55,363
No one should lose more of the people they love.

337
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,753
At least, a world without war.

338
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,873
And to have this utopia you'd...

339
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:01,521
How would you do it?

340
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,850
It's simple.

341
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,922
When somebody wins...

342
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:07,839
...the fighting will end.

343
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,676
Somebody?

344
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,960
I don't know how you would do it.

345
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:14,804
But if I stop trying,

346
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,324
then my father's death will have been in vain.

347
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,720
The Prime Minister's death?

348
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:24,063
My own father died because he had
to sacrifice his life in that war!

349
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,717
Jeremiah!

350
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:32,437
You're going to pay for letting
Prince Clovis' murderer go free!

351
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,567
Kewell, you dirty coward!

352
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,873
That sighting of Zero was a lie, wasn't it?!

353
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:41,649
We have to wipe away our disgrace before
Princess Cornelia takes up her post here.

354
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,064
This is how we keep our officials honest.

355
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:47,826
Suzaku!

356
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:48,882
Miss Cecile!

357
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,587
It's dangerous here! Get in!

358
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,865
The purebloods are having a silly squabble.

359
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,204
Better get out of here.

360
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,958
Oh, and by the way, what a shame about your acquittal.

361
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,835
Because now you'll have to work for me again.

362
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,811
Wait, please!

363
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,211
Isn't this an opportunity to
gather battle data for the Lancelot?

364
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:03,695
Uh?

365
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:05,403
Oh, ho...

366
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,490
Suzaku...

367
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,644
I'm sorry, Euphy, we have to say goodbye here.

368
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,148
I need to do this. I think I
can stop them with the Lancelot.

369
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:14,511
I have to try. I...

370
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:15,611
I must!

371
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:20,230
Damn! It's four against one!

372
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,530
Cowards!

373
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,163
Don't worry, Jeremiah.

374
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:25,905
We'll say you died in battle.

375
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,151
Your family's name won't be disgraced.

376
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,589
You're serious then?

377
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,812
You actually intend to kill me?!

378
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:33,303
Kewell!

379
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,938
Silence, Orange!

380
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,922
We serve the imperial family!

381
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,570
Why else would we be here?!

382
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:42,526
All... hail... Britannia!

383
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,060
Wha...?!

384
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,969
Stop it! You're all Britannian soldiers!

385
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,744
That's him. It's that honorary Britannian.

386
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,083
The advanced weapon! Lancelot!

387
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,864
What business does the Special Corps want here?!

388
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,471
Interlopers will die!

389
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,364
No!

390
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,381
I can't stand by and ignore this senseless battle!

391
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:10,401
Oh my god. They've perfected the MVSs.

392
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,032
Too late! I won't back down!

393
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,915
We're on the same side!

394
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,866
Suzaku Kururugi... is saving me?

395
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,711
We can at least kill Orange!

396
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,029
Lord Jeremiah!

397
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,635
Villetta, thanks!

398
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,204
Still wanna fight?

399
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,483
Men, stand down.

400
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:50,604
Kewell?

401
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,260
You understand, then?

402
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,917
I'm using a chaos mine.

403
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:55,483
Huh?

404
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,987
No! Stop it now!

405
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:00,624
What?

406
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,366
That honorary Britannian...

407
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,345
He risked his life for...

408
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,060
Everyone, lower your weapons at once!

409
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,374
In my name, I command you!

410
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:35,504
It... can't be.

411
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:40,199
I am Euphemia Li Britannia of the empire,
and the third princess of the royal family!

412
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,545
Euphy?

413
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:45,974
I'm assuming command here! Now fall back!

414
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,221
It is her. It's the princess.

415
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,202
Did you know it was her, Lloyd?

416
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:56,123
Uh-huh. But she's been a student up until
now and hasn't made her public debut yet.

417
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:58,134
We... we're truly...

418
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,846
We're truly sorry, Your Highness!

419
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:03,911
My lady!

420
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:04,699
Uh?

421
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,191
I had no idea who you were. Please forgive me, Princess!

422
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:13,748
Suzaku, you and I bear a similar deep pain.

423
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,548
You have lost your father as I have lost my brother.

424
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,633
Will you let me help you in your quest to ensure that

425
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,548
no one ever again has to suffer the
loss of a loved one on the battlefield?

426
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,687
Yes! I'm... unworthy of your kindness.

427
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,643
I heard what you did, Euphemia.

428
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,392
You shouldn't be so reckless.

429
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:37,957
I know, sister. Forgive me. But...

430
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:41,690
You will address me as viceroy here, sub-viceroy Euphemia.

431
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,794
Because we're sisters, we need
to follow a stricter protocol.

432
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,746
Yes. I understand.

433
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:47,540
Heh.

434
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,720
Now then, give me your report.

435
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,162
Yes. Milady, the first order
of business is a welcome party

436
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,688
we've arranged for Your Highness and... Uh!

437
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:02,246
Sloppy. Senile. Corrupt.

438
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:06,150
Where is Zero?! I want the enemy of the empire caught!

439
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,789
Get Zero!

440
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:08,715
Uh?

441
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,865
I'll be joining the student body
here at Ashford Academy beginning today.

442
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:16,313
My name is Suzaku Kururugi.

443
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:17,915
It's a pleasure to meet you.

444
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,428
Yes. I understand. I'm lying.

445
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:54,719
To Shirley and Rivalz and the others.

446
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,548
Even to Suzaku and Nunnally.

447
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,627
But there's no goin' back now.

448
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,025
I can't turn back.

449
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,779
As long as C.C. and I are bound by our "contract,"

450
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:04,381
I have to keep at this.

451
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,612
Beause I don't wanna lie to myself any more.
