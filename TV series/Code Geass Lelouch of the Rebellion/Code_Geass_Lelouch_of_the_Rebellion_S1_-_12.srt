1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,045
Lelouch, a young, outcast prince of Britannia,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,196
possesses two great powers:

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:13,492
One of them is the absolute ability to
compel any person to do whatever he commands.

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,162
The other is the Black Knights,

5
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:21,091
his military force assembled with the intent of
destroying the Britannian Empire ruled by his father.

6
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:25,422
Veiling his true identity behind
a mask and the code name Zero,

7
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:28,572
Lelouch has made his move to avenge his mother's murder

8
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:32,974
and to create a world in which his
younger sister Nunnally can find happiness.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,891
What will be the final outcome of these actions?

10
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,747
At this point, no one can predict.

11
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,258
The Japan Liberation Front

12
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:19,385
was nearly wiped out by your Narita operation, Viceroy.

13
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:22,008
Now we're hunting down the survivors one by one.

14
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,858
Are you being sarcastic?

15
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:27,103
We're barely pulling our forces
back together after that fiasco.

16
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,835
No! I-I didn't mean to...

17
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,662
The occupation government is responsible for this!

18
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:36,085
They've done nothing about
Area Eleven's subways and mining railways!

19
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,608
In the ghettos, they falsify
the registries and property deeds,

20
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,270
as the rebellion spreads unchallenged!

21
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,543
Uhh, the subway tunnels stretch over the whole country.

22
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,402
We can't just fill them all in. We don't have the budget.

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,533
The terrorists are using them
as their strike bases and escape routes!

24
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,258
P-Prince Clovis instructed us...

25
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:58,085
Uh, he said...

26
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,219
...forcing them would fuel the rebellion,

27
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:03,010
giving the Chinese Federation an excuse to attack.

28
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,983
They've already got their excuse!

29
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:08,091
Zero's growing stronger and bolder every day!

30
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:11,322
Vice-minister, Internal Affairs has appointed

31
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:15,125
a special group of Elevens to
self-govern this area, isn't that right?

32
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,352
A group who are called the N.A.C.

33
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:22,088
When we stormed Narita, we looked
for evidence of the N.A.C.'s conspiracies.

34
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:24,080
But it was buried in the landslide...

35
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:26,515
Still our suspicions remain high.

36
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,605
If we supress them now...

37
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:32,721
Hm... A group of blue bloods and plutocrats.

38
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,980
Relics of their dismal past.

39
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,575
W-Wait, please!

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,911
These are just rumors; there's no evidence of that at all!

41
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:44,305
I-If you suppress them, then the
Elevens' economy will certainly collapse!

42
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:47,123
That means no tax revenue to send to the homeland!

43
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,839
Also it's a prime directive of the empire that

44
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,167
Numbers should take care of their own kind!

45
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:54,623
And what have you done to find the Black Knights?!

46
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,565
We unearthed a shield machine they left

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,506
showing Zero was behind the Narita operation.

48
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:00,863
B-But that's all we've got;

49
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,298
you can't squeeze information out of corpses.

50
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,971
So you can't catch Zero
and you don't want us to hit Kyoto.

51
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,705
Do you know the word "incompetent," minister?

52
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:12,244
It's for people who can't get results.

53
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,823
So, the Britannian viceroy has gone this far already.

54
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,755
With the Liberation Front smashed,

55
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,364
the last embers of Japan have died away.

56
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:22,679
No!

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,759
He may be on the run,
but Toudou is still strong, still fighting!

58
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:28,350
Even if that's so,

59
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,994
I heard he lost his custom Burais, so there's no hope...

60
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:33,480
There is hope.

61
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:34,321
Hm?

62
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:39,369
The Black Knights? You've been infatuated
with Zero since he rescued Suzaku Kururugi.

63
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:42,014
We even sent him the Guren MK-II.

64
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,640
And after the defeat at Trafalgar,

65
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:50,296
Elizabeth the 3rd found herself
surrounded by revolutionaries in Edinburgh.

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,838
Oh, father...

67
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:55,502
However, with the help of Lord Britannia,
she fled to the American colonies,

68
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:58,709
now known as our homeland, Britannia.

69
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:01,825
Hmm...

70
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:08,750
Huh?

71
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:12,046
Okay, what's got you so worried?

72
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:14,029
Constipated? Your monthly?

73
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:15,488
Uh?! T-That's not it!

74
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,880
Ah. You're lonely 'cause Lelouch is gone, aren't you?

75
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:18,698
We-eh...

76
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:22,990
It's more like, Kallen's absent the same day he is.

77
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:23,781
Again...

78
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:28,496
Oh, so carefree while the rest of the
world grapples with what happened at Narita.

79
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:31,771
Suzaku's been out for two days because of that, too.

80
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:32,813
I know that!

81
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,644
But Lulu and Kallen? Gone on the same day together?

82
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,815
That's serious!

83
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,715
I envy you, Shirley. That's what I love about you!

84
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,235
Don't make fun of me!

85
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,635
Then just tell him already!

86
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,119
Three little words: "I like you!"

87
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:52,523
U-Uh... I couldn't! I just couldn't!

88
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,688
I mean, what if...

89
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,973
"What if he rejects me?!

90
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:58,352
It could ruin our great friendship!"

91
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:04,015
You don't have to laugh that hard, you know?

92
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,202
It's comfortable, isn't it?

93
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:09,240
This place now. The way we are together.

94
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,669
That's true.

95
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:13,600
Still, we should prepare ourselves a bit.

96
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,865
The fact is, nothing stays the same forever, you know.

97
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:21,529
Oh, forget it! Please don't take me too seriously.

98
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,933
If it's bothering you, why not
just ask him the next chance you get?

99
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,546
So, how do you feel about it from your side?

100
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,563
L-Lulu! I thought you were absent!

101
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,955
Nunnally had a little fever this morning.

102
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,417
And Sayoko was busy, so I stayed home to help.

103
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh, really? You don't say...

104
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,402
So is Nunna feeling better now?

105
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:42,360
A bit.

106
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,446
Madame President, those papers?

107
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,302
Oh, right.

108
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:48,356
Make sure you organize
all of them by year and class, okay?

109
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,452
Yeah, I will.

110
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,831
You have a talent for ordering people around.

111
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,319
And you're a great subordinate!

112
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:57,506
Subordinate? I guess that's what I am.

113
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,656
Oh, Madame President!

114
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,613
You nearly gave me a heart attack doing that!

115
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,756
Huh? Where's my tickets...?

116
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:06,935
Ah?!

117
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:08,927
Lulu!

118
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:10,415
What is it?

119
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,631
Um, is my dad's letter mixed up with that paperwork?

120
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,850
Hmm? Oh, sorry...

121
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,779
What's wrong?

122
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,050
Ah, Lulu!

123
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:23,942
Shirley?

124
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:25,063
Huh?

125
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:36,970
Stop being so suspicious.

126
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:39,162
That's hardly the case.

127
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:41,700
To me, he's nothing more than a...

128
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:52,610
I did it! I actually really did it!

129
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,087
So now what happens? He'll come, right?!

130
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,302
I mean, he didn't say no.

131
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:02,235
Then again... uh-uh, he's just
coming with me to little a concert...

132
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,622
So it's no big thing. But, still, it's a chance!

133
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,187
Thank you, Father.

134
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,241
Kyoto praised us for using the Guren MK-II so well.

135
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,880
I thought that was encouraging.

136
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,389
But there was the White Armor...

137
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,472
Don't sweat it! It was a tie, right? A tie!

138
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,239
Why would Shirley just out of the blue...

139
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,757
My dad works a really, long way from here,

140
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,630
but he likes to send me great stuff like this

141
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,597
to keep my spirits up, y'know?

142
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,678
So, I was just wondering...

143
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:39,573
Here.

144
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:41,070
Hm? What's this?

145
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:42,082
A love letter.

146
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,736
Oh? From you?

147
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,572
And they say you have no sense of humor!

148
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:49,276
You laugh too much.

149
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,397
It's an official letter from Kyoto.

150
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,989
They urgently request a meeting.

151
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,724
Is this really such a big deal?

152
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:57,218
A big deal? It's Kyoto!

153
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,826
If they accept us, it means funding and support.

154
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,701
It could solve our financial crisis.

155
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:02,543
Crisis?

156
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,981
There shouldn't be any problem

157
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:07,068
if you're following the budget I laid out.

158
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,166
Well, uh...

159
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,926
Hey, it's not my fault!

160
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,205
We're turning into a big organization now!

161
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,082
That means new expenses, y'know.

162
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:17,191
Like fancy dinners for the
new recruits so you can show off?

163
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:18,230
Hey, you...

164
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,286
I know where you've been taking them, "big spender!"

165
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,768
You know about it?

166
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:26,391
We'll put Ohgi in charge of the treasury for now.

167
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:29,997
Hold it right there! I'm the one
that's in charge of the cash!

168
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:30,780
That's my job!

169
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,092
If you want me to trust you,

170
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,697
then show me some results.

171
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,306
Did you actually just say "trust"?!

172
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,151
A guy who hides his face from his own partners?!

173
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,305
How about it, Zero? Huh?!

174
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,272
Hold on, that's, uh...

175
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,797
Zero's not the problem here!

176
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,278
Who cares who he is?!

177
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,249
He had the skill to outwit Cornelia, didn't he?

178
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:51,049
That's why he's the leader of the Black Knights!

179
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,907
Do you really need to know more?

180
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,586
Nina is that you?

181
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,434
If you're not feeling well, then...

182
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,363
Oh, no. It's nothing.

183
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,398
Don't worry about it.

184
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,074
So what do we do?

185
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,099
I don't know...

186
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:22,939
We were in Naoto's unit.

187
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,876
I don't mind about his kid-sister Kallen, but...

188
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,190
You were next in line to be leader!

189
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,166
No one said that at Narita.

190
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,620
'Cause Zero practically forced us.

191
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,857
We're the senior commanders, and he keeps secrets from us!

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,584
I've narrowed it down to 12 possibilites.

193
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,987
Now let's see which bets pay off.

194
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,205
For that, I'll have to meet them face to face.

195
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,641
Who is it?

196
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,014
It's me.

197
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,359
Um, I'm sorry if I was out of line
when I spoke up back there.

198
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:58,562
Kallen, tell me, do you wanna know my identity as well?

199
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,897
That girl knows, doesn't she?

200
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:09,753
No. Sorry to bother you.

201
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,114
Lelouch?

202
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,397
Looks like your fever's gone.

203
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,407
Maybe I was just a little moody.

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,245
Moody?

205
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:32,216
It just seems to me, lately,

206
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,074
that you've become a little distant,

207
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:36,824
like you have other things weighing on your mind.

208
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:43,003
Perhaps my body just did this
on its own to get your attention.

209
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,976
You're wrong. I haven't changed.

210
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:52,061
No matter what, I'll always be at your side, Nunnally.

211
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:55,743
So, then, can I be a little selfish now?

212
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:59,286
Please hold my hand just a little bit longer.

213
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,649
If I fall asleep alone...

214
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,395
I'm afraid, I'll have that dream again.

215
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:15,537
You're serious? You're asking me for a favor?

216
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:18,778
Yes. I got the idea from something that you said.

217
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,101
No matter what Kyoto's intentions are,

218
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,497
I want their power.

219
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,914
Is that what you truly wish for?

220
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:28,356
If it's at the very core of your reason for living,

221
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,673
then I'll try to help you.

222
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:33,151
Then do it. C.C., I need you.

223
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:39,664
I understand. By the way, you forgot something.

224
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:42,489
I didn't forget.

225
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,222
I don't know when I'll be back tonight,

226
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,535
so I was planning to call her and cancel.

227
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,093
Stick to your contract...

228
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,397
It's me.

229
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,272
Oh, good timing. I wanted to call. Y'see...

230
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:56,781
Um, listen, Lulu...

231
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:57,618
Hmm?

232
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:00,849
I-I know I made a date with you, but I may be late.

233
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,866
Sorry, but, anyway I'm sure it'll be fine, really!

234
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,097
But I promise you that I'll be there.

235
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,921
Please bring your command staff along,

236
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:18,946
as per my master's instruction, understood?

237
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,708
They're patrolling the perimeter
in case of any unpleasant contingencies.

238
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:26,315
I'll call them soon. However, before I do...

239
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,731
Severely damaged corpses should be brought to tent 2.

240
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,603
I.D. all personal items.

241
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:34,870
Bring remains with identifiable faces to tent 1.

242
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,853
Note locations and times.

243
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:40,333
Medical team 2 will arrive at Narita shortly.

244
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,655
Transport personnel, report to tent 2!

245
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:46,060
Was it really her? Did I really see here there?

246
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,358
And then...

247
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:50,530
Just forget it!

248
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,562
She doesn't show up in any of the data!

249
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,651
Dug enough bodies out of the landslide yet?

250
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:01,853
I'd like to continue with
recovery operations if that's possible.

251
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,728
Be my guest till it's out of your system.

252
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,293
Consider it Princess Cornelia's pleasure to indulge you.

253
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:13,393
Ah, Lloyd, Zero and the Black Knights,

254
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:14,753
what are they trying to do?

255
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:18,458
What do they hope to achieve
by sacrificing all these lives?

256
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:21,947
They're "Nights for Justice," haven't you heard?

257
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,370
Is this "justice"?!

258
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,137
Hey, hey, I hope you're not going to start spouting

259
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:29,293
some embarassing theory about the nature of justice.

260
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,451
We're soldiers, after all.

261
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,955
All set!

262
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,503
I replaced the energy filler for you.

263
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:39,737
Uh, okay!

264
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:48,956
Cecile?

265
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:52,226
I checked the units, including the Purebloods'.

266
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,318
And I was right, wasn't I?

267
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,272
Yes. A radiant surge.

268
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,818
Rakshata!

269
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:00,620
I never thought she'd work with our enemies.

270
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,010
Plus their pilot was extremely skilled.

271
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:05,668
Suzaku's mental state is so unstable now,

272
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,960
if we have to fight that knightmare again...

273
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,868
You don't think it could win?

274
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:12,110
Against my dear Lancelot?

275
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,208
This is taking too long. When do we get there?

276
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,906
Could you chill out? You're embarassing.

277
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,038
Hu... What the hell?!

278
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,055
We're going up?

279
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,139
Sorry for the inconvenience.

280
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,647
The master is waiting for you.

281
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,641
This is... the Fuji mines?!

282
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:52,623
That is not possible! There's no way we could be here!

283
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:56,081
It has to be Mt. Fuji!
There's only one mountain like this.

284
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,356
That means the Sakuradite is right below us?!

285
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,666
The damn treasure that caused this whole war!

286
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:02,482
You know what they do to intruders here?

287
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:03,778
Execute them!

288
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,570
Their power reaches all the way out to here?

289
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,340
The Kyoto Group is amazing!

290
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:09,878
It's repulsive!

291
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:13,032
Mt. Fuji, a sacred mountain

292
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,182
once known for its clear water and quiet beauty...

293
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,593
Now, it is bent to the empire's will,

294
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:21,159
a place of hideous violation;

295
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,041
a reflection of what Japan has become.

296
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,997
It pains me so.

297
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,988
I apologize for not showing my face.

298
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,072
But, Zero, your face is hidden as well.

299
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:37,345
Unfortunately, I cannot allow this.

300
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,924
To trust you, I must know who you are.

301
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,272
Therefore, you will show me your face!

302
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,409
Please wait! Zero has given us power and victory!

303
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,057
That should...

304
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,070
Silence!

305
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,018
Now, which of you is Ohgi?

306
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,922
Uh, that's me!

307
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:03,134
You will remove Zero's mask!

308
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:08,689
Ohgi!

309
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:13,247
I'm sorry, Zero, but we need
a reason to put our faith in you, too.

310
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:14,941
So help us...

311
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:16,906
...to put our trust in you!

312
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,489
A woman?!

313
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:21,739
It can't be!

314
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,070
It's not!

315
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:25,973
This isn't Zero! I saw her before.

316
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,176
She was with Zero after Narita!

317
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,770
You there, girl, is this true?

318
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:31,976
It is.

319
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:35,330
So, you are not Japanese?

320
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,357
Correct, clan-chief of Kyoto...

321
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,489
...Taizou Kirihara.

322
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:44,128
Anyone who can identify him must die!

323
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,819
Especially one who is not Japanese!

324
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,561
Hey! Hold on! I'm not part of this!

325
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:58,039
You're soft!

326
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:00,414
And your methods and thinking are outdated!

327
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,797
That is why you'll never win!

328
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:04,807
Zero?

329
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:06,649
Wh-When did you...

330
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:09,851
Hold on! He can fire at us with that remote!

331
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,707
Everyone, stay back! Don't make a move!

332
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,184
Taizou Kirihara.

333
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:20,030
Founder of Kirihara Industries
which has a monopoly on Sakuradite mining.

334
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:23,201
Formerly a key backer of the Kururugi regime.

335
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:27,031
However, when Japan fell, you dodged the tribunals

336
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:29,470
by collaborating with the colonial rulers.

337
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,341
Commonly known as "Kirihara the Traitor."

338
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,893
In reality, you are one of the
leaders of the "Six Houses of Kyoto,"

339
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,714
who support resistance groups throughout Japan.

340
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,982
A double-agent. How cliché...

341
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,943
Show some respect, you swine!

342
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:43,880
Stop!

343
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,465
It's as you guessed though.

344
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,791
I... am not Japanese!

345
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,365
Is he serious?!

346
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,974
No wonder he never showed his face.

347
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,514
If you are not Japanese,

348
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,818
why do you fight for Japan? What is it you want?!

349
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:02,949
The destruction of Britannia.

350
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:06,818
And so do you believe that this is possible?

351
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,230
That you can do it?

352
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,618
I can, because I must.

353
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,336
I have reasons which compel me inexorably!

354
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,901
I'm glad I'm dealing with you.

355
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,397
You!

356
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,599
It's been a long time. Lord Kirihara.

357
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:24,239
Is it really you?

358
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:28,039
It's 8 years since that family received you as a hostage.

359
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:31,080
Yes. And I appreciate you taking care of me then.

360
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,772
If I hadn't come tonight,

361
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,330
were you planning to take a messenger as hostage?

362
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,520
Not at all.

363
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:39,909
I came to ask for your help;
that's all I'm seeking from you.

364
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:45,168
So, the flower planted 8 years ago has finally bloomed.

365
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,285
Oh, I can't see 'im!

366
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,364
Ohgi!

367
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,289
Yes?

368
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:55,568
This man is a true mortal enemy of Britannia.

369
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,887
His face must remain hidden for vital reasons.

370
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,714
I urge you to follow Zero, and I guarantee that if you do,

371
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,343
we will assist you generously

372
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,095
with intelligence and strategic support.

373
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,252
We thank you!

374
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,306
I am grateful, Lord Kirihara.

375
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,460
Are you embarking on the path of blood?

376
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,531
Indeed. If that is my destiny.

377
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,429
Second, fifth, seventh,

378
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,006
eighth, and ninth platoons,
please continue confirmation...

379
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,006
Yes, the spelling of Fenette matches this one.

380
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:30,905
I'm afraid this is him.

381
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,277
I'm sorry you had to learn about it like this.

382
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,908
It's all right...

383
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,089
Can you please identify the body?

384
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,598
Of course it's too late all ready.

385
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,718
Anyway, things are finally moving forward.

386
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,826
Now, the Black Knights will operate as I envisioned.

387
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:12,493
Ah, I'm sorry I was late.

388
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:14,930
I thought you'd already be back home by now.

389
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,122
Anyway, never mind that.

390
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,899
Come on, let's go someplace to get out of the rain now.

391
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:23,724
Lulu, tell me...

392
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,957
Zero, he fights for the weak, doesn't he?

393
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:28,832
Wha...?

394
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:31,128
Yeah, well, that's what he says.

395
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,664
Then... Then why did he kill my father?

396
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:40,374
You know, my father... was so gentle...

397
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,305
He never, ever hurt me...

398
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:45,236
He didn't do anything wrong!

399
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:49,751
But he was buried alive... He couldn't... breathe...

400
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,299
Why...?

401
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:54,084
Why did my father have to die?!

402
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:57,618
I... don't want this...

403
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:00,626
Nooo!

404
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:04,264
Please, Lulu...

405
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:08,757
Help me...

406
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:53,188
Yes, I understand my actions have consequences.

407
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:55,693
I know that now, so why?

408
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,893
It'd be so easy to vanish from the stage.

409
00:23:57,918 --> 00:23:59,591
Just stop being Zero.

410
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,918
If I can keep Kirihara quiet,

411
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,710
I can go back to being merely Lelouch Lamperouge.

412
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:07,051
But, even so...
