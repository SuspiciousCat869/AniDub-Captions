1
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:13,013
Your Majesty, the remains have arrived.

2
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:16,751
I was just conversing with Clovis, actually.

3
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:17,124
Huh?

4
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,923
The project must proceed. Without a moment's delay.

5
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:59,234
What's an Eleven doing here?!

6
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,952
He was a suspect in Prince Clovis's murder!

7
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:03,658
But the teacher said the charges were dropped.

8
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:05,872
He was suspicious enough to arrest though, right?

9
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,294
You don't really think he's a terrorist, do you?

10
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,846
Um?

11
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,280
Of course he isn't.

12
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,568
The school board would know something like that.

13
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,239
An Eleven here at school?

14
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:17,160
He is an honorary Britannian.

15
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,098
I know but still, all the same.

16
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,216
Well, he doesn't look all that scary to me.

17
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,019
Why don't we just talk to him, I'm sure he's totally...

18
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:23,711
Hey.

19
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,447
The guy just got here, give him some space.

20
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,820
Seven years since we used this signal. Long time, huh?

21
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,091
Meeting on the roof like the old days.

22
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:01,728
Yeah.

23
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,518
I'm glad you're okay. I've been worried.

24
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,392
Alive and kicking, thanks to you.

25
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:09,577
You almost died... trying to protect me...

26
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,418
I was just returning the favor. From seven years ago.

27
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,904
What about the girl? You know, from the capsule?

28
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,718
I don't really know, we got seperated during the fray.

29
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:24,290
But you would know more about her than I do, right?

30
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:26,773
No. The only ones who knew anything

31
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:29,143
were the inner circle of the Royal Guard.

32
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,414
I see.

33
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,896
And your name, do I still call you Lelouch?

34
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:36,853
The records count my old identity among the dead.

35
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,797
I go by the name Lelouch Lamperouge now.

36
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:41,918
Oh.

37
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,054
And you? What happened at your court martial?

38
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,882
And why did you enroll at this school?

39
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,274
I'm as surprised as you are.

40
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,636
What're the odds that we'd end up at the same school?

41
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:52,880
Truth is...

42
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:56,217
...someone arranged for me to
receive a proper investigation.

43
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,694
And that person said that a
17-year-old should be in school.

44
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,614
Were all of these painted by Clovis?

45
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:11,127
Yes.

46
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:17,784
Such gentle colors... Very much akin to my brother.

47
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,648
We've successfully identified the guerillas.

48
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:25,137
That's good. Now all we need is their hideout.

49
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,221
Get that intel to the viceroy!

50
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:28,236
Yes, my lord!

51
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:40,839
What the...?!

52
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,842
Is that Cornelia?!

53
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:45,868
Relics of a forgotten age.

54
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,053
Darlton! In here, correct?

55
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,560
Yes, m'lady. Shall we accompany you?

56
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,497
Not for this level of resistance.

57
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:07,408
Understood.

58
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:12,401
Surrender at once, you feeble-minded Elevens!

59
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,011
Down with Britannia!

60
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,434
Doesn't seem Zero is here.

61
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,327
No point in going after them one at a time, I suppose.

62
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,340
Vermin.

63
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,710
Rot like the filth that you are!

64
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,909
Hi, Lelouch. I've returned home.

65
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,641
Hi, there. Welcome back. Miss Sayoko.

66
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,328
I've got a special present for you today.

67
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,320
Really? What could it be?

68
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,334
Huh?

69
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,026
This hand.

70
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,310
Thank heaven.

71
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:15,800
I knew it. I just knew you'd be all right!

72
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,072
It's been a long time, Nunnally.

73
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,840
So tell me, you will stay the night, won't you?

74
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:25,953
Suzaku's enrolled as a student at Ashford Academy now.

75
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,898
So you can see him anytime you want.

76
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:28,985
Is that true?!

77
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:31,132
Well, I still have military duties,

78
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,959
so I can't be here every day.

79
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,787
Oh, you're... you're still in the military?

80
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,826
Don't worry.

81
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:39,180
I've been re-assigned to the engineering corp.

82
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:40,997
It's a lot less dangerous.

83
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:43,350
Oh, cool. Engineering, huh?

84
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,789
Oh! Lemme help you!

85
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:48,225
You just sit down.

86
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:51,218
Unlike seven years ago, we get to be your host now.

87
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:51,754
Uh.

88
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,065
It's funny, you're a lot more mellow than you used to be.

89
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,995
And you're a bit more rough.

90
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,400
Ha, I suppose.

91
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:01,077
Hm?

92
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:03,885
I told you to stay in my room.

93
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:05,105
That boy out there.

94
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,989
He's the Britannian soldier from Shinjuku, isn't he?

95
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,291
Is that wise?

96
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:12,203
Don't worry, it's fine. He's...

97
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:13,410
Hm?

98
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:16,371
He's a friend... from the past.

99
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:19,348
You're getting out, Jeremiah.

100
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:20,796
Lord Guilford!

101
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:22,622
You see I'm innocent, don't you?!

102
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,015
Well it seems in the eyes of the court you are anyway.

103
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,288
Orange boy.

104
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,678
Whatever the truth is, Zero got away.

105
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:31,689
And you purebloods let it happen.

106
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,016
You've been demoted three ranks for failure.

107
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,600
You have two options to choose from.

108
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,748
Starting over as a pilot,

109
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:42,112
or cultivating an orange farm.

110
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,302
You should come by again.

111
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:46,639
Nunnally would enjoy it.

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,527
Sure. But...

113
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,080
Hm?

114
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,349
Lelouch, I...

115
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,703
I don't think we should be seen together at school.

116
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:53,677
What do you mean?

117
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:55,685
Think. How would you explain it?

118
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:58,300
Being friends with an honorary Britannian?

119
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,342
We have to guard your secret.

120
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,510
No one can know you're royalty.

121
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,050
Uh.

122
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,210
And the same goes for Nunnally.

123
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,575
I don't wanna cause you any trouble...

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,209
Doing it again, huh? Everyone's needs but your own!

125
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:10,823
Again?

126
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,156
Forget it...

127
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:13,125
Uh...

128
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,970
Thanks for having me. It was a lotta fun.

129
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:17,750
I'll, uh... see you later.

130
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,111
Right.

131
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,965
I'm so glad, ya know?

132
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:21,847
Huh?

133
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,204
I never thought we'd get another chance...

134
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,415
...to talk like this.

135
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,285
So, what's the deal?

136
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,378
Something happen to you yesterday, or what?

137
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,620
Ya didn't even show up for the council meeting.

138
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,955
You know, I kinda tanked that history exam.

139
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,258
Please, I don't buy that.

140
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:44,036
The way you study? I...

141
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,208
Stop it, you guys.

142
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:46,837
Huh?

143
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:54,968
It hasn't made the news yet,

144
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:58,027
but the "Blood of the Samurai"
faction was wiped out by Cornelia.

145
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,057
They were the largest group we had in Central Japan.

146
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:04,440
Look, Zero, it won't be long till she comes after us.

147
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,389
Just keep your head. Our chance will come.

148
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:08,082
But...!

149
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,192
Sit tight, I'll contact you later.

150
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,843
He's getting too overly familiar...

151
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,687
Maybe I'd better cut my ties with them.

152
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:16,481
Huh?

153
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,728
Nina?

154
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,166
I'm sorry, am I too loud?

155
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:37,461
Not at all. Why are you here? What about class?

156
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,140
Oh...

157
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,556
Something wrong?

158
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:43,014
Well, it's... I dunno... a little scary.

159
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,956
Scary?

160
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,373
We have a transfer student in our class now.

161
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:49,721
It's that boy who was accused of murdering Prince Clovis.

162
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,216
He's an Eleven.

163
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,237
Oh. Thanks for all the repeat business.

164
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:05,245
Although the name on the account we
debit has a guy's name on it, is that okay?

165
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,185
Huh? Trying to you hide your mask, huh?

166
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,210
Unlike my Geass, the mask is a physical piece of evidence.

167
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:21,927
Huh?

168
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,672
All right, Lelouch. The tea is ready when you are.

169
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,111
That smell. Hey, did you ordered pizza again?

170
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,971
I'm racking up reward points.

171
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:32,624
I'll be right down, okay?

172
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,003
Lelouch.

173
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:34,441
Hm?

174
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:37,004
Maybe you should cut down on the pizza.

175
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:39,262
You don't want a blubbery belly.

176
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,619
Just don't touch or rub it, okay?

177
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,083
Ooh, scary!

178
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,868
Hm? What the heck?

179
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,882
Yeah... I was wondering if that was going on.

180
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,050
They're just being cruel to Suzaku.

181
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,521
No. It's just...

182
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:10,037
These things take time. People will come around.

183
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:12,205
Isn't there anything you can do though?

184
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,198
I mean, he is your friend.

185
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:22,317
Huh?

186
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,906
Hey! Give that back!

187
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,636
Uh... Lelouch?

188
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:34,852
A cat...

189
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:38,965
A... stupid, little cat! You've gotta be kidding me!

190
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,961
There's no way I'm getting exposed by a lousy feline!

191
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:43,413
Huh?

192
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,960
That wasn't my fault... was it?

193
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:48,983
I didn't touch or rub anything. Hmm.

194
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,107
Yeah, that's right. I think a cat ran
off with something pretty important to him.

195
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:01,164
Important?

196
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,223
I'm not sure what exactly,

197
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,507
but I'm positive it was something of value to him.

198
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:09,762
Because... I've never heard my brother sound like that!

199
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,861
He was completely hysterical!

200
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:12,720
That's weird.

201
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,772
What could be so important to the guy?

202
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:15,791
A love letter?

203
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,651
An embarrassing photo?

204
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,017
Poetry he wrote?

205
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,097
Poetry?

206
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:25,479
Leave it to us! We'll get our hands on this
thing before Lelouch has a chance to blink!

207
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:26,916
Just you wait!

208
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,733
If I had those terrorists with me,

209
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,591
we could encircle the enemy! Maybe Kallen?

210
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,555
No... She's suspicious of me as it is!

211
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,676
Get it together.

212
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,686
So anyway, I told him to buzz off, he know?

213
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,114
Totally. And then?

214
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,139
C'mon, you can guess, can't you!

215
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:54,941
Hm? What's up with that cat?

216
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,985
Is that the mask Zero wears? Or am I crazy?

217
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,915
No way. Why would it be here?

218
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:02,104
You two saw it?!

219
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,454
Forget everything you've just seen!

220
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,895
Sure, no problem at all.

221
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,452
Good.

222
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,914
This is Milly Ashford, your student council president.

223
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,551
Cat hunt, everybody!

224
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:17,869
Cat hunt?

225
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,758
There's a cat loose on campus that needs to be rounded up!

226
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,678
Put everything on hold people.

227
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,395
Participating clubs'll get budget priority!

228
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:30,262
And whoever catches our feline
friend will get an extra special prize!

229
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:33,782
A big 'ole kiss from one of the members of the council!

230
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,264
Members of... Wait, like me?!?!

231
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,505
Exactly!

232
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,923
You've been hangin' the student council haven't ya!

233
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,406
Wouldn't mind a taste 'a those lips!

234
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,822
It's not gonna be like some lame
peck on the cheek though, is it?!

235
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,981
A kiss on the cheek would be fine with me!

236
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:50,797
Wait, we can choose where she plants it?!

237
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,748
Whoa. Yeah.

238
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,179
All right!

239
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:59,765
There's no way that's how I'm gonna get my first kiss!

240
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,040
What? From a member of the student council?

241
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,565
Does that include Lelouch?

242
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,207
Actually, I would prefer Milly.

243
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,980
Ugh. Could you get back in the closet please?

244
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,908
Hut-hut-hut!

245
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,110
We have the advantage in mobility!

246
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,428
Hurry, look for catnip!

247
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,674
Science will prevail!

248
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,364
And when you do catch that cat,

249
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,714
bring what it's carrying to me! To me! To meeee!

250
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,359
Milly! Stay out of this, will ya!

251
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:28,372
Offering people up as prizes.
That's why I hate Britannians.

252
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,994
I know, crazy, right?

253
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,040
Yeah, I can hardly believe it.

254
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,101
I was, like, floored when I heard it.

255
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,726
All I can say is sign me up!

256
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:38,200
Dammit! Why do I have to pretend like I'm sick and feeble?

257
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,859
Jeez, I'm sorry about that...

258
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,206
Shirley, why are you dressed like that?!

259
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,683
I didn't have time to change!

260
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,784
They're gonna make us kiss somebody. We've gotta hurry!

261
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:50,678
I'm with you!

262
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:53,924
Nunnally, is there anything about this cat that's special?

263
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:54,944
Hm...

264
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,612
I think that its leg must be hurt

265
00:14:57,637 --> 00:15:00,221
because it's footsteps sounded off to me.

266
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,454
And uh... Oh! I almost forgot!

267
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,970
It meowed like this...

268
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,416
Meooowwww!

269
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,404
Meooowwwwwwwwww!

270
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,184
This school seems so laid back.

271
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:13,519
In spite of the fact that they're in mourning.

272
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:16,115
You suppose Sukzaku will be all right in here?

273
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,780
Never mind that. The university here...

274
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,009
Don't worry, I've made arrangements with them.

275
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:21,909
Hmm...

276
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:25,395
They still didn't have to kick poor Lancelot out though.

277
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,228
I know.

278
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,105
Even if they did say Elevens aren't acceptable.

279
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,588
'Kay! Let's go!

280
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:35,279
What happens if a member of the
student council catches the cat?

281
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:36,716
We don't get a prize do we?

282
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,820
Do we get a kiss? But of course.

283
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:40,915
Is that so?

284
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,622
Well, what are we waitin' around for then?

285
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,495
This is my day t'shine...

286
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,071
Hey! No speeding on campus!

287
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:57,251
Okay, we do this right and our lips will be safe.

288
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:58,998
Shirley, you cover the rear.

289
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,080
Wait a sec!

290
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,269
What's the matter?

291
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,076
Who would you wanna get a kiss from?

292
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,889
 Is there anybody in particular?

293
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:07,542
Huh?

294
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,353
It wouldn't be Lelou, would it?

295
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:11,554
Just what would make you think that?

296
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh, well... I guess... it's just...

297
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:19,898
Hey, that's...

298
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,511
Suzaku?

299
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,952
Lelouch?! You're looking for the cat too?

300
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,357
Up there...

301
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,024
Suzaku, wait!

302
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:34,609
Don't go up there!

303
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,884
But the student council president said to catch it!

304
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,710
Don't worry about it, I'll get the cat!

305
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:40,795
I was always more agile than you!

306
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:42,694
Remember when that little bird got loose?

307
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,480
Quit talkin' ancient history!

308
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,566
It was only seven years ago!

309
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,957
Oh, for Pete's sake.

310
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,506
He always was an exercise nut...

311
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,828
So someone's got it cornered, huh?!

312
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,118
Who's the lucky winner?!

313
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:58,098
Up there!

314
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,678
Suzaku?

315
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,898
Easy now. You don't have to be scared.

316
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,203
Suzaku! Come back!

317
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,304
It's all right. Leave this to me.

318
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,367
That's funny.

319
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,728
He never went along with the crowd like this.

320
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:15,939
Huh?

321
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:17,858
Lelouch!

322
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,454
Are you... okay?

323
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,027
Y-Yeah...

324
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:29,908
Is it possible... those two are?

325
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,571
Pretty calm for someone on the verge of death.

326
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,463
Yeah, right. I was just limp with fear.

327
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:50,860
Huh?

328
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,318
Hey, what's going on?

329
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:55,773
That transfer student just saved
Lelouch from a really close call.

330
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:56,588
Uh.

331
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,815
I think it's the same cat from the other day.

332
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,279
Huh.

333
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,583
You saved him! Thank you so much, Suzaku!

334
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,398
Yeah, way to go there, new guy!

335
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,673
That cat was carrying something, wasn't it?

336
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,547
Yeah, there was something on its head,

337
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,728
but I never really got a good look at it.

338
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,839
Guess it slipped off when I wasn't looking.

339
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,352
So where is Lelou?

340
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,655
He said he forgot something. Told me to go ahead.

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,096
That's it! The embarrassing secret that he's hiding!

342
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:33,437
Hm?

343
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,811
So that's it, Madame President?

344
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:36,329
Hm?

345
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:42,563
Aww. After all this time, I
thought I had some dirt on you.

346
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,037
Yeah, he almost lost his cool for once.

347
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,202
So, uh, do you two know each other, then?

348
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,103
Yeah, but, he's an Eleven.

349
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:58,722
No, I just...

350
00:18:58,747 --> 00:18:59,682
He's my friend.

351
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:01,919
Madame President,

352
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,406
would you permit him as a member of the student council?

353
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:05,076
Huh...?

354
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,431
The rules are clear.

355
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,811
All students are required to join a club.

356
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,255
Although...

357
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:15,788
Well, you are the vice president.

358
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,648
I s'pose I can't refuse.

359
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,134
Well then, I'd say that's the end of that.

360
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,294
Now c'mere you two, lend me an ear.

361
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,288
Nunnally?

362
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:35,281
There you go, the reward Miss Milly promised.

363
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,878
Since you both caught the cat,

364
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,589
you'll just have to settle for me.

365
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:40,523
Almost a real council member!

366
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:41,626
All right then!

367
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,611
Let's celebrate the catching of the cat!

368
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,702
Everything's on the new guy, naturally!

369
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,061
Oh, back off!

370
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,495
Hi there, I'm Shirley!

371
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:49,632
Pleasure to meet 'cha!

372
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,291
Oh, right, I'm Rivalz!

373
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,797
Milly Ashford. Student council president.

374
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,882
The pleasure is mine.

375
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:23,043
And now, his royal majesty,

376
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,690
the 98th emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire!

377
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:35,642
All men.. are not created equal...

378
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:39,919
Some are born swifter of foot. Some with greater beauty.

379
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,021
Some are born into poverty.

380
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,846
And others born sick and feeble.

381
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,976
Both in birth and in upbringing.

382
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:51,209
In sheer scope of ability, every
human is inheritantly different.

383
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:52,358
Yes,

384
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:55,475
that is why people discriminate against one another.

385
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:58,417
Which is why there is struggle, competition,

386
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,944
and the unfaltering march of progress.

387
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:03,354
Inequality...

388
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,050
...is not wrong. Equality is.

389
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:10,359
What of the EU, which made equality a right?

390
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:14,003
Rabble politics by a popularity contest!

391
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:17,789
The Chinese Federation with
its equal distribution of wealth?

392
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,513
A nation of lazy dullards...

393
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,980
But not our beloved Britannia.

394
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:27,187
We fight. We compete. Evolution is continuous.

395
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:30,191
Evolution. Such a pretty little word.

396
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:32,641
Britannia alone moves forward,

397
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,103
advancing steadily into the future.

398
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,480
Even the death of my son Clovis,

399
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,420
demonstrates Britannia's
unswerving commitment to progress.

400
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,695
We will fight on!

401
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,470
We shall struggle, compete, plunder, and dominate!

402
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:51,713
And in the end, the future shall be ours.

403
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,813
All hail Britannia.

404
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:56,213
All hail Britannia!

405
00:21:56,238 --> 00:22:09,453
All hail Britannia!

406
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:13,447
So... This is Lelouch's enemy. Well.

407
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,945
The word "hatred" is not strong enough...

408
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,580
If my father is the embodiment of Brittannia,

409
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:55,950
he must be detroyed!

410
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,581
And if Cornelia gets in my
way, she'll suffer the same fate!

411
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,884
You may not know it yet, but I have power!

412
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:07,313
So long as I possess Geass, I can go this alone.
