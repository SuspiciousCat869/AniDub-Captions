1
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:09,108
The date was August 10 in the
year 2010 of the Imperial calendar.

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,937
The Holy Britannian Empire had
just declared war upon Japan.

3
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,484
Confronted by Britannia's newest weapon,

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,324
the formidable Knightmare Frame,

5
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,965
Japan fell to its enemy in less than a month.

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:24,823
The conquered nation was stripped of
its freedom, rights, culture, and dignity.

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,623
Finally, even its name was taken away.

8
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:28,806
Eleven.

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,850
The name of Japan and its people
was replaced with a mere number.

10
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,297
I don't understand

11
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,270
what it is you wanted me to do?

12
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,612
Why did you give me this bizarre power?

13
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,460
How could all these royal guard be dead?!

14
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:44,405
What happened here, boy?!

15
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,180
And why is a Britannian student in a place like this?!

16
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,806
Are you deaf?! Answer me, or I'll...

17
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:53,833
Answer me!

18
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:57,007
I order you to come out! At once!

19
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,178
Who the hell do you think you are to order me?

20
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:03,227
I see.

21
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,944
It only works with direct eye contact.

22
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,146
My name is Alan Spacer.

23
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,578
My father's a duke.

24
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:10,937
Nobility.

25
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,245
My I.D. card's in my breast pocket.

26
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:17,003
After you confirm who I am, I'll request your protection.

27
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,101
Keep your hands up in the air.

28
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,728
I'll take out your I.D.

29
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,502
Now then, hand your Knightmare over to me.

30
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:40,183
Understood.

31
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:43,889
The code number is XG21G2D4.

32
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,204
Got it.

33
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,245
What the...?

34
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,093
So, are we having a bad day?!

35
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,266
Looks like you missed a chance
to go heaven, Private Kururugi.

36
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:04,410
I did? Uh.

37
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:05,150
Where...?

38
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:08,343
Hm? Ah. We're still in the Shinjuku ghetto.

39
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:12,207
With Prince Clovis nearby, this is
probably the safest place anywhere.

40
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:15,412
This is what saved your life, Mr. Suzaku.

41
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:19,336
You're lucky it was under your protective
suit because that's what deflected the bullet.

42
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:20,635
Is it a keepsake?

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,331
Yeah. Very.

44
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:27,227
You Elevens believe that gods live inside of
everything, even objects, don't you? I guess this one...

45
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:27,968
Is Lelou...?

46
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,350
What's the latest on the situation?

47
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,837
It looks like the poison gas was released.

48
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,608
Massive Eleven casualties have been reported.

49
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,808
They haven't caught the perpetrators yet.

50
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,558
They haven't, huh? Not yet...

51
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:45,198
Private Kururugi, how much experience do
you have in piloting a Knightmare Frame?

52
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:45,846
Wha...?

53
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,048
But... there's no way an Eleven would be made a knight.

54
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,512
Well, supposing you could.

55
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,277
Congratulations!

56
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:56,006
The only Knightmare of its kind awaits you!

57
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,022
Once you take the controls of this big beauty,

58
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,989
everything will change. You and your world.

59
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,833
Whether you want it to or not.

60
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,468
Those damned Brittanians!

61
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,722
Kallen! Can the Glasgow still move?!

62
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,981
Don't worry, Ohgi, it's all right! I'll decoy them!

63
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,154
Get the people out of here!

64
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,879
The only ones that'll be captured
are those us in the resistance!

65
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,126
I know, but we're trapped!

66
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,950
They've got us completely surrounded!

67
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,022
When that happens, use this sticker.

68
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:29,820
What's that for?

69
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:32,333
That's because you don't have enough leg strength, right?

70
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,337
You're wrong. You sink when you get fat.

71
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,037
Because you snack, right?

72
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:35,777
Huh?

73
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,140
I'll be fine. I burn up twice as many calories.

74
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,131
Uh, Lelou?

75
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:41,015
Uh, what in the world have you been doing?

76
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,333
Where are you now?

77
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,621
If you keep cutting class, you'll get held back.

78
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,651
Are you near a TV?

79
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:46,645
A TV?

80
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,894
Sorry, but this is important.

81
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:50,410
Hmph.

82
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,787
Hang on.

83
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,512
Hey, can I change the channel?

84
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,691
Huh? To what?

85
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:55,439
The news.

86
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,060
Is there anything about Shinjuku?

87
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,178
News? Let's see...

88
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:01,633
There's nothing on. Traffic restrictions?

89
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:02,919
Why is it restricted?

90
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,512
I dunno. They're not saying.

91
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:06,608
I get it.

92
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:10,672
Once they finish everything off, they'll
release news that favors the military.

93
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,552
Hm?

94
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,389
Oh, you're gambling again, aren't you?

95
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,350
I've warned you before, more
than once, how dangerous that is!

96
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,051
Yup. You caught me.

97
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:23,033
By the way, tell my little sister that
I'm gonna be home late tonight, would you?

98
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,015
Thanks.

99
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:25,381
Oh!

100
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:27,789
Why does he always hang up on me like that?!

101
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,820
The number you have called is beyond service range.

102
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:32,814
Oh, darn it, not this again.

103
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,645
They need to keep a lid on this information,

104
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,145
so it'll be hard for them to call in reinforcements.

105
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,664
They'll have to make do with
the pieces they have on the board.

106
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,911
I'm hemmed in here,

107
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,026
it'll be tough to break through by myself.

108
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:46,663
Gaining refuge carries its own risk, too.

109
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:54,588
I want payback for bein' dragged into your fight.

110
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,274
It's our Glasgow friend.

111
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,269
Just 30 minutes left!

112
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,373
The west entrance!

113
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:11,381
Use the tracks to move to the west entrance!

114
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:12,273
Who's this?!

115
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,756
How do you know this code?!

116
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,072
That doesn't matter!

117
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:17,177
If you wanna win, you're just gonna have to trust me!

118
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:18,137
To win?

119
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:25,473
Okay, what am I supposed to do now?

120
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,475
You pathetic Eleven.

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,750
If you simply run away,

122
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,325
this hunt hasn't much to offer in the way of sport.

123
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,302
Since you trusted me, you're gonna win.

124
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,112
Jump onto the train!

125
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,221
Gotcha!

126
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:45,054
You think you can get through that way, hm?

127
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,377
If that's your plan, then...

128
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:48,987
You, go after the Glasgow!

129
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,235
Yes, my lord!

130
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:51,704
What the...?!

131
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,739
Shot by friendly fire?!

132
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,604
What's your name and your unit?!

133
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,340
We're after the one-armed Glas...

134
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,763
Oh my god! A terrorist?!

135
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,694
You son of a...!

136
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,002
You saved me.

137
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:23,867
But how did you get a hold of a Sutherland? Uh?

138
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,940
What? Where did he go?

139
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,290
Kallen!

140
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,467
What the hell was that radio message earlier?

141
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,575
What? He contacted you, too?!

142
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Sure did. And Yoshida's group oughta be here soon.

143
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:35,192
Hm?

144
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,400
Are you in charge?

145
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,212
Huh? Uh, yeah.

146
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,829
I present to you the cargo in that train over there.

147
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,465
They're tools for your victory.

148
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:46,281
If you want to use them to win, then follow my orders.

149
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,100
There's more in here!

150
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,084
Here, too!

151
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,240
Amazing!

152
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,419
Maybe we can give this guy a chance!

153
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:56,577
All this...

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,650
But how...?

155
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,906
Woman in the Glasgow.

156
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,063
Y-Yes!

157
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,387
Stay where you are.

158
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:03,563
Your unit's gonna run decoy, you got that?

159
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:04,746
Understood.

160
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,120
Energy filler status?

161
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,558
About 15 minute's worth.

162
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,563
Then recharge it.

163
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,648
In ten minutes, I'll contact
you with your next instructions.

164
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,194
This is wearing me out.

165
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:20,096
Regardless, I'll need determination to succeed.

166
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:23,410
After all, I'm betting my life in this game.

167
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:29,183
The terrorists are mixed among the Eleven populace
and they're mounting a minor resistance against us.

168
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:32,390
But they pose little threat to our vastly superior army.

169
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,302
We know that. Moving on...

170
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:35,977
Understood, Your Highness.

171
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,198
The gas capsules will be...

172
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,638
What the public thinks.

173
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,904
Yes. We'll keep searching for her.

174
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,048
Either way, I want her captured, dead or alive.

175
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,746
Hey, are you certain about this whole thing?

176
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,612
They've all had their IFF's removed.

177
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:49,987
What if this is a trap?

178
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,442
The other side has total advantage in this war.

179
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,173
They don't need to set any traps!

180
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,721
All right, people, let's move!
Get to your assigned points...

181
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:57,971
P-1, can you move?

182
00:09:58,154 --> 00:10:00,808
It operates basically the same as what you're used to.

183
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:02,508
Can't you tell us who you are?

184
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,385
At least your name.

185
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:04,408
I can't do that.

186
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,235
What if these signals are being intercepted?

187
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,938
Any way, if Q-1 is on schedule, enemy Sutherlands,
probably two of them, will reach you in 23 seconds.

188
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,167
Shoot them through the wall.

189
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,420
Aah! He's outta his mind!

190
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,667
Everyone, double-check your weapons.

191
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,906
What?! Are you serious?!

192
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,881
Enemy spotted at point F-31.

193
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,535
A feint, eh? How pedestrian.

194
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,900
Tell Lazlo squad to go straight in!

195
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,606
Have Eugen and Valerie strike from the rear!

196
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:36,353
Three... two... one... Fire!

197
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,204
What?!

198
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:46,400
Sir Eugen and Sir Valerie, both lost.

199
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,575
Huh? An ambush?

200
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,753
An I.D. signal can be a double-edged sword.

201
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:56,571
Besides, if the terrorists follow the orders I issue,

202
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,171
my task at hand is sure to be completed.

203
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:02,496
P-1, P-4, P-7, move 100 meters to the right.

204
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,741
Fire your slash harkens toward three o'clock.

205
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:07,010
You heard him! Do what the voice says!

206
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,891
Damn, what else does he want us to do?!

207
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,348
P-5, ready?

208
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,791
Agh! Quit callin' me that!

209
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,854
They're using the same...

210
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,489
The enemy's moving towards G-28!

211
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:22,460
Send Lazlo squad... I mean Glaube squad!

212
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:26,312
This means... terrorists have our military weaponry?

213
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:35,279
Sir Glaube has ejected!

214
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:36,227
His unit's been lost!

215
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,927
Change our codes! They're intercepting our transmission!

216
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:40,798
We already have, sir! Four times!

217
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:41,675
Do it again!!

218
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,618
This failure is unacceptable!

219
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:44,921
Forgive me!

220
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:45,921
Good afternoon!

221
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:46,937
What is it?!

222
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:48,466
We're in the middle of an operation!

223
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,235
I'd say it's time to deploy the ASEEC's special weapon.

224
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,166
We've no time for this right now!

225
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,014
R-2, fire anchor.

226
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,764
B-7, use U.N. ordnance.

227
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:02,772
N-Group, you'll continue your advance.

228
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:05,935
You filthy Elevens.

229
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,362
We just lost Lazlo squad!

230
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:12,035
So do it! We'll have to bring up Quincy's squad!

231
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,253
My lord, that will break the encirclement!

232
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:18,015
Now then. The enemy has five options. Their move...

233
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:21,056
Reinforce the breach with some of the units guarding me.

234
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,846
All we know for certain is that enemy forces are here.

235
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,262
Who ordered them to break formation?

236
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,873
Well, that's a more stupid move than I expected.

237
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:35,235
You, Q-1, do you have an area map?

238
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,242
Yes, I have a map of the old town.

239
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:39,146
But it has no current landmarks.

240
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:39,984
It'll do.

241
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,892
All right. Send in Bertz and the others, too!

242
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,479
Mission Number Three now.

243
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,648
Concentrate our forces there! Surround them!

244
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,139
Is everything prepared?

245
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,912
The enemy's main force is that center dot.

246
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:52,922
Finish every one of them off!

247
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,452
What?! Where's the enemy?!

248
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,897
With this, I call check.

249
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:22,906
My plan worked, didn't it?

250
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:27,131
I can do it! I can! I can defeat Britannia!

251
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:29,958
Who...?

252
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,715
Who in hell am I up against?!

253
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:36,371
What if... he's even better than Tohdoh?!

254
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,129
Lloyd!

255
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:38,768
Yes, Your Highness?

256
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,939
Can it win?

257
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:41,289
Will your toy beat them?

258
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:41,752
Hmph.

259
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:46,007
My lord. Please be so kind as to call it Lancelot.

260
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,793
Z-0-1 Lancelot, now activating.

261
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:57,046
Lancelot activating. Releasing hatch.

262
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,546
Z-0-1 Lancelot, stand by for activation.

263
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,562
Pallet extension, initiating.

264
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,218
Did you read the manual?

265
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:06,076
Pretty much.

266
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,035
Well done.

267
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,660
You scored at the top of the class in the simulator.

268
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:12,910
Hey, look, about what you told me earlier...

269
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:13,756
Huh?

270
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:17,721
Ah... It could be, but the possibility is nearly zero.

271
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:20,034
But that means there's still a chance, right?

272
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,091
Yes, I'm afraid that's true.

273
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,735
Even so, you're not to do anything reckless.

274
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,477
The new system is not outfitted
with an ejection mechanism.

275
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,343
Okay. I understand, Miss Cecile.

276
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,125
That's it?

277
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:40,295
Yes. The advanced weapon developed by us in
the Advanced Special Envoy Engineering Corps.

278
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:44,522
Lancelot. The world's first
7th generation Knightmare Frame.

279
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:48,704
Well, if you're ready, Suzaku, shall
we proceed with the initial start-up?

280
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:51,693
Initial start-up now proceeding from phase 20.

281
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,471
Equipping energy filler.

282
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,646
Confirm pre-start.

283
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,643
Energy filler now at full output.

284
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:58,396
Thirty seconds to reach critical voltage.

285
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:00,512
Core luminous, shifting phase. Yggdrasil Drive...

286
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,210
Initiating Devicer set up.

287
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:05,688
Confirming entry of devicer into Z-0-1.

288
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:08,733
Individual ID registration, confirmed.

289
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:11,496
Confirm man-machine interface, engaged.

290
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,018
Yggdrasil resonance, confirmed.

291
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,641
Rejection response, weak.

292
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,558
Devicer stress response, weak.

293
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,962
All readings nominal.

294
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,743
So far, it's going per the data.

295
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:20,556
Status, all green.

296
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,706
Status of back-up tactical bank, authorized.

297
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,282
Secondary confirmation given.

298
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:34,749
Lancelot.

299
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,863
Activate M.E. boost!

300
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,321
Lancelot, launch!

301
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,579
Running full throttle right out of the gate!

302
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,554
Cooler than the manual.

303
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:52,136
With this... Uh.

304
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,581
Huh? What is that?

305
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,592
It doesn't look like a Suther...

306
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,288
Another push, and the checkpoint with fall...

307
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,854
This is B-Group, reporting enemy presence!

308
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,545
Hm? Reinforcements?

309
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,210
Real battle is different, isn't it?

310
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:09,217
Status.

311
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,325
Everyone ejected,

312
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,579
but they took out four units in nothing flat!

313
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,533
Enemy numbers?

314
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:14,516
Just one!

315
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:15,869
I think it's a new model.

316
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,960
Never seen anything like... Ah!

317
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,460
What's happening out there?!

318
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:30,671
Bastard!

319
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,310
What?! It reflects bullets?

320
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,923
Ah! What do we do?!

321
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:36,933
Ishida!

322
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,926
Useless so-called terrorists.

323
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:43,646
With all the resources they have,
they're being beaten by one unit.

324
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:47,134
Dammit!

325
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:52,845
Yes, I can do this!

326
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,741
With Lancelot, I can stop all this at once!

327
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,682
N-4, N-5, hold there.

328
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,937
When the rear units arrive, surround that thing!

329
00:16:59,055 --> 00:16:59,841
Gotcha.

330
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,517
We can't stop it!

331
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,970
N-units, what is it?!

332
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:16,268
What happened? Something I didn't foresee?

333
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:17,577
For heaven's sake...

334
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,650
Now I'll owe my older brother
a debt I don't need to incur.

335
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,322
It's for the best, though.

336
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:29,979
P-1, report!

337
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,602
The enemy...

338
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,514
Can it really be only one unit?

339
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:38,824
These readings are even higher than predicted.

340
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,606
It's because our pilot is taking his job very seriously.

341
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,083
If I can stop all of the
Knightmares, then this battle is over.

342
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,512
No matter what it takes,

343
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,772
I've gotta save Lelouch and that girl.

344
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,022
Uh?

345
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:06,410
You mean this thing's what's ruining my plan?!

346
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,710
Are you the guy that's in command?

347
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,899
Nothing more than a pilot! How dare he!

348
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,285
No choice, I've gotta get outta here!

349
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:32,679
Hey! I'm returning the favor!

350
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:37,962
I can't...!

351
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,366
I must remember that.

352
00:18:45,587 --> 00:18:48,206
The most vital element in battle is the human one.

353
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,925
That damn monster's unstoppable!

354
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:05,515
Bastard! He's tearing things up for no reason!

355
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,488
Huh?

356
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,110
In the midst of battle, he rescues someone?

357
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,815
Hmph. I'll concede you the tactical victory here.

358
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,185
Nevertheless...

359
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,519
Huh? He saved someone?

360
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,190
Yes. So it would seem.

361
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,173
Hmm...

362
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,275
It's very strange of him.

363
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:36,817
Suzaku?

364
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:39,740
Are you tired? We'll call it quits for today.

365
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,327
No, I'm fine. Please let me keep going.

366
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:44,977
Be careful with his operational time!

367
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:46,046
Yes, sir!

368
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,965
My, that boy's an excellent piece of equipment.

369
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,971
Stop there! Your I.D.

370
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:54,754
This is Prince Clovis' personal transport!

371
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,513
At last, the checkpoint.

372
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,498
And barely guarded, per my plan.

373
00:19:58,523 --> 00:19:59,340
Your plan?

374
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,222
That's right.

375
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:02,467
Now, I'd like you to let me pass.

376
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,640
Yes, sir. Understood.

377
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,204
Kallen!

378
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:11,177
It's your fault!

379
00:20:11,202 --> 00:20:13,504
This is what happens when you oppose the Britannians!

380
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,877
What?! Why, you gutless coward!

381
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,083
How many people were killed because of this?!

382
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:21,514
Shut up! Do you know how many of
us were killed or captured?! Do ya?!

383
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:23,158
Quit cryin'!

384
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,785
Ohgi, who was that voice we heard?

385
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,206
Damned if I know.

386
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,051
He doesn't answer when I call, so maybe he bought it.

387
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,798
There, you see?!

388
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:39,127
Instead of following somebody we don't
even know, we should've used the poison gas!

389
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:39,902
But he...

390
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,764
Damn Nagata to hell!

391
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,987
So, this is where you Eleven vermin scurried off to.

392
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,166
Prepare to fire!

393
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,829
Naoto!

394
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:53,625
Commence...

395
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,825
Attention, all forces! Cease fire at once!

396
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,483
Uh?

397
00:20:57,837 --> 00:20:58,696
Cease fire?

398
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:04,648
I, Clovis, third prince of Brittania, and
royal viceroy of Area 11, hereby command you!

399
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:07,582
All forces are ordered to cease fire at once!

400
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,925
You will also cease destruction
of any buildings or property!

401
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,575
All casualties, whether Britannian or Eleven,

402
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,308
shall be treated equally and without prejudice!

403
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:21,325
In the name of Clovis La Britannia, you
are hereby ordered! Cease fire at once!

404
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,316
I shall allow no further fighting!

405
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,598
Are you satisfied?

406
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,137
Very. Well done.

407
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,748
And what shall we do now?

408
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,629
Sing a few lively ballads?

409
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,789
Or perhaps a nice game of chess.

410
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:34,539
That has a familiar ring.

411
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,298
Hm?

412
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:39,477
Don't you recall?

413
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:42,437
The two of us used to play chess together as boys.

414
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,512
Of course, I would always win.

415
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,268
What?

416
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,179
Remember? At the Aries villa?

417
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:49,668
You...

418
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:51,308
Who are you?

419
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:54,100
It's been a long time, big brother.

420
00:21:54,976 --> 00:22:00,383
The eldest son of the late Consort Marianne
and 17th in line to the imperial throne.

421
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:03,021
Lelouch vi Britannia, at your service.

422
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:05,175
Lelouch? But-But I thought...

423
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,564
That I was dead? You were wrong.

424
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,843
I have returned, Your Highness.

425
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:17,875
And I've come back to change everything.

426
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,998
How could a single student
ever be able to change the world?

427
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:56,737
It isn't realistic.

428
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:59,667
Just think about it for a moment, and you'll see that.

429
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,101
Nevertheless...

430
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,726
Now that I hold the advantage...

431
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:07,142
...there may be a strategic move I need to play.
