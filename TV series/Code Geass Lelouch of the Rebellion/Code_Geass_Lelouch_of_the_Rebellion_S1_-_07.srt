1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,166
Announcing Prince Lelouch vi Britannia!

2
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,980
Seventeenth heir to the Royal Britannian Imperial throne!

3
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:21,349
I heard Empress Marianna was killed
inside of the Britannian palace.

4
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:24,192
There's no way terrorists could've gotten in there.

5
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,227
Which means that the real assassins must've...

6
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:28,230
Sh! Beware, my friend.

7
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:31,446
You'll regret it if anyone hears
that kind of talk around the palace.

8
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,116
And yet the boy remains.

9
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:34,656
Even though his mother is dead.

10
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,566
It's over.

11
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,521
And the Ashford family who stood
behind them is finished, as well.

12
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,472
And his sister, the princess?

13
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,605
I understand she was shot in the legs.

14
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,584
And that she lost her sight.

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,816
Blindness caused by trauma, though, isn't it?

16
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:47,860
No difference.

17
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:50,605
Now, she can't even be married off for political gain.

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,508
Hail, Your Majesty! My mother, the empress, is dead!

19
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,229
Old news. What of it?

20
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:57,239
What of it?!

21
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:02,379
You sought an audience with the emperor
of Britannia simply to inform me of that?

22
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:03,779
Send the next one in.

23
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:06,036
I have no time for these childish games.

24
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:06,911
Father!

25
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,554
Yes, Your Majesty!

26
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:13,118
Why didn't you keep mother out of harm's way?!

27
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,408
You're the emperor!

28
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,970
The greatest man in this nation, if not the world!

29
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:20,096
You should've protected her! And
now you don't even visit Nunnally!

30
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:22,137
I've no use for that weakling.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,620
That weakling?

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,388
That is what it means to be royalty.

33
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,590
Then I don't wanna be your heir.

34
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,561
I give up my claim to the throne!

35
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:38,499
I'm sick of the fighting and scheming over
who will succeed you, Father! I've had enough!

36
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:39,666
You are dead.

37
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:43,775
You have always been dead to me,
dead from the moment you were born.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,842
Who gave you the fine clothes
you wear, a comfortable home,

39
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:48,759
the food you eat, and your very life?

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,293
All of those, I have given to you!

41
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,912
In short, you are nothing to me
because you have never existed.

42
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:58,238
Yet you dare to speak such foolishness to me!

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,757
Lelouch!

44
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:04,265
You are dead, therefore you
are not entitled to any rights.

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,893
I am sending you and Nunnally to Japan.

46
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,682
As prince and princess, you will
serve well as bargaining tools.

47
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:53,276
It's a 7th-generation Knightmare Frame,
making its abilities far greater than normal.

48
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,197
I understand that the Lancelot's pilot is an Eleven.

49
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:59,099
That's correct, an honorary Britannian. However...

50
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,829
I'm promoting this man from private to warrant officer.

51
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,385
That should satisfy him.

52
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,908
I'm trying to win without having
to rely too much on the numbers.

53
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:11,822
Those who risk their lives on the
battlefield are the ones who deserve to rule.

54
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:15,385
I understand the theory, Sister. But still...

55
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:20,357
Sorry you have to sit here watching me do my homework.

56
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:21,590
Oh, don't worry about it.

57
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:23,556
You've never attended a regular school before,

58
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:24,982
so it can't be avoided.

59
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,257
The guys on the student council are helping me, too,

60
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,856
but... it's still hard.

61
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,566
To be perfectly honest with you,
I've been a little bit worried.

62
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:36,477
It's supposed to be a liberal school, but
I was afraid you weren't fitting in well.

63
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:38,289
Me too, I was expecting that.

64
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:41,820
But I happened to run into an old friend
there, and he smoothed everything out for me.

65
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,458
Be sure you never take that friend for granted.

66
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:47,598
If your friendship continues, your
reunion won't have been coincidence,

67
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,071
it will have been predestined.

68
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:49,946
Okay.

69
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:51,845
Anyway, please try one of these.

70
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,534
Uh. Thank you, I will.

71
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,855
I'd like your opinion of them.

72
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,135
There's jam?

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,763
Yes, I just happened to get some lovely blueberries.

74
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,222
All right, everyone! Pack it up! Pack it up!

75
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,195
We're done today! Don't do anymore!

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,945
Hip-hip-hoo-rayyyy!

77
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,986
That's all, folks!

78
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,684
Uh... umm...

79
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:13,824
Go to school.

80
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,383
Classes might be over for the day,

81
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,235
but it's important to meet your
friends and have a social life, too.

82
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,226
Say, can I ask you something important?

83
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,934
Hm? Sure, what is it?

84
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,093
Kallen, are you hiding something from us?

85
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:27,866
Huh?

86
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,739
If it's something too personal.

87
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,140
No. What're you talking about?

88
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,211
You can tell me. I promise I won't be shocked or upset.

89
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,363
Well, the thing is, I happened to see you before.

90
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,583
You're going out with Lulu, right?!

91
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,689
Lulu?

92
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,947
The other day. I saw you outside!

93
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:48,609
Oh! No, no, no!

94
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:49,875
That was all his doing!

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,816
His doing?!

96
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:52,468
No, wait, it wasn't like that...

97
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:55,505
I don't get it. You were trying
so hard to catch the cat before.

98
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,647
No, that wasn't it.

99
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,377
Besides, it's not like we kissed or anything.

100
00:05:58,402 --> 00:06:01,157
Or anything?! Then you stopped short of doing it?!

101
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:02,582
Will you quit imagining things!

102
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:05,233
You don't understand the circumstances one bit!

103
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,162
But an arranged marriage is so...

104
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:14,557
I understand how much you want
to re-establish the Ashford family.

105
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,945
But, Mother, it's just that...

106
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,597
Ah! I've divided it!

107
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,854
The Saitama ghetto is now completely surrounded.

108
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,045
The Yamato Alliance's hideout
is located somewhere in here.

109
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:35,073
Half the people in this
neighborhood are cooperating with them.

110
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,499
So, if we proceed now...

111
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,315
What'll be the effect on production?

112
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,667
Primary sector output should decrease by 0.2%.

113
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,315
Within expectations, you mean. All right.

114
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:48,312
All of you here participated in the
Shinjuku disaster, is that correct?

115
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,344
Yes, and we're indebted to you,
Princess Cornelia, for your mercy...

116
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,832
That's not what I'm asking!

117
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,144
Do you think the conditions are similar?

118
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:55,704
Huh?

119
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,599
To those in Shinkjuku.

120
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:03,329
Military authorities report that they have surrounded
the Saitama ghetto, a known hiding place for terrorists.

121
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,750
Viceroy Cornelia is also on the scene,

122
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,027
and entry to that area is restricted.

123
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:14,477
Oh? Well, what has you looking so serious?

124
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:18,454
It appears that a full-scale
assault will be launched in two hours.

125
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,979
Consequently, power will be shut off...

126
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,851
News is one thing, but why are
we broadcasting the start time?

127
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,889
Because they're trying to provoke Zero.

128
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:27,624
Zero is a criminal with a flair for the theatrical.

129
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:32,741
I've recreated the same conditions that
existed in Shinjuku in order to draw him out.

130
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,549
If he's the overconfident type,

131
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,960
I predict he'll come here to try and kill me.

132
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:37,955
Viceroy.

133
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:40,715
You'd really risk your own life like this?

134
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,795
What you fail to understand is the
war is a struggle between pride and life.

135
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,138
You're not falling for the enemy's provocation?

136
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,637
They went to such trouble to invite me, though.

137
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:54,211
Besides, there's something I'd
like to ask Cornelia personally.

138
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:57,766
Destroying Britannia or
discovering who murdered your mother.

139
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,428
Which is more important to you?

140
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,521
The two are of equal importance.

141
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,858
The royal family members are competing with each other

142
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,612
to see who will ascend the
throne and become the next ruler.

143
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,676
Or rather, they're being forced to fight.

144
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:11,148
By that man.

145
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,085
But the very thing you hate is the
same thing, that makes Britannia strong.

146
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:20,015
The royal heir who is best fit to become the next
ruler of Britannia is the last one left standing.

147
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,855
Exactly.

148
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,390
The weak ones lose, and they're cast aside.

149
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,500
Britannia's that kind of nation.

150
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:26,927
That kind of world.

151
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,040
Survival of the fittest is the most basic rule of all.

152
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,069
If that's true, then what happens to Nunnally?!

153
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,916
Should I simply give up on my sister because she's frail?!

154
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,661
I refuse to accept that!

155
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,534
I'll wipe out that sort of world myself!

156
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:52,683
Like I said, there's nothing between Lelouch and I.

157
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,025
Lelouch?

158
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,509
Anyway, that's how it is!

159
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,195
There's nothing's going on.

160
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,030
Huh?

161
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,376
Um... where's Lelouch?

162
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:03,890
I don't know where he is, and I don't give a damn!

163
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:04,409
Uh?

164
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,541
You can't go, Lelouch.

165
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:10,574
You need to fulfill your part of our
bargain, so I won't have you dying before that.

166
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,939
Notice that what you're saying and
what you're doing are contradictory.

167
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,212
Oh, I won't kill you.

168
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:18,049
I'm merely going to shoot you
in the leg to quiet you down.

169
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,324
Now I get it.

170
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,588
You're unable to use Geass yourself, aren't you?

171
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:21,968
Uh.

172
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,467
I'm not surprised, I suspected as much.

173
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:28,890
You obviously wouldn't have asked me to
do it if you could've done it yourself.

174
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,827
Do you honestly think you can threaten me with a gun?

175
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,087
Yes, I do.

176
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,031
Until I met you, I was dead.

177
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,222
An impotent corpse existing behind a false guise of life.

178
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,311
A life in which I did nothing real.

179
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:50,356
Day to day, I merely went through the
motions of living, as if I were a zombie,

180
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,271
and I always had the feeling that I was gradually dying.

181
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:56,183
If I'm condemned to go back to that, then I'd rather...

182
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,028
Stop it!

183
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,381
I see now.

184
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,158
It's life without meaning.

185
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,150
And a life like that...

186
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,492
Oh, my god!

187
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,191
Why the hell did you do that?! Even children are here!

188
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,479
What's going on?! We haven't done anything!

189
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,004
That's exactly why!

190
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,191
The people of this ghetto refuse to report the terrorists!

191
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,277
You hide them! Cover for them!

192
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,955
That's treason against a suzerain state!

193
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:25,192
We're done sweeping away those in charge.

194
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:27,801
It's nearly time to set our plan into motion.

195
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,165
So, shall we begin?

196
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:29,858
Right!

197
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,857
Attention, all forces!

198
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,393
Commence eradication of the Saitama ghetto!

199
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,603
All forces, assume level one battle stations!

200
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,619
I don't understand.

201
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:54,476
Why won't Princess Cornelia order us to attack, as well?!

202
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:57,024
She won't because Orange is here.

203
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:59,614
Just be thankful that you haven't been disposed of.

204
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,422
You're to blame for this.

205
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,458
It's due to you that our careers are over!

206
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:05,929
You're wrong! Zero's the one who did it!

207
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:07,692
That again? Hmph.

208
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:11,631
Zero... Could that student be working with him?

209
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,791
Suppression of area 4, complete.

210
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:18,236
8th and 11th mechanized infantry companies are
sweeping north and south in a pincer movement.

211
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,677
Always the same.

212
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:23,503
Cornelia replaces Clovis... yet Britannia never changes.

213
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,340
What unit are you from?

214
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,310
Your unit name and I.D., soldier!

215
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,831
Private Dario Torres, sir,
with 3rd reconnaissance company.

216
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,901
I obtained this item from one of the terrorists.

217
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,884
Could I ask you to please transmit
it to headquarters for me, sir?

218
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,728
A disk, huh?

219
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:42,004
Well, I still need to verify your I.D. first.

220
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:45,035
Right, understood, but before we do that, sir,

221
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,998
I'd like to borrow your Sutherland, so hand it over.

222
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:48,795
Uh.

223
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:56,361
Sure, no problem. Just take good care of it.

224
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,068
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

225
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,794
It's hopeless.

226
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,967
Can't we break through along the Sai-Kyo line?

227
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,354
They've got armor blocking it.

228
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,879
We can't use back roads, either.

229
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,226
Any reinforcements from Akabane or Jujoh?

230
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,751
One man might get through, but not a group!

231
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,479
Izumi!

232
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,926
Damn. Any word from the Toda or Kawaguchi districts?

233
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,030
Forget that! Listen!

234
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:19,671
Huh?!

235
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,343
This... is Zero.

236
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,189
Zero?

237
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,489
Zero? You mean...?

238
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:30,121
I assume all of you have heard
about the Shinjuku incident.

239
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,230
Do what I say, and you will be saved.

240
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,932
B-12, suppression complete.

241
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,451
F-7, no sign of the enemy.

242
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:38,422
D-24, 87% complete.

243
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:41,217
Powadon team, change course to 5-1-6.

244
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:44,044
Yes, my lord. Moving to 5-1-6.

245
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,187
No response at all.

246
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,398
This guy Zero might turn out to be a no-show.

247
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,842
Guess he's just another run-of-the-mill terrorist.

248
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,025
They came! They really came!

249
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,967
Just like Zero said they would!

250
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:04,351
Now then, shall I drag Cornelia
out or should I make an opening?

251
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,255
R-1, R-2, maintain distance.

252
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,194
Draw them back to the area where N-2 is.

253
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,859
B-7, open fire towards two o'clock.

254
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:17,058
P-5's team will commence its barrage.

255
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,690
Gester team, contact lost!

256
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,958
Enemy spotted in district G-4-7!

257
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,291
Kaczinski team engaging. They were ambushed.

258
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:26,926
The enemy appears to be using.

259
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,143
Sutherlands captured from our own forces.

260
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,963
Exactly the same as Shinjuku.

261
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:33,345
Has there even been any sign of Zero yet?

262
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,799
N-2, continue towards the upper-right.

263
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:38,874
R-4, fire.

264
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:41,737
N-1, take the man on the left.

265
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:45,563
Right. P-3, Take out the bridge
and close down the route now.

266
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,471
Point 1-7 has fallen!

267
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,235
Halley Team, contact lost!

268
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,428
That's enough.

269
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,265
Order all troops to fall back.

270
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,748
Further damage and casualties serve no point.

271
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:02,519
Fall back?!

272
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,668
With all due respect, we can still fight them!

273
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,568
We can't fight them like this.

274
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,594
All forces,

275
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,956
fall back behind ghetto perimeter at once!

276
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,367
Formation doesn't matter!

277
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,884
Fall back behind ghetto perimeter at once!

278
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:16,181
What, no stomach for it?

279
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,066
If I blend in with the retreating units,
that'll put me right next to Cornelia.

280
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,782
Have I cleared the task at hand already?

281
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,869
You can't fight your own blood, can you?

282
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:32,139
But regardless, that type of person is dangerous.

283
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:33,935
I wonder which path he'll take.

284
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,315
I understand.

285
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,060
Just who do you think I am, anyway?

286
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:42,464
Hmm...

287
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:46,001
So, Lulu lived here before this became Area 11, huh?

288
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,469
Was he a neighbor?

289
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,101
Um... What about yourself.

290
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,031
Myself?

291
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,425
I guess we're a lot alike in that respect.

292
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,582
Honestly, I didn't like Lulu at
the beginning when I first met him.

293
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,292
He gave the impression that he was flippant,

294
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:00,592
and that the only thing he worked
hard at was avoiding hard work.

295
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:04,715
But back when we were freshmen, I happened
to see him come upon a traffic accident.

296
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:08,102
A driver rear-ended another car and was clearly at fault,

297
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,958
but he tried to blame it on the
elderly owners of the other car.

298
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,608
Nobody tried to help them.

299
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:13,602
And then...

300
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,691
Lulu didn't do it so that he could boast
to his buddies or laugh about it later.

301
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,702
He did it with the same bored expression he always wears.

302
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:25,256
That's when I wondered, "What's up with this guy?

303
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:28,040
What goes on in his mind? What does he wanna do?"

304
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:31,623
I really wanted to know, and
in the process of finding out...

305
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,037
You fell in love with him.

306
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,351
Umm...

307
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,701
You think that's what this is? Maybe you're right.

308
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,140
How dreamy it is to be in love.

309
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,267
Oh, how I wish.

310
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:48,490
Cornelia... You're no match, you'll lose.

311
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,745
Zero is no match, I'll win.

312
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,334
Huh?

313
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:55,292
Of course. That's why they call
Princess Cornelia the Goddess of Victory.

314
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,630
Shall we go then, Guilford, my knight?

315
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,381
It is my pleasure to serve and obey you, my lady.

316
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,622
Even with my Geass, the normal security
makes it too risky for me to simply stroll in.

317
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,300
I guess I'll have to create
an opening as I did with Clovis.

318
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,214
Hm? The student council room?

319
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:16,412
But I thought the cat festival
meeting was scheduled for tomorrow.

320
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,555
I know Kallen said I had it all wrong,

321
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,624
but it seemed like she was
getting upset in order to fool me.

322
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:25,194
Which is why, in this case, it's
best to simply ask him directly.

323
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,890
On your behalf, I can ask him how he feels about you.

324
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,609
What?! You'd really do that?!

325
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,062
Just relax, it'll be fine.

326
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,967
Are you nuts?! No way!

327
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:34,444
Hm?

328
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,014
Oh, whatever...

329
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,514
Aw, c'mon, let me handle this for you. I'll be discrete.

330
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,150
I don't want your help, okay?!

331
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,413
It'll be fine!

332
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:44,379
Uh! Sorry!

333
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,387
Uh, oh... Does that hurt much?

334
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,265
Greatly...

335
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,830
You're desperate, Cornelia.

336
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,389
Using your royal guard in such a manner...

337
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,325
This is Zero.

338
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:04,134
N-1 will re-engage their IFF signal.

339
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,936
Operate as a Britannian unit.

340
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:06,783
Understood.

341
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,905
As my decoy.

342
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,988
One knightmare left transmitting
an IFF signal within the city area.

343
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:14,216
Can't you contact it?!

344
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,647
Scramble a rescue team!

345
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,015
No, destroy it.

346
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:17,634
You can't!

347
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,746
He might be a captive of the enemy!

348
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:22,206
I ordered all troops to fall back.

349
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:25,271
I have no use for soldiers who can't follow my orders.

350
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:26,395
You heard the princess.

351
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,906
But...!

352
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,769
Do your duty, even if it costs your life.

353
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:32,528
My subordinates follow that code without question.

354
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,344
At your command, Your Highness.

355
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,029
Hey! What're you guys doing?!

356
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,709
Can't you read the IFF signal?! I'm on your side!

357
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:42,797
Dammit!

358
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,498
No confirmation?

359
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:54,680
Well then...

360
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:58,090
N-2, send signal, then fall back to the hospital ruins.

361
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,366
R-1, R-2, hold your positions. Fire only if attacked.

362
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,477
They've transmitted another signal, which means one thing.

363
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,748
They've set an ambush!

364
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,672
Send in more Gloucesters and surround them!

365
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,873
They're not following?

366
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:11,395
No, dammit!

367
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,548
R-1, R-2, abort the ambush and fall back at once! Abort!

368
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,242
Gloucesters have arrived at indicated area.

369
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,480
No sign of enemy.

370
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,810
He anticipated my move.

371
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,737
It's possible we really are dealing with Zero himself.

372
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,351
P-2! N-3! Circle around behind the enemy!

373
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,517
What's wrong?! Come in! P2! N3!

374
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,556
Dead? B-1! B-5! Move in!

375
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:35,495
Like hell!

376
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,601
There's no way we can beat Cornelia's royal guard!

377
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,330
That's a death sentence! I'm out!

378
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,851
Hey! We surrender!

379
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:46,134
We won't resist! Spare us!

380
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:47,431
Kill them.

381
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:53,566
P-6, P-8, what's happening?! Agh!

382
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,918
B-7! Circle around and cover N-4!

383
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:57,018
This is B-7!

384
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,557
I gotta prime target here! I'll take him out first!

385
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,794
No, hold your fire! That's a decoy!

386
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,114
B-7! That's an order!

387
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,533
Whaddaya mean? I've got this bastard right in my sights!

388
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,832
Fall back! They'll strike from above! B-7, fall back!

389
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:12,929
Idiot.

390
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:15,855
B-8, this is Zero. I want a status report, now.

391
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,222
Screw your status report! Agh!

392
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,324
B-8! Damn!

393
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,110
Anyone who's left, report in from the P group now! Uh?

394
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:24,943
Mission complete.

395
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,885
All forces, take formation number 4.

396
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,410
Beaten as easily...

397
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:33,145
But that's not how the game is supposed to go!

398
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,244
This didn't work out the way it did in Shinjuku, Zero.

399
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,918
So, are you still masquerading as one of us?

400
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,996
We'll discover who you are shortly.

401
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:41,945
This...

402
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,648
This is what real organization can do...

403
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:46,396
Attention, all Knightmare pilots.

404
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,865
Open your hatches and reveal your faces!

405
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,360
Cornelia!

406
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,530
Hah!

407
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:53,861
I repeat!

408
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:57,344
All pilots open your hatches, and show me your faces!

409
00:19:57,972 --> 00:19:59,047
What do I do?

410
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:00,822
If she gets me in a line-up...

411
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,761
Without my mask, my identity will be exposed!

412
00:20:05,012 --> 00:20:06,255
That mustn't happen!

413
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,201
Use my Geass? No, impossible.

414
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,351
It won't work unless I look directly at them.

415
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,604
The enemy is protected within Knightmares.

416
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:16,842
That leaves the infantry and the other pilots.

417
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,376
Huh-uh, forget it. There are too many of them.

418
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,843
How do I turn this around?

419
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,201
No... Would that work?

420
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:25,166
Show them I'm Zero, then use the power?

421
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,490
But then the the Knightmares.

422
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,994
Maybe I can start shooting and break out of here!

423
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:30,377
Impossible.

424
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:33,501
Against Cornelia's royal guard, that would be suicide!

425
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:35,421
Open your hatch. It's your turn.

426
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,848
What's wrong? Hurry up and open your hatch!

427
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,537
Well... my hatch was damaged earlier in battle.

428
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,694
I see. Then we'll open it for you.

429
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:44,709
Uh!

430
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:45,774
Turn around.

431
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:48,011
Well? Come on!

432
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,135
Yes, understood.

433
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:52,851
At once, sir.

434
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,001
Zero's been sighted!

435
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:54,460
Uh!

436
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:55,340
Hm?

437
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,512
Ah-ha! I was right. Zero has a flair for the dramatic.

438
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:04,473
No way!

439
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,498
Capture him!

440
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:06,606
Platoons three and five, stand ready!

441
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,554
Image detected! Target confirmed!

442
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:09,580
12th tactical special mobile company...

443
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,237
I'll just have to play along!

444
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:12,686
Surround the building! Head around back!

445
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:14,570
Sharp-shooters, open fire!

446
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:17,871
He fell!

447
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:20,233
Your Highness, how do you want us to proceed now?

448
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:22,557
Hm. Any likelihood it's a trap?

449
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:27,475
There's always that possibility, especially
since we don't know anything about this person,

450
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,232
aside from the fact that he seems as
prideful as you anticipated, Viceroy.

451
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,288
Then there's no point in chasing him.

452
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:36,917
Correct. If he intentionally
revealed himself directly to his enemy,

453
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,574
he must already have an escape route already in place.

454
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,044
So self-preservation trumps all?

455
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,936
That's how Cornelia is.

456
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,771
She's nothing at all like Clovis.

457
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:55,785
Why did you rescue me?

458
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,062
I told you already.

459
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,478
I can't have you dying.

460
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,729
I wouldn't have lost if the conditions were equal!

461
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,117
You sore loser.

462
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:07,895
If you're really that good, you should be
able to set up conditions the way you want.

463
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,467
That's what I'll do, then. I'll set them up.

464
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,341
I'll raise an army that can't lose to Britannia.

465
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,071
A people! A nation!

466
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,964
Where and how can I find troops?

467
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:54,654
Who will serve in my army?

468
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,208
If only I could ask Suzaku to join me...

469
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:59,138
No, that ship has sailed.

470
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,998
He's a Britannian soldier now.

471
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,170
Even if he doesn't enter into
the fray, he's still my enemy.

472
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:07,386
Well then, I'll just have to choose.
