1
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:09,137
The young Britannian, Lelouch, is faced
with a choice between two divergent paths.

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:13,293
One leads to the past in a quest
to find his mother's enemies.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,700
The other way takes him to the future

4
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:20,560
where he will create a world in which
his little sister, Nunnally, can live happily.

5
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:24,035
Only Lelouch can choose which direction he will go.

6
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:27,704
Will he follow the path that
ends in destruction of the world?

7
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:31,241
Or will he travel the road to building a bright, new one?

8
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,549
Suzaku...

9
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,734
I finally understand.

10
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:10,926
You...

11
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:15,838
Suzaku. What Mao said...

12
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,508
Did you do it? Did you kill your own father?

13
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,130
I see.

14
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,636
It's not just your secret, is it?

15
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,586
Lelouch, I...

16
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,838
Kirihara!

17
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,451
I think that was the old man's name.

18
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,345
He claimed that Prime Minister
Genbu Kururugi killed himself

19
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,728
in order to stop all of those in his cabinet
who called for do-or-die resistance.

20
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,587
The story was a necessary one.

21
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,132
For Japan, and Britannia.

22
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,220
Thank you for that.

23
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,276
Frankly, he's at odds with himself,

24
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,182
because he used to be different.

25
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,305
He never placed any importance on another person.

26
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:01,951
It was tough enough for me to kill my half brother...

27
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,105
Yet Suzaku killed his father
when he was only 10 years old...

28
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,721
He's been carrying that burden around all these years?

29
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:10,380
C'mon, Lelouch, quit moving around, will ya?

30
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:14,032
O-Oh, sorry, guys.

31
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,705
No, your sight line was lower.

32
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,372
Like this?

33
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,980
Too far! Little higher!

34
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:19,754
Good?

35
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:23,282
Now your expression's totally
different from when we started!

36
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:25,584
This was like this... That went kinda like that...

37
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,776
And this was here...

38
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,843
There!

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,855
That's not how he was!

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,413
I like the frowny face more!

41
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:34,646
Come on, everyone! I prefer him looking clueless.

42
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,761
Shirley, don't we have math for first period?

43
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,536
Don't you remember? It's Art Week?

44
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,518
Prince Clovis had declared it that.

45
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,689
We will open Art Week with the dedication
of the Clovis Memorial Museum of Art.

46
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:48,976
You, Princess Euphemia, will select the First Place winner

47
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,005
from among these submitted works.

48
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,797
Oh, this one's nice.

49
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:57,455
I particularly like this painting.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,982
It's regrettable that our investigation revealed

51
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,607
that the artist happens to be one-quarter Eleven.

52
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:06,632
Perhaps it shouldn't have been
displayed here in the first place, then.

53
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:09,199
Well it's a delicate balance with our public.

54
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:12,705
Anyway, take a look at that painting right there.

55
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,784
It was painted by the son of Marquess Nicolai.

56
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,063
Octopus hotdogs...

57
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:22,386
Hmph. That girl...

58
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,171
Excuse me...

59
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:25,693
No, these aren't what you think!

60
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,130
We have visitors.

61
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,103
They also have an introduction from Kyoto.

62
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,151
You're the... Four Holy Swords?!

63
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,899
I'll get straight to the point here.

64
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,066
We've come to you today to ask you for your help.

65
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:41,013
Uh, how do you mean?

66
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,803
Lt. Col. Tohdoh has been apprehended.

67
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,811
He sacrificed himself so that we could escape.

68
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,841
I see. We'll help them.

69
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:51,094
You sure?

70
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,396
The Black Knights fight for the cause of justice.

71
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:55,216
There's nothing odd about that.

72
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,938
We'll use assembly method B-13.

73
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:02,401
Take the sectioned Knightmares via course 18.

74
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:03,968
You can have Diethard handle it.

75
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,513
Also alert those who are to rendezvous with us.

76
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:10,888
Sorry I didn't meet with the Chinese Federation.

77
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:11,657
Don't worry about it.

78
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,613
I've revised all our plans with them.

79
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:17,274
Making any changes in your
usefulness to me will only hinder the plan.

80
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:21,224
Besides, two chess pieces
I've been wanting will be mine today.

81
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,824
And with any luck, a third...

82
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:30,230
Today, Kyoshiro Tohdoh will be executed.

83
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:31,705
I won't be present for that,

84
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,257
now that the Japan Liberation Front is defunct.

85
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,057
Right.

86
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,372
No, wait.

87
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,351
Let him handle the execution.

88
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,018
Viceroy!

89
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:39,709
Huh?

90
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:41,993
Sorry to summon you like this.

91
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,399
How's everything at the museum?

92
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,133
The dedication is later on.

93
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:49,365
Of greater importance, though, the N.A.C.
reported there was unrest in Ishikawa.

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,390
Probably backed by the E.U. or the Chinese Federation.

95
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,091
And there have also been sighting of Gun-Rus.

96
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,453
Still, it's our chance to bring Hokuriku under control.

97
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:03,274
I'll leave Darlton here while I'm gone.
If anything happens, consult him.

98
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:07,063
Also, concerning what we spoke of earlier...

99
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:07,855
Huh?

100
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,434
You may choose any one of them to be your knight.

101
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,376
They're all excellent soldiers from respected families.

102
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:19,468
Yes, the pond does freeze solid in the winter.

103
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:23,185
Although, big brother scolded me once
when he caught me skating on it.

104
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,493
We had a pond, too, at the Kururugi shrine.

105
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,836
It was small, but I used to catch zarigani...

106
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,134
I mean crawdads, all the time.

107
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,624
You would catch crawdads? How?

108
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:33,620
It's simple.

109
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,614
You just tie a string to a frog's back leg.

110
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,568
Huh? Frog, as in those things that
sit on lily pads and go "croak!"?

111
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:42,791
Yeah, but in Japanese, they go "kero-kero, kero-kero."

112
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:43,957
Huh? "Kero?"

113
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:45,757
Yup. Kero-kero.

114
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:49,291
If things continue at this pace
and keep proceeding according to plan,

115
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:51,853
I won't be able to stay with Nunnally any longer.

116
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,951
That affair with Mao also drove home the fact

117
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,413
that I need someone to protect my little sister.

118
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:58,201
Whoever that person will be,

119
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,493
if Nunnally's the one who
gives him a reason to live, then...

120
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,705
Um? Lelouch?

121
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,286
I need to... tell you...

122
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,576
Suzaku!

123
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,638
Lloyd says it's urgent.

124
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,441
Who's that?

125
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,841
She's a soldier.

126
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:13,636
Friends of yours?

127
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:14,868
Yes.

128
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,572
I'm sorry,

129
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:18,076
but I need to pull Suzaku away from you for a while.

130
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,482
Uh... but, um...

131
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,298
Don't worry, I told you it's all right.

132
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,168
That guy isn't going to come back here.

133
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,930
Right. See you, then.

134
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,986
Please come again, Suzaku.

135
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:27,724
I will!

136
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:28,788
Suzaku!

137
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:29,729
Huh?

138
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,968
When you return, there's
something that I want to... discuss.

139
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,535
It's an important matter.

140
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,434
Uh-oh. I'm nervous.

141
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,985
I'll talk to you when I get back.

142
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,836
Well, it seems that Suzaku's really important to them.

143
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,949
I'm glad.

144
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:47,663
Nunnally, you seem... fond of Suzaku. Am I right?

145
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,561
I adore him.

146
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:53,164
But of course, I love you more than anyone, Lelouch.

147
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:54,616
I see.

148
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,774
Shirley, I'm gonna go on ahead.

149
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,674
Oh, just wait up, will ya?

150
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,139
Ah!

151
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,034
Oh, great...

152
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,159
Hm?

153
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,446
Sub-Viceroy, is it true that no Eleven companies

154
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,471
were used in the construction of this museum?

155
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:23,304
W-Well, with regard to that question, I, uh...

156
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,621
We're looking into it right now,

157
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:26,752
so we have no answer at this time.

158
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:27,772
Idiot!

159
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:30,428
Why bother asking princess Euphemia about politics?!

160
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:31,842
Keriman from Interstate.

161
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:35,576
Your Highness, there have been rumors lately
that you're close to choosing your knight.

162
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,909
Um... a knight.

163
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:39,916
Yes, well, you see I'm...

164
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,311
Ladies and gentlemen!

165
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:45,694
We ask that you please limit your
questions to those concerning the museum only.

166
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,516
Hey, I heard from Brown Bear.

167
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,063
Salmon's group is moving in.

168
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:56,496
Tell Ohgi it's too soon to reel...

169
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,664
I told you not to bunch up
all the hydro lines in one place!

170
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,054
That's why I said it was different from a Burai!

171
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:05,287
Are you sure it's a good idea
to throw in with the Black Knights?

172
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,069
Can you think of any other way to rescue Col. Tohdoh?

173
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:09,636
There's also what Kyoto said,

174
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,411
that they would lend us the new models.

175
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,879
Still, their principles seem to be somewhat off.

176
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:17,387
We're not ethnocentric,
but after all, you already know that.

177
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:20,487
We can worry about the details
after we've rescued the colonel.

178
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:24,274
I understand. But no matter where
Tohdoh may be, it's the place I belong.

179
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,605
Look, just stuff 'em in and
close the lid, for crying' out loud!

180
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,890
It's almost time to move out!

181
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,553
Take your time, and treat it with the utmost care!

182
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,391
Huh?

183
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,626
It was far more fragile than
any of you when I gave birth to it.

184
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,524
Huh? Who the hell are you?!

185
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,935
I am its mother!

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,569
You arrived on time.

187
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:42,391
Hm? Are you Zero? It's a pleasure.

188
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,324
I've heard a lot of things about you.

189
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,641
The pleasure is all mine, Rakshata.

190
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,399
I've been reading about you on the net for some time, now.

191
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,594
You have?

192
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,613
The articles relating to medical cybernetics.

193
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,165
I do hate talking about the past.

194
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,315
Anyway, here.

195
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,106
Hm?

196
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,755
A souvenir from Kyoto.

197
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,032
Excuse me...

198
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,543
Is this really going to improve the interfacing system?

199
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:06,828
No, of course not.

200
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:07,561
Huh?!

201
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:10,191
It's going to improve your life expectancy.

202
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:32,777
I just heard they changed your executioner.

203
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:36,188
It's going to be Warrant Officer Suzaku Kururugi.

204
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:38,643
You oughta be glad it's someone you know.

205
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,998
Wha...? You need my signature again?

206
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:44,981
Even though Princess Cornelia ordered this,

207
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,269
there are still some formalities to be followed.

208
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:51,390
A change of executioner is
the most exception of circumstances.

209
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:06,879
What was that?

210
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:08,717
What happened?!

211
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:11,896
Good, now we're free of this hellish paperwork.

212
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:32,121
Colonel, we're coming to save you.

213
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,688
These Gekkas are awesome! Way superior to Burais!

214
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,355
Yeah! Ya got that right.

215
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:42,676
Hmm...

216
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,553
You think the sub-weaponry's linkage isn't tight enough?

217
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:48,051
No. However, I suspect it might be the line.

218
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:50,284
I'm reading a 0.7 variance to specs.

219
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,351
Obviously, those old codgers in Kyoto

220
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,671
need to supply us with better parts.

221
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:55,480
Hm?

222
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,165
My superiors have just ordered that you be
unofficially executed before you're busted out of here.

223
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,321
Any last words?

224
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,513
It's a life I gave up once before.

225
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,792
It's worth nothing.

226
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,365
In that case, I'll claim your life for myself.

227
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:09,806
What the hell?

228
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:24,763
Zero!

229
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:28,333
Kyoshiro Tohdoh, the only Japanese who, seven years ago,

230
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:31,667
brought the mighty Britannian
forces to their knees in defeat.

231
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,275
You mean Itsukushima?

232
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:36,108
You want me to perform a miracle for you, as well?

233
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,642
That was no miracle.

234
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:41,510
It ended in victory because it was
based on excellent intelligence work.

235
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,165
That's why I want you.

236
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,904
I pledged my loyalty to General Katase.

237
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:48,169
Now that he's dead, I wish to die, too.

238
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,736
Don't be a coward!

239
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:50,517
What?

240
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,629
You must take responsibility!

241
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:56,004
Responsibility for the miracle that you made!

242
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:04,848
The Area 11 resistance movement is
more intense than that of any other area

243
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:08,929
because Japan surrendered before
exhausting all of its military strength.

244
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:13,535
You failed to continue the great hope
known as the Miracle of Itsukushima!

245
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,279
You're saying it's my fault?

246
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:19,448
Yes. People grasp at illusions
because they're desperate for miracles.

247
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:22,538
Why else has there been such rampant use of Refrain?

248
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,677
You must endeavor!

249
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:28,908
To the bitter end, beyond all
that's decent, and then you can die!

250
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,392
Till the name of Tohdoh the
Miracle has grown ragged and tattered!

251
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,462
You're telling me that the Japanese
people can't accept their defeat until then?

252
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:38,469
Till now, they had to accept it.

253
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,454
However, now that I'm here, there's hope,

254
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,333
because I can likely turn their dreams into reality.

255
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:44,729
Heh.

256
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,265
And now for the highlight of today's events.

257
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,371
Princess Euphemia will select the grand prizewinner.

258
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,552
The work of art upon which you place this flower

259
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,648
will be deemed the winner, Your Highness.

260
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,771
Colonel!

261
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,604
Welcome back, Col. Tohdoh!

262
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:12,527
Thank you.

263
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,196
You've all worked so hard for this.

264
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:15,854
No effort at all, sir.

265
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,780
Cooperate with Zero!

266
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:22,722
Eliminate the remaining forces here!

267
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:23,736
Roger!

268
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,961
Now all the tasks at hand have been cleared.

269
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:29,111
And Nunnally's knight has already been chosen.

270
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,571
That leaves only...

271
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,896
Damn! What's he doing here?!

272
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,332
Well, how convenient.

273
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,549
The one problem left to
contend with has come here on his own!

274
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,253
Please, Your Highness, it's time for you
to decide. We can't wait any longer.

275
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,844
I know, but I...

276
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:53,542
But I...

277
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:56,257
Hello?

278
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,394
Hello? Hello?

279
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:02,790
Escaped?!

280
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,332
They're skilled fighters!

281
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:11,607
Oh, my...

282
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:14,313
Aren't those new enemy models amazing?

283
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:15,842
However, Ms. Cecile...

284
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:16,542
Yes?

285
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,048
In hindsight, it's certainly quite fortunate that

286
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:22,407
the Lancelot's trailer is our primary means of transport.

287
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,824
No, it's because you spent our
entire budget on the Lancelot itself.

288
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,849
That's hindsight.

289
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:27,788
That's it?

290
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,526
The White Knightmare that's
been giving such trouble to Zero?

291
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:31,634
Uh, yeah.

292
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,586
Hm...

293
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:34,887
That's crazy! One against seven?!

294
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,376
But that Lancelot knightmare is holding its own!

295
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,021
Whoa, he dodged it!

296
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,129
Wow, and again!

297
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:41,367
You show 'em, White Knight!

298
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,347
Listen, send in everything we've got.

299
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,763
Lend support to Kururugi,

300
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:47,305
then make them report that
we're wiping out the terrorists.

301
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:50,167
Zero, do you have any data available on this unit?

302
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:51,309
Possibly.

303
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,919
However, I want you to do exactly as I say...

304
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:57,122
Ah. Very well. I'll defer to you in this.

305
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:59,853
All units, give him distance!

306
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,831
Its speed and maneuverability are truly astonishing.

307
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,606
Nevertheless...

308
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:10,564
Its movements follow a predictable pattern.

309
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:13,167
Its initial attack is always straight on!

310
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,218
It never feints that first move.

311
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,175
Once you dodge that attack,

312
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,325
he immediately moves to avoid your offensive.

313
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,153
Check the data I'm sending you.

314
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:24,464
S-5-7!

315
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,545
Hey... He's really doing it.

316
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:32,574
Right!

317
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,735
So now, the next move he makes will be...

318
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,605
falling back to the rear!

319
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,535
Coordinates: X-2-3!

320
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:39,796
And with that...

321
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,116
...check!

322
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:44,490
I know this!

323
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,589
Who dares anticipate my moves?!

324
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:47,822
No matter!

325
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,377
Dammit! It doesn't have an ejection block on it!

326
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,569
What?! You mean we didn't install one?!

327
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:06,243
No way!

328
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,402
Is that really you, Suzaku?

329
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,854
What? Huh?

330
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:12,881
Zero! What now?!

331
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,448
Give us our next instructions! Zero!

332
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,483
All this time, it was him?!

333
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,771
Suzaku!

334
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:25,509
Hey, isn't that...?!

335
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:26,694
Yeah. The Eleven.

336
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,348
That's Suzaku Kururugi!

337
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,242
The one accused of killing Prince Clovis?!

338
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,242
They let an Eleven...

339
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,161
That's enough! Turn off the monitor, now!

340
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,311
Wait, please!

341
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,253
What?!

342
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,414
I'd like to watch it to the end.

343
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,120
Good. I can still pilot.

344
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,732
Do not do this, Suzaku!

345
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:47,589
Col. Tohdoh!

346
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:51,768
So then. You want to live more than
you want to follow your own principles?!

347
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,210
Do I disappoint you?

348
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,436
Very well, then keep to your schedule and execute me!

349
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:00,870
But why? Why are you there? You can't be, because you...

350
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,673
...have to be by Nunnally's side.

351
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:03,622
What's wrong?

352
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,453
That's the reason you're here, isn't it?!

353
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:09,499
You have become a cowardly boy
who's afraid of altering the status quo!

354
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,328
Denying everything in our society is pointless!

355
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:15,234
Once I make them trust me,
I'll have the power to change it!

356
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:15,926
You're serious?!

357
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:17,199
I'm dead serious!

358
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,081
Then you must continue down that path.

359
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:19,948
Huh?!

360
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:23,464
Regardless of whether you win or lose,

361
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,769
you'll achieve nothing unless
you're prepared to sacrifice everything!

362
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:29,681
And that goes for countries as well as individuals!

363
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,173
Right!

364
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:38,171
Zero, what do we do, capture him or... Zero!

365
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:40,198
We're destroying the White Knightmare! Got that?!

366
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:41,772
Wait for Zero's orders!

367
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:42,741
We're not waiting!

368
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,416
Captain Senba, take Spinning Life-or-Death Formation!

369
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:46,539
Roger!

370
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,116
Don't do it...!

371
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,781
No wait! Stand down!

372
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,342
Don't worry. It's a synchronized 4-way attack.

373
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:53,733
He'll never dodge it!

374
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,767
Kururugi, release the harken booster, quickly!

375
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,082
The password is my favorite food!

376
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:04,913
It can't...!

377
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:05,438
No way!

378
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,294
Huh?

379
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:14,495
Are you okay?!

380
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,467
Interesting fighting style he uses!

381
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,956
This time, Asahina, circle 'round to the left!

382
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,065
Stop it!

383
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:21,401
Zero!

384
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,224
We've done enough fighting for now!

385
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,280
We achieved our objective here!

386
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,042
Use escape route 3.

387
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,512
Withdraw immediately!

388
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:31,380
Mm?

389
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,593
An unwinnable battle's not the same as a lost battle.

390
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:40,472
You seem to be well aware of that, Zero.

391
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:44,473
Wait!

392
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,747
Now, releasing chaff smoke!

393
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,458
Look, they're running!

394
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,835
He fought them off?! The Black Knights?!

395
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:06,188
Suzaku... well done.

396
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,411
Damned traitor!

397
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:08,645
Why won't he follow them?!

398
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,299
'Cuz they're Elevens, like him.

399
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:11,071
Of course!

400
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,266
I thought 1 against 7 was a bit much to swallow!

401
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,787
Hm? Princess Euphemia?

402
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,708
All of you!

403
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,686
I'll now answer the question you asked me earlier!

404
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,648
You had inquired as to whom I would
select to serve as my knight, correct?

405
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:30,298
The knight I have chosen will be
the young man you see before you!

406
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,933
Warrant Officer Suzaku Kururugi!

407
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,447
Tohdoh, I... I'm your...

408
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,024
I am your foe.

409
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,346
Hey, isn't Zero coming out?

410
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:55,588
No. I called him, but he won't answer.

411
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:58,817
What's wrong?

412
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,022
Suzaku Kururugi.

413
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,370
Is he my enemy?

414
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:56,747
The man who I intended to be
Nunnally's protector is now Euphemia's knight.

415
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,154
The Black Knights stand ready for battle...

416
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,961
but am I ready for this?

417
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:03,405
Must I carry on regardless...

418
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,992
...so that I can reshape the
world into what I want it to be?
