1
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:08,434
I, Euphemia li Britannia, bid all of you within
the sound of my voice to heed the following command!

2
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:11,198
Seek out any Japanese you can find...

3
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:12,931
And please kill them!

4
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:15,368
Leave not a single one of them alive!

5
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:53,488
Euphemia has betrayed us here!

6
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,934
All units, descend upon the stadium!

7
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,871
Grind the Britannians to dust!

8
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:05,012
Damn you, Euphemia! You deceived us!

9
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,766
Damn Elevens!

10
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,020
Now I see.

11
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,113
You were planning this all along!

12
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,541
Crush the Britannians!

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,082
Euphy!

14
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:25,934
Euphy, where are you?!

15
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,323
Get away from me...

16
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,306
I don't have time to waste on you!

17
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,260
Oh my, this is turning into a mess.

18
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:41,967
How dare you... trampling over the hopes of our people...!

19
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,499
Euphemia...!

20
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,709
Stop it!

21
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:51,093
Are you Japanese?!

22
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:54,755
You dare raise a hand against Euphemia li Britannia?!

23
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,941
Huh? A-ha, so there you are...

24
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:00,008
...you ridiculous royal puppet.

25
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,508
Oh! You were on that island, weren't you?

26
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,492
Yeah.

27
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,531
Now suffer the hand of vengeance...

28
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:06,416
Wait.

29
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,444
I'll deal with her.

30
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,727
You defiant Japanese!

31
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,323
Now what, Zero? Do we take her prisoner?

32
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:24,440
There's no point. Leave her.

33
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,502
I have to kill them all!

34
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,554
These Japanese people, they have to die!

35
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:38,278
It jammed up! I have to...

36
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,455
Hurry!

37
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,597
I think it goes... in here.

38
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,503
Oh! I thought you were one of them.

39
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,919
So, I was thinking we could run the
Specially Administrated Zone of Japan together...

40
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:57,672
Oh wait... Japan?

41
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:58,586
Yes...

42
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,094
I would have liked that...

43
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,954
You and I, together.

44
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:08,665
Euphy...

45
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,537
Lelouch...

46
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,180
Why...?

47
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,192
Farewell, Euphy.

48
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:22,415
You may have been the first girl I ever loved.

49
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:29,176
No...!

50
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,324
Suzaku?!

51
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,757
Why now of all times?!

52
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,718
I'm no match for that Hadron Cannon!

53
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,337
I will never allow you to kill Lelouch!

54
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,615
Suzaku!

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,863
Get outta my way!

56
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,277
Ahh, dammit!

57
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:07,610
Please...

58
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,327
You have to save Euphy...

59
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,869
Do something! You mustn't let her die!

60
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,571
You still haven't made contact with Darlton?!

61
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:16,596
No, Your Highness.

62
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,198
There was a report he'd been injured,

63
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,515
but nothing beyond that.

64
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,282
Viceroy! Emergency message from the Avalon!

65
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,488
From the Avalon?

66
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:24,338
Yes.

67
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:27,537
The special zone at Fuji has fallen to the Black Knights.

68
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,713
What was that?!

69
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:31,138
They're moving to intercept our forces.

70
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:32,592
Also...

71
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:35,346
Princess Euphemia...

72
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,842
"Equality"?!

73
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,912
You can shove that straight up your administrative ass!

74
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,134
You lured us into a death trap!

75
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,763
You just made the biggest mistake of your lives!

76
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:53,002
You got that?!

77
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:54,549
That's right! Let Britannia burn!

78
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:56,283
Don't screw with the Japanese!

79
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,785
Lucked out, didn't we?

80
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,015
I can't believe they left all
this footage and equipment behind.

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,648
Yes, once we're done editing, we can
throw it on the net for the entire world to see.

82
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,223
It's pretty clear which side justice is on.

83
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:09,879
How curious...

84
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,884
You don't feel any loyalty toward Britannia, do you?

85
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:13,826
Loyalty?

86
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,716
Mm-hm.

87
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,140
Btitannia's glory has ripened on the vine.

88
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,385
My talents are wasted serving them.

89
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:23,056
You're more of an honest man than I thought you were.

90
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,759
And what will you do now?

91
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,839
Hard to say...

92
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,583
The only reason I came here was to gather data.

93
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,858
But I'd feel bad abandoning you all.

94
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,640
And I find Zero so... amusing.

95
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,333
How wonderful to finally meet you!

96
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:38,648
This girl...

97
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,664
...she's a relative of Suzaku's.

98
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:42,809
Zero...

99
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,422
Are you prepared to work beside us in what's to come?

100
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,693
The opposite!

101
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,273
From this point on,

102
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:51,407
the six houses of Kyoto will be under my control.

103
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,473
I won't hear any objections.

104
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,101
All other paths of survival for you...

105
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,396
...have now vanished!

106
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,753
We should inform Viceroy Cornelia...

107
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:06,862
Don't worry, I'll be taking care of that.

108
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:09,469
Will she last until we reach the bureau?

109
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:11,126
I'm afraid not.

110
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,310
I'll contact Prince Schneizel, then.

111
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:14,770
Excuse me.

112
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,498
Suzaku...

113
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:25,942
Euphy!

114
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,283
Euphy...

115
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:42,343
I have to know...

116
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,263
Why did you issue that order at the stadium?

117
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,866
Order...?

118
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,808
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,530
Never mind that...

120
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:53,893
Suzaku...

121
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,498
You're Japanese, aren't you...?

122
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:58,026
Yeah...?

123
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,247
Euphy!

124
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,089
No...

125
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,064
Huh?

126
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:03,840
I mustn't...

127
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,553
I-I can't even think such a thing!

128
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,568
Oh, please...!

129
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,195
Suzaku?

130
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,790
Yes, Euphy?

131
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,149
The ceremony...

132
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,243
Did it go all right?

133
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,598
Is Japan okay?

134
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:21,307
Euphy...

135
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,394
Don't you remember?

136
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,150
People of Japan!

137
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,648
And all who are oppressed by the Empire of Britannia!

138
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,194
Long have I waited...

139
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,158
All through the struggles against Britannia's injustices,

140
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:45,082
I've waited for them to come to their senses!

141
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:47,329
But that hope was betrayed...

142
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,806
...by an act of barbarism
that can only be called genocide!

143
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:53,723
How about everyone that was there?

144
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,383
Are the Japanese happy?

145
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:56,287
Never forgive you!

146
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,443
She's a murderer!

147
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,446
She's a filthy witch!

148
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,471
Liar!

149
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,684
Euphemia is the symbol of Britannia's hypocrisy!

150
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,721
A murderer cloaked in the flag of a nation!

151
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,905
How was the ceremony?

152
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:12,651
Do you think I did... okay?

153
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:14,726
I hope that bitch burns in hell!

154
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,234
We're finished with your lies!

155
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,600
Death to them all!

156
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,619
Euphy...

157
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,761
The special zone is...

158
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:25,978
A great success!

159
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,779
The Japanese people were given back their home!

160
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,557
And you did it!

161
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,236
Oh, thank god...

162
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:37,500
I hereby declare our independence from Britannia!

163
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:41,332
But don't take this to mean
the resurrection of your fallen nation...

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,101
We will not turn back the hands of time!

165
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,943
The new Japan we go on to build...

166
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:51,517
shall be one broad enough to
accept all peoples, histories, and ideologies!

167
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,292
Where the strong shall not reign over the weak!

168
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:58,814
And it shall be called the United States of Japan!

169
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,710
He's done it! This is the birth of a nation!

170
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,972
How strange...

171
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:08,895
I can't see your face anymore...

172
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,673
Keep going... to school...

173
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,961
I had to stop... before I...

174
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:26,075
...before I had the chance to finish...

175
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,517
Euphy, you can still go yourself.

176
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,315
I know!

177
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,737
Why don't we go to Ashford Academy together?

178
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,471
The student council is so much fun!

179
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:35,921
Euphy...

180
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:39,808
You have to do it... for me...

181
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:41,712
...'kay?

182
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,078
Please, Euphy...

183
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,548
No, don't go!

184
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:46,773
Suzaku...

185
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:50,409
I'm so happy... that we...

186
00:10:55,657 --> 00:11:05,284
Zero! Zero! Zero!

187
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:14,347
Zero! Zero! Zero!

188
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:15,957
Dear god...

189
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,950
Area Fukushima, Byakko squad, en route to Ibaraki.

190
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,184
Area Tama, continuing with barricade construction.

191
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:30,859
You plan to assault the Tokyo settlement?

192
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:31,878
Yes.

193
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,901
This is the best chance we'll get.

194
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,871
Don't worry about it.

195
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,274
Your Geass has no effect on me. You know that, don't you?

196
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,126
That's true, isn't it?

197
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:45,159
Hmph. With the Geass out of control now,

198
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,203
I can never see anyone.

199
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,159
Yes, Nunnally?

200
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,749
Hi, Lelouch! I was wondering... um...

201
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,283
...do you suppose I could talk to Euphy again?

202
00:11:56,807 --> 00:12:00,571
I was thinking the three of us
could go to the school festival together.

203
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,605
You see, Milly said they were organizing another one,

204
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,297
since everything got all messed up the other day.

205
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:09,752
So I was hoping we could go to the new one together, too.

206
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,668
Oh... I'm sorry.

207
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:14,074
I know you don't want us meeting ever again.

208
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,653
But I thought maybe,

209
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:19,386
if there was some way you and I
could maybe see her just one last time...

210
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:22,465
Nunnally... Haven't you heard the news?

211
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,845
Oh, well the radio cut off mid-broadcast earlier.

212
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,200
Why do you ask, did something happen?

213
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,780
Of course not. Everything is just fine.

214
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,770
Sorry.

215
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:35,749
I'll be home by tomorrow. We'll discuss it when I'm back.

216
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,380
Right.

217
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:41,649
All right, so you can't switch off your Geass.

218
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,507
Are there other changes you've noticed?

219
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,740
Not really. It's just...

220
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,497
Euphy...

221
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,235
She tried to resist the Geass...

222
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,337
...and my orders.

223
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,892
I was wondering if my power had weakened.

224
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,874
But I think...

225
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,589
I think such a malignant command...

226
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,261
...was simply against her nature.

227
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,741
And so?

228
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,354
I guess, that's all.

229
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,386
I-It was something...!

230
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,436
We have our contract.

231
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,699
I promise to stay with you...

232
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:21,357
...till the very end.

233
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,851
We weren't fast enough!

234
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:27,543
We may have managed to keep the news off the net, but...

235
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:29,696
There's insurrections all over the map!

236
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:30,639
That's correct!

237
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:33,297
The Black Knights are the largest of the insurgent groups.

238
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:35,447
They are now absorbing all of the masses

239
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:37,592
and advancing on the Tokyo settlement!

240
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,408
All our units are in play right now,

241
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,266
we're completely on our own!

242
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:44,604
Yes, and with so many Honorary Britannians turning on us,

243
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,826
our enemies number in the tens of thousands!

244
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:47,826
Lord Guilford!

245
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:48,745
Forget it.

246
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,315
We cannot move without Her Highness's word.

247
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,429
But sir!

248
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:55,181
The viceroy's been shut up in Princess Euphemia's room

249
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,165
ever since she canceled the attack orders!

250
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,364
And we still can't confirm General Dalton's whereabouts!

251
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,671
Everyone in Toyama Squad is at your disposal.

252
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,201
Roger that. Any weaponry?

253
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,122
Some explosives from Gokayama.

254
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,984
But we don't have enough vehicles.

255
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,270
Can any of us ride with you?

256
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,129
Best we can offer are freight trains.

257
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,171
That okay?

258
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,064
Looks like the groups from Yamanashi joined up with us.

259
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,803
Yeah, and the remnants of the
"Blood of the Samurai" faction, too.

260
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:38,744
Our numbers are growing by the minute!

261
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,977
I hope everyone in the student council can get away.

262
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,541
On the contrary...

263
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:47,142
For the first time in a while, I'm glad.

264
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,206
Yes...

265
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,386
I forgot the art of kindness ages ago... Marianne.

266
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:53,908
You worthless Brits!

267
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,870
I hope you're all right, Kaname.

268
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,739
You're working in Shizuoka now, right?

269
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,779
Yeah, I'm fine over here.

270
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,065
Look, Chigusa...

271
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,981
We need to talk about something important when I get back.

272
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,110
What's wrong?

273
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:09,718
Well, that's the first time you've called me by that name.

274
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,893
Oh, you're right.

275
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,275
Does it sound weird?

276
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,217
Not a bit!

277
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,902
Anyway, I'll be here.

278
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:19,408
There she is! That Brit woman!

279
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:21,064
Watchin' us from your window, huh?!

280
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,841
Admit it, you're some sort of spy!

281
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:25,654
As the insurgents draw closer,

282
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,158
security in the ghettos continues to worsen.

283
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,176
The government is asking all citizens

284
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,762
to stay in their homes until further notice.

285
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,738
Do you think the fighting will come our way as well?

286
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:37,180
O-Of course not!

287
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,872
Princess Cornelia has her regular forces stationed here!

288
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,980
There's no way!

289
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,233
I hope so.

290
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:45,252
Jeez, buck up, will ya? You're scaring me.

291
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,617
Ah, Nunnally, what about Lelouch, is he back here yet?

292
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:49,842
Lelouch?

293
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,209
Is something the matter?

294
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,842
No, not really...

295
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:55,575
Man... I wish you'd go back to calling him Lulu.

296
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,132
It's time you two made up.

297
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,461
Lulu?

298
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:01,013
What, you mean I called him that?

299
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:03,340
Oh, there you go again...

300
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:05,750
Lulu...

301
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:09,944
Nina, they want us upstairs in school.

302
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,302
The insurgents are headed toward Tokyo!

303
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,765
Right. And Zero is coming, isn't he?

304
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,571
Please... Wait for me, Princess Euphemia.

305
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,588
I'll avenge you, I swear!

306
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,261
Euphy...

307
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,367
I just don't understand.

308
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,586
Why did you give that order?!

309
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,671
Shall I tell you?

310
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,721
Huh? A child?

311
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:35,684
How did you get on board?

312
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,555
How do you do, Suzaku Kururugi?

313
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,300
You may call me V.V.

314
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,200
V.V.?

315
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,907
They've broken the Atsugi line, as well!

316
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,599
Maybe the homeland can help us!

317
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:55,791
They'll never make it in time!

318
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,140
Then we should evacuate this area right away...

319
00:16:58,165 --> 00:16:59,261
Don't panic!

320
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,198
Huh?

321
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,894
P-Princess Cornelia!

322
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,503
I've put the Glaston Knights on standby.

323
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,278
Place all our forces on the outskirts of Tokyo!

324
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,896
We can end this!

325
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,007
We just need to take down Zero!

326
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,644
Kill Cornelia, and the day will be ours!

327
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,190
You all have your orders.

328
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,694
Now be ready!

329
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,823
Diethard, have Tohdoh handle the front line.

330
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:23,857
I'm leaving you in charge here.

331
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,182
Yes, very well, Zero.

332
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:27,707
You're Sumeragi's...

333
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,940
Thank goodness, I made it in time!

334
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,498
That was so mean of you,

335
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:33,950
the way you headed off to battle without me.

336
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:38,002
I've been a huge fan of yours ever since your big debut!

337
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,860
I was hoping that I'd finally get to talk to you.

338
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,288
Wow! You're really tall, aren't you?

339
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,427
Don't worry though!

340
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,102
I'll catch up with you pretty soon!

341
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,698
L-Lady Kaguya...

342
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:50,898
I thought the heads of the Six Houses remained in Fuji.

343
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,657
I followed after you!

344
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,998
So I could watch my future husband fight.

345
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:55,773
Huh?

346
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,198
Don't joke around.

347
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,923
Well, once you win this battle,

348
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:01,073
you'll eventually need a wife, won't you?

349
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,088
I mean, I know your identity is a big secret and all,

350
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:06,967
but you're gonna need somebody as your public face, right?

351
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:09,738
Really? You believe we're going to win this battle?

352
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:10,907
Of course!

353
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,265
I am the goddess of victory after all!

354
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:15,263
I'd be lucky to have you then.

355
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:19,194
Unfortunately, I've already
made a contract with the devil.

356
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,293
Huh?

357
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,243
I have no room in my life for deities right now.

358
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:32,607
Hurry! We have to get this
experimental subject back to the Homeland!

359
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:33,515
The pressure!

360
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,369
The internal pressure is rising!

361
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:43,652
And now of all times...

362
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,993
Good morning to you, it was.

363
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,277
Hear me, Britannia!

364
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,977
This is Zero!

365
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,660
A rebel against oppressors who abuse their power!

366
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,561
We will wait until midnight.

367
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,802
You have till then to surrender to me.

368
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:07,340
This is your only warning.

369
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,261
Heed it.

370
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:11,098
Twelve midnight, not a single second later.

371
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,075
General Dalton, you're in no condition to do this!

372
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,892
I don't care, I have to be... at her Highness's side...!

373
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,411
Your little bluff is meaningless, Zero.

374
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:28,680
The Tokyo settlement is an impenetrable fortress.

375
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,798
You can still turn back, you know.

376
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:36,388
Your actions here will affect more than just Area 11.

377
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:40,867
You... and this entire world... will be steeped in war.

378
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,644
I'm aware of that.

379
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,392
And yet, all the same...

380
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:50,915
Euphy? How could that be possible?!

381
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,269
No, it must be an imposter.

382
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,086
Lelouch, it's me.

383
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:02,598
Suzaku.

384
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,677
Why are you calling me now?

385
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:05,640
Lelouch...

386
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,225
Are you at the school?

387
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,559
No, but I will be soon.

388
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:10,663
I see.

389
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,568
I called because there's something
I want you to tell everyone for me.

390
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:16,652
Yes, and what would that be?

391
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:17,732
The sky...

392
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,986
Make sure no one looks up at the sky.

393
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:20,773
What?

394
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:22,855
Lelouch...

395
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:25,711
Is there anyone you could ever hate so much

396
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:27,780
that you'd actually want to kill them?

397
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,548
There is, yes.

398
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:33,871
I used to feel that sort of thinking was unacceptable.

399
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,310
That unless you followed the rules,

400
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,582
killing someone was just murder.

401
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,438
But now...

402
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,009
It's hatred that's guiding me.

403
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,135
I'm fighting to kill someone.

404
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,323
I'm going to become a murderer in the skies of Tokyo.

405
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,600
So please...

406
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,041
Embrace your hate.

407
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,769
Just think of Euphy.

408
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:58,436
I made my own mind up long ago.

409
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,850
I have no intention of turning back.

410
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:02,410
For Nunnally, you mean?

411
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,438
Yes...

412
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:05,415
I have to go now.

413
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:07,486
Thank you, Lelouch.

414
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,868
Forget about it.

415
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:11,421
I mean, you and I are friends after all.

416
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,393
For the last seven years.

417
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,502
Right. See ya, then.

418
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,432
Yeah. Later.

419
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,830
What the hell?!

420
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,277
These hands of mine have been
dirty for a long time now, Suzaku.

421
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:40,300
You're coming to face me now doesn't matter at all.

422
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:42,134
Hell, I welcome it even.

423
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:45,011
I mean, of course, you and I are friends.

424
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:57,804
Perhaps this is what I've longed for...

425
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,575
...ever since that day.

426
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,954
The destruction and loss of everything.

427
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,065
That's right.

428
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:08,102
Destruction always comes before creation.

429
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:12,527
And for that goal, even my
own conscience must be cast aside.

430
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:15,942
The only path left to me is straight ahead.

431
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:17,692
Now then...

432
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:51,561
That's right.

433
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:54,613
Only by pushing forward will I find atonement.

434
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,469
Even if my enemy is the greatest empire on the planet,

435
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,915
there's no turning back for me now!

436
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,053
Everything is in place...

437
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:07,028
The time has come to overthrow the old world order!
