1
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,923
Situations evolve.

2
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,130
Our desires have no bearing on that.

3
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:13,809
Time flows on, unaffected by our struggles.

4
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:16,756
On this point, Lelouch should be pleased,

5
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:20,109
for he possesses true self-determination.

6
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:23,222
He can change destiny itself...

7
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:27,823
by applying the absolute power
to compel anyone to obey him.

8
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:30,645
The power of Geass.

9
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,914
Yes, it is true that the invasion

10
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,148
by the Chinese Federation and the terrorism

11
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,990
of the Black Knights have disrupted our society.

12
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:15,257
But that is a completely separate issue!

13
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,018
The fact remains that you've both
been absent from class far too often!

14
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,939
I don't care how good your grades are

15
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:23,172
or that you're Princess Euphemia's knight!

16
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:25,863
If you don't improve, you will repeat this year!

17
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,889
Sounds like she's still going strong.

18
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,914
She may carry on all night.

19
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:34,287
I'm telling you, Zero's our savior!

20
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,616
Even Elevens can move up in the world!

21
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:38,701
Just look at Suzaku Kururugi!

22
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:42,577
If it hadn't been for Zero, the Chinese
Federation would have conquered Kyushu!

23
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,623
That isn't what it said on the news.

24
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:47,019
Cause the Britannians control the media.

25
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:49,127
I don't care, as long as there's peace.

26
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,559
The peace of slavery?

27
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,615
That's what Kururugi wants!

28
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,609
So opinions in the ghettos are split?

29
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,036
Some are submissive, some are defiant.

30
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,669
But they'll all be shocked when they find out Zero's goal

31
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,527
is to start an independent nation.

32
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,566
Yeah, right, that's totally crazy.

33
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,237
We need to be realistic.

34
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,213
I agree with Zero.

35
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:08,929
Huh?

36
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,235
Well, isn't it true?

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,950
If we stick with him, we might catch a huge lucky break.

38
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:15,370
Maybe I'll even get my dream of being a bureaucrat.

39
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,070
A bureaucrat? Seriously?

40
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,078
Hey, even I had a dream once!

41
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,163
If I hadn't thrown in with the Black Knights,

42
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:24,021
I'd probably be hooked on Refrain by now!

43
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,534
Refrain might bring back her memory

44
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,585
so I could find out who Zero is.

45
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,641
But what would I do if I knew?

46
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:33,631
Ohgi?

47
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,706
On that other issue,

48
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,354
we wanted to ask for instructions,

49
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,167
but we haven't been able to reach Zero.

50
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,879
Then I'll just go ahead as planned.

51
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,779
I'm telling you, don't. It's a trap.

52
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,554
But we need inside sources.

53
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,472
They also said there's
someone there who wants to join us.

54
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:49,397
Anyway, tomorrow is the only time

55
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:52,643
we'll be able to use the escape
route that Diethard set up for us.

56
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,599
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

57
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,718
The Ashford Academy school festival,

58
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:03,709
which is the most open event in
the Tokyo settlement, is about to start!

59
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:06,151
It will begin at the sound of this voice!

60
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,327
Are you sure it's all right to do this, Milly?

61
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:09,327
Very sure!

62
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,467
Okay.

63
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,236
Meow!

64
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,577
The school is really noisy today.

65
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,182
Welcome! Step right up!

66
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,341
Get your Britannian rolls!

67
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:27,670
See the shocking exposé: "The Zero Report!"

68
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:30,362
Photos! Photos of Prince Clovis!

69
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:33,935
That's what I thought.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,656
So even Sawasaki and the others turned out to be useful.

71
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:38,762
We've covered all the tasks at hand.

72
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:43,968
Yes. We gathered all the sector data on the
emergency countermeasures that they've left behind.

73
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,079
The press?!

74
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:49,567
We've identified the solar panels used in
each settlement as well as the energy storage sites.

75
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,717
Oh, and what about that collaborator issue?

76
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,735
I've handled most of it myself.

77
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:56,160
About 72 percent is complete.

78
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:57,404
And Tohdoh?

79
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,053
He's drawing up a list of occupation targets:

80
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,113
broadcasting stations and such.

81
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,832
I need you to check them including
the dummy plans we're sending to Kyoto.

82
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,371
I understand. I'll confirm tomorrow.

83
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:10,604
Oh, and I know we're late in reporting this to you,

84
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:13,019
but regarding the operation of the Zero Squad, Ohgi has...

85
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:15,610
There's trouble! There's huge, huge trouble!

86
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,550
I'll have to contact you later.

87
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,846
Hmm? Trouble?

88
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,201
What are you doing goofing off like that?

89
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:23,518
You're the festival chairman!

90
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:26,390
But everything is running fine. There's no problem!

91
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,804
Besides, you're taking charge of that part, right?

92
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,662
It was two meters wide up through last year,

93
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,562
then suddenly you declared
we had to have a 12-meter pizza!

94
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,126
Uh huh! Isn't it great?

95
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,651
It's going to be the largest one of its kind in the world!

96
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,284
Just the oven and the ingredients are causing an uproar.

97
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,741
And now there's a TV crew running around campus?

98
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,557
You know we can't show our faces!

99
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:47,043
But we have to document making the pizza!

100
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:49,693
You can run things from the control booth, okay?

101
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,016
President's orders.

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,751
All right, stop right there!

103
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:55,192
Rivalz! We're all set on this end!

104
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,449
Wow, you're in a sunny mood. Something good happen?

105
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,130
Yeah, you could say that!

106
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:02,626
Sorry, but an Eleven from the
ghetto walking around alone would be...

107
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,826
It's all right.

108
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,922
If you're afraid that some Britannians, uh...

109
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,947
You needn't worry about me so much.

110
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:09,448
I'm okay, really.

111
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,849
Anyway, is this going to help you with your work?

112
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,229
Yes. I can gather data for our development project.

113
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,873
I understand. That's good, then.

114
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,612
What the hell am I doing?

115
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,055
If I get the chance, I should
hand her over to the cops or a hospital.

116
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:26,655
No, I can't.

117
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:28,238
If they connect me to the Black Knights,

118
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,672
it would implicate everyone.

119
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,051
Even so, I can't just kill her!

120
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,556
I can't!

121
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:36,139
Here we are.

122
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,583
Is something wrong?

123
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,186
No, I used to be a school teacher,

124
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,467
so I was feeling a little nostalgic.

125
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,281
Why did you stop teaching?

126
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:47,886
My best friend since we were little kids...

127
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,869
Well, he's since passed on.

128
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,991
You could say that I'm living out his dream in his place.

129
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,047
It's kind of a heavy thing for me to carry around.

130
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,618
Let's go in.

131
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:02,992
No, I can't go into a Britannian school! I'm an Eleven!

132
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:04,722
That doesn't matter!

133
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,288
The campus is open today! Come on!

134
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:07,587
Yeah, in you go, you two!

135
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:10,036
Wha...? Hey, I found them first!

136
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,720
That's a relief.

137
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,696
I thought you were never going to come back to school.

138
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,222
It's on purpose?

139
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:23,210
Why didn't you tell anyone?

140
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,860
About who I really am?

141
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,345
You're Kallen Stadtfeld right now, aren't you?

142
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,629
Not Kallen Kouzuki, right?

143
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,534
Are you trying to draw me in by acting friendly?

144
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:36,097
On the battlefield, I won't show any mercy.

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,278
But I want to try to persuade you here.

146
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,077
I know this is against the rules,
but while we're at school,

147
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:44,759
I'd rather try to change your mind
here than defeat you in combat later.

148
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:47,947
Something's different about you.

149
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,390
Suzaku, the truck's here. The cheese...

150
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,196
You came back.

151
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,533
Uh, yeah.

152
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm not as sick now, so...

153
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,067
Kallen, what we were talking about
has nothing to do with school, okay?

154
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,646
Yeah, I get it.

155
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,704
Kallen, if you don't mind,

156
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,521
could you go and check in with your class?

157
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:08,119
They seem to be a bit short-handed.

158
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,915
Sure, I don't mind.

159
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,441
I do mind!

160
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,653
Aw, this thing actually scares them?

161
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,723
Ugh, I'm gonna get Lelouch for this!

162
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:24,029
He should have told me I had
to be part of the Horror House.

163
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:28,019
Hmph! The only person I let order me around is Zero!

164
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:31,087
Oh great, here comes another couple.

165
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,462
Why couldn't they make this whole thing mechanical?

166
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,382
They've got this dumb screen...

167
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:37,678
It's sweltering inside of here!

168
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:39,751
It's like those early Glasgows.

169
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,388
Come on, move your ass!

170
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:44,041
Hurry! Move your ass!

171
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,749
Ohgi?!

172
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,390
You're back safe?

173
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,745
Fortunately, yes.

174
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:58,282
School festivals are such fun! I feel so free!

175
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:02,996
The one she keeps whacking... doesn't he look like Lloyd?

176
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,052
No great wonder.

177
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,710
Working under that guy must
really drive her out of her mind.

178
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,864
Right, the pizza is starting later.

179
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,271
I definitely don't have time to be doing this.

180
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,817
Yes. Oh, the drama club?

181
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,516
I've spoken to the film club about it.

182
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:20,857
How can I prepare my coup d'etat?

183
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,855
I'm sorry! The handle just broke in two!

184
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,380
Soldiers? How peaceful the world is...

185
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:29,821
Say, aren't you Suzaku's friend?

186
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,482
Hey! You! Boy!

187
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:34,914
Where am I supposed to go to
eat the biggest pizza in the world?

188
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:37,242
Oh, so you're here.

189
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,532
Good work getting them here from Area 18 in one night.

190
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,587
Your forces are impressive, Cornelia.

191
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:43,993
You flatter me.

192
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:48,841
I'm honored that you deployed your
regular troops to fill in for them, Schneizel.

193
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,831
It was the least I could do.

194
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:54,019
The Glaston Knights, who were standing by in the homeland,

195
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:57,057
have joined us here, and that means...

196
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:59,944
We even have Sattel Waffe for the Gloucesters.

197
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,253
I understand.

198
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,345
And I'm going to play this card in my
negotiations with the Chinese Federation.

199
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,292
Please do.

200
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:07,855
What a great honor...

201
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,224
Being asked for assistance by Princess Cornelia,

202
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:13,291
who is unmatched on the battlefield.

203
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:15,041
Please, don't tease me about this.

204
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,183
But I'm sincere.

205
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,439
On the field of combat, you shine more beautifully

206
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:21,839
and brightly than any flower or butterfly at a soirée.

207
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,526
Yes, like the Flash herself.

208
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,871
Please, stop saying that. You know I'm only...

209
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,155
Now where could Euphy have disappeared to?

210
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,342
I told her I was coming to see you off.

211
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,828
I had a long talk with Euphy last night.

212
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:36,009
Last night?

213
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:36,889
Yes.

214
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,928
Ah, and about the other matter?

215
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,077
Bartley's project?

216
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:42,061
Oh yes, I really don't mind,

217
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,673
but will he actually be of any use to us?

218
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,056
I'm asking about the biggest pizza in the world.

219
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,372
I'll bring you some, now wait in your room!

220
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,358
I don't believe you, because you're a liar.

221
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,761
I'm not going to deceive you over a pizza.

222
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,567
The military and the press are here!

223
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,759
What if they see you?!

224
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,567
I'll wear a disguise. I don't like cold pizza.

225
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:06,120
Right now, I have a school
festival and a coup d'etat to run!

226
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:08,318
Why did you come into the school?

227
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:09,934
Oh, that's my fault.

228
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,872
Who are you anyway?

229
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:13,564
You're definitely not an Eleven.

230
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,929
What's your name?

231
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,786
This is, uh... She's my...

232
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,851
Kallen? Authorized personnel only.

233
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:25,656
Could you get them out of here now?

234
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,109
Ohgi?!

235
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,779
I'm really sorry, but there's something
I want to talk to Suzaku about.

236
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,218
It's all right, Your Highness.

237
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:39,020
Euphy, I think this is a
wonderful idea you've come up with!

238
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,392
Really?! Then...?

239
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,651
You should follow the path
you believe in with all your heart.

240
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:46,872
I'll discuss it with Cornelia so that she understands.

241
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:50,365
Suzaku, my brother approved my idea.

242
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,711
Now we can...

243
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,196
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

244
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,183
I'm fine. Are you okay?

245
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:58,845
Nunnally?!

246
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,878
Huh? That voice... Is it you?

247
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,918
He's seen Ohgi now.

248
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:10,948
This is bad.

249
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,199
If they see me here with C.C., then...

250
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,314
A propane tank for the burner?

251
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,409
I'm sure the spare ones are here, maybe in back.

252
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:19,409
Kallen?

253
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,667
Oh, hello. What's up?

254
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,858
Are there any spare fuel tanks in the back there?

255
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,417
Rivalz needs one for the pizza.

256
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:27,776
Uh, maybe they're on the other side?

257
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,862
Oh, okay.

258
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,811
Can this get any more annoying?!

259
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,586
You can use your Geass, can't you?

260
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:36,129
It'd be dangerous to use it on
Ohgi and whoever that is with him.

261
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:38,755
And I've already used it on everyone else here!

262
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,668
Well it's your own fault then.

263
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,059
You shouldn't use it so freely.

264
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,959
Your comments are not helping!

265
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:45,275
Is that Lelouch?

266
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,406
Are you here?

267
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:48,578
There's something important I want to ask you about!

268
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,967
Find a way to get out of here, fast!

269
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,528
Shirley. Can it wait?

270
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:56,350
I'm going to create a diversion. Use it to get away!

271
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,535
What are you talking about?

272
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,759
You're never around in the first place.

273
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,218
The panels are falling! Run away!

274
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,991
Don't just stand there! Watch out!

275
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,992
Uh, I... thank you.

276
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:22,793
I'm just glad you're okay.

277
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,509
But where'd all the smoke come from?

278
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,574
It must be for detecting gas leaks.

279
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,685
It looks like the main valve was knocked loose.

280
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,639
Never mind that.

281
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:32,051
Can someone help me, please? I'm in a little pain here.

282
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:32,785
What's the matter?

283
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,768
My ankle.

284
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:35,757
It's a very familiar feeling.

285
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:39,057
Sorry you got caught in that weirdness back there.

286
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:41,418
No. It was actually sort of fun.

287
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,068
I haven't felt this excited in a long time.

288
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:49,463
I think it's better you move out of Area 11 now.

289
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,397
Whoever shot you wouldn't come after you.

290
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:52,782
You should be safe.

291
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,086
Y'know, Ohgi,

292
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:58,056
I wonder if the person I used
to be was as happy as I am now.

293
00:13:58,353 --> 00:13:59,572
So, uh...

294
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,978
Can you tell me what you were going to say

295
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,878
when we were back there at the school?

296
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:05,774
Uh...

297
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,625
You started with "She's my..."

298
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,648
She's my what?

299
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:13,086
Well you see...

300
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,625
I really don't think I'd mind becoming an Eleven.

301
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,519
Will you keep our secret?

302
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:24,712
I mean about Lelouch and I being here?

303
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:26,627
But if you just stay here like this...

304
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:28,514
All I want is to be with my brother.

305
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,205
That's all that matters.

306
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:36,553
Do you remember that time when
you and I got into a great big argument?

307
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:40,034
On which of us was going to marry Lelouch when we grew up?

308
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,389
Yes, I do!

309
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:45,331
We put Lelouch on the spot by
making him decide right then and there!

310
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,325
So how 'bout now?

311
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,116
Huh?

312
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,520
Do you still love him?

313
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,104
Even to this day?

314
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,061
All right! Any moment!

315
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:02,911
We are about to begin the historic task
of the making of the world's largest pizza!

316
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,739
Please note that this contraption at my feet

317
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:07,014
is an oven specially built for this occasion!

318
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,250
A fabulous waste of money!

319
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:11,098
Yes, I understand, Shirley.

320
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,824
I promise I'll make time for you.

321
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,606
Right now, just send group B to the stage to help.

322
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:16,990
Right.

323
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,638
This feels so easy!

324
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:24,855
If I make a mistake here, no one's life is on the line.

325
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:26,383
Not bad.

326
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,372
Got everything on schedule, huh?

327
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,649
I've learned to manage people lately.

328
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:33,700
Still, they seem so optimistic, don't they?

329
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,142
The Chinese Federation attacked just the other day,

330
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,569
yet look at everyone.

331
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,937
That's why we need this.

332
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:39,607
Hm?

333
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:41,351
Festivals are necessary.

334
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,145
For everyone, all the time.

335
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,456
You still need to learn a bit more.

336
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,311
Okay, lesson learned!

337
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,253
Lelouch!

338
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,278
Nunnally, how's the pizza...

339
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,583
Sorry! I need a second!

340
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,326
Call me if something happens!

341
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:58,437
Huh?

342
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:01,096
It looks like the ingredients are all prepared!

343
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:01,863
Now!

344
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:04,053
Introducing our special dough tosser,

345
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,366
the Ashford family Ganymede!

346
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,910
Yes, it's a bit of an antique.

347
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,452
However, at the controls is
the student council's special member

348
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:17,758
and Princess Euphemia's personal knight, Suzaku Kururugi!

349
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,245
Listen. Is that because of...?

350
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,184
Yes. There are lots of Elevens who came here today.

351
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,542
It's an open festival after all,
and this is Suzaku's school.

352
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,116
So they came to see him?

353
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:33,580
Yes. Suzaku's like a ray of hope for many Elevens.

354
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,772
They revere him.

355
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,794
I see...

356
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,365
Ganymede, a third-generation Knightmare...

357
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,939
The type used by Lady Marianne
the Flash, isn't that correct?

358
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:43,847
It's just a fundamental frame.

359
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,688
A big puppet for events like this.

360
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,289
An unorthodox design, dropped for
the next generation of Knightmares

361
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,223
due to Lady Marianne's death.

362
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,856
I'm guessing that's the real reason you want to marry me.

363
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,158
So now you get it.

364
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:58,125
He has no attraction whatsoever to the opposite sex.

365
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,518
Well, I get the general idea, anyway.

366
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,353
And again!

367
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,335
Can he get it any larger, folks?!

368
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,590
C'mon, Sir Suzaku! We've got high hopes for you!

369
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,781
Last year, it was my turn to do it,

370
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:12,855
but I can't compare to a real pro.

371
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,047
This is a day of sweet surprises.

372
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:17,822
To think you and Nunnally were so close all this time...

373
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,621
And that you and Suzaku are friends as well!

374
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,849
What is that guy doing?!

375
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,989
This is no time to be hitting on some flirty girl!

376
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,417
I never want to see people unhappy ever again.

377
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,605
Remember, we can't meet after this.

378
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,274
That's not true. I've found a solution for everything.

379
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,505
Lelouch!

380
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,453
Is that Princess Euphemia?!

381
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:45,955
Princess Euphemia?!

382
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,369
What's up?

383
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,153
Princess Euphemia?!

384
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,632
Lelouch! Take Nunnally away!

385
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,324
Sorry to leave you alone at a time like this.

386
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,137
That's right!

387
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:57,100
The sub-viceroy is near the main entrance!

388
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,297
I copy! I'll send in the back-up team!

389
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,603
Camera! Get a link to the studio, quick!

390
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:02,336
All right!

391
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,546
Princess Euphemia's here!

392
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,737
No way! Why?

393
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,098
Where? Where is she?

394
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,915
Everyone stop! Don't run!

395
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,524
Please don't panic!

396
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,247
Pizza...

397
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,157
Guess we should have left this to the pros.

398
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,296
What do you think?

399
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,845
I'm afraid I'm just going to have to give up on this one.

400
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,373
And some other things.

401
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,728
Everyone stop this at once!

402
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,211
Do you realize who this is?!

403
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,527
This is the Sub-Viceroy! The Third Imperial Princess!

404
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,395
Thanks for your help. We'll take over from here.

405
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,409
Stand back every...

406
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:39,360
HiTV! A comment!

407
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,552
Just one word, please!

408
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,563
Princess Euphemia, it's me! Nina!

409
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,428
I'll get you out of here...

410
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,193
Ugh this is getting tight!

411
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,510
Please, excuse me! No, don't!

412
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,390
You don't say?

413
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,335
Already? If you've escaped on your own,

414
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,776
I'd say that's excellent, Deputy Commander.

415
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,207
We'll stay right here.

416
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,511
Right.

417
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:04,176
Looks like we wasted the
equipment space inside the news van.

418
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:07,674
There's no need for the captain of
the Zero squad to escape now either.

419
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,997
I'd like you to continue to stay
undercover here in the settlement.

420
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,139
I'll introduce you to Zero later on.

421
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,746
I understand.

422
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:16,749
Oh, wow!

423
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,377
Princess Euphemia, you're not hurt, are you?

424
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:24,081
I'm fine! Thank you, Suzaku!

425
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:25,953
Are you okay, Nunnally?

426
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,273
Yes. How about Euphemia?

427
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:30,681
She's all right. Suzaku's taking care of her.

428
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:31,690
I see...

429
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,651
Lelouch, guess what?

430
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:34,308
Hm?

431
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:39,164
Euphy said that she and Suzaku
are becoming very close now.

432
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:43,293
They make a nice couple. Don't you agree?

433
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,278
Nunnally, you...

434
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,387
Thank heavens. They're all right.

435
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,695
Princess Euphemia, down here,
can I get a statement, please?

436
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:03,248
Could you please network this broadcast nationwide?

437
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:04,897
Huh? You mean go live now?

438
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:05,720
Euphy?

439
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,852
I have a very important announcement!

440
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:08,671
Hm?

441
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:11,122
Your Highness! It's Princess Euphemia!

442
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:12,897
What's she doing now?

443
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:15,214
And we go to our special live coverage!

444
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,536
I am Euphemia,

445
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,675
Sub-Viceroy of Area 11 of the Holy Britannian Empire.

446
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,617
There is something of great consequence

447
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:24,341
that I wish to tell you all today!

448
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,700
Now what?

449
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,186
This little girl makes such a fuss.

450
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:34,125
I, Euphemia li Britannia, hereby declare the
formation of the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan

451
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,317
in the area surrounding Mount Fuji!

452
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,300
What?! Britannia has...?!

453
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:40,687
They're recognizing Japan?!

454
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:41,661
Dammit!

455
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,477
I never thought of this scheme.

456
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:45,842
Even though it's only in a limited area...

457
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,700
Within the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan,

458
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,058
Elevens will be permitted to call themselves Japanese.

459
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:55,519
Restrictions against Elevens
and special rights for Britannians

460
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,961
will no longer exist within this zone.

461
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:01,161
It will be a place where Elevens and Britannians

462
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,576
live side by side as equals!

463
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:04,885
Stop this, Euphy!

464
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,475
I already thought through every detail of that scenario!

465
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,266
It's nothing but an empty dream!

466
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,474
Do you hear me, Zero?!

467
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:16,324
I don't care about your past,
nor who you are underneath that mask!

468
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,275
I beg you!

469
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,106
Join us in creating this special zone of freedom!

470
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,034
Join Zero?

471
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,428
No way! Just think about Prince Clovis!

472
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:25,510
What is she doing?!

473
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,864
Zero, help me build a new future within Britannia!

474
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,888
A place for everyone!

475
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,560
A Japanese zone? Why's she doing that now?

476
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:39,411
That's pretty obvious. She's in love with an Eleven.

477
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,664
I'm finished.

478
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,761
Either way I go, the Black
Knights will break apart over this!

479
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,581
The reason we exist has vanished!

480
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,286
How could this have happened so easily?!

481
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,597
You think you can just take
it all away from me like this?!

482
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:56,903
Even if it is a place where we can be ourselves...

483
00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:58,509
You know nothing!

484
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,784
You understand nothing!

485
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,774
I am the terrorist who hides his face.

486
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:06,511
And you...

487
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:11,142
Lelouch! Now it can be like before!

488
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:14,283
No, the past is dead and gone!

489
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,760
Euphemia!

490
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,118
The Specially Administrated Zone of Japan.

491
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:55,233
If I cooperate, I give up the right to use force.

492
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,633
Oppose it, and the people become my enemies,

493
00:23:57,658 --> 00:23:59,471
and the Black Knights collapse.

494
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:00,537
Euphemia!

495
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:04,215
The third princess who innocently
holds good intentions like a sword!

496
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,698
For Nunnally and me, your
very existence has become a crime!
