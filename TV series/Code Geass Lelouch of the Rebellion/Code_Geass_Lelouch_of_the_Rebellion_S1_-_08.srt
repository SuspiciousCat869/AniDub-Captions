1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,890
Lelouch, a Britannian youth,

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:11,245
has been given a god-like power
by the mysterious young woman, C.C.

3
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:12,475
Geass.

4
00:00:12,591 --> 00:00:16,608
The absolute power to compel anyone to follow any order.

5
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:19,605
For the sake of his younger sister, Nunnally,

6
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:23,086
Lelouch plots to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire.

7
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:27,795
Meanwhile, his best friend
from childhood, Suzaku Kururugi,

8
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:31,637
has established himself as an
honorary Britannian within the Empire.

9
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:35,171
At this point, their lives are already intertwined

10
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:38,688
and their destinies predetermined
with inevitable outcomes.

11
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,803
I never left the Tokyo settlement before!

12
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,277
This is my first time!

13
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:36,157
I'm sure you wish Lelouch could
have come with us, don't you?

14
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,734
Don't be so shy.

15
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,788
Tonight, we can stay up all night talking.

16
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:42,024
Let's tell each other which boys we like from school.

17
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,474
Then you'll probably have a lot
to talk about, right, Ms. President?

18
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,441
Who can say?

19
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,133
Nina, it's all right.

20
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:55,769
There are lots of Britannian tourists
at Lake Kawaguchi, so security's fine.

21
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,091
Don't be afraid. It's not the ghettos.

22
00:02:58,222 --> 00:02:59,201
Yes, but...

23
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,674
We'll be with you the whole time.

24
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,788
We won't leave your side for a second.

25
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,314
Th-Thanks.

26
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,548
What are you waiting for? Come in.

27
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,817
As of now, this place will be our hideout.

28
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:22,585
So...

29
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:25,075
...you think joining up with us is a good idea?

30
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,503
Yes. We're comrades, after all.

31
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:28,987
Holy cow!

32
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,983
So, what is this, huh?

33
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,014
D'you mind if I ask how you came by this?

34
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,072
I borrowed it from a rather libertine
nobleman who indulges my requests.

35
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,251
You asked for it? Just like that?

36
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,493
Don't worry. No strings attached.

37
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:43,769
It's huge.

38
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,221
Check it out, it's got a second story.

39
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:47,285
On the other hand,

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,547
no one would expect us in something like this.

41
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,196
It's even got a TV.

42
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,461
How's are things looking at the scene?

43
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:53,957
Huh?

44
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:54,789
What's this?

45
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:57,338
I'm here in front of the Lake
Kawaguchi Convention Center Hotel.

46
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:01,268
The hotel jackers have identified
themselves as the Japan Liberation Front.

47
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,047
What's happening?

48
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:06,768
Members of the Sakuradite allocation meeting,
most notably, Chairman James, were taken hostage,

49
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,446
as well as several tourists and hotel employees.

50
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:12,017
This footage was taken by the perpetrators.

51
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,742
In it, you can clearly see Chairman
James, including some students.

52
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:16,941
From the student council.

53
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,607
Hm?

54
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:21,256
The leader of the group claims to be Lt. Colonel
Kusakabe of the now-defunct Japanese military.

55
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,300
Agh! That imbecile!

56
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:27,996
Sakuradite, an essential component in the
manufacture of high temperature superconductors,

57
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,553
is a vital strategic resource
that directly affects world security.

58
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:37,673
Area 11 is the largest producer of this
material, providing 70% of the world's total supply.

59
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:41,164
Here at the yearly national
meeting of Sakuradite producers,

60
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,499
it will be determined how this resource
will be distributed among the world's nations.

61
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:50,159
It's no exaggeration to say that the
outcome determines the balance of global power

62
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:52,524
between Britannia and other countries.

63
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,685
It is believed that the terrorists are
using world interest in the annual gathering

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,204
to their advantage by carrying
out this violent hotel takeover.

65
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:03,658
I'm Kusakabe of the Japan Liberation Front.

66
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:07,130
This stand we're taking is for the
freedom of Japan and our countrymen!

67
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,840
Even though you are not soldiers,
you are still Britannians!

68
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:12,032
You are the ones who rule and oppress us!

69
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:14,554
Sit still, be quiet, and you'll be fine.

70
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,815
If you don't...!

71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,581
Lulu.

72
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,399
So, they've made their move.

73
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:21,587
They're easily the biggest anti-Britannian force in Japan.

74
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,024
And now their pride's hurt.

75
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:24,070
Because of us?

76
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,787
Maybe.

77
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,500
I don't know whether to feel happy or sad about that.

78
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,324
Because they're all gonna end up dead.

79
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:30,437
Rivalz?

80
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,393
Uh! Lelouch, I've... Huh?

81
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:34,543
This is Lelouch.

82
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,240
Please leave a message after the beep.

83
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,523
What the hell's he doing at a time like this?!

84
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,047
I know. But...

85
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:47,892
All bridges connecting to the hotel, with the
exception of the main one, have been destroyed.

86
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:51,253
Our attempted approaches from air
and water have been unsuccessful.

87
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:56,375
There's only one route left that will allow
us to develop a possible hostage rescue plan.

88
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:01,402
The main utilities tunnel running
directly beneath the convention center hotel.

89
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:06,902
Basically, we would go in through this route,
destroy the foundation block, and submerge the hotel.

90
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,159
Since the tunnel was also built
to handle supply deliveries,

91
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:12,553
it should be able to accommodate Sutherlands.

92
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:16,179
Even if the enemy has taken
precautions, it should be no problem.

93
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:17,898
Go.

94
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,172
They've been using sub-standard weaponry,

95
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:22,097
so we'll have no trouble evading them.

96
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,351
Enemy detected!

97
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:26,048
As expected, they're moving
through the underground tunnel!

98
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:26,957
Roger that!

99
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,044
Raikou, secondary start-up! Both quad-linkage legs locked!

100
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,399
Super electromagnetic shrapnel cannon voltage, confirmed!

101
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,957
I think these guys have Knightmare rifles.

102
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,732
Spread out and break their ranks.

103
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:44,345
Super electromagnetic shrapnel cannon, fire!

104
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,287
What?!

105
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,135
One shot!

106
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,561
Yes!

107
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:52,329
It works!

108
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,396
The Raikou was a complete success!

109
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,603
What do you think of that, Britannian pigs?

110
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:57,633
Wiped out?!

111
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,350
It looks as though they've modified
a Glasgow into a linear cannon.

112
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,132
Then there's no way we can break through.

113
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,079
What do we do now?

114
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,590
If we release the political prisoners as they demand...

115
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,802
We can't show weakness to terrorists!

116
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,682
But Princess Euphemia, she's...

117
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:12,819
Yes, I know.

118
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:15,898
Thus far, it appears that none
of them have discovered that fact.

119
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:19,051
If they learn that Princess
Euphemia is among the hostages,

120
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,422
they'll undoubtedly use her as a bargaining chip.

121
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,470
She went there just to observe,

122
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,325
therefore she isn't registered
along with the other guests.

123
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,776
Yes, yes, I understand. I'll do well this time.

124
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,828
I'll try to look out for him, but I'm not his guardian.

125
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,817
Can't the Special Corps offer any
assistance with the rescue operation?

126
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:46,054
I've already asked them, but we're an irregular unit,

127
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,640
and they don't acknowledge our chain of command.

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,209
Besides...

129
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,040
It's too risky to entrust the
operation to an Eleven, is that right?

130
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,372
Yet, I'm sure you're aware that Princess Cornelia

131
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:59,066
is very discriminating about Britannians and Numbers.

132
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:02,216
So the Japanese still aren't being
accepted enough into your structure?

133
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:06,433
If that were true, then what point would there
be in even having an honorary Britannian system?

134
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,033
Sir, did your daughter appear...

135
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:08,975
Where do you want this?

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Over there, by the driver's seat.

137
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,773
Hey! What about these boxes here?

138
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:14,548
She was only sightseeing!

139
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,128
Shirley is still a student.

140
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:18,545
But these criminals act indiscriminately.

141
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:20,885
Savages! I want to know if Shir...

142
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,636
I want to know if my daughter's all right!

143
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,277
She hasn't done anything wrong!

144
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,242
All he's asking...

145
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:28,544
We need to organize before we fight them again.

146
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:30,508
It's too soon, though. We're not ready.

147
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,361
But we can't just sit here and do nothing, either.

148
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:36,138
Knowing Cornelia, she'll sacrifice the hostages.

149
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,339
Then why doesn't she make her move?

150
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,885
Is it possible?

151
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:41,842
Zero.

152
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,266
What will happen to the hostages?

153
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,525
Eventually...

154
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,256
...there will be no reason to
keep those Britannians alive.

155
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:51,755
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

156
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,819
Hey, Zero. I found these.

157
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,689
Should I hand them out to everyone?

158
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:58,268
I mean, as far as gear goes, it looks pretty hip,

159
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,627
but we're just a resistance group, so...

160
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,343
Wrong!

161
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,543
We're not a resistance group. Is that clear?

162
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,826
Well then, what are we?

163
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:08,906
What we are... what we're trying to be...

164
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:11,264
...are knights for justice.

165
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:14,164
Attention all sniper teams. Situation is "hold."

166
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,547
All team commanders, confirm...

167
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,423
Those teenage hostages are friends
of yours from school, aren't they?

168
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:21,091
They're still negotiating, so let's not give up hope.

169
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,535
I have faith in the system.

170
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,925
I prefer the logic of systems to individualist emotions.

171
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,015
Uh. Miss Cecile, look!

172
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,858
Huh? What?

173
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,711
That's...

174
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:33,988
What are they gonna do to him?!

175
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,036
Oh, no...

176
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,346
Don't do it!

177
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,953
No!

178
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,211
Our demands have gone unanswered.

179
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:47,747
Therefore, we will throw one hostage from the
roof every 30 minutes until our terms are met.

180
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,537
For the sake of the hostages,
negotiations better be in good faith!

181
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,269
This is their warning? Barbarians.

182
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:57,260
For now, we could negotiate just
to get the women and children out...

183
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,034
Forget it!

184
00:09:58,101 --> 00:10:02,357
If you give in to their conditions even
once then you're simply legitimizing terrorism!

185
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,829
Then do we use force?

186
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:08,246
We would pursue that course of action after
we secure the safety of Princess Euphemia.

187
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,696
Euphy... I...

188
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,891
Viceroy! It's Zero!

189
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,877
We just received a message from Zero.

190
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,146
What?

191
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,587
What do you mean van three was stolen by Zero?

192
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:21,633
What the hell was Gibson doing all the while?

193
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:24,663
He said that when he realized
what was happening, it was too late.

194
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:26,886
Ugh. Then where's van three now?

195
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,603
Driving straight toward the military.

196
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,189
Huh?

197
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,707
We confirm. It's Zero! Should we open fire?

198
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,189
No, just stand by.

199
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,082
We'll capture him after he's surrounded.

200
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:40,402
Hey, when Zero went off about "justice" earlier,

201
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:41,636
what do you think he meant?

202
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,544
Dunno.

203
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,815
But we may die first before we find out.

204
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,261
It seems all of our escape routes have been cut off.

205
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:50,408
I'm just wondering: why didn't we use that other vehicle?

206
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,845
Oh, so you want the whole world
to see where we hide out, huh?

207
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,674
Point taken.

208
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,528
I don't know about this Zero character.

209
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:56,732
You sure we should trust him?

210
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,924
No, that's why I said he looked shifty to me.

211
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:01,874
But if anything goes wrong, I'll do somethin' about it.

212
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,112
Cornelia...

213
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:12,398
Much as I'd love to get you back right
here and now, you're more useful to me alive.

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,746
If you do what I predict, I won't need to use my Geass.

215
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,924
Well, well, we meet again, Zero.

216
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,457
Are you a member of the Japan Liberation Front?

217
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,714
Or perhaps you intend to help us.

218
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:27,904
Regardless, our concerns take
priority over yours at the moment.

219
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,437
And so, for the death of my half-brother, Clovis,

220
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,708
I shall take my revenge right here!

221
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,220
Cornelia! Which would you chose?

222
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:39,296
Clovis, who is dead, or Euphemia, who is alive?

223
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,762
My suspicion's confirmed.

224
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,939
The first task at hand is completed.

225
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,043
You haven't changed, dear sister.

226
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,749
You've always doted on sweet little Euphemia.

227
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:52,079
That's why you won't take aggressive action.

228
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,219
Your emotions are getting in the way.

229
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,544
It's within my power to save Euphemia for you.

230
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,078
What do you mean?

231
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:02,407
I have no idea what you're talking about!

232
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:04,884
I said that I'm able to rescue her!

233
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,871
Zero, you say?

234
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:09,184
Yes, sir. Word came from the Britannian army.

235
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,395
Attention all forces!

236
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,660
Let Zero pass! I repeat, let Zero pass!

237
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:24,661
Either the Japan Liberation
Front will accept me as their ally,

238
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,667
or they're going to treat me
as nothing more than a nuisance.

239
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:33,365
In any event, I highly doubt that they can't
resist the temptation of meeting the infamous Zero.

240
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:34,638
We shall see...

241
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,040
Excellent.

242
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:42,451
All the operation's preliminary
conditions have been cleared.

243
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,600
Viceroy, what are we doing?

244
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,837
I believe that by letting Zero go in,

245
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:49,920
we can buy some time before the next hostage is executed.

246
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,028
So... this is our chance.

247
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,178
We can hit them both at the same time.

248
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,881
Wonderful! I want to thank you for that lovely order!

249
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,059
They said you've got the green light, Lancelot!

250
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,485
You've orders to charge right in
to that linear canon in the tunnel.

251
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,228
Wait a minute, you mean they're using
him as a decoy to make an opening for them?

252
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:12,168
Yup! Seems like they'll use the
confusion to send in the royal guard!

253
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,140
"Seems like"?! But Lloyd...!

254
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,104
Miss Cecile.

255
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,127
I'm ready. Please let me do it.

256
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,259
If Lancelot and I are needed,

257
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:23,490
and we're able to give the hostages an
opportunity to be saved, then I'll do it.

258
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,627
Even if it means being a decoy.

259
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,814
Warrant Officer Kururugi,

260
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,458
here is a guideline for your mission.

261
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:44,311
According to prime search, the hostages
are located on the hotel's middle floor

262
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,883
and believed to be locked inside a food storage room.

263
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:52,361
Advanced prototype weapon Z-01 Lancelot will
use the utilities tunnel to move under the hotel.

264
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:56,862
Once on site, you will destroy the
foundation block and submerge the building.

265
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,964
The area with the hostages
should hold out for eight minutes.

266
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:03,618
Hostage rescue and mop-up of the
terrorists will be handled by other units.

267
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,209
You will be using the VARIS to destroy the foundation.

268
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:09,228
Set the impact rail to anti-material level three.

269
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:13,413
The only variable in this is that pesky
linear cannon waiting for you in the tunnel.

270
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,792
Space is tight in there.

271
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:18,401
The Lancelot will only have a 47.8% evasion rate.

272
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:20,146
Are we really going through with this?

273
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:23,189
Yup. Make sure you both pull
out of there before it's too late.

274
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,893
Lancelot might be wrecked, that would be unacceptable.

275
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,126
"Before it's too late"?

276
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,429
Mmmm!

277
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:30,753
Understood, sir.

278
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,207
Suzaku.

279
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:36,702
The president, and Nina and I are going
to Lake Kawaguchi on Sunday. Wanna join us?

280
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,232
Sorry. I have to work that day.

281
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:40,661
You do?

282
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:42,943
Too bad, but I guess that can't be helped then.

283
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,416
But thank you for inviting me.

284
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,941
I really appreciate it.

285
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,821
I hope all of you have a great time.

286
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,652
Twelve minutes to operation start.

287
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:52,042
Commencing countdown.

288
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,830
An Eleven?

289
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:58,308
What did you say?!

290
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,535
Not Elevens! We are Japanese, dammit!

291
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,810
Yes, we're aware of that! Just lay off of her!

292
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,210
Then correct her! We're not called "Elevens"!

293
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,459
Fine, we'll correct her!

294
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:09,275
How dare you speak like that to me!

295
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:13,389
You three, come with me to the next
room, and I'll teach you a real lesson!

296
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,160
Mh-hm.

297
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,692
I said get up! Now!

298
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:22,826
Let me go!

299
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:23,806
Stop it!

300
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,534
Who the hell are you?!

301
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,241
I demand you take me to your
leader right now, understand?!

302
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:29,816
What?!

303
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,223
No, Sub-viceroy, please.

304
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:33,541
You're addressing Euphemia Li Britannia.

305
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,271
The third princess of the Britannian Empire.

306
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:41,407
Are you all right, young lady? You haven't been hurt?

307
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:42,873
No.

308
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,049
You have no intention of joining me?

309
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,965
Remove that mask and reveal your real face to us.

310
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,407
It's disrespectful not to.

311
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:51,616
I understand.

312
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,580
But before I do, I'd like to ask you something.

313
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:57,850
What exactly do you hope to accomplish by this action?

314
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,902
Gain attention.

315
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:02,747
I want this country and the world to
know that the Japanese aren't dead yet.

316
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:03,897
How stale.

317
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:04,523
Hm?!

318
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,284
You people are obsolete. There's no saving you.

319
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,142
What?! Why you arrogant...!

320
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,347
Explain what you mean by that, Zero.

321
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,041
M.E. boost...

322
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,686
Lancelot, now launching!

323
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,219
Reaction confirmed! One enemy Knightmare!

324
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,054
It moves twice as fast as the others!

325
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,199
So what?! It'll end up like the rest!

326
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:28,879
Super electromagnetic shrapnel cannon... Fire!

327
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:38,972
I warned you about this, Lloyd!

328
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,269
He doesn't want to play decoy, he's going for the gold!

329
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,538
I brought the hostage that I radioed about
earlier for the lieutenant colonel to see.

330
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,635
She claims that she's Princess Euphemia.

331
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,078
Zero!

332
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,943
There's no point talking any more!

333
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:56,600
Die.

334
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,753
Fire!

335
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,086
Colonel!

336
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:09,799
Calm yourselves.

337
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,453
Zero.

338
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:16,741
The colonel and the others committed suicide when
they realized how meaningless this operation was.

339
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:18,491
Euphemia...

340
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:21,961
You were willing to sacrifice yourself for the commoners.

341
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,440
You haven't changed.

342
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:23,998
Uh?

343
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,364
What? The ASEEC's Knightmare?

344
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,175
Yes. At the rate it's going, it'll break through soon.

345
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,616
Huh. Do we dare hold out hope?

346
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:36,484
Yes! It can take this level of destructive force!

347
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:39,535
That thing broke through salvo number five!

348
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,597
I can't believe it!

349
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:41,698
Just don't panic!

350
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:44,613
Deploy the quad-link free-fire arm gun, batteries too!

351
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:47,066
We'll shield this final defense line with our lives!

352
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,431
Miss Cecile, it's time for me to use the VARIS.

353
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:50,751
No, you could get killed!

354
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,308
There's no room for me to evade.

355
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,769
I'll risk getting blasted to take the first shot!

356
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,829
Why, you stinking son of a...

357
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,539
I heard that you're the sub-viceroy now, Your Highness.

358
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:10,749
Princess Euphemia Li Britannia.

359
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:12,796
It's not an appointment I'm happy with.

360
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:15,820
No. That's because Clovis was murdered.

361
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:17,686
That was my handiwork.

362
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,400
He begged pathetically for his life to the very end.

363
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:24,879
He pleaded with the same tongue
that ordered the deaths of Elevens.

364
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,353
So is that the reason why you killed my brother?

365
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,394
No.

366
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:29,410
Then why?!

367
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,549
Because Clovis was an offspring of the Britannian emperor.

368
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,400
That reminds me...

369
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,974
You're one of his children, too, aren't you?

370
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,436
Use maximum output!

371
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:41,868
I don't give a damn if that destroys the guns!

372
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:45,891
Be prepared to die defending this spot! Smash him!

373
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:01,468
It's the Eleven...

374
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,043
He really did it!

375
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,074
Guilford!

376
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,906
Right!

377
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,825
No way!

378
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,579
The white Knightmare from before!

379
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,721
Euphy!

380
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:33,449
My friends!

381
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,967
Warrant Officer Kururugi, don't!

382
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,132
What about the cameras in van three?

383
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:42,510
I told you, Zero took the van...

384
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,111
Well then, let's hope we pick up a signal from them!

385
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,182
What're you doing, Zero?

386
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:51,270
Wasn't that part of your plan? To show us something?

387
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:00,679
He's all right!

388
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,543
I couldn't rescue them.

389
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,193
They're dead.

390
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:13,622
I failed.

391
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,611
Not again!

392
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:21,695
We've got it!

393
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,656
My dear Britannians, have no fear.

394
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:31,121
All of the hostages from the hotel are safe and sound.

395
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:34,599
I, Zero, return them to you unharmed.

396
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,938
They're fine!

397
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:38,044
They're all right!

398
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:40,266
Of all the brazen audacity!

399
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:44,446
If we attack you, those people will
quickly become your hostages, won't they?!

400
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,423
People!

401
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,919
Fear us, or rally behind us, as you see fit.

402
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,631
We... are the Black Knights!

403
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:55,909
Black Knights?

404
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,431
Ironic, isn't it?

405
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,101
The terrorists referring to themselves as knights.

406
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,932
We of the Black Knights stand with
all those who have no weapons to wield!

407
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:08,532
Regardless of whether they be Elevens... or Britannians!

408
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:13,356
The Japan Liberation Front cowardly
took innocent Britannian civilians hostage

409
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:15,639
and then mercilessly executed them.

410
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,425
It was a wanton and meaningless act.

411
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,280
Therefore, they have been punished.

412
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:21,200
Uh?

413
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:23,792
You heard me right! I said let it run!

414
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:27,290
Liable?! I'll be the one responsible for this!

415
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:32,524
Just as former viceroy Clovis was punished for
ordering the slaughter of countless unarmed Elevens.

416
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:36,423
We could not stand by and allow
such cruelty to be carried out.

417
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,910
And so, we made him pay for his actions.

418
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,244
I will not repudiate battle on a fair and level field.

419
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,900
But neither will I tolerate a one-sided
massacre of the weak by the strong!

420
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,639
The only ones who should kill...

421
00:21:48,664 --> 00:21:51,034
...are those of us who are prepared to be killed!

422
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:55,230
Wherever oppressors abuse their power
by attacking those who are powerless,

423
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,803
we shall appear again!

424
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:00,239
No matter how mighty... how formidable our foe may be!

425
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,830
Knights... for justice?

426
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,295
Those of you with power... fear us!

427
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,794
Those of you without it... rally behind us!

428
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:17,055
We, the Black Knights, shall be the
ones who stand in judgment of this world!

429
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:50,722
I was lucky.

430
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,897
Heaven must truly be on my side.

431
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,943
I never expected that Cornelia's
one weakness was among the hostages.

432
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:58,913
A weakness named Euphemia.

433
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:02,626
From now on, the Black Knights
shall become my counterattack.

434
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,857
Against the world in which I was trapped.

435
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,033
And against my own undecided heart.
