1
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:05,918
About this specially administrated zone of Japan...

2
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:09,109
There is some unpleasant rumors about Princess Euphemia.

3
00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:11,393
It must be due to the Kamine Island matter.

4
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:13,001
You think she contacted Zero there?

5
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:16,112
I suspect there's a connection
here that goes all the way to top.

6
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,107
No connection.

7
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:19,942
The viceroy wasn't the only one asking what was going on.

8
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,301
But in any case, our connections with them need to be...

9
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:24,934
Mm, right, we'll have to sever ties at once.

10
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:25,959
I'm afraid it's too late.

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,300
Uh?!

12
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:30,130
All the evidence has already been gathered, Vice-Minister.

13
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,698
Namely, that NAC profit-sharing bribe.

14
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,314
I appreciate this, General Darlton.

15
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:36,787
With this...

16
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:41,941
With this, we can finally sweep away
the parasites who were sucking Prince Clovis dry.

17
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:45,134
There are more rats than expected.

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,795
And all of them are confused by Princess
Euphemia's proposed special zone, aren't they?

19
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:58,797
Over two hundred thousand people
have applied to join the Japan special zone.

20
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:01,326
The way things look, that number's only going to grow.

21
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,635
Thanks to you, Suzaku.

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,245
Huh?

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,294
Because of what you represent to the Japanese people,

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,736
everyone is rallying.

25
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,428
They believe in what we're doing here.

26
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:11,250
No, you're giving me too much credit.

27
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:13,773
It must be due to your proclamation, Princess.

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm truly thankful for this. I really am.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,667
Just as I'm thankful to you.

30
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:22,228
And I hope that you're going to
help me with everything that's still to come.

31
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:22,937
Yes, Your...

32
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:24,127
Not like that...

33
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,369
Yes.

34
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:08,018
the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan
is the first attempt of its kind in Britannia,

35
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:11,835
and was personally proposed
by Her Highness, Princess Euphemia.

36
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,328
This youthful inspiration
was an idea from her school years.

37
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:17,601
It has not only caught the Homeland's attention...

38
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:20,285
If Princess Euphemia thinks it's a good idea,

39
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,462
then even I have to...

40
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:24,065
The NAC, lead by Kirihara Industries,

41
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,188
gives its wholehearted support to the plan.

42
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,133
Euphy really is amazing, isn't she?

43
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,396
Now the terrorist groups in Area 11
will lose their popular support and fall apart.

44
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,046
Public order will be stabilized.

45
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:35,838
I personally oppose this.

46
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,816
But, since you understand the situation,

47
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,499
you've sent Darlton to advise her, have you not?

48
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,088
To ensure public policy stays on track.

49
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,779
It's a measure that a viceroy would obviously take.

50
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:46,676
Hm.

51
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:51,170
Did you approve her future plans
as the viceroy or as her older sister?

52
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:55,996
The Japan special zone doesn't sound that bad.

53
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,754
A shadow of Japan that's
given to us out of pity is worthless.

54
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,130
We were granted this concession by the Britannians

55
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,394
as a result of our resistance efforts.

56
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,989
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

57
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,264
Lord Kirihara!

58
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,615
I heard a rumor that you'll be given
a favored position in the special zone

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,061
in exchange for the Sakuradite mining rights.

60
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,310
Don't be suspicious.

61
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,919
It's merely a request to join the ceremony.

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,426
That's a clever excuse.

63
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:19,550
How dare you!

64
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:20,925
Zero.

65
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,631
What about him and all of the Black Knights?

66
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:28,131
The situation is serious. It's not only supporters.

67
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,845
Some of the members within our own ranks

68
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,958
have already applied to join the special zone.

69
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:36,402
Unlike the Black Knights, there's no risk
involved in signing up for the Japan special zone.

70
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,927
Besides, when you compare the pedigreed princess

71
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:41,369
with the mysterious unknown man behind the mask,

72
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,769
it's obvious which one exudes more appeal.

73
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,300
There's a rumor that Kyoto's cooperating with them, too.

74
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,543
What's up with that?!

75
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:49,568
They're offering equality, that's why.

76
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,813
Equality, my ass!

77
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,463
Don't just accept their word for it!

78
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,547
I agree.

79
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:54,090
Mm?

80
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:57,152
But unless we decide how to respond to this quickly...

81
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,411
You want to apply to the special zone?

82
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:04,831
Because there it won't make any difference
who's a Britannian and who's an Eleven.

83
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,066
Listen...

84
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,943
If it works like Euphemia's proposal,

85
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:10,916
then it wouldn't be wrong for the
Black Knights to support this, right?

86
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:13,570
Yeah, sure, like Britannians would ever honor a promise!

87
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,327
I think we should support the zone.

88
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,676
It doesn't contradict what Zero said, does it?

89
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,868
But Ohgi, that's...

90
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:22,383
First off, if we accept peace
on their terms, we'll be forced to disarm.

91
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:24,252
That is a problem, isn't it?

92
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:27,808
We would also get swallowed up
in their regime and lose our independence.

93
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,470
On the other hand, if we don't support it,
then we're against equality and freedom.

94
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,579
Then let's support it!

95
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:34,856
What, without any guarantees in place?

96
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,684
But we can't ignore it, either!

97
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,827
Sorry about having you drop me off like this.

98
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,080
Hey, you helped me go shopping after all.

99
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,710
Besides, I heard that you
were gonna go meet up with Shirley.

100
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,821
She might need me to go shopping, too.

101
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,310
Britannians shouldn't be worried just
because of the special zone starting up.

102
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,044
Oh, yeah, I think you're right about that.

103
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,523
Anyway, you'd better make up
with Shirley pretty soon, buddy.

104
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:57,428
I don't care about your "special zone"!

105
00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:58,834
I don't care about "support"!

106
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,690
I'd sooner die than sign that!

107
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,481
It's a Nobleman, a shining example of class.

108
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,171
You think you're equal to us now?!

109
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:08,862
The lower classes should simply
obey their betters without any backtalk!

110
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,047
There it is.

111
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:13,334
That's the true nature of the sub-viceroy's "benevolence."

112
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:14,828
What do you want?

113
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,107
Doesn't it feel good to look down from above?

114
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,184
It is rather like being a god.

115
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,464
Hold it, school boy. Just back off.

116
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:24,119
I think you should go home right now.

117
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,934
Yeah, okay, I will. Well, I'd better get going.

118
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,072
Huh? What did you say to him?!

119
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:36,555
Come back here at once!

120
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,841
What's wrong, Sir Nobleman?

121
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,769
Confusing borrowed power with
your own ability is a big mistake, you know.

122
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:46,203
Garbage like you should simply die
and be thrown out where no...

123
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:48,275
All right, already, let's break this up!

124
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,569
Mister, why don't you apologize? Whaddya say?

125
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,551
Apologize?! You insolent whelp!

126
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:53,519
Go away!

127
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,489
Uh... Hmph!

128
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,093
Um... Thank you very much.

129
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,646
It was nothing.

130
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:02,185
He came to the aid of that Eleven, even though he's Zero!

131
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,793
Or because he's Zero!

132
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,773
So, why would he have been talking to Princess Euphemia?

133
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,307
Stop it.

134
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:11,378
If I dig too deep, it'll be dangerous.

135
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,155
The NAC...

136
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,208
Or rather, Kyoto, as it's known among the terrorists.

137
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,917
Tomorrow, after the ceremony,

138
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,708
why don't you dissolve your group and leave Mt. Fuji?

139
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,334
We can talk about a legal agreement

140
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:27,234
if you hand over the mining operation to us peacefully.

141
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,093
Uh...

142
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:31,796
Of course, that will mean the end
of your support to the Black Knights.

143
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:34,839
Whether Zero comes tomorrow or not doesn't matter.

144
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:37,903
With this, that man's downfall is assured.

145
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:40,528
Hm?

146
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:41,553
I'm back.

147
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,393
Hello, Lelouch. Welcome home.

148
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:44,875
Oh, where's Shirley?

149
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,025
I'm sorry, Nunnally, she never showed up.

150
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,717
I wasn't able to get a hold of her, either.

151
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:50,571
More of her getting back at you, huh?

152
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,009
Well, you have seemed sort of chilly toward her.

153
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,268
You think so? Then I'll be nicer.

154
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:58,195
Um, Sayoko, would you bring us some tea, please?

155
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,274
Yes. As you wish, my lord.

156
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,484
I get the feeling you're worried about something, Lelouch.

157
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,049
Huh?

158
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,073
Does it involve Euphy?

159
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:13,909
It'd be selfish to say that I want to see her again.

160
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:17,755
I'd like to, I admit it, but that would
simply cause trouble for you both.

161
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:19,594
You like Euphy, don't you?

162
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,225
Yes, very much.

163
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,891
The same way you like her.

164
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,469
Yeah... I did like her.

165
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,027
We're bringing you live coverage from the stadium

166
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,247
where the inaugural ceremony will be held

167
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,064
for the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan.

168
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,392
The place is already packed full with Elevens...

169
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,125
Sorry, I mean with Japanese...

170
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,488
and those unable to get in
are gathered outside the stadium.

171
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:44,365
Leslie, do you think Zero will show up here?

172
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,528
No, and we've heard nothing about it at this time.

173
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,980
Will Zero even show up?

174
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:53,048
I seriously doubt it. What do you think?

175
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,073
If the data we have on the man is accurate,

176
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,089
then I don't believe he will, either.

177
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,720
Princess Euphemia, it's time.

178
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:08,819
Right.

179
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:17,192
Huh?

180
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:20,818
Zero!

181
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:21,771
It's Zero!

182
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,183
Zero is here!

183
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,214
Oh! He came after all!

184
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,568
You accept that you've lost?

185
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,243
What are you doing?!

186
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:34,738
I thought I would have to
carry your identity with me to the grave!

187
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:37,786
If people discover that Zero is a Britannian prince,

188
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,943
it's all over!

189
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,734
They'll mistake this for a farce planned by the Empire!

190
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,469
That would even cause the
specially administrated zone to fall apart!

191
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:46,847
Your target is Zero.

192
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,580
If he makes any suspicious moves, kill him at once.

193
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,050
Yes, my lord.

194
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:54,509
Zero! Welcome to the specially administrated zone!

195
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,961
Greetings, Euphemia li Britannia!

196
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:59,305
I wish to request an audience with you!

197
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,625
Just with me?

198
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,723
Yes, with you alone!

199
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:05,655
Something major has happened here, ladies and gentlemen!

200
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,714
Zero has just appeared in the open!

201
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,654
Under Princess Euphemia's direction,

202
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,346
he is moving toward the G1.

203
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,911
I'm afraid something's going to happen.

204
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,727
We should have gone there like I thought.

205
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,731
What for?

206
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,708
It's not as if we had choice in the matter.

207
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:21,373
Everyone said that if Lancelot was
there waiting, Zero wouldn't show.

208
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,220
It appears to be safe, Your Highness.

209
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,525
Then this way, please.

210
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,490
Princess Euphemia, it's too
dangerous to be alone with this man.

211
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:31,455
As your knight, I request that you
allow me to accompany you to safety!

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,814
No, it's all right.

213
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,839
Please, just trust me, Suzaku.

214
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,837
C'mon... How long are we supposed to hang around here?

215
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,966
What, it's not enough for you
that Zero instructed us to wait here?

216
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:46,283
Yeah, whatever...

217
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,627
Well, first of all, we have to
confirm the empire's true intentions.

218
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:50,485
Deputy-commander?

219
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,677
Uh... Yes.

220
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:53,452
Zero knows their real intentions.

221
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:56,249
Isn't that why he told us to hide
and wait in all four directions?

222
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:57,678
A risky assumption!

223
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:00,888
He's even got Diethard and Rakshata standing by.

224
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,150
Zero is probably planning to assassinate Euphemia.

225
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,367
Even though the cameras are off,

226
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,683
you're still being extremely careful, aren't you?

227
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,899
I've been in hiding for a long time
due to a certain empire, I'm afraid.

228
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:16,010
This is a needle gun made from ceramic and bamboo.

229
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,327
It can't be picked up on a metal detector.

230
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:21,405
Lelouch, you would never shoot me, would you?

231
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,027
No... I would never do that.

232
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,116
You'll be doin' the shooting, Euphy.

233
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,358
Huh?!

234
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:30,183
Is this really all right, leaving her alone with Zero?

235
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,920
But she ordered us to.

236
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,924
Well, she can always press the emergency call button.

237
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,605
Hm? Is there something wrong?

238
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,983
Why are you here? What are you doing with Zero?

239
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,159
It looks like he can see me.

240
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:01,124
Is that because of our indirect contact
and what occurred at Kamine Island?

241
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:02,827
Or is it because he...

242
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,011
But if that's the case, then...

243
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,589
This ceremony is being broadcast globally

244
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,258
and the world is going to witness you,

245
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,408
a Britannian princess, shoot Zero.

246
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,200
What do you think will happen next?

247
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,324
Rioting would break out, I imagine.

248
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:23,317
Right.

249
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,911
Zero will become a martyr, tricked into a deathtrap,

250
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,786
and instantly, your popularity will crash to Earth.

251
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:31,120
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

252
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,006
You should just help me to rebuild Japan.

253
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:37,028
If you force it upon us from on high,
then you're as bad as Clovis was!

254
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,790
All tasks at hand have been cleared.

255
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:44,429
After hovering near death, Zero will be met
with cheers when he makes a miraculous recovery.

256
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,729
Because people don't give a damn
about reason, but nobody can resist miracles.

257
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:50,545
Now, take the gun.

258
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,739
Huh...?

259
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:54,449
There can only be one messiah, you understand.

260
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,406
And when the people realize
that you're a false one, they'll... Ugh!

261
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,452
I... I thought so.

262
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:03,101
I need to know one thing. Are you the...

263
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:09,161
No... He's reached that... point...!

264
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,538
Hey! What's wrong?!

265
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,742
Major Kururugi!

266
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,746
Why you...! What have you done to him?!

267
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,094
Lelouch!

268
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,859
Stop it! Stop giving me your pity!

269
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,606
Spare me your charity!

270
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,815
This is something I have to achieve on my own!

271
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,217
And so for that, I shall now stain your hands with blood,

272
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:42,307
Euphemia li Britannia!

273
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,620
That isn't my name! I've renounced it!

274
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:49,442
There'll probably be a formal announcement
issued by the Homeland about it any day now,

275
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,717
but I've given up my claim to the throne!

276
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,934
But why?

277
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,735
It isn't because you accepted Zero, is it?

278
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,328
Well, of course. I have to pay the
price for doing something so selfish.

279
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,070
Those are the consequences.

280
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,803
Yes, but it wasn't difficult
for you to give that up, was it?

281
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,824
And I suppose you did it for my sake.

282
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,410
As conceited as you ever were.
But no, I did it for Nunnally.

283
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,083
She told me herself.

284
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:15,912
"All I want to is to be with my brother.

285
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,907
and that's all that matters; I want nothing more."

286
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:20,774
For that petty reason?

287
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,632
That's right, Lelouch. That's how I made up my mind.

288
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:28,185
It made me stop and seriously reflect on
what was truly important to me in life.

289
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:29,732
Do you understand now?

290
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,746
I'm not giving up anything that
has significant meaning or real worth to me.

291
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,085
And you don't need to worry.
I won't tell anyone about you.

292
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,009
Hmph.

293
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:40,409
And Cornelia?

294
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,101
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

295
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,341
Euphy, you are a fool.

296
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:46,828
An amazing fool.

297
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,898
I know I'm not as smart as you, Lelouch.

298
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,891
I've never been able to beat
you at games or studies, however...

299
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,006
However...

300
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:57,448
In your usual rash "Euphy" fashion,
you've managed to end up winning all of it.

301
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,312
When I think of you, I don't
visualize a sub-viceroy or a princess.

302
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:04,429
I only see the plain little Euphy who you used to be.

303
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,583
Then will you join plain little Euphy and help her?

304
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,766
You are...

305
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,052
You are the worst opponent I have ever faced.

306
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:19,882
You win.

307
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:20,957
Huh?

308
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:24,133
I'll amend my plans to help out your special zone.

309
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,943
Ah. But not as your subordinate, all right?

310
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,819
All right!

311
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:30,224
Though you haven't got very much faith in me, have you?

312
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:30,815
Hm?

313
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Did you honestly believe that by
simply threatening me, I would shoot you?

314
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,607
Oh, no. You've got it all wrong.

315
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,831
When I really want people to follow my orders,

316
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,398
they will not resist me.

317
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:44,930
Whether it's to shoot me, to grant
pardon to Suzaku, or... any order at all.

318
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,459
Oh, now you're being silly.

319
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:47,693
Stop playing with me.

320
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:48,791
I'm serious!

321
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:51,377
For example, if I told you to kill all the Japanese,

322
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,277
it wouldn't matter how you felt about it.

323
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,184
No! Don't make me do it, please!

324
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,602
I'm not...!

325
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,935
Not going to do it... Please!

326
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:08,633
I don't want to kill them!

327
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,018
No...!

328
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:11,043
Did I...?!

329
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,562
You're right.

330
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:16,279
I have to kill all the Japanese.

331
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:18,073
I've become like Mao!

332
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,993
I can't control my Geass power!

333
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,573
Forget the order I just gave you!

334
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,966
Euphy!

335
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,329
Wait, Euphy! Don't!

336
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:30,326
Right. I've reached an
agreement with the Chinese Federation,

337
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,663
therefore I should be returning to the Homeland today.

338
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:35,630
Should we keep the experimental
subject here then, Your Highness?

339
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,661
Yes. How intelligent is he?

340
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,311
Our resources are rather limited in Area 11.

341
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,313
I see.

342
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:43,907
We should ask the Rosenberg Institute about that.

343
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:48,333
Very well, I'll arrange it with them
for you to send over the experimental subject.

344
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,259
Understood.

345
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,751
Then, what do we do with the ruins on Kamine Island?

346
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,845
We have to wait to do anything until the
security situation in Area 11 has been stabilized.

347
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,579
We can thank the specially administrated zone for that.

348
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,802
Owing to Euphemia, everything's
going to work out perfectly.

349
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,650
Sub-viceroy, where's Zero?

350
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,243
Those of you who call yourselves Japanese,

351
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,852
I have a favor to ask!

352
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,416
Could you all die, please?

353
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,858
Huh?! What did she just say?

354
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,146
What the hell?!

355
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,297
Suzaku!

356
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:19,050
He's only unconscious. But why?!

357
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:20,775
Umm...

358
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,673
I was hoping you'd all just commit suicide,

359
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,211
but you can't, can you?

360
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:28,244
Okay, soldiers, please kill the Japanese!

361
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,348
Kill them all!

362
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,790
Ah! The woman's mad!

363
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,877
Cut the mics and cameras now!

364
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,116
Euphy, no!

365
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:34,947
Halt!

366
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,029
Out of my way!

367
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,810
Terrorist!

368
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:38,335
Stand aside!

369
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:50,062
Go on, soldiers, do your duty! Hurry up!

370
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,295
Princess Euphemia!

371
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,889
What on earth's come over you?!

372
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,595
Please stop this at once, Your Highness!

373
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,662
This is...

374
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:58,261
General!

375
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,059
Forgive me, General,
but I mustn't let anyone stand in my way.

376
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,084
I have to kill all the Japanese.

377
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,758
Now Britannians, kill the Japanese!

378
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,965
Kill the Elevens! All troops, exterminate the Elevens!

379
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,949
Don't let any escape! Kill 'em all!

380
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,620
Stop! What are you doing?!

381
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,561
All forces, this is Suzaku Kururugi,

382
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,374
Knight of Honor of Britannia! Cease fire at once!

383
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,369
We've been ordered to kill all the Japanese here.

384
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,769
Princess Euphemia issued the command herself.

385
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:31,647
What?! Princess Euphemia did?!

386
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:33,173
No, that's absurd!

387
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,100
You're Japanese, aren't you?

388
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,296
What's going on?!

389
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,576
What happened in there?!

390
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:40,705
It can't be.

391
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:41,780
What does the TV say?

392
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:42,798
They cut the feed!

393
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,196
Euphy, stop!

394
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,555
This thing...

395
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,057
My Geass did this?!

396
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:54,149
Z-Zero... Please help us...

397
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,860
You must help.

398
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:58,049
You're Japan's savior...

399
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,449
Stop it...

400
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,660
Don't call me your savior.

401
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,711
Because I'm not the messiah of Japan!

402
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:07,725
Zero, you're... You're our only hope...

403
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,100
Stop it.

404
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,381
Don't... Don't force me...

405
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,320
Must I atone for this sin?

406
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,788
Is this a cross I have to bear, too?!

407
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,623
Zero! You son of a bitch!

408
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,319
What did you do to Princess Euphemia?! Tell me!

409
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:26,154
Andreas Darlton...

410
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,761
...the closest of Cornelia's inner circle advisors.

411
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,209
Tamaki, what's happening inside the stadium?!

412
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,651
We're trying to figure that out!

413
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,058
We're getting a feed from the stadium now.

414
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:37,282
It appears...

415
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:38,550
Why can't you cut it off?!

416
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,841
We're not transmitting this, it's someone else.

417
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:43,678
Stop it! It's going out live to the entire world!

418
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:46,560
They will cut off the broadcast at any minute now.

419
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,309
Let's upload the data to the net.

420
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,170
You heard him.

421
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:49,884
Right.

422
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:53,219
Sir! C.C. has made contact with the supreme commander!

423
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:55,767
Perfect! That clears up our last problem, then.

424
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:59,126
I have no idea how you arranged the situation,

425
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:02,452
but your scheme has gone well beyond what I had expected.

426
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:08,819
I'm shocked. I didn't think you'd go this far.

427
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,081
It wasn't me.

428
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:10,814
What?!

429
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,462
This time, I didn't use the power.

430
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:16,582
Or I should say, I didn't mean to use my Geass.

431
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:17,761
I see...

432
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:19,751
Then what I felt earlier was...

433
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:22,282
I knew there were risks when we made our contract.

434
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:25,073
You told me how dangerous this power could be.

435
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,275
Nonetheless...!

436
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,860
Yes! You're worthy of being called my child now!

437
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,497
What madness is this?!

438
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,068
Princess Cornelia, wait!

439
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:43,452
Don't follow me unless you wanna come along!

440
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:44,865
Euphy!

441
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,130
Have you located her yet? Where is she?!

442
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:48,997
I don't know!

443
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:51,935
We haven't been able to contact General Darlton, either!

444
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,148
Something's dreadfully wrong.

445
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:56,158
Euphemia would never do such a thing.

446
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:57,854
I wish there was room to negotiate here,

447
00:20:57,879 --> 00:20:59,963
but we can't be connected to Kirihara now!

448
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,423
Mm. We need to save ourselves first.

449
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:04,714
Yes, and the "souvenir," is it ready?

450
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,612
How pathetic.

451
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:06,310
Hm?

452
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,054
Your survival is all that counts in all of this?

453
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,634
My Lady, you really shouldn't speak like that.

454
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,279
We need to survive for the sake of Japan as well.

455
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:16,471
But then what's the point if we're all that's left?

456
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:17,813
Watch your tongue, Kaguya!

457
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,393
You're just a girl with family rank!

458
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:22,261
What purpose is having Kyoto if we don't act now?!

459
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,179
I can't believe Euphy would order
the slaughter of all those innocent people!

460
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,926
I've got to find her, no matter what!

461
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:30,097
Huh?

462
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:36,241
Hey! The Britannian forces
have begun moving out of the stadium!

463
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,146
Right.

464
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,160
In this case, our only option is
to exploit Euphemia to the utmost.

465
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,533
It's the... least we can do...

466
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,411
Attention, Zero!

467
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:49,665
Return that unit! It's property of our military... Ah!

468
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:53,120
This is my order to all Black Knights!

469
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,049
Euphemia has become our enemy!

470
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:59,764
the Specially Administrated Zone of Japan
is a cowardly trap designed to lure us in!

471
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,468
All armored autonomous battle knight units,

472
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:05,243
advance on the ceremony grounds and wage an attack!

473
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:07,435
Wipe out all Britannian forces!

474
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,933
Save the Japanese! Hurry!

475
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:15,111
I have to! I must find Euphy!

476
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,001
Find her and kill her!

477
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,502
Who is the one responsible for creating this situation?

478
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,688
Who is the one to bear the sin for this grotesque tragedy?

479
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:59,062
Who is the one craving for this battle?

480
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:01,920
And who is the one who possesses the world?

481
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,560
Yes. I understand.

482
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:07,589
But, even so... Even so, I...!
