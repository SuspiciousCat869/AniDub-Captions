1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,373
The actions one takes are answered
by consequences waiting at their conclusion.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,722
There are no exceptions,

3
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:12,874
and even Lelouch's power cannot change this.

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:17,084
Despite his absolute ability to make anyone obey him,

5
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,861
there is no escaping the inevitable.

6
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,912
Lelouch has acted to avenge his mother's death,

7
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:28,535
and to create a world where his
younger sister, Nunnally, can find happiness.

8
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:33,012
Now, he is confronted by the results of his acts;

9
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:36,175
consequences he never imagined.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,263
And there are more to come.

11
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:42,527
If these unintended consequences
help to create new worlds,

12
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:45,800
who will bear the blame for the sins that are committed?

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,979
Who will take the punishment?

14
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,086
And who will measure it out?

15
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,747
He was a pious soul,

16
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,676
who always looked to God in his life.

17
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,208
And a friend to us all.

18
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,116
To his wife, he was a devoted husband.

19
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,387
To his child, a loving father.

20
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:43,658
Father...

21
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:48,212
May he rest in peace, forever
cradled in the bosom of our lord.

22
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:55,370
No! Stop!

23
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't bury him again, please!

24
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:01,168
He's suffered enough! Oh god, don't leave me...

25
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:02,881
Mom, he's gone already.

26
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,689
Please, Mom.

27
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,264
Guess what, Papa!

28
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,058
Some day, when I grow up, I'm gonna be your wife!

29
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:18,762
Oh, that's very sweet of you, honey.

30
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:21,195
But your teacher told you, didn't she?

31
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,906
Huh?

32
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:24,787
Someday, you'll meet the man you really love.

33
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,399
More than I do you?

34
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,204
Hm... It's hard to explain.

35
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:33,426
Well, if you truly love that person,

36
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,004
and he cares for you just as much...

37
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,743
It would make me the happiest father on earth.

38
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,991
Shirley, I'm so sorry this happened...

39
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,039
Oh, stop. What've you to apologize for?

40
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,387
We feel awful!

41
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,214
Huh?

42
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,418
It's just that...

43
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,004
When we were all watching the hoteljacking on TV...

44
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:58,208
I thought the Black Knights were, ya know, heroes.

45
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,733
I mean, the news was handling it all wrong!

46
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:04,385
Anyway, I was posting online
how I thought what happened in Narita

47
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,437
was kinda cool and I'm... Forgive me!

48
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,524
Come on, don't be silly.

49
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,220
That has absoloutely nothing to do with this at all.

50
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,308
I mean even I was saying Narita wa...

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,437
Shirley, stop.

52
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,299
Seriously, I'm starting to worry about you here.

53
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,615
Have you cried yet?

54
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,420
If you simply hold it in, it's only
gonna be harder for you later on.

55
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,433
You don't have to worry.

56
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:27,666
Really, I'm fine.

57
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:29,937
I've cried a lot...

58
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:32,535
Cowards!

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,274
Huh?

60
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,838
Zero and his people,

61
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,821
their methods are just cowardly!

62
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,929
He doesn't even get his hands dirty.

63
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:41,764
He stirs people into a frenzy, tips the world into chaos,

64
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,333
and then sits back and congratulates himself!

65
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:46,272
It's not going to change a thing!

66
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,112
Anything gained through
his kind of tactics is just meaningless!

67
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:50,974
Huh?

68
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:55,845
Well, anyway, I think it's time we headed back, everyone.

69
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,241
Shirley, we'll be waiting for you.

70
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,212
Back in the old student council room.

71
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,393
Same as ever.

72
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,712
C'mon, guys, let's go.

73
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,235
Hey, uh, Lelouch...

74
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,862
What? Wha'd I do?

75
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,308
Lulu... Forgive me.

76
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:40,991
What?

77
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:45,326
It wasn't fair, kissing you like that.

78
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,066
It wasn't fair of me at all.

79
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,604
It was just... something I did...

80
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,554
Forget about it, okay?

81
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:54,051
I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that.

82
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,843
I'm sorry. It was totally stupid of me.

83
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:03,356
I mean, you finally kissed me, and I can't even be happy!

84
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,314
Wait, I...! Shirley!

85
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:27,190
Do you regret it?

86
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:29,777
That your friend's father was caught up in all this?

87
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:36,233
You were just accusing Kirihara of being too soft.

88
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,754
What happened to the path of blood?

89
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:39,817
Shut up.

90
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,770
But it turns out you're the soft one.

91
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,052
Did you think these was all just a game?

92
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:48,131
You've already killed your fair share of people.

93
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:51,498
By hand. Or words, more often than not.

94
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,359
Just shut up.

95
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,686
All of them left behind a family.

96
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,707
All had lovers and friends.

97
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:01,024
Are you really telling me you hadn't grasped that yet?

98
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:03,148
I would've thought you to be better prepared.

99
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,427
Just shut up! I am prepared!

100
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,854
I have been from the moment I killed Clovis!

101
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,721
Then why this hesitation?

102
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,904
Has she shaken you so badly?

103
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,163
One kiss and you go to pieces then, huh?

104
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:17,517
Hm. So, for all your preening and posturing,

105
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,417
you're really just a spoiled little boy

106
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,896
with a swollen head and a big fat mouth.

107
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:25,554
You're in way too deep to be turning back now.

108
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,621
You've past the point of no return.

109
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,095
You need a reason for living, don't you?

110
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,370
You're not going to disappoint me, are you?

111
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,045
Yes!

112
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:56,064
That is why people discriminate against one another.

113
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,345
So is that the reason why you killed my brother?!

114
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:02,203
And any ends gained through
contemptible means aren't worth anything.

115
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:03,939
Are you really going through with this?

116
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:05,423
That's easy enough to say, isn't it?!

117
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:07,364
You can't! We may have different mothers,

118
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,070
but you and I are still blood!

119
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,281
It's nothing but self-satisfying gratification!

120
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,139
And to have this utopia you'd...

121
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,177
I wish the world was a gentler place.

122
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:20,768
You appear to have a reason for living

123
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,239
And I've come back to change everything.

124
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:26,143
Are you embarking on the path of blood?

125
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,804
Ohgi... It's me. Zero.

126
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,451
Data logger S-4, contact.

127
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:06,418
Protocol established.

128
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,289
I have some bad news, Suzaku!

129
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,743
We just got word from Cornelia's Royal Guard!

130
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:15,124
We're on deck for the next operation!

131
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:15,482
Huh?

132
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,191
Are they acknowledging your skill,

133
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:18,812
or do they need another decoy?

134
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:19,968
Oh, Lloyd?

135
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:20,701
Huh?

136
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:23,212
Care for a lesson in proper social etiquette?

137
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,185
You look like you have some time to kill.

138
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,918
I'll have to take a pass on that.

139
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,979
Now then, I believe we were talking about your mission...

140
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,170
W-Wait a second, Zero!

141
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,512
I realize this is a request from Kyoto.

142
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,935
I think we could definitely handle it.

143
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,546
And, I'm pretty sure the Japan Liberation Front

144
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,785
would rather join with us than
flee to foreign soil and all, but...

145
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,164
You're the one who brought us this information...

146
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,554
Diethard, wasn't it?

147
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:49,596
That's right.

148
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,029
It is an honor that you'd meet me like this, Zero.

149
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:54,310
So, Princess Cornelia is going to deploy

150
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:58,099
the Royal Marines on Gen. Katase
of the Japan Liberation Front.

151
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,537
Is that correct?

152
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:03,749
Yes, the Network is already poised
to broadcast a special report on it.

153
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:07,114
Lt. Col. Toudou will never make it to Katase in time.

154
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,462
Which means the Japan Liberation Front
has no military strength right now.

155
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:15,265
Their only chance of escape is
the liquid Sakuradite they're carrying.

156
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,783
Which is why we should help General Katase
escape instead of going after Cornelia!

157
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:22,314
Ohgi! Who are we?

158
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:25,506
W-We're the Black Knights, Zero...

159
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:27,514
Then we have but one task!

160
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:31,399
We will destroy Cornelia's troops, and in doing so,

161
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,716
rescue the remnants of the JLF.

162
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:37,995
Tonight, we regain what was lost to us at Narita!

163
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,535
What're our chances?

164
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,139
Need you ask?

165
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,954
Understood.

166
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,918
Hm.

167
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,213
Begin preparations.

168
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,701
You all have your orders to carry out.

169
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,333
Uh...! Zero!

170
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,246
I have something to attend to.

171
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,451
Whatever it is, save it for later.

172
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:58,803
Just so you know...

173
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:02,333
The viceroy has her reservations about using Numbers.

174
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,983
But use every able body, I always say.

175
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,251
Even if it's the son of the former prime minister.

176
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,704
Our target is Katase.

177
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:14,149
Take him out and the Japan Liberation Front is finished.

178
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,376
We're sending in the Royal Marines.

179
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:21,291
Your job'll be to provide supporting fire
from the shore until the marines have Katase...

180
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:24,435
...as well as annihilating any stragglers left over.

181
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,310
I'm to annihilate them, sir?

182
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,776
Nobody but the target is to survive, is that clear?

183
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:35,929
Warrant Officer Kururugi, show your loyalty to the crown.

184
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,697
This your chance to get ahead in the world, soldier.

185
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:41,635
Understood... my lord.

186
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,941
Onward, Christian soldiers. Conflicting morals, right?

187
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:07,821
No, Lulu...

188
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,552
It can't be true...

189
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,623
He would never get tangled up with someone like that...

190
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:20,202
There is a possibility that this boy
is linked to the Black Knights.

191
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:22,008
What're you saying... he's involved?

192
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:22,991
In terrorism.

193
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,548
I don't belive you!

194
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,885
He can't be... It has to be a lie.

195
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:34,438
Lulu...

196
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:38,019
I'm so sorry to be doubting you like this... But...

197
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,621
Please, I wanna believe in you!

198
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,810
Dammit, she lost him.

199
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,921
If she had just called me sooner, I could've had him!

200
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,981
I should've grabbed him when I had the chance.

201
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,915
No, I need proof.

202
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,238
If he talks to her, I can
learn what his role is in all this.

203
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:02,944
Which is all the more important
if he can manipulate memory somehow.

204
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:08,596
I won't have to die, stripped of
my position and honor, like Jeremiah.

205
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,502
Hell, this is my chance to move back up again.

206
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,045
So, I have to find a link to Zero...

207
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,746
It has to be me!

208
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,600
Who's there?!

209
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,829
Ah! I-I'm sorry! I'll go...

210
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,083
Second thoughts?

211
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:29,348
I thought the goal was justice.

212
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,704
The only reason I've fought until now

213
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,141
is because I thought it was the right thing to do.

214
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:38,009
So I could live with the killing. But now...

215
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:39,941
Tell me is this real?!

216
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:43,789
Is what we're all doing here really
going to change the world for the better?!

217
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:44,962
Yes, it will.

218
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:47,074
Or rather, it must change the world.

219
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:47,837
But...!

220
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,509
Will there be sacrifices?

221
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:52,624
Not only just soldiers, but the innocent as well.

222
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:58,226
And yet, because of all these things,
we've no choice but to continue on...

223
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,062
...no matter the cost.

224
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,462
Even if people see us as cowards...

225
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,272
We have to prevail!

226
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:07,670
If that means more blood will be shed, so be it.

227
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,007
We've spilled so much to get here,

228
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,522
we can't let it be in vain...

229
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,926
But I won't force you, Kallen.

230
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:18,170
If you wish to turn back, now is the time.

231
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:30,813
I've made my choice. I'll follow you to the very end.

232
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,082
I'm grateful, Kallen.

233
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:42,936
Yes. You saved me today.

234
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:44,598
Thank you.

235
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:48,213
C.C., I need you. I do.

236
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,096
What am I doing?

237
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,721
I just can't afford to make the
same mistake here all over again here.

238
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,101
It's time.

239
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,048
Commence with the operation!

240
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,001
All underwater units, hit the water!

241
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,698
Dive, dive, dive!

242
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:14,322
Supression Team, you are cleared for cartegory C weaponry.

243
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,617
Our unit'll be covering them from the shore.

244
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,379
Careful though,

245
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:19,005
we want that tanker in one piece.

246
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,478
Understood, my lord.

247
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,561
Once torpedo attack is confirmed,

248
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:26,490
all units go to weapons free. Repeat. Weapons free.

249
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,204
Oh my god! Terrorists?!

250
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,877
It looks like it's starting.

251
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:45,871
Zero...

252
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:47,637
You wanna move out or what?

253
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,220
Hey! Do you read me?

254
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,627
They're closing in on the JLF! Come in!

255
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,618
We have to hold.

256
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:53,256
Huh?

257
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,525
Cornelia moved faster than expected.

258
00:15:55,557 --> 00:15:57,943
If we go now, we'll die along with them.

259
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,510
Commence support fire.

260
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,191
All units restricted to micro round ordinance only.

261
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:04,760
Be careful not to set off that liquid Sakuradite!

262
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,595
Damn those Britannians!

263
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,346
When the hell did they get here?!

264
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,877
Enemy units! They're coming from the water!

265
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,077
Itagaki!

266
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,553
Two-oh-two! Five-oh-three!

267
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:18,216
Focus fire at nine o'clock!

268
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:21,062
This isn't battle. This is wholesale slaughter!

269
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:22,235
Officer Kururugi.

270
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,014
Go ahead.

271
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,818
I certainly know this must be hard for you,

272
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:26,775
but you're a soldier, remember that.

273
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,329
Right. I understand.

274
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:33,696
How could they have found us?! Where's Tohdoh?!

275
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:36,048
We can't locate him! Or the Holy Swords!

276
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:37,600
What about Kyoto?!

277
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,083
They said they would send help!

278
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,954
Yes, sir, but we have no way of contacting them now!

279
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,662
So they're just gonna sit back and watch us die here?!

280
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,562
We surrender! Please, cease fire!

281
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,129
This is the Japan Liberation Front!

282
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:52,185
I reapeat! We surrender!

283
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,858
Sir, they're issuing a surrender over an open channel!

284
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:56,566
Ignore it.

285
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:57,754
Yes, but, sir!

286
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,100
You see?

287
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,466
They were just buying time. Now, carry out your orders.

288
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:09,218
Lulu just couldn't be a member
of the Black Knights, could he?

289
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:11,945
Ugh! Dammit! It'll be too late soon!

290
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,662
When does Zero plan to move?!

291
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:18,037
I just hope that he isn't just doing all this
to honor some childish notion of justice.

292
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,527
The Knightmares are boarding the ship!

293
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:23,738
I see.

294
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,048
That leaves only one way out.

295
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,831
They have to be careful around that precious Sakuradite.

296
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:34,206
Zero! If we don't hurry...

297
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,541
Very well then. Go ahead...

298
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:43,439
What the hell is going on?!

299
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,185
I can't believe this idiocy!

300
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,627
They blew up the liquid Sakuradite?!

301
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,343
Just what you'd expect of the JLF.

302
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,914
Choosing to take the Britanians out with them!

303
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:05,141
Suicide? But they never mentioned...!

304
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,343
We're going to rush Cornelia's position head on!

305
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,288
Forget about everything else!

306
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,728
All that matters is achieving our goal!

307
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:16,587
If you want to avenge the JLF, then capture Cornelia

308
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,362
and show them our strength and determination!

309
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,941
Right!

310
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,264
This is like Narita all over again!

311
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,581
It's outstanding!

312
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,056
Hey! Get back here!

313
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,706
The JLF was just bait!

314
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,523
Their command is wide open now.

315
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:32,481
Heh. One of the oldest tricks in the book...

316
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,704
Where're you going?! Hey!

317
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:37,945
It makes perfect sense!

318
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,052
He wanted to cripple his enemy's defenses,

319
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,116
using the Liberation Front as a living trap!

320
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,289
He's excellent material, this Zero.

321
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,070
He's chaos incarnate!

322
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:50,866
More, show me more of your genius!

323
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:53,295
Let your ego engulf the world!

324
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,631
E-Enemy attack?!

325
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,746
Two-zero-four, signal lost!

326
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,663
Erickson, form up with three-zero-eight!

327
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:09,794
Provide support!

328
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,652
All units, status report!

329
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:13,660
I repeat, what is your status?!

330
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,769
Why would the general kill himself?

331
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:17,683
It doesn't make any sense...

332
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:20,294
The main force...!

333
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,321
Could they have used the tanker as a decoy?!

334
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:25,330
Mount up now and form a defensive line, on the double!

335
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:26,854
How did they know we were here?!

336
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:27,844
Your Highness!

337
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,848
Knock their Knightmares into
the sea before the pilots can mount!

338
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,288
Guren Mark-Two, you're with me!

339
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:36,552
Yes, sir!

340
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,108
Your Highness! We can handle this!

341
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:44,692
Quiet!

342
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,731
How many times do you think I'll allow them to mock me?!

343
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,771
I haven't even powered on!

344
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,365
Do you think you can best me in Knightmare combat?!

345
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,673
That new model again?!

346
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:06,420
I'll smash your hatch and drag you out...

347
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,788
Cornelia!

348
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:15,300
Shirley?!

349
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:23,004
Zero!

350
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:25,602
Your methods are not going to change anything!

351
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,320
You're focused on goals,

352
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,833
and don't understand the pain of others!

353
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:32,108
Zero!

354
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:35,104
This is payback for Narita!

355
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,742
Well, if it isn't the knight in shining armor!

356
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,923
These are people's lives you're playing with!

357
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,140
You're nothing but a murderer!

358
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:50,788
Why?!

359
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,092
Why do you keep getting in my way?!

360
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:56,592
Why do you keep spilling people's blood without meaning?!

361
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,192
If it wasn't for you...!

362
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,323
Because of you...!

363
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:21,643
Zero... This is the end result.

364
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,198
Lancelot, behind you!

365
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,780
Get the hell away from him!

366
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:55,219
Is this Zero's?

367
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:59,379
So... then, with this...

368
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:07,733
I'll repay you... for my father!

369
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,491
The best laid plans often fall apart.

370
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,843
Doubts can arise at any time.

371
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,004
My heart grows heavier, little by little...

372
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:00,363
Is this the foundation for the future?

373
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:02,910
Or merely stumbling blocks from the past?

374
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,135
The answers that I seek...

375
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:06,685
...lie within me.
