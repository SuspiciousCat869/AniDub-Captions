1
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,445
The Japan Liberation Front:

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,183
The largest insurgent group in Area 11.

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:10,655
Viceroy Cornelia was determined to crush them.

4
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:13,062
She encircled the Narita mountains

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:16,628
where her proud Britannian
legions applied overwhelming force,

6
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:19,304
sure their "inferior enemy" was vanquished.

7
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:21,751
Then, the Black Knights made their move.

8
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:24,835
Using the Guren Mk-II's radiant wave surger,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,499
they caused the water veins of
the summit to explode at once.

10
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:30,262
The mountain collapsed.

11
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:36,324
Both the Japan Liberation Front and the main
Britannian forces were engulfed in mud and rushing water.

12
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:40,520
Cornelia was isolated; Most of her forces lost.

13
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:43,272
Seeking an unprecedented reversal,

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,807
Zero commanded the Black Knights to hunt down Cornelia.

15
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,694
In their hearts, everyone has faith in
their own existence and ultimate triumph.

16
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:59,637
However, when time and destiny unfold,

17
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,767
this faith turns out to be quite fleeting and pointless.

18
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,021
What are our losses?!

19
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:43,546
I've only got signal from 20 percent of our forces.

20
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,521
20 percent?!

21
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:47,131
Our command structure can't sustain this!

22
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:48,804
This is the Marceau unit!

23
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,352
I can't raise General Alex!

24
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:52,747
It looks like the second division's been wiped out!

25
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,420
Lloyd, what's going on?

26
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,700
Hmm... It's very unnatural.

27
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:57,708
Unnatural?

28
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,063
There seems to be an unconfirmed report

29
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:01,904
that the Black Knights have appeared.

30
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:02,584
Zero!

31
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:03,923
Congratulations!

32
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,276
This is our chance.

33
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,185
Lloyd!

34
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,293
You're so rash.

35
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,787
Huh? Why's that?

36
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,943
Would you like a detailed explanation?

37
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,969
Uh, no, I'll pass.

38
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:16,327
Anyway, while the High Command's still gathering data,

39
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,214
all we can do is play it by ear, right?

40
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,227
Is the Viceroy safe?

41
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,952
Yes, she was outside the mud flow.

42
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,748
But the units guarding her flank are lost.

43
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:26,537
That means she's totally isolated.

44
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,053
What the hell are those Purebloods doing?!

45
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,496
Come on, move!

46
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:41,229
I can't lose to Elevens! I am a Brittanian!

47
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,313
Lord Kewell!

48
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,727
All right! Guren MK-II, move to the planned point!

49
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:48,581
We'll break through the last
of their line and take Cornelia!

50
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:48,962
Right!

51
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,780
Got it! Let's pull this off!

52
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,275
Fight to the death!

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,388
Sugiyama! You okay?!

54
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:58,908
Y-Yeah...

55
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,671
Get them!

56
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:06,713
That's right, move swiftly.

57
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,350
If you survive this battle, you
can call yourself a true warrior.

58
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:11,704
And afterward...

59
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:14,004
The Purebloods are holding their ground?

60
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:15,918
Yes, sir! Under Lady Viletta's command!

61
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:19,001
Then use the moment for the
Viceroy to retreat! Send air cover!

62
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:20,518
No, wait!

63
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,130
Something's approaching the Viceroy from behind!

64
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,487
All units, are you ready?

65
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:26,452
Yes, sir!

66
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,748
All right. Deploy the custom Burais.

67
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:29,826
Deploying!

68
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,964
Listen carefully!

69
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,825
If this landslide was manmade,

70
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,223
it should allow us to hit Cornelia from behind.

71
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:38,204
Capture Cornelia now!

72
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,812
Take revenge for what happened seven years ago!

73
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:41,637
Yes, sir!

74
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,094
By the honor of the Four Holy Swords!

75
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,116
What?!

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,997
Protect Her Highness!

77
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:52,662
Surround them!

78
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,166
The Japan Liberation Front?!

79
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,112
Slash and encircle!

80
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:57,807
Right!

81
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,216
These are not just any Burais.

82
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:04,293
This reminds me of seven years ago.

83
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,860
But it's different now.

84
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,285
This time we have Knightmares as well!

85
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:09,943
Your Highness, leave them to us!

86
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:11,819
Please, you have to withdraw for now!

87
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:16,091
Very well, I know a way to turn this around.

88
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:16,614
Guilford!

89
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,253
Yes!

90
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,502
After you've driven them back, meet me over at point nine!

91
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,305
Nine?

92
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:22,904
I understand!

93
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,167
Cornelia!

94
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,334
You weaklings!

95
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,044
All right! Keep this up and crush Zero!

96
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,306
Maybe we should get Kallen over here.

97
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:35,873
No!

98
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,222
If we break formation now, our plan is ruined!

99
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,483
This is turning grim.

100
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:43,662
If it goes on, we'll be fighting her royal guard next.

101
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:46,371
Zero! Cornelia's under attack down below!

102
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,304
What's that? Which team made the move?

103
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:50,740
It's not our people! Looks like the JLF!

104
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,191
Someone else understands my intent?

105
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,334
How excellent.

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,361
They'll hold off the royal
guard, which is just what we need.

107
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,171
I'm sorry for the late arrival, General!

108
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:02,028
Tohdoh! We've been waiting!

109
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:05,552
General, please send all remaining units to join me here.

110
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:07,029
Can you beat them?

111
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,655
Yes, but only if we can hold off their main force!

112
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:12,409
We have a chance now to turn the entire war around!

113
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:16,271
I've heard Area 11 has a formidable commander.

114
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,557
Their "shining knight."

115
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,764
Is this him? Tohdoh?!

116
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,615
Fine! Let him try me!

117
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,710
Urgh! At a time like this?!

118
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:27,440
What do we do?

119
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,280
Fall back!

120
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,100
We have to find a way to link up with Viceroy Cornelia.

121
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,993
But sir, their main base is right in front of us!

122
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,491
And if we're hit from behind, we'll be wiped out!

123
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:37,443
You fool!

124
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:39,675
If Princess Cornelia's taken by these Elevens,

125
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,410
this entire battle is lost!

126
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,806
Y-Yes sir!

127
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,270
Sub-Viceroy Euphemia,

128
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,370
you must act now to prevent a disaster.

129
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,498
Send in the G1!

130
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:48,993
No!

131
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,310
But Commander Guilford is completely
pinned down; He can't get to Cornelia.

132
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:53,727
Her life is at stake here!

133
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:54,918
We can't!

134
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:58,109
There's a field hospital right here! And civilians!

135
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,729
They've been evacuated from all over the area

136
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,354
and brought to this point!

137
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,943
Besides, the G1 base is our command center!

138
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,696
The Viceroy ordered me not to move it, no matter what!

139
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,684
That's why... I just can't...!

140
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:15,125
Well, hello there, the ASEEC's crew reporting for duty.

141
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,071
Insolence!

142
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,137
You're irregulars!

143
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,959
Your orders are to keep silent and observe!

144
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:21,645
Um, yes sir, normally we would, but...

145
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,708
But all of this waiting around is boring.

146
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,636
Sub-Viceroy Euphemia...

147
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,516
I beseech you, please order us into the battle!

148
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,814
How transparent!

149
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,165
You just want the glory of rescuing the Viceroy!

150
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,752
Our whole army is out there!

151
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,881
You think one unit is going to change things?!

152
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:40,281
With an Eleven pilot!

153
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,847
Right, right, but what's the harm in trying?

154
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:47,002
Since it's just one unit, it won't
look bad for you if we lose, right?

155
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,093
Are you listening?

156
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,102
Euphie!

157
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,564
Yes, I understand. Please do it!

158
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,614
We got it!

159
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,093
Thank you very much!

160
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,054
Right! I won't fail!

161
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,826
Dammit! He's fierce!

162
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,093
Scatter!

163
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,764
Lt. Colonel! What about Cornelia?

164
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,962
If Zero's the man I think he is,
he's moving into position right now!

165
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,365
We've got to trust him.

166
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,989
What? Zero's on the move?!

167
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:15,754
Right.

168
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,100
We'll keep going and come over and back you up!

169
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,987
Never mind that now, just track Zero!

170
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,637
Y-Yes, sir!

171
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,496
This is his projected course.

172
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,679
The Princess was trying to trap Tohdoh;

173
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,458
Now there's a Knightmare waiting for her!

174
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,655
Princess Cornelia!

175
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,554
I got the message, Guilford.

176
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:42,174
Advanced weapon system Z-01 Lancelot,

177
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:47,539
utilize sand panels to climb liquefied slope
at max combat speed and rescue the Viceroy!

178
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:48,959
Yes, my lord.

179
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,602
Suzaku, there's one thing I want to ask you.

180
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:54,301
What's that?

181
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,773
More than anything, you hate when people die,

182
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,414
yet, you're in the military. Why is that?

183
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,006
I'm in the military to stop people from dying.

184
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:06,187
And that self-contradiction will get you killed someday!

185
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,460
Ugh! Sorry about that!

186
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,121
Lancelot, now launching.

187
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,763
Cornelia!

188
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,755
Lowborn scum!

189
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,070
What's this?!

190
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:26,172
That's not just a customized unit!

191
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:32,197
Can you hear me, Cornelia?

192
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,279
This is checkmate.

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,365
Zero!

194
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,327
Yes. Should we celebrate our reunion?

195
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,992
Of course, you'll have to surrender to us first.

196
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:44,607
And after that, there are a few questions I wanna ask you.

197
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:49,310
And in case you're wondering, your
reinforcements won't get here in time.

198
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,144
I win, Cornelia.

199
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,270
You're a fool, Zero!

200
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,594
This one!

201
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:58,402
If I take this one out, I'm free and clear!

202
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,969
You've got some moves!

203
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,148
Coward! Attacking from behind!

204
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,109
Really?

205
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:21,513
And your own attack methods don't show acts of cowardice?

206
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:27,694
They launched a pincer assault before we could regroup!

207
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,127
I'll never be able to reach the Princess now!

208
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,636
Lt. Colonel, we've crushed the enemy reinforcements!

209
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:39,306
Right!

210
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:42,085
Switch to spinning life-or-death formation!

211
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,985
Yes, sir!

212
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:47,559
If this goes on, Princess Cornelia will be....

213
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,610
Guilford...

214
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:54,055
Guilford, my knight. You and Darlton protect Euphie.

215
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,208
Your Highness!

216
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,207
I won't surrender.

217
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:04,019
As an imperial princess, I'll fight to the last!

218
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,018
Princess Cornelia!

219
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,884
Huh. She's so predictable.

220
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:18,686
Oh my.

221
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,527
As reckless as ever, eh?

222
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,866
He's used the V.A.R.I.S. to
clear the obstacles in his path.

223
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:29,357
Viceroy, are you all right?

224
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:30,813
I came to help, Your Highness!

225
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:33,217
Special Corps? Who authorized you?

226
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:36,607
He can get her out of there if it's the Lancelot unit.

227
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,298
Hey, isn't that Knightmare...

228
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:41,481
Yeah. The one from Shinjuku and Lake Kawaguchi.

229
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,740
Again?! It's him again?!

230
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,934
MK-II, destroy that unit immediately!

231
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,741
It's interfered with us enough!

232
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:52,491
Right!

233
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:03,103
You handle that thing! I'll take out Zero!

234
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,555
Now you'll pay for Shinjuku!

235
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:12,891
It's as fast as the Lancelot?!

236
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,703
If I can take it down...

237
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,492
Is that all you've got?!

238
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,808
Blocked!

239
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,351
Hey! Are you okay?!

240
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:51,464
I am...

241
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:52,471
Ohgi!

242
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:52,913
Yes.

243
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,225
How's the Guren MK-II?!

244
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,237
The right hand's wrecked. We've gotta fix it.

245
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,904
Retreat!

246
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,448
All Black Knights, move to your escape points!

247
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,012
This has become a war of attrition. Retreat!

248
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,705
Viceroy!

249
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,187
Go after Zero!

250
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:11,669
But...

251
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,996
My energy filler's just drained!

252
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:14,675
Go!

253
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,449
Right!

254
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,694
Ugh, I'm hating this retreat thing.

255
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,456
We thrashed 'em, but if we keep pushing...

256
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:27,452
Face it, we left the JLF there as bait while we ran away.

257
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:29,767
I hate when you say it like that, but...

258
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:34,107
Yeah, but people aren't just pieces in a chess game.

259
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,637
Zero wouldn't think like that.

260
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:40,321
If he did, he'd end up using us as pawns, too.

261
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,242
I don't believe he'd do that.

262
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,307
His rage is real.

263
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,881
He hates Britannia as much as we do.

264
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:52,046
And I think a person who knows rage also knows sorrow.

265
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,042
Special corps head trailer.

266
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,684
Found Zero. Going in for capture.

267
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,971
Zero, I owe you; I know that.

268
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,796
You've saved a lot of people.

269
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,287
I know there are lots of Elevens
supporting you from the shadows.

270
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,100
However, your methods are...

271
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,590
...very wrong.

272
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:30,729
Th-That's...

273
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,925
Is it the girl from the capsule in Shinjuku?!

274
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,600
Stop now!

275
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,614
Don't even think about hurting him!

276
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,555
C.C...

277
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,647
She's working with Zero?

278
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,918
Wait! What are you doing?

279
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,390
You're challenging a Knightmare?!

280
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,223
It's a problem if you die.

281
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:53,355
It'll be indirect contact, but it's worth a try.

282
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,284
Father... You're dead!

283
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:15,870
That's impossible!

284
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,688
No! I didn't mean to!

285
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,349
No, I... I just...!

286
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:32,117
Hey! Are you using Geass on him?

287
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,756
I'm just feeding him some shock images.

288
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,857
I can't tell what he's seeing though.

289
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,314
Anyway, you've got time to get away now.

290
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,723
What about you?

291
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,291
I can't move yet.

292
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,239
You go first!

293
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:44,385
Don't be foolish.

294
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,290
I can't keep owing you favors...

295
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,460
No, not now!

296
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,763
What? This is different.

297
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:12,036
That's...

298
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,366
S-Stop it!

299
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:17,336
Stay... out... of my mind!

300
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,596
Stop it!

301
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:21,460
Why now?!

302
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,187
You're... unveiling me...

303
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,716
I had to do it!

304
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:54,655
What's happening to him?!

305
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,089
Idiot! Get away now!

306
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,279
C.C.!

307
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,231
Hurry!

308
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,830
Damn you!

309
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:07,877
Don't follow!

310
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,371
I have no idea what Zero is trying to do now.

311
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,724
Our only course of action is to get
to the General and get him out of here.

312
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,606
Your Highness! I'll be right there!

313
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:19,500
Guilford, relay this message to all units:

314
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,138
Prepare to retreat.

315
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,692
There's no reason to waste
the lives of any more of my men.

316
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,543
Stay in formation and fall back cautiouslly.

317
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:34,059
We have to face facts. We've been defeated this time.

318
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:40,660
You see? Britannia sure had its hands full

319
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,742
just dealing with the Liberation Front!

320
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,518
Yeah.

321
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,550
That gave us the chance we needed to escape.

322
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:47,861
Hey, where's Zero?

323
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,452
I can't raise his Burai.

324
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,917
You don't think he's been captured, do you...?

325
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:58,887
This girl, she can't be human.

326
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:01,728
She recovers from wounds in ways that are beyond normal.

327
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,389
She was shot in the head in Shinjuku, and yet...

328
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:07,673
Clovis confined her for his private experiments,

329
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,677
so she's not connected with Britannia.

330
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:13,603
Her vital signs are at human levels.

331
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:16,799
I'd better analyze a blood sample
later and photograph the wounds.

332
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:22,284
What?

333
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,832
You finally called me... by my real name.

334
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,689
So Zero escaped again.

335
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,113
The Japan Liberation Front hammered our defenses

336
00:18:45,138 --> 00:18:46,954
and he slipped away in the confusion.

337
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:50,433
Despicable. Using someone else to cover his movements.

338
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,484
Oh, what about Kururugi?

339
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:53,877
He's safe now.

340
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:57,043
We had to wait till his energy
filler ran out to finally stop him.

341
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,466
Stop him from what?

342
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,388
Was there a problem with his unit?

343
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:04,207
Apparently. It was going berserk.

344
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:07,797
A failure unworthy of my older brother's forces.

345
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,153
I removed the shrapnel and cleaned the wound.

346
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,619
That wasn't necessary.

347
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:17,848
Apparently not.

348
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:20,696
So, there was no point in protecting me at all.

349
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,411
Your pride always gets in the
way at the most ridiculous moments.

350
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:28,611
But then I learned something from it.

351
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:29,817
Hmph.

352
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,825
That's your name, isn't it?

353
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,287
You have a bad habit of eavesdropping.

354
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,174
Well, it's a good name.

355
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,561
It's a lot more human than C.C...

356
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,194
Oh, that's a joke.

357
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:46,242
As if I want to be more human.

358
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:49,601
After all, I've... I...

359
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,689
I've forgotten everything.

360
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,963
Every single thing...

361
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,549
So what's the use of it?

362
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:01,112
A name? But why?

363
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,579
It's a good time to say this.

364
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:12,084
Yes... You saved me today.

365
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:17,108
You did that before and gave me Geass.

366
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:21,138
That's why... I'll only say this once...

367
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,639
Thank you.

368
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,842
No one's ever... thanked me before.

369
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,738
Well then, can you show your appreciation?

370
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:39,070
Say it again, like you did before.

371
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,050
Uh? Oh, you mean the name.

372
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:44,865
Just this once, with tenderness,

373
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,817
like you treasure it in your heart.

374
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,047
Very well then...

375
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:00,852
How was that?

376
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,329
It was bad. It was completely bad.

377
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:08,608
It wasn't tender. There was no honesty or sympathy in it.

378
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:11,581
You spoke it oddly. And worst of all, it was cold.

379
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,279
You're a picky girl.

380
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:16,628
Exactly. That's why I go by the name C.C.

381
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,480
Ugh. Another soldier.

382
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:31,241
No wonder our battalions fell apart!

383
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,244
I swear I'm not Orange.

384
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,328
ZERO!

385
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,412
Looks like our ride's here.

386
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:50,066
Zero! Are you okay?

387
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:51,595
The others went on ahead, and...

388
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,381
Who's that?!

389
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,283
Oh, you needn't worry.

390
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,702
She's a very important friend.

391
00:21:58,971 --> 00:21:59,637
Huh...?

392
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,574
C.C., I don't know why snow is white,

393
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:06,253
but I still think snow is beautiful.

394
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,573
I don't hate it.

395
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:12,650
I see.

396
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,588
Still not enough!

397
00:23:51,654 --> 00:23:54,196
I need something more to checkmate Cornelia.

398
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,321
And I have a feeling that what's missing is inside of me.

399
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,357
Something I have to face and overcome.

400
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:03,501
Then, I can lead the Black Knights to the next stage.

401
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:04,785
Yes.

402
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:07,613
And if necessary, I'll even...
