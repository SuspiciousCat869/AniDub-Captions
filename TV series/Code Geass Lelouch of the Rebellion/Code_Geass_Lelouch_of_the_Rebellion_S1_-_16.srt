1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:06,382
In this world, evil can arise from the best intentions.

2
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:10,305
And there is good, which can come from evil intentions.

3
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:13,836
How then should Lelouch's actions be taken?

4
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:17,297
Every man has his day of judgment, does he not?

5
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,084
Geass...

6
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:24,791
He who uses this inhuman
power will find his heart isolated,

7
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,334
whether he wants it that way or not.

8
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:32,026
Thus, he plummets into the abyss
that lies between good and evil.

9
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:36,488
But if a man can climb out of that abyss into the light,

10
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:40,364
then that man has the soul of a king.

11
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,895
Yes, that's right. The training for the
post-refit Guren MK-II is proceeding on schedule.

12
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:35,540
Kyoto and the Military District
of India have finally come to terms.

13
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,968
So, we're just waiting for
Rakshata and her team to arrive.

14
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:44,924
And the organization's changeover to
a cell-based structure is now 92% complete.

15
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:48,284
The members have also been ranked into 14 tiers.

16
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:52,084
As you directed, we've
infiltrated all Britannian warehouses.

17
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:58,789
Within the Kanto block, combat personnel
have been dispersed to 564 separate locations.

18
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,419
Thirty-two of our positions have been uncovered.

19
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,496
Eleven of those were dummies.

20
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,233
Fourty-seven members have been apprehended...

21
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:10,371
But since information is now
firewalled above class 8 members,

22
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,854
the Britannians aren't getting anything out of them.

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,280
And now that we have the
unreserved support of the Kyoto Group,

24
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:20,874
we're seeing almost no more cases
of citizens tipping off the authorities.

25
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,024
On that list of Britannian supporters...

26
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,405
Yes, it's the group you made arrangements with.

27
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:30,326
Oh! And we're still looking for
information about Tohdoh and the Four Holy Swords.

28
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,747
A176 to the Chinese Federation is now boarding.

29
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,660
Understood. Continue with the work, all right?

30
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,697
Are you sure you want me to be the messenger?

31
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,513
If you look humble they'll look down on you.

32
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,663
That's how it works in the Chinese Federation.

33
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,771
I don't know about that,

34
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,280
but unlike you, I do have some humility.

35
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,264
Good, now you can put it to use.

36
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,311
How's your passport?

37
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:50,461
Not a bad forgery.

38
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:51,653
I'm all set.

39
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,303
Where we going?

40
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,747
Are we getting moved to another place again?

41
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:06,064
It's one of the Kururugi's homes.

42
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,963
This time it's the main house, okay?

43
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,949
Keep on walking, Suzaku.

44
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:16,749
But...

45
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,476
Keep walking!

46
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:21,922
Where are we? It smells really bad here.

47
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,207
We're going by a garbage dump, right, Suzaku?

48
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,610
What's wrong, Suzaku?

49
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:40,172
I... I...

50
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,864
Nunnally...

51
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,030
My mother taught me that a warm touch is good for tears.

52
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,635
Do you think it's true?

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,582
I will overcome this.

54
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,778
Hey! Lelouch!

55
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,361
Hm?

56
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:09,162
What's up?

57
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:11,762
You know, they're going to hold you back
if you don't start coming to class.

58
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:14,203
I could say the same about you, right?

59
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,887
I have work to do.

60
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,876
It's just that the Black Knights
have really been on the move lately.

61
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,776
Hey, I thought you were in engineering.

62
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,860
Uh... We're shorthanded so they move me around.

63
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:24,807
Hm.

64
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:27,597
Still, how about dropping by for dinner more often?

65
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:28,789
Nunnally misses you.

66
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,253
Are you free this evening?

67
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,753
Yeah, I could come tonight, but are you sure it's okay?

68
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,528
I don't wanna cause any... Ah!

69
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,191
Hey! Lelouch!

70
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,247
What's wrong?

71
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,824
I heard the President's out
doing a blind date thing again!

72
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:41,932
Yeah. Today.

73
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,655
Today?! Why didn't you tell me about it?!

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,903
Because it'd make you cry.

75
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,178
Boys don't cry!

76
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:49,464
It's okay; I didn't know about it either.

77
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:51,572
Don't give me your emo routine!

78
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:52,499
Emo?

79
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:55,364
I guess compassion is not in fashion these days.

80
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,914
So anyways, are we on for dinner tonight with Nunnaly?

81
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,731
Sure!

82
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,616
What about school?!

83
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:00,641
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

84
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,299
I'm just gonna go tell her about it!

85
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:05,597
My life is over and he's worried about dinner.

86
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:08,601
Uh?

87
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:12,182
My classes don't start till second period, Sayoko.

88
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,472
Huh?

89
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,157
Heh.

90
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,497
Are you surprised?

91
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:19,078
Uh...

92
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:22,345
Matchmaking dates are usually in hotels or restaurants.

93
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,061
I suppose that's true.

94
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:27,296
But I'd heard you were a very unique person, Lord Asplund.

95
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,396
Unique! What a delightfully artful way to put it!

96
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:32,246
I'm surprised you're interested in a girl

97
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,604
from the downgraded Ashford family after it lost its rank.

98
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,204
Oh-ho! But I couldn't care less about loss of rank.

99
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:40,396
Excuse me.

100
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,753
I'm sorry to trouble you.

101
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,903
Not at all, take your time.

102
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:46,056
No need for that.

103
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:48,041
Why draw it out? Let's get married.

104
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,358
Huh? That's it?!

105
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,008
Getting cold feet?

106
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,910
Nunnally! Suzaku's gonna...

107
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:02,977
Yes?

108
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:04,078
Lelouch!

109
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:06,516
Nunnally! Where are you right now?!

110
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,293
I don't know... But I can't move!

111
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,074
Nunnally!

112
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,641
It's me, Lulu!

113
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:14,669
It can't be!

114
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,845
You dropped your guard, Lelouch.

115
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:18,728
Just 'cause you thought I was dead?

116
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:19,852
Mao, listen!

117
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,643
C.C. isn't here right now!

118
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,002
That's why I came.

119
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,080
Someone immune to my Geass would be troublesome now.

120
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,674
I'll save my encounter with her for a later date.

121
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,326
First, I'm going to pay you back

122
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,222
for that little session the other day.

123
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:34,622
You're somewhere within 500 meters of me.

124
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:35,606
Of course.

125
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,322
Want to try and find me?

126
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,755
Your time limit is 5 hours.

127
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,510
Oh, by the way, since the game is just between you and me,

128
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:46,077
no using the cops as pawns this time.

129
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,287
I don't really want to get shot up again.

130
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,920
Although Britannian medical science is amazing.

131
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,032
You can thank them for my return!

132
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:57,570
You know, Lulu, when you used your Geass on those cops,

133
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,924
you should have told them to kill me, not just shoot me.

134
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,807
You left off the finishing touch,

135
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,832
and now your sister's in a "bind."

136
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:08,274
What a quandary! What a quagmire! What a crunch!

137
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,257
Nunnally has nothing to do with this!

138
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:13,295
It's not a very nice way to play a game, you know.

139
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,382
Hmm?

140
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,797
If you do something to make my brother sad,

141
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,378
I'll never forgive you!

142
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,545
What a pair you are!

143
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,093
I love this brother sister thing!

144
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,801
Hi, everyone! It's lunch time! Are you all eating well?

145
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:31,064
A fight? Shirley and Lelouch?

146
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,224
Right, she's pretending she doesn't know him,

147
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,655
and the President said we're supposed to play along

148
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,755
Oh... Right! What's up with her blind date?!

149
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,082
Never mind that, if Shirley and Lelouch are fighting...

150
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,232
Leave 'em alone. It's just
a little lovers' spat, that's all.

151
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,557
Uh... But you...

152
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:48,835
Don't even think that way;
I've got nothing to do with him.

153
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,360
So, he hasn't taken the plunge yet, huh?

154
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:52,214
The plunge?

155
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:55,762
Well, Lelouch is good with theories,
but he's not so good with the real thing.

156
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:56,743
Real thing?

157
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,937
I mean, he doesn't have "experience."

158
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,003
Experience?!

159
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:00,680
Ah!

160
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:01,564
Huh?

161
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,543
What's the matter? Don't you like your food?

162
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,241
Arthur, why do you always do this?!

163
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,807
Hey, Lelouch, what happened with you and Shirley, huh?

164
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:11,935
Huh? What?

165
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,320
Just give her some flowers.

166
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,935
And what about your classes?

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,830
You'd better go to... Uh...

168
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,055
Excuse me.

169
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,372
Oh, and I'll talk to you later about dinner.

170
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,564
You think he's going gambling again, huh, Arthur?

171
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:24,256
Huh?

172
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,530
Lulu, if you do a handstand while searching for me,

173
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,791
I'll extend your time limit an hour!

174
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:33,345
He anticipated this!

175
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,982
He wants to see me squirm.

176
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,353
But what do I do?

177
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:39,878
He must be within 500 meters
if he's readin' my mind, but...

178
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:40,995
Lelouch!

179
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:44,353
That's...!

180
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:47,805
I thought so... Something's happened to Nunnally!

181
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:53,912
Welcome back!

182
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,945
Uh... R-Right.

183
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,970
Good timing! The meal's almost ready.

184
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:58,941
Meal?

185
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,380
You mean... Did you go out shopping somewhere?

186
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,770
No, I just used what you had around.

187
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:06,649
Some people here are afraid of Britannians, so...

188
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,894
Have you been able to remember anything yet?

189
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,995
Sorry, nothing at all yet.

190
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,144
That's okay.

191
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,174
Don't push it.

192
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:14,747
You're still healing.

193
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:17,489
It's all right if it takes time to remember.

194
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,797
Okay, it's ready.

195
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:21,641
I sure hope you like it.

196
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,022
Uh...

197
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,945
Who kidnapped Nunnally?

198
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:27,974
It can't be a Brittanian or someone from the royal family.

199
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,749
No, this has nothing to do with our bloodline.

200
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,912
Just a psychopath who wants to keep a girl all to himself.

201
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,216
So, he's threatening you?

202
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:35,941
Yes.

203
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,199
An investigation could reveal who we are.

204
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:41,424
That's why I can't go to the army or the police.

205
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,866
Then there's no choice.

206
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,341
We'll have to do it on our own.

207
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,357
This isn't about your gambling though...

208
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,103
It has nothing to do with that!

209
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:49,078
Okay.

210
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:50,224
Do you have any leads?

211
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,516
Just this photo,

212
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,397
and I know that he's somewhere very close by, watching me.

213
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,832
And now that I think of it,
I heard the sound of running water, too!

214
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,705
Water...

215
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,041
The circulation system!

216
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,324
The lower levels!

217
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,569
Something's still off though.

218
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,364
What?

219
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,878
Normally, you'd hone right in on that.

220
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,503
What is it?

221
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,007
He changed the codes.

222
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,591
We'll have to hack into the system.

223
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,124
But that's against school rules.

224
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,505
I'll change it back later.

225
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:18,755
Then let me do it.

226
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,653
Too late; I got it.

227
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,993
That was fast.

228
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,368
You're a little too good at that.

229
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:26,482
The student council has partial access to these areas.

230
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:30,105
Lelouch, I see, this is how
you've been getting off campus, isn't it?

231
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,330
Your little escape route.

232
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,047
Huh?

233
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,430
Uh, yeah... Sometimes.

234
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:40,339
How's it look?

235
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,169
You were right, the door's guarded.

236
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:44,849
There's a machine gun linked to the security camera.

237
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:48,570
The lag on these systems
is tight: point zero five seconds.

238
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,628
That means we can't access it this way.

239
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,645
We'll have to head back up and disable the main...

240
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:53,999
Wait!

241
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,970
Of all the reckless moves!

242
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,412
Come on, let's go!

243
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,232
Nunnally's waiting for us!

244
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,470
Nunnally!

245
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:17,439
Lelouch and Suzaku, is that you?

246
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:18,484
I'm so sorry! I'll cut you loose...

247
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,744
Wait! Wait!

248
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:20,697
Up there!

249
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:28,303
A bomb.

250
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,090
That's right, Lulu!

251
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,978
I'll play along since Kururugi came on his own.

252
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,753
Can't wait to see how you two deal with this!

253
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,763
Nunnally, we're going to diffuse the bomb.

254
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:42,132
It's okay, don't worry.

255
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:45,136
Lelouch and I can do anything together, you know that?

256
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,069
That's right!

257
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,036
It's motion sensitive.

258
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,905
A solenoid inside supplies energy
that keeps it constantly moving.

259
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,661
If an external force interferes with the motion,

260
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:00,594
then the bomb...

261
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:01,828
...explodes.

262
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:04,145
Moving Nunnally even an inch will trigger it.

263
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,728
That's the way it's set up.

264
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,798
Can you calculate its range?

265
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:11,080
It'd wipe out everything within
five or six hundred meters, minimum.

266
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:12,284
Now what?

267
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,663
We're beyond the reach of his Geass.

268
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,598
Is he trying to mislead me?

269
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,359
Do you know how to disarm it?

270
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,623
Theoretically.

271
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,778
The power line to the detonator would need to be severed.

272
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,240
Since he's not a pro at this,

273
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:27,432
I'm sure I could figure out which lines are dummies.

274
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:30,257
Still, we need to find another way to do it.

275
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:31,455
Why?

276
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,967
I-If we choose the right one...

277
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:36,211
Because you'd have to cut the line
without disrupting the motion...

278
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:37,742
which is impossible.

279
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:39,319
I'll do it; there's no choice.

280
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:42,107
No, Suzaku! We don't have
enough information to pull it off!

281
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:45,163
There's a time limit here!
We can't afford to play it safe!

282
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:48,365
As for information, it's staring you right in the face...

283
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,586
I'm a soldier, Lelouch, can you use that information?

284
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,908
Hmph.

285
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,828
We still have toilet tissue...

286
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,003
Hm?

287
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:08,632
Huh?

288
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,818
Stuck up little brats!

289
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,082
No wonder I hate school so much.

290
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:23,978
Huh?

291
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,361
What now?

292
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,393
What's he got planned for me next?

293
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:30,857
That camera trained on Nunnally's transmitting to Mao.

294
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,172
Is he here?

295
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,593
I can't believe he'd still be here at the school.

296
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,189
What a whack-job.

297
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,918
I told Suzaku to stay with Nunnally,

298
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:41,548
but that leaves me with only one option.

299
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,912
Well, if it isn't Casanova!

300
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:49,976
No weapons, no strategy, you didn't diffuse the bomb,

301
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,709
didn't deploy the Black Knights, or your friend.

302
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:54,597
What's wrong, Lulu?

303
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,960
I'm not explaining anything to you.

304
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,462
The final game, is it ready?

305
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,739
Hm. Let's put an end to this...

306
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,953
...with your specialty.

307
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:04,855
Hm?

308
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,893
It's been a while since we could spend time like this.

309
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,428
There've been so many
unexpected events since we came here.

310
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,714
All of that desk work... it's making you fat.

311
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,066
Hey, cut it out. That's not funny!

312
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:26,926
Cornelia, don't you think this garden looks familiar?

313
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:29,241
It's like Lady Marianne's.

314
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:30,945
Now that you mention it...

315
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:35,036
I heard Clovis ordered them to build it like this.

316
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:37,439
I'm surprised he liked her villa that much.

317
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:40,349
Since he was always fighting with her son, Lelouch, there.

318
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,437
He must have thought of Lelouch as his rival.

319
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,520
Even though Lelouch was younger?

320
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,607
Well, he kept paintings of Lelouch and the others;

321
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:50,691
we found them after he was killed.

322
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,841
I see...

323
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:56,703
We need to stabilize this area and capture Zero, fast.

324
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:00,828
To avenge Clovis... as well as Lelouch and Nunnally.

325
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:04,341
This land has taken the lives of three of our siblings.

326
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,530
It's soaked in our family's blood.

327
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,749
You see, the scale is the bomb's detonator

328
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:12,105
and it's cancellation switch.

329
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,262
The chess pieces we capture will go here.

330
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,755
If the needle swings all the way towards me,

331
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,118
the bomb goes off.

332
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:23,268
If it swings towards you, the bomb will be disarmed.

333
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,819
In short, if you win the game,
your sister's life will be saved.

334
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,876
Your mind is twisted; no wonder C.C. left you.

335
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,639
Provoking me won't work.

336
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
I can read your thoughts,
so I know what you're trying to do.

337
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,078
I'm afraid you're not the type of
person who can keep your mind empty.

338
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:52,730
There's a part of you that's a critic,
constantly watching your own moves,

339
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:57,489
and then there's another part that's
an observer, watching the critic watching you.

340
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,528
You're that kind of person.

341
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,884
But I know all your thoughts, so I'm always a step ahead.

342
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:05,163
You can't win.

343
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,411
Bravo!

344
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:13,609
Your plan is to think of seven things
at once to confuse me and trip me up.

345
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,301
But you see, if I focus my Geass directly on you,

346
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:20,113
it's easy to tell which one is your true thought.

347
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:24,530
Aah, your last plan is failing as well.

348
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,959
You underestimated me; that's why your sister is...

349
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,117
"What do I do?"

350
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:38,575
"I'm out of strategies. I can't call for back up

351
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,651
as long as Nunnally's being held hostage!"

352
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:47,526
Sorry, sorry, I dropped it.

353
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,415
Your turn. Better hurry.

354
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,970
Lookie, lookie, time is running out.

355
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,446
Your little sister's not going to make it.

356
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,696
Ah, is that the right move?

357
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,203
Are you sure you want to do that?

358
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,588
Isn't this enough?

359
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:08,526
Huh?

360
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,128
Please stop it, Mao.

361
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,084
I can't hear you very well.

362
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,940
You got everything you wanted! Let Nunnally go!

363
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,144
Huh?

364
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:17,717
I admit it...

365
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:19,930
You have beaten me.

366
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,603
Very well said!

367
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:33,184
You're finally speaking the thoughts
from the deepest part of your soul, huh?

368
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,529
That feels great! Fantastic!

369
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:37,584
But no.

370
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:39,673
This is...

371
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:43,936
Checkmate!

372
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,584
No!

373
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,430
Nunnally...

374
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:56,501
Hm... Let me se if she's burst into little pieces.

375
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:57,221
Huh?

376
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:02,344
What? Why is she...?

377
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,063
Huh?

378
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:05,430
How did you...?!

379
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,288
You kept me focused on you!

380
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:15,421
I am Warrant Officer Suzaku Kururagi

381
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,529
of the Britannian military, and you are under arrest!

382
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:19,548
Suzaku.

383
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,576
You disarmed the bomb?!

384
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,865
Impossible! You'd have to
match your speed to the pendulum!

385
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,657
That's right.

386
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:29,186
After Lelouch showed me which line to cut.

387
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,051
I showed you?

388
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,663
What are you saying?

389
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:33,894
It was your plan.

390
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,994
Cut the line, then bust in here when I heard you scream.

391
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,536
My plan?

392
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,607
So that's it.

393
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,986
Right...

394
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,873
Mao, it seems that it's my checkmate.

395
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,271
Lelouch, don't tell me that you...

396
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,065
Yes...

397
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,155
I gave Suzaku his instructions,
then used Geass on myself to forget,

398
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,813
so you couldn't find out.

399
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,805
You believed that if you know a person's thoughts,

400
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,038
you know everything.

401
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:03,021
That's why you narrowed your range
and focused all your power on my mind.

402
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,603
That was your mistake.

403
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:06,367
That's ridiculous!

404
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:08,267
You bet everything on one friend?!

405
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,526
What if he'd failed you?!

406
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:10,523
Good point.

407
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,909
To execute this plan, I had to trust Suzaku completely.

408
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,613
Sayoko, everything's fine now.

409
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:18,013
Right, go ahead.

410
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:21,120
Sayoko?

411
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,919
I'll have you free in a second.

412
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:23,657
Hmph.

413
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,396
You think you beat me, huh?!

414
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:26,209
Stop it!

415
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:28,486
Get your hands off of me, father killer!

416
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:35,003
You killed your own father seven years ago!

417
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:36,077
Hmph!

418
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,376
He called for do-or-die resistance,

419
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,871
and you thought stopping him would end the war.

420
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:42,797
What a childish idea!

421
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,182
The fact is, you're a murderer.

422
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,747
That's not true! I just... I...

423
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:52,438
How lucky for you that no one ever found out.

424
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,080
All the adults lied to protect you.

425
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:58,703
But all the reports said his suicide
was a protest against the military actions...

426
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:01,173
A big, fat lie, all of it.

427
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:01,821
A lie?

428
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,153
I didn't have any choice!

429
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,386
If I didn't, Japan would have...

430
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:06,528
That's how you justify it in retrospect?

431
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:08,767
Well, it explains your death wish!

432
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:11,478
You want to save people's lives?

433
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,086
It's your own wretched soul, you're trying to save!

434
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,024
That's why you're always charging into danger!

435
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,608
Placing yourself on the edge of death!

436
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:24,076
You're no hero.

437
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,334
You're just trying to wash the blood off your hands.

438
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,747
A little brat begging to be punished!

439
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,891
Mao!

440
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,158
Never speak again!

441
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,428
Huh? No!

442
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:46,021
Mao!

443
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:54,309
I did love you, Mao.

444
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:02,093
Mao, I want you to go and wait for me... in C's world.

445
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:17,774
I just... I just...

446
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,201
I'm a fool.

447
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:55,938
In the end, I never asked the terms
of the contract she made with Mao.

448
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,526
And Suzaku...

449
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,845
When we were reunited, why didn't I... No!

450
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,798
He's been trying to tell me for a long time now.

451
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,398
I should have confronted him right from the start.
