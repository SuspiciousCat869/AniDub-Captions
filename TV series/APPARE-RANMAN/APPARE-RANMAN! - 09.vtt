00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.303 position:50% align:center
[AL] Gil's thugs had
taken us captive,

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.681 position:50% align:center
and all hope seemed lost,
until suddenly...

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.308 position:50% align:center
Kosame! I always knew
you had great strength!

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
Hototo has his vengeance,
and the race is set to continue,

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
but the true identity of Gil
the Snake remains unknown.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
The B.I.G. BOSS delegates have
concluded their deliberations.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.567 position:50% align:center
It's been decided that
the race will go on.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
All thanks to Kosame.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
No, hardly! Please don't
make any fuss over me.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
At least you had a
good time, though.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.118 position:50% align:center
Then there's me, drivin' through
the desert with this clown here,

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
halfway wishin'
somebody'd shoot me.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.414 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Callin' me a
clown in that get-up?

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
Every piece of my outfit
I'm wearin' for a reason.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.085 position:50% align:center
You just lettin' your
neck hair get like that.

00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, wait a second.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Ahem.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
Well, regrettably,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
Gil remains at large,
in spite of our best efforts.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.592 position:50% align:center
We've no choice but to assume

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
he's got the next
leg staked out.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.347 position:50% align:center
As such, we've designated
a new location

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
for the next supply point,
moving the course northward.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.309 position:50% align:center
Accordingly,
you'll now be taking

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
a different route out of town.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.771 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty big detour.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Unfortunately,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
there weren't many
options open to us.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
It had to be a town the staff
could reach from here by rail.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
We would've preferred a straight
shot through the plains.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
That would have been
the best environment

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.783 position:50% align:center
to demonstrate the power of
the motorcar at its peak.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
We should be counting
our blessings

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
that the race can
continue at all.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
Yes, agreed! Safety first!

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same here.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
That sounds okay.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
Not to me. Why y'all wanna go
and make this race so boring?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.464 position:50% align:center
You could drop out.
No one's keepin' ya here.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Huh?

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.301 position:50% align:center
Well, sir, you're in the employ
of the Iron Motor Company,

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:57.635 position:50% align:center
which was represented
on the committee

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
that approved this change.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Man...

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Any thoughts, Mr. Reaseman?

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
I hate to say this, but I
don't feel safe continuing.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
I'm going to withdraw
from the race.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Hm?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
Hey, Richard.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
You suffered through
something truly horrific.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
No one can judge you.
So don't worry about it.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
All racers will need
to remain here

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
while we spend the day
transferring our crews

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
to the new supply point.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, you'll drive to the
new starting line in a group

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
and launch according to
your current standing.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
You heard that, right, Appare?

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
We've got a day to do
whatever we want!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
"Thanks for keeping me
in the loop, Kosame,

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
and also making sure there's
tasty food waiting for me

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
at whatever ridiculous hour
I remember to eat."

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
What is this, now?

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Well, <i>he</i> never hears
me when he's working,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
but I guess I forgot everyone
else still can, huh?

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME chuckles]

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[AL]
What is he fixing?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Something about
cooling the hybrid engine,

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
I think he said.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
...heat transfer.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
But if I can squeeze out
another 20% efficiency...

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
If you need help,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
perhaps Mr. Carter could
be of some assistance.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Who's he?

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
So it's just me he doesn't hear?

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Seth from Great Motors.
Fancy glasses, like so.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Huh.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
He was once an engineer,
and quite a good one at that.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
I am sure he could offer some
insight if you asked him.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Much obliged, sir!

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Mr. Oldin.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
Hm?

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
It's just Dylan. Never really
been much for formalities.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Dylan. My father's
death is finally avenged.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
So I've been told.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
It's thanks to you I was
able to find his killers.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
So on my father's name and mine,
I owe you a great debt.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
To hell with that.
Go live your life.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Thank you.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
Cut it out.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Anyone heard you thankin' me,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
my reputation as an
outlaw would be shot.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
So who's Claudia?

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
Uh! You okay?

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
Where'd you hear that name?

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Back when you were
staring at that photo

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
at the pre-race party.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
Aww, Claudia.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
I didn't mean pry,

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
but the look on your
face was so sad.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Who was Claudia?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
She was someone who could see
the filth all around her

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
and laugh like a child
in spite of it.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
Then she's...

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
In this ugly world,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
she was all I had
worth holdin' onto.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
Son, if you got
someone to protect,

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
you better keep 'em
real close to ya.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
Someone to protect?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
And if you don't,

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
then you're a wiser man
than I ever was.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
So how much heat transfer
you gettin' outta this thing?

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
Uh. Lemme look.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
It's fresh off a 900-mile trip,

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
so I want every single nut
and bolt double-checked

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
before we resume the
race tomorrow morning.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
Right, sir, but the mechanics
will need a chance to rest.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
Then tell 'em they're free to
go on break. Permanently.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
Understood, gentlemen?

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
I'm putting my-- We're putting
GM's future at stake here!

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
We must secure victory in this
race, no matter the cost!

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
Destiny decrees it!

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
We'll soar past Iron and BNW,

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
and those backwater
fools with their--

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
You could work on it
yourself, right?

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
[SETH] What are you doing
under that machine?!

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
I'm inspecting it.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Well, stop!

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
So you're Seth, huh?

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
I don't care for your
tone, monkey boy.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
It's "Mr. Carter" to you.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I heard you're an engineer.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
That's a lie!

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
I'm an executive who's
been delegated by GM

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
to represent their interests
in organizing this event.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Oh, okay.
Don't really care about that.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why did you come here?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
For ideas.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
I need to squeeze a
little more efficiency

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
out of the heat exchange
mechanism on my hybrid engine

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
to keep the gas part
from overheating.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, hybrid?
The heat exchange? What--?

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you pipe the excess heat

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
from the gas engine
out to the boiler.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
So not only are you cooling it,
you're actually also...

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Ah, never mind.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
I can't explain it all
to a non-engineer.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.223 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
You mean to tell me that your
car's running parallel engines?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
So you do get it?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it, what
you're describing is absurd.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
Or at the very least, it's quite
far beyond your abilities!

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
You wanna see it?

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
That's fair.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
Oh, and good work on that car.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
But I'm not too sure why
you would wanna leave

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
that weird gap by the engine.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
It's nearly finished, sir.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
It improves power
and efficiency,

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
and it runs off
exhaust pressure.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center

What do you plan to do
after the race ends?

Well, if I get the prize,

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
I figure I'll buy a little piece

stir crazy pretty quick.

I want to protect my family.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Big thing for
a kid to take on.

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
Lemme give ya one
piece of advice.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
What you wanna protect and
what you oughta protect

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
might not always be
the same thing, y'know?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
You get the two of
'em twisted around

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
and you're gonna be
in for a world of hurt.

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Also, if you wanna
protect others,

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
you gotta be strong enough to
protect yourself first, got it?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
And remember to brush your teeth
after eating a lotta sugar!

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.959 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I need a way to keep
the whole engine assembly

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
in the right temperature range.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
What can I do to pull
some more heat out of it?

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
A bigger transfer
area could work.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
Except that there's no more room
in the engine compartment,

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
which means that forcing
higher airflow

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
might be the only viable
option for us right now.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
Naturally, I'll need to
add some exterior ducts

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center

you wanna come, too?

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.375 position:50% align:center
Uh... Sure.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Now where do I have room

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
for the supplementary cooling?

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
I can mount it on the side.

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that'll also pull
some of the heat

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
outta the engine compartment,

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
so a side-mounted configuration
is probably a good way to go.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
Though collisions
would be more likely

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
and maybe more damaging, too.

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
And considering how the race
has played out so far,

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
that could end up being
a serious problem.

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
But if I can split them up

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
and mount one on
each side of the car,

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
that would mitigate the risk.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center

thing or another to the car.

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] I always kinda
thought you didn't care

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
about the flavor.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
Of course I do.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
Well, I know a lot of people
start to crave salty foods

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
when they get tired.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
The day has finally come.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
Now, your hybrid... is ready!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
Yes. And it's time for
the real race to start.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
So how far can we take this?

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
To New York, Hototo! Right?

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
The show must go on, everybody!

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
Dylan the Hero and Crazy TJ
of the Thousand Three

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
will be starting at
the head of the pack!

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Next is our crimson
peony, Xialian Jing,

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
the young scion, Al Lyon,

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
and of course, the fearless
freaks of Team Appare!

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
And bringing up the rear,
the notorious Bad Brothers!

00:21:56.775 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
All cars are standing by
and we're nearly underway!

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Pardon me, miss,
but are you Sofia?

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
<i>Oui</i> . You are Richard?

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
Seems we're going the same way.
Would you care for some company?

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
Absolutely!

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.251 position:50% align:center
I could help you with your bag.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
<i>Merci</i> , but there is no need.

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:18.380 position:50% align:center
