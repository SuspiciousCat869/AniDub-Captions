00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.637 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Finally, I get
to face off with the man

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
who killed my father!

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
What? You're not Gil the Snake?

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.393 position:50% align:center
The man behind the mask was
actually Chase's brother,

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
Tristan the Bad.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
I'll keep searching!

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
My journey won't end till
I avenge my father's death!

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
You fix it?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.494 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:01.329 position:50% align:center
But it's gonna take me
a little while longer

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.457 position:50% align:center
before the hybrid engine
in working order.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.502 position:50% align:center
It's almost time
to get on the road,

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.922 position:50% align:center
so it'll have to wait
till the next supply point.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50% align:center
We're pretty far behind
the leader pack right now,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.886 position:50% align:center
but once you finish, I'm sure
we'll catch up in no time.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
That sound about
right to you? Huh?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
Out like a light again. Hm?

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?
You guys should get a move on!

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.063 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Whoa, I slept too late!

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Right behind you!

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Appare!

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hototo!

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
No, not you! I mean the old one!

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
You've gotta change its name.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] We're leaving,
so load up our stuff!

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hmm.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
Is this really a good idea?

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
Look, who knows how
long he's gonna sleep,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
so we can't sit here
and wait on him.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
But don't worry, I've got this!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Whoa! Hey! Be careful!

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Stop talking
or you'll bite your tongue!

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Just drive
like you're supposed to!

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] That's not
that easy to do, okay?

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
What?!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
Is that Appare?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.900 position:50% align:center
Kosame? Why?

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
You're a terrible driver!

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Shut up!

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
I'm Isshiki Kosame,
Hangetsu Ittoryu master,

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
and I will succeed!

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
And there's the flag!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
The race is on!

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's go!

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
Gotta close that gap!

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
Clutch! Shift up!

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Come on,
you're going way too slow!

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Just sit down, shut your mouth,
and leave the driving to me!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.222 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What could
they be doing?

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
Step on it, will ya?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
I am!

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
I bet I could do better.
You're too scared.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
Move over, Kosame.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Appare!

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
You should've just woken me up.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Has that ever worked?

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
--[HOTOTO] Course not.
--[APPARE] Of course.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Try not to scream again.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
The race must go on!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Hm?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
There they are!

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
You ready? Here we go!

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Is that the front of the pack?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
What's going on here?

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
No! What happened?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
It's horrific.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Hey! This man's alive!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They got me pretty
damn good, though.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Bunch of cowboy lookin'
guys on horseback

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
came out of nowhere
and blocked the road.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
That's all I know.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
Bandits?

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
If they were a gang of bandits,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
don'tcha reckon they
would've killed me, too?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
Did they say anything?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
All they really said was

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
"everybody in this
race is gonna die."

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD] Told me to make
sure I pass that message on.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
If they're not bandits,
who are they?

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
But, uh, their leader had some
kinda tattoo on his neck.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.702 position:50% align:center
Gil the Snake!

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Is he the real one?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hototo.
Where are you going?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
After them.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] But how do you
know where they went?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Five horses walked
north from here, slowly.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
You got all that from
looking at the ground?

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
Well, there is a little
town just up north of here

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
if I recall correctly.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
I think we should go on
to the next supply point

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
--and get some help.
--They're gonna get away!

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
So what? Do you think
that you can stop them?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
Just calm down. The race
is still on, so we might--

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
These guys killed my family.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
You have no idea of
the pain I've felt.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
You agree, don't you, Appare?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
We can't just stop in
the middle of the race.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
Hototo, get in.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
Appare. Listen, I--

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
We'll find them.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I don't know who these guys are,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
but they did this to cars that
they knew we would be passing.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
It's a statement to me and you
and everybody in this race.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
Uh, Appare? Not you, too.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
I imagine that little town
would have a sheriff.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
I would think so, too.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
Not to mention it'll be safer
for all the racers involved

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
if these goons were
caught sooner than later.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
I'll go back to the last supply
point and try to get some help.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO gasps]

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
Stop here.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Looks like the tracks
lead straight towards that town.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] So maybe we can
still find them there.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Excuse me, sir,

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
did five men on horses
come through here recently?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
Eh, I dunno.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Have you seen any suspicious men

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
carrying guns walking
around town?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME gasps]

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
Beat it, stranger.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME grumbles]

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] I get the feeling
we're not welcome here.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
[AL]
I'll ask the sheriff.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he'll be
more keen to help.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
Would you mind coming
with me, Appare?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yeah.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
We can try some more
people in town.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, miss?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and what the hell
do you want, huh?

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
Surely you folk know better than
to bring a kid into this place.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Have there been any
suspicious men in here lately?

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS A] Besides the
one standing next to ya?

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
Listen, we're looking
for five men on horses.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
One of 'em's got a snake
tattoo on his neck.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
If y'all ain't drinkin' here,
then you best go on.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
I gotta bar to run, ya know?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
Please, will you tell us
if you've seen them?

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
They're dangerous and violent.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
If I was you, I'd skip outta
town and never come back.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh? Hmm...

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF]
I understand.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
You can't really blame
'em, now can ya?

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
This ain't the type of place
that gets too many visitors,

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
so folks 'round here
tend to be suspicious.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
You have any deputies
that could help apprehend

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50% align:center
these roving outlaws?

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Son, we are out in the boonies.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
So... you?

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
My weapon is right here.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF]
Okay. Let's get goin'.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! His swordsmanship
is amazing!

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
Don't move!

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.301 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF]
You animals!

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
You're all gonna die! Y'hear?!

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF laughing]

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
Damn you! You're gonna
pay! I'll kill you!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF]
Get offa me!

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna send you off to
see your daddy in hell.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey! That's enough, Hototo!

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
Let go of me, Kosame!

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
He killed my father!
I gotta kill him--

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
Look, my mother was killed, too!

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
I was just a kid
and I couldn't help her.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
All the horror and regret
that I felt back then,

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
it still haunts me
to this very day.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
Then you should know--

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Listen to me!

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
I won't let you stain your hands
with this coward's blood.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
That's a job for
a grown up to do.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Put down your gun and give up.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
There's been enough
needless death today.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF] Maybe so, but I
think you need to be next.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Oh, no.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
When he sways his gun
around like that,

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
it's hard to predict
where he's gonna shoot.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
[AL] And it's even harder
with two guns.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
[SHERIFF]
What's the matter, son?

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Not gonna draw your sword?

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry about me.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
Then I won't.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Gotcha!

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
Hangetsu Ittoryu secret move!

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Fury Eternal Wary Moon!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
There's no right nor wrong.

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
There's only what happens
as one carries on.

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
You're late, Kosame.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
You saved our lives. Thank you.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
I always knew you
had great strength.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. The path to real
strength is quite long.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
I'm still on it.

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Now back to the race.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
He's right. Dylan and TJ
are likely quite far ahead.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Kosame.

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
I... I, um...

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] You don't have to
say anything, not right now.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
And you know, if you wanna
run back to your mommy,

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
you can leave
whenever you want to.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
Stop treating me like a kid!

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME chuckles]

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS A]
And here I figured

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
you was gonna get
yourself killed.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
[HOSTESS A]
Some parting advice.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
I hear those guys' boss is ten
times worse than they are.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
Gil, eh?

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter to me
who it is, 'cause I--

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
<i>we've</i> gotta keep on
moving forward.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
You take care.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
Xialian Jing, Al Lyon,

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
and Team Appare have arrived!

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
With Dylan, TJ, and
Richard in the lead,

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.467 position:50% align:center
and the Bad Brothers
at the tail,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
this race has been whittled
down to just seven cars!

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
We knew this was gonna be one
action-packed contest, folks!

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF A]
You think that was smart?

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
Pulling a crazy stunt like that?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
Now I shouldn't
have to tell you,

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
but if the word gets out about
us, that'll be a big problem.

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
All you gotta to do is put
your focus on the race.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
So don't try and get cute and--

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.325 position:50% align:center
[RICHARD]
No need to get twisted.

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:09.496 position:50% align:center
This "new era" they're
talking about won't come.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.248 position:50% align:center
Just wanted to make that
crystal clear to them.

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.585 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF A]
Well, don't you forget.

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:18.505 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you,
Gil T. Cigar.

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:19.923 position:50% align:center
Heh.
