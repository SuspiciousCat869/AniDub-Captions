[KOSAME] The racers assaulted
the ghost town to rescue Sofia

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.764 position:50% align:center
and put an end to Gil's terror!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
One by one we carved a path

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
through his toughest Snakes.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
Now it's time for us to regroup

Get ready, Gil!

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
[APPARE, KOSAME]
Because we will stop you!

Where is Sofia?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
[GIL] What the hell
are you doin' here?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.659 position:50% align:center
Men aren't gods,

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
and no one is strong enough
to bend the fates to his whim.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
Well then, guess I'm
killin' you twice.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.042 position:50% align:center
Enough talk, where is Sofia?

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about her.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
'Cause you won't live
to see her die.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50% align:center
Hell, y'all halfway look
like you busted in here

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center

[DYLAN]
You're askin' me?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
Yes. Should we find ourselves
up against Gil, your advice?

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.229 position:50% align:center
Turn tail and run like hell.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
And leave the hostages' lives
in his hands? Never.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.986 position:50% align:center
[TJ] You ain't got a snowball's
chance in hell except up close.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
He fights the way we do,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.864 position:50% align:center
by predictin' which
way you're gonna move

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
and where your shots
are gonna go.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.909 position:50% align:center
So does Kosame.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
Well, to a degree.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
It's still sword against gun.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.499 position:50% align:center
Could be, you're quick enough to
close that gap, but even then,

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
a bullet's a helluva lot
quicker than you are.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
What about when
he has to reload?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
If we all move at one time,

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
at least one of us has
to find an opening.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.135 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN] As a bettin' man,
I wouldn't take that one.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
I am all in, odds be damned.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
I would gladly give
my life for Sofia's.

[DYLAN grunts]

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
He knows how to use
that six-shooter.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
Don't get killed.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
Come on. Stop wastin' my time.

[GIL] Gotta say,
that wasn't bad at all.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
Didn't think I'd have to shift
gears on your account.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Al's lady friend
ain't here anymore.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
On the train.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
The train?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, indeed!

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
And it's rollin' out now.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
Matter of fact,

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
she's on a one-way trip
aboard a big iron bullet,

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center
straight into the beating
heart of Chicago, Illinois.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
The world's gonna see
that big city bleed,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
and all the death, terror,
and rage that comes after,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
and they'll know...

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
...that the only real
power in this world

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
is the power to kill!

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
Why put Sofia on that train?

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
I like the thought of a lone
blossom burning away

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
at the heart of the inferno.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
Sounds real pretty.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
If you're a God-fearin' man,

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
you'd best ask Him to take her
quick and hope He's listenin'.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
Not a chance!

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
It's not over.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
I know I can stop that train
and we can save Sofia!

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
You forgot about one thing,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
and it's gonna throw a big
damn wrench in your plan.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Did he? That's great news!

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you?

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Huh? I'm sorry?

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
You're heading home,
too, aren't you?

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
Uhh. Yeah.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
So this is where
our paths diverge.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Well, naturally.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
We've all got our
hopes and dreams.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Kosame is
leaving today, isn't he?

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
[boat horn blares]

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go for a walk.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Kosame!

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
Kosame!

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Kosame.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
Why are you leaving?

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
And why...?

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't I tell
you how badly

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to stay
here with me?

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I'm not ready for you to leave.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
Kosame.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
I wanna fly across the sky.
I wanna set foot on the moon.

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
But it's not gonna feel right
if you're not there with me!

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
[APPARE gasps]

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
Kosame, you're--

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Well, I sent a letter
so my family knows I'm alive,

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure my fiancée has
broken our engagement anyway,

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
thinking I had died.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
Besides, Fumi is
old enough by now

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
that she should be fine
without me there.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
My future's not back in Japan.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
My next steps are right here,
in the States, alongside you.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.349 position:50% align:center
How much of that did you hear?

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
The whole thing.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Let's go! Hototo is waiting!

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
Oh, of course!

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
But who was it you wanted
to cross the sky with you?

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Oh, shut up!
I'm bringing Hototo.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Just Hototo?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Go commit <i>harakiri</i> !

00:21:18.528 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Urgh. My wound
must've heard you.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Oh, crap! Are you okay?

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
Wait, it was on the other side!

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
And that's American comedy!

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Ow, that actually
hurts, you jerk!

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
Hey, get back here!

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:27.013 position:50% align:center
It's so good to know that
both our brothers are fine.

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:29.516 position:50% align:center
And thank you for
keeping me apprised.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:33.812 position:50% align:center
Appare sent me a letter as well,
but it doesn't say much.

00:22:34.813 --> 00:22:35.605 position:50% align:center
[FUMI chuckles]

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:37.649 position:50% align:center
They do look happy.

00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
[AYANE]
Quite.

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.902 position:50% align:center
[AYANE chuckles]
