[SOFIA] The racers all got
a necessary break to rest.

Ah! Hot springs are

In a moment of inspiration,

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
Appare was able to complete
his hybrid engine

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
just in time for the
race to start again.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
Please be careful, everyone!

[ANNOUNCER] It's time to kick
off the next leg of the race!

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.416 position:50% align:center
Thanks to our sponsors
at B.I.G. BOSS!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center
With their hard work and expert
planning and coordination,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
all remaining drivers
will be restarting

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.214 position:50% align:center
at the exact same time!

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
And as a bonus, we'll be getting

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
a whole other race
going on as well!

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.429 position:50% align:center
Who will be the first to arrive?
The train or the automobiles?

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50% align:center
The winner may decide the
future of American travel!

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.588 position:50% align:center
I am a bit lacking
in acceleration.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
However... at top speed,
I am the king of the road!

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center

battle, but it's a race!

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.865 position:50% align:center
Whew. I think I'm in love.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Don't really like
bein' dead last.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
Then we gotta change that.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
This hunk of junk
ain't the fastest,

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center
but it does pack
a mighty wallop!

[CHASE laughing]

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
The real race starts now.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
Yeah! We'll show 'em all!

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
Cooling system

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center

[ALL]
Here we go!

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Looks like the

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
Dylan, TJ, and Al

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
Bringing up the rear
are the Bad Brothers,

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
and behind them, Team Appare!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
That's the stuff, my friend!

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Let's have some fun.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
Pay close attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
What we are witnessing
at this very moment

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
are the first rays of the dawn

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
of a whole new era
in transportation!

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
The bridge we'll cross
into Missouri today

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
could very well serve
as a metaphor of sorts.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
Who will be the first
to conquer it

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
and make it to the other side?

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
Will it be the train
or the motorcar?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
Folks! Keep watch!

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
[PASSENGER A]
I'd bet the farm on the car!

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
[PASSENGER B]
They're looking pretty good.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.387 position:50% align:center
Go fetch him.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
Good luck! Do your best!

[SOFIA giggles]

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me
for being so noisy.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
I'm simply far too excited!

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
Oh, I understand.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
Even as a spectator, the whole
thing is pretty thrilling.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
You must be sad, no?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
If that tragedy hadn't happened,

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
you yourself would still be
among the competitors.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad to be alive.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
And I learned that
I'm not really cut out

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
to live the life of
a high-stakes racer.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're too kind.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
Please, God.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
Protect our brave racers and
see that they all finish safely.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[GIL] Well, you're
definitely kind, young miss.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
And I hope that God answers
your prayers for our friends

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
on the course.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center

Please excuse me, sir.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
May I have a quick
word with you?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure. You'll have
to excuse me, miss.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
Of course.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
I'll be back real soon.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
All right, Cigar, you got
some explaining to do.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
Because I paid you quite
a handsome amount of money

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
to put the kibosh on this
whole damn production!

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
And if those confounded
automobiles

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
happen to make it across
the bridge before we do,

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
I do not want to see
tomorrow's headlines!

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
Now the course has
been re-directed

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
and the racers got some
time to refresh themselves.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
The era of cars
can't come to pass.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center

the dominating force

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
across this great continent.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:38.106 position:50% align:center
The main reason I hired you
was to make the world see that.

Hey! You'd better listen up!

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
What I need from you is to do
whatever the hell it takes

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
to put the brakes
on Dylan and TJ!

one guy, and that's me.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
I thought that was clear.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center

Great! Let's go for it!

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Yes! Bravo!

Oh, you've come back.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
Hate to break it to ya, but God
ain't answerin' your prayers.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
You wanna know why that is?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center

I guess that
lily-livered Richard,

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
What? You mean
you're not Richard?

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
Okay, I get it now.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
This man's name sure
as hell ain't Richard.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
You bet your ass it's not.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's Gil
the Snake's mark!

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
And if you happen
to run into somebody

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
with this tattooed on 'em,

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
it's because they've sworn
complete loyalty to me.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Then that means you're--

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
It means he's Gil the Butcher.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Yeah.
The one and only.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] So how in the world
can Richard be Gil?

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
[GIL] Well, I guess you're not
nearly as sharp as your blade.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
Because somehow you
still managed to kill

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
five of my men all
by your lonesome.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I had no other choice.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
Ha. No big deal.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
After all, the world is
ruled by violence, right?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
The strong survive and the
weak ain't quite so fortunate.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
You were just provin' that
point, weren't ya, tough guy?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
I do it, too.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
No! I was only--

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
You gimme any more
of that backtalk,

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
you're gonna be eatin' a bullet.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
Are all the passengers
on the train safe?

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
[GIL] If ya got somethin' to
ask me, Frenchie, quit hiding.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
Or are ya too scared?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
No, Al!

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
Don't get near him!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Are they safe?

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
"all the passengers"

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
are your real concern.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
You wanna know
about sweet Sofia.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What in the hell
did you do to her?

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
I think this might
answer that question.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
Damn you!

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
Say hello to her for me.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yells]

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
No, Kosame!

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN yells]

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
He's good.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
Y'all aren't too shabby either.

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
How about gettin'
yourselves tatted up, too?

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
I could always use more Snakes.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Never!

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
Guess you're dyin' then.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Now come on, man.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you quit big doggin'
all these scared little puppies?

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassin'.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
What do you want outta this?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
If you really can't
handle the race,

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
then why don't you
just run along home

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
and suck on your
mama's milkbags?

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
[GIL laughs]

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[GIL] You honestly think it's
about this dumb-ass race?

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they're
paying'you to do this.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
If you want money,
you just go out and grab it!

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
That's what real outlaws do.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
This race is not dumb!

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
You were a part of it,
too, ya know!

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
I think shutting up is
the smart move right now.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
So are you lookin' for money?

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
It's pathetic.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
Back when we were
the Thousand Seven,

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
people would piss their pants
just from hearin' our name.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
Nowadays we're the only
three that's left.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
What's worse, one of em's
a chickenshit dandy,

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
and the crazy one
is nothin' but talk.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
You know I ain't never been
ashamed of bein' called crazy,

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
but I do a hell of a
lot more than talk.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
Prove it.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
Let's have fun, then I'll
get back to business.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[TJ chuckles]

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[GIL] If anyone tries
to run, light 'em up.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
Now, don't y'all fret.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
My Snakes won't do a damn thing
'less I give the order first.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
So let's start this here dance;
I'll take both of ya on at once.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
[TJ, DYLAN]
Hey, screw you!

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.377 position:50% align:center
[TJ] I ain't teamin' up
with this backwoods clown!

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
Just who're you callin' a clown?

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
Then sit this one out and watch.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
Only way this is gonna end

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
is with both of ya
pushin' up daisies.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
So...

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[GIL laughs]

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
Time to shift gears.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.231 position:50% align:center
Can you keep up?

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
It's lookin' like we're whittled
down to the Thousand Two.

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
You have yourself
a change of heart?

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
I'm still an outlaw.
And I do what I want.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
Dylan... damn you.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
You shoulda listened and
stuck to the rules, cowboy!

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50% align:center
He told ya to sit and wa--

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
And you should've learned
that there's a big difference

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
between breakin' the rules
and defying my orders!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
You might still be alive.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
He killed one of his own men.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
The man's a monster.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
He spoiled my fun.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
Perfect timing.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.003 position:50% align:center
I reckon we'll call
it quits for now.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
And don't you dare forget
I got a buncha hostages.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
That means you, monsieur.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
[AL gasps]

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
[SNAKE E]
You ain't goin' nowhere!

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
Al!

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
No, Sofia!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
I never told ya she was dead.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
But, I mean, you won't
ever see her again,

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
so what's the difference?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
If hostages are what you need,

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
then why don't you
just take me instead?

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
Please, sir, let Sofia
go, right now!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
You should save your
breath, Jacques,

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
because what I need you to do

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
is get with those other deep
pockets in B.I.G. Boss

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
and rustle up 1.51
million bucks.

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
1.51, huh?

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
It's the total prize
amount for the race.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
Makes perfect sense,
doesn't it?

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
After all, that prize ain't
goin' to any of you people.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
[AL gasps]

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
And you're just gonna
have to face the fact

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
that this whole race is over!

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
You'd better get
down off that car!

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
You are really startin'
to get under my skin.

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
This race is far from over!

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
And it's not gonna be stopped
by a thug like you!

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna let you
off with a warning.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
But next time, you're dead.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
Ya hear me?

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
I have the power
to take everything

00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
that means anything to
you sorry sacks of shit.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Miss Jing?

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
I mean, look at this car.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
It was awfully nice of
your pals on the team

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
to put this baby
together for ya.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
But what a cryin' shame
to waste it on a gal.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.341 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dylan.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
When the hell did you--?

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
[GIL] Oh, Claudia.
She was a real peach.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Keep your goddamn
hands offa her!

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
It's gotta hurt knowin'
she'd still be alive

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
if it wasn't for you.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIA]
Dylan.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
Claudia.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
Bet you agonize over the fact

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
that if you'd stayed by
your true love's side,

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
you coulda protected her.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
But now she's up there singin'
in a choir of angels

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
because you were too obsessed

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
with fighting your
own little battles.

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
No, I-- Everything I did
was to protect Claudia.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
You're tellin' me
you truly believed

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
that you could rebuild the
orphanage she grew up in

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
and all your sins would be
magically washed away?

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
How the hell do you know?

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
[GIL laughs]

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
You killed her. Sweet
Claudia, your true love.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
Avenging your daddy like that.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
I'd always heard your
kind was cunning.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:28.525 position:50% align:center
I reckon I'll have to kill
your mama next time.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
You figure you'll be up
to doin' the same for her?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you!

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
You understand?
This here is real power.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
Whatever I want, I take,
and whatever I hate, I destroy.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make any
difference if cars take off

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
or if the railway
keeps on expanding,

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
there ain't no new world
on the horizon!

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
Because as long as I'm
still alive and kickin',

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
the only thing ruling
this godforsaken world

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
is power and brute force!

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
Ya see? I'm the boss!
And you can't stop me!

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
[GIL laughs]

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's go!

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
[GIL laughing]

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Don't do this.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
Just stop!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
Did you forget that
I said I'd kill ya?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME groans]

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
Kosame?

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
[GIL] Gotta say,
I wasn't expectin' that.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
I won't let it happen.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
'Cause Appare...
he gives me hope!

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
I won't let someone
like you take his life.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I...

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
Kosame? Kosame!

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
What'd you do?

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. I reckon I'll let
your buddy pay the piper.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
Y'all come find me when
you gather all that money.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
And in case it ain't clear,
I'm not a patient man.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.042 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Where are you going?!

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
Son of a bitch!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
Make way! Move it!

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.011 position:50% align:center
No, Sofia!

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
I'm here!

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.811 position:50% align:center
Sofia!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA]
Al!

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
Sofia!

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME breathing heavily]

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
What the hell's happening?
Why did he--?

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
Why'd you do that, Kosame?

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
Honestly... I just thought that
I was doing what I needed to do.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
It's not every day that I get
the chance to see you panic.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
Just try to breathe, okay?

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
It's bad. There's so much blood.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
If we don't get him
to a hospital soon...

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Shit! Damnit!

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.984 position:50% align:center
Just move!

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
I need you to start right now!

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
Start, damn you!

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Appare.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
I'll look for another car.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
Keep pressure on it.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
Just hang in there,
Kosame! Stay with us.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Calm down.

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
That's the...
best thing about you.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:43.011 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?
What are you tryin' to say?

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Don't give up...
whatever happens.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
The race isn't over
yet, you know.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's you...

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
You're gonna reach
the finish line.

00:21:56.358 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
Just say... here we go...

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
Please, no. Kosame!

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center
You can't leave me! Kosame!

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
Kosame!
