[APPARE] As Kosame hung
on the brink of death

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.849 position:50% align:center
with a bullet in his gut, I
broke down in the pouring rain.

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Never scare me like
that again, Kosame!

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
Now that our hope
has been renewed,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50% align:center

finish this race!

[music playing]

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
[SETH] We've heard back
from the police.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
Indeed, they found
the train Gil hijacked

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
about 90 kilometers out.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
As expected, they've set up camp
in an old railway town nearby,

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
most likely with
the hostages in tow.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
I managed to gather
part of the ransom.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
It's well short of
what they demanded,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
but hopefully, they'll at least
be willing to negotiate with us.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
I'd like to avoid violence
if at all possible.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
You figure Gil wants the same?

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
How many men has he got?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
A hundred and change, at least.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
Though we should assume
that he has more.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
I get to kill Gil.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Of course, I took the precaution

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
of procuring guns
and ammunition.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
You're too kind, sir.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
And if you'd all be willing
to hold off for just a while,

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
we could request the National
Guard be deployed from Chicago.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
That dog ain't gonna hunt.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Once the Guard shows up,

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
that ghost town'll be a
full-blown battlefield.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
Then first, we must
get Sofia to safety.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
Still get to kill Gil.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center

And a kid?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
Okay, point taken,

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
but there's also a desk jockey
who's never fired a gun!

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
What are you so worried about?

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center

of the Thousand Three.

be all we need.

There is still one problem.

That bridge is going to take
several days to rebuild.

We know.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
Y'all I got one plan
and it works every time.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna roll up in there

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

and the red one if you find Gil.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
Go towards white and run away
from the red. Makes sense.

if we see them both?

Damn it all.

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
I only left 'em alive so
they could die watching me

Otherwise, I would've
left 'em for the vultures.

But if they're here,
I'm willing to bet

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
we'll find Al Lyon and all
them skulkin' about, too.

Build a totem for me out
of their flesh and bones.

This dead town will
stand over the plains

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center

I thought we were
to avoid fighting.

they don't hit back.

that new weapon yet.

we're ready to take on Gil.

Perhaps that's wise.

They're like flies on shit!

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
So he can fire multiple
projectiles with every shot.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
It won't blast through stone,

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
but you'll likely
hit your target.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
Knowing that is no help right
now. We need to get closer!

Where is Sofia?!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center

No, sirree. Not when the

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
To-To kill them?

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
[GIL]
No!

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[GIL] I said, "Guts like
goddamn garlands!"

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
I'm guessin' you ain't just
gonna let us leave, huh?

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Look!

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
Okay. Good to go?

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
Let's move!

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
There's the range!

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
Quit wastin' my time, kid!

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
Gotcha!

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
Hangetsu Ittoryu secret move!

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.554 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Majestic Crimson Moon Halo!

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What was that?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
It's just a net that
I can electrify.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
Anyway, are you okay?

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
More or less.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
I can keep going.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
Gil gave us instructions:

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
"String their guts
up like garlands."

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
I've gone through
tougher things than you

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
just trying to get here.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
I beat back the tides.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
I've done what the whole
world told me I couldn't do.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
We're not the same.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
I don't need to follow orders
from some pig of a boss

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
to live my life.

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
The only person who can
tell me what to do is me!

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Hell's bells. Who are you?

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
My name's Jing Xialian.
I'm a racer.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Back off!

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
Now what was that, little man?
Sounded like, "Kill me first."

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[TRISTAN growls]

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Get your hands off him.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO yelps]

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
[TRISTAN] Tryin' to hurt
my buddy like that?

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
You got no right!

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
[TRISTAN yells]

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
[SNAKE C groans]

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Tristan!

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, bud, I'm fine!

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Good, thanks for the help.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
[TRISTAN]
Now let's go!

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:22.949 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Right!

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
Step aside, swine!

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
This man.

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
Al!

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
He was one of Gil's hostages.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
Somebody fired the white
signal, too. Sofia's alive.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Guys!

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
You're here.
Good to see you safe.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
Indeed. So the signal came
from either Seth or Chase.

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
[gunfire]

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
Sofia!
