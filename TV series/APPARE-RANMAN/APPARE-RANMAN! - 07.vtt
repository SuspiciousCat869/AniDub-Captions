Yeah?

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.441 position:50% align:center
All right then, you sing, too!

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
Like it or not, we're all
the company we got!

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
[TJ laughs]

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Huh?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hold up now!

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
Man! I don't wanna get
stuck looking at your tail!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
That's the last ridge up ahead.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Then we're out of Death Valley.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
We're making good time.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
The path gets narrow and
extremely steep ahead.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
In our tongue, it is called
Bloodstained Pass.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
We can't risk that
drive after dark.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
We should make camp
and wait here till dawn.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
--[AL] Whoa.
--Not bad.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
It's not just cars
that need fuel, right?

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
You seem like a great cook.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
Well... my mother passed on
when I was quite young.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
Someone had to step up to
take care of my little sister.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
What for?

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
Well, I should go try and
hunt something for dinner.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.232 position:50% align:center
We'll need a fire.
I'll go get us some wood.

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
Right. I will fish.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
I guess this means
that you get to be

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
the useless one
for a while, huh?

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Huh?

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
I'll help.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
Great, I've got
a fishing partner

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
who's smarter than
a fish this time.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can--

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
Uh. What'd you bait it
with? I didn't see.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
A potato.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
All I need is one rope
and a couple of trees

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
to set up this neat little
snare trap I designed.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
Then if I can scout out a
few game trails around here

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
and set up some more of them--

--[APPARE yelps]

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
Nice! Got one!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
Hey, Appare,

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
could you do me a favor and
take a look at the Lotus?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the meal.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Hey, Appare, dinner's ready!

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
My friend, you are
quite the chef indeed!

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
It's been some time
since I cooked for anyone

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
who could appreciate flavor.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
So, how long is it
until sunrise?

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
Should be six hours or so.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
I expect by then Gil and the
rest will have entered the city.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Assuming we take off
at the crack of dawn,

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
we should be able
to catch up with them

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
before they start the next leg.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
Indeed, we'll catch them.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
I cannot allow such a coward
to hold a lead over me.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Those men murdered my father.
I won't let them get away.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
Say, come to think of it,
we never properly thanked you.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Huh?

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
It was only thanks to your
warning we made it out here.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
Had you not nearby,

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
we'd be on a long,
perhaps eternal, detour.

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
But all I did was
tell Appare

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
what I had overheard
those guys saying.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Hototo.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN gasps]

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to forget
about your dinner, buddy.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Come on, now, Hototo,
you didn't grow up in a barn.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Hototo?

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
We picked up a spare.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
You see nothing wrong with that?

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
Would you like some apple,
too, original Hototo?

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
Oh, do I smell jealousy?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
Gosh, he's a cutie-pie.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Huh?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
"He"? Elaborate. Which "he"?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
Well, they both are!

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Yeah... the kid'll
outgrow it before long.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Don't call me a kid.

[KOSAME'S MOM]
Kosame!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
Mother? What...?

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME screams]

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.166 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] It's chillier
than I expected at night.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
I take it something's
keeping you awake?

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
It's the hybrid engine.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
Shutting it off would've been
the smartest thing to do.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
And I waited for Hototo.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
Am I... maybe turning
dumb or something?

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME chuckles]

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
How is that funny?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
And why'd both Al and Xialian

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
throw away their
positions to help us?

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
They wanna win this race
just as badly as we do.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.030 position:50% align:center
Everybody's acting insane.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Because people aren't machines.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
And sometimes, we all do
irrational things. Even you.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
We're only human, right?

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
We think with more
than just our brains.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
There are three inner
voices that guide us.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
Our heads, our guts...
and our hearts.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, this is
making my skin crawl.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
It's important being
able to feel that.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Why is Mr. Oldin not here?

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry, sir,

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
but he's reported to have left
Lancaster exactly on schedule.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
Does he understand how much
money I'm pissing away

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
to field a member of the
"fearsome" Thousand Three?

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt
he'll make it here.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
After his eight-hour break,

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
front-runner Gil T. Cigar is now
ready to continue the race!

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
All right, time for a leisurely
cruise from here to New York.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
You kiddin' me?

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
Dylan and TJ?
They're here already?

Never mind, just the
leftovers catchin' up.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
There's Al!

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Gil T. Cigar has
been cleared to roll out!

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
[CHASE] Move or I'm
runnin' you all over!

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
Hell. Your call, kid.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.117 position:50% align:center
But in case you couldn't
tell by lookin',

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
this machine's gonna
grind you into stew meat

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
if you don't move your ass now!

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
Stop! Mr. Lyon, what is the
meaning of this disruption?

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
His goons destroyed the cliffs
at the Valley of Despair.

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
They what?!

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
'Cause if I got goons,
nobody ever told me about 'em.

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
Hey, come to think of it,

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
nobody ever told me
about any rule

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.887 position:50% align:center
sayin' we couldn't blow up some
rocks if we wanted, either.

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
Well, there is no rule
directly pertaining, but--

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
Say it loud!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
He's right! There is no rule!

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
Good, now get outta the road!

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
Unless you feel like pickin' a
fight with the Thousand Three

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.485 position:50% align:center
and turnin' these people's
town into a warzone.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
Stand aside, friends, and let
us settle it on the course.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
No.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
He knows about the man who
stole everything from us,

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
and I'm not moving from
this spot till he tells me.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
How bad do you want
me to kill you, kid?

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Hototo, we can--

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Stay back!

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
He's here.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
My enemy is standing right
here in front of me!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
I was alone.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
For so long, it was just me,

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
searching for what
taken--what was ours.

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
Horses, our land, our home.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
I refuse to return to
my mother and family

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
until I can give them
what belongs to them!

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
Even then... I'm still never
gonna see my father again.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
And the life we had before--

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
a life of real freedom,
without fear--

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
we can never get that back!

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[sighs] A real tear-jerker,

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
but I still got no interest
in your dead dad.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
So what are they waitin' for?

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Is this a race or a play?

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
Outta the road!

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
Move, ya damn injun!

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
Yeah, get lost!

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
[MEN shouting]

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Stop this!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Enough. He's only a boy!

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
[MEN gasping]

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you sure about all that?

Don't you touch him!

[GIL]
Stop!

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
All of you, please stop.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
I can feel all that
pain of yours,

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
and part of it's
on account of me.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Enough. I'm done keepin'
up with this lie.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
I am not gonna be the guy
who'd do that to a little kid.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Hey, you all right, bud? Here.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
[sighs] And we damn near
pulled it off, too.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I've missed something.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Then this man isn't Gil?

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
He's an impostor who borrowed
his name to enter the race.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
Cat's outta the bag.

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
We ain't the Thousand Three,

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
but you could walk into every
watering hole in the midwest

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
and not meet a single soul
that hadn't heard of us.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
Just ask the barkeep
about the Bad Brothers.

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
The who?

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.618 position:50% align:center
This guy's my little
brother, Tristan.

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
The plain truth is, we're not
the ones who did your father in.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
And we can't point you to the
ones that did it, neither.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Didn't mean to get
your hopes up, kid,

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
but we do follow a code.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
No matter what,
no women and no children,

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
and no stealing from people
who have less than we do.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
[AL] Then why would
you assume a name

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.764 position:50% align:center
as tainted as that
of Gil the Butcher?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
Scary name like
that gets everybody

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
to clear a path for ya.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
Gives you a pretty big leg up
in an auto race, ya know?

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
Besides, it didn't bother
"Fancy Lad" here at all.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50% align:center
He thought havin' Gil around
would liven up the race.

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
He was more than happy
to have us sign up!

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
[grunts] You lied your way in.
What kind of scum--?

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
You can cram it!

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
We're outlaws, you got that?

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
No worse than the men
your companies hired

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
to drive their cars.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
You sayin' that's a problem?

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Mr. Carter,

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
did you conduct any sort
of research into these men?

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Well, no.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
I suppose it didn't
strike me odd,

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
given Gil's
mysterious reputation.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
Guess that means
everything's settled.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
No need for us to stick around.
See you all at the finish line.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
Hey, there weren't
any rules saying

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
you can't disassemble an
opponent's car, were there?

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
[SETH] Uh. Again, there's no
specific rule stating you can't.

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
Okay. Good to hear it.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center

Huh?

No way that takes 'em
less than eight hours.

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
The rules say it's fine.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
Well, dang, bub,
they got us pretty good.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
I already told you not
to call me "bub," okay?

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
Slipped my mind, bub. Sorry,
won't let it happen again.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
Sofia.

00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see you safe.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.515 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui!</i>

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
Don't we need to get your car
over to the pit, Appare? C'mon.

I know that I can fix it
in eight hours though.

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

[KOSAME] Stop putting
yourself in danger.

00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
It won't help.

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center

back what you've lost.

Shut up. What would you know?

have given up their position!

How much time are
they going to lose
