Shouldn't I be the one
asking you that?

What's wrong?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Uh. Pardon?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
You haven't said anything
for some time now,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
which means there's
something on your mind.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
Sofia, perhaps it's best

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
if you continue to
New York ahead of me.

There's a train that
departs from this town.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
I understand that you're here
at my father's request,

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
but at any moment, this
race could turn dangerous,

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
and we can't predict
how things--

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Then am I holding you back?

Not sure how to say it.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
Be prudent.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
There's no prize for those
who perish along the way.

over till you get home.

I can't drive the way
Dylan and TJ do.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I could win here

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
worth putting my
life on the line.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
There are bigger
things at stake.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
I can protect what matters
to me and still win this race,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
and that's how I've
chosen to live my life.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
Then I'll carry on
as I have been.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
I'll be safe with the team,

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
and I can trust you won't
put us in any danger, no?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
Count on me.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
I suppose we all have
our insecurities.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Uh! What does that have
to do with anything?

[SOFIA] Likewise. Practicing
swordplay during the race?

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
Yes, just to kill the time.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
And as the team's leader, I have
to prepare for any eventuality.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
Wonderful. I could go
for a brief spar.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
A spar? Wait.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
And I'll pay. The exercise
alone is worth the price.

[KOSAME]
Ah. You're quite skilled.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
I'm not surprised.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
That was good exercise.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Well, thanks!

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
Goodness me.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Kosame put up quite
a fight, indeed.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
He must be stronger
than he lets on.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
It looked closer than it was,

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
but I had some difficulty
getting an accurate read

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
of his ability when I faced him.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
As though his sword's edge
sought to hide from me.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Well, it was blunt, no?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
<i>Touché</i> , my dear.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
[AL]
But it's something else.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Like there's a fog where
its blade should be.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, guys,

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
but you really don't
need to buy me dinner.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Think nothing of it.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
Besides, the food from the
supply tent isn't very exciting.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Well, if you insist.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
Man, this really hits the spot!
It's tasty stuff, right, Hototo?

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so what?
Not like you made it.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
And all food is a...

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME, HOTOTO] ...bounty
granted to us by the earth.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I am the one
who bought it.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO grumbles]

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
Hey, what kinda
route do you have

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.067 position:50% align:center
mapped out for tomorrow, Appare?

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME
What route?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] We're going
through Death Valley.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Do we have other options?

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
The drive would be a lot safer

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
if you took the high road
and skipped the valley,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
but if you miss
that supply point,

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
you won't hit another one
for more than 600 kilometers.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
Death Valley is an
untamed wasteland

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
full of boulders and fissures.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
Nobody could make it through
driving by moonlight.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
We're gonna take off at midnight

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
and head out to the
Valley of Despair.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
When the sun comes up,
we'll enter Death Valley.

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's prob'ly how
everyone's gonna tackle this.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Wait, the Valley of Despair?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
It's a canyon that runs
down into Death Valley.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
A straight path with tall
cliffs on either side.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN A]
Case of beer, on the double!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN B] You heard him! Gil
and his boys need their suds.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
You don't want his whole
crew to come here

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
lookin' for 'em, now do ya?

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMEN laughing]

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
I'm heading out.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Right. I'll come with you.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
You go on ahead. I will
catch up with you later.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hm?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
I have a little
personal business

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
that I need to take care of.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
But at midnight,
we're taking off.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
I know.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely have
this handled by then.

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN A]
I gotcha, boss.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
Knockin' off Dylan and
TJ takes top priority.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
Once those two are gone,
the rest'll be easy pickin's.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
If we can block up the entrance
to the Valley of Despair,

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
the other teams won't have
a way to deal with it.

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
Then we roll up in this beast

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
and we plow through
that junk heap

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
like a knife through butter,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
riding into the canyon
ahead of the pack.

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
Once we're through
the tightest point,

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
we'll blow the walls
with dynamite behind us

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
so nobody else will
be able to get past.

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN A] Ah, sure,
that'll hold 'em up a while,

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
but why not blow the
walls once they get--?

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
Because, ya moron,
if we do that,

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
they cancel the race and
the prize money's gone.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
We just wanna stop 'em
from movin' forward.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMEN]
Oh.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
That's our plan, right, Gil?

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
Well, not to say nobody's
gonna get crushed by a rock,

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
'cause shit happens.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
[CHASE laughs]

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
The hell you doin'
here, rugrat?!

00:13:56.753 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
That kid heard us.
This could be a problem.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
Boy, was that ever a feast!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hototo! I grabbed us
something to snack on later.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
Can you find a place to stow it?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
Hototo? Are you in there?

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Any idea where he
would have gone?

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
He didn't say.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
Just something about dealing
with personal business.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
Huh? What kind of
personal business?

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
Ain't right to spy
on people, punk.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
I wasn't!

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to find the man
who took my father's life.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
Someone with a snake tattoo
like that on his neck!

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
You think I give a damn
about your dead dad?

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
You filthy murderer!

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
Cut me loose!
Let me go right now!

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
Easy, Gil.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
You can leave this to us.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
All right, boys, stuff the
brat into one of the boxes,

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
and then in the
morning... kaboom!

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
[CHASE laughs]

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
He's late, and it's
the dead of night.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
You just let him wander off
without asking why?

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
What if I had?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
He's got his business and I've
got stuff to deal with, too.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME gasps]

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
You know we're all supposed to
be in this together, don't you?

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:14.622 position:50% align:center
As much as he hates it,
he's still a kid.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
I'm going to look for him.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
Hototo!

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
Where did you go?!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
Hototo!

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
Hey, there. Everything okay?

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Oh, uh... Richard, was it?

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
You haven't seen
Hototo, have you?

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
The kid about yea high?

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
No, have you lost
track of him?

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
Well, see...

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
That's not good.
So he's looking for revenge?

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
The man he's trying to find has
a snake tattooed on his neck.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
Gil the Snake, surely.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
There's not a bounty hunter in
the land who wouldn't know that.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
Gil and his crew
set up camp somewhere

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
not far outside the city limits.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
your young friend is
looking for 'em now.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN D]
Okay, boss, everything's ready.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
We can set up the trap.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
Now get the crew together
and start heading that way.

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
Then Gil and I'll
catch up later,

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
and once the time
comes, we can--

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hello! Good evening, sirs!

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN D]
Hey!

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN B]
Who in the hell are you?

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
Yes, hi, sorry to intrude,

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
but I was looking
for a friend of mine.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
Little guy who
answers to Hototo.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
We ain't seen any Ho-to-tos.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
And you ain't gonna be
seein' the sun come up

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
if you give ol' Gil an excuse.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
[banging]

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tell me what you
have in that box!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
Come and look for yourself.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
But know this: If I'm
gettin' up for nothin',

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
there's a heavy price
to pay, friend.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. Well, I know
I heard a sound.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Thank you. It's a nice box!

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
Hotot-- Oh?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
Now then, time for
you to settle up, pal.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hototo!

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
You made everybody worry!

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
You naughty little boy, running
off on your own like that!

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
Now, that's enough fun,
let's head back.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
Found him! Thanks, gentlemen!
Have a good night!

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Hototo, you sneaky
little-- Mwah! Mwah!

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
[engine roars]

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hm? Huh?

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] The frontrunners
will be leaving

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
in less than 30 minutes,

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
and the starting line is
suddenly roaring back to life!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
He's still gone.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:52.113 position:50% align:center
What'll we do if he doesn't
make it back here in time?

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Obviously we'll
leave without him.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Would you rather sit around here

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
and wait on him, then?

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
Because that would basically
amount to forfeiting the race.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
But--

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
He's doing exactly
what he came here for,

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
just like I'm doing right now.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
You're free to stay here
and wait for him if you want.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
I can keep going alone.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN A]
How's this for a good spot?

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
[HENCHMAN B]
It'll do.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
[muffled screaming]

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui!</i>

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] The racers
will be departing in order

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
based on their time
for the first leg!

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Next up, TJ!

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You're just gonna
leave Hototo stranded out there?

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
You've already asked me that.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] Xialian sets out
with Richard close behind her!

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
Off they go, into the night!

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
No. How is it already our turn?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER]
And bringing up the rear,

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
Appare in car number 0
is ready to launch!

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
Hototo!

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
Fine. Just go, dammit!

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER] And Appare has
failed to start his car!

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
His engine winds down.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
Is this mystery machine
on the fritz? What gives?!

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
The other teams won't actually

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
head into Death Valley
till dawn anyway.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
And they won't be driving
at full speed in the dark.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
I can keep working for a while

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
and we'll still be able
to catch up with the pack

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
at the Valley of Despair.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
Plus, if Hototo is
really gone for good,

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
we can dump his rations.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
Less weight equals
better mileage.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
Appare, I knew it.

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Ah, crap.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Hey, pick that up. Hurry!

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Here!

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Besides, I'm so close.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
Just a bit more and this
machine will be reborn.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
I'm gonna go look again!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Hmm. Okay, okay.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
[TJ laughs]

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
[cow moos]

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hototo! Hototo!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
Is that him?

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
Hototo! Where were you?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
[rooster crows]

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Appare!

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
They're back!

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What is that?

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Picked up a spare Hototo.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hototo!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
Okay! Now, let's roll!

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
Where'd you run off to?
I was really worried about you.

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:59.903 position:50% align:center
But we've got a bigger
problem now!

00:22:03.406 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
With dynamite?

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
So he said.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.202 position:50% align:center
They could hurt Xialian and Al,

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:10.163 position:50% align:center
and Death Valley would become
completely impassable.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:11.247 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
We'll stop them.

00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:12.707 position:50% align:center
How? There's no way
we can catch up!

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Didn't you hear me?

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
Our machine has been reborn.
