[XIALIAN] I was driving
the track at night

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.097 position:50% align:center
when Appare and Kosame
popped up outta nowhere!

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.725 position:50% align:center
These guys think they can win
the Trans-America Wild Race?

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
Still, Appare touched
on a dream of mine

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
that may not be so
impossible after all.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
Be careful, you guys, the
world is not a gentle place.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.281 position:50% align:center
Attaboy. Can't waste the hooch.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
Wait! How'd you--?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.952 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
Listen, if you wanna live,

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
you best not touch that heater.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're playin'
with fire, pal!

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.665 position:50% align:center
Back off!

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
This guy, uh--this gentleman--
is Dylan of the Thousand Three.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50% align:center
The Thousand Three?

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.008 position:50% align:center
I don't cotton to that
title, you get me?

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.014 position:50% align:center
You saved our lives.
Thank you, sir.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
Y'all need to get on outta here.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.934 position:50% align:center
This ain't no place to
be takin' a little kid.

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:25.353 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, but he's not
here with us. We only--

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:26.688 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.983 position:50% align:center
Have you seen a man with
this tattoo on his neck?

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN] Whatcha gonna
do when you find him?

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
I will take back what's
ours--what was stolen!

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
You'll get yourself
killed. Forget it.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.911 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Wait up!

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
Do you know something
about this guy?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hey.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.461 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the guy who was
driving that fancy car earlier?

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.504 position:50% align:center
You want my John Hancock, kiddo?

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.089 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Nope.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
Remember me, 'cause someday,

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
you're gonna be tryin'
to catch up to me.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What's your problem?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
Don't be rude to this man--
he just saved us!

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
Do whatever ya want.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
I didn't save ya . I just tryin'
to enjoy a little firewater.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Oh, no! Kid! Are you okay?

[HOTOTO'S FATHER]
Run, Hototo! Get out of here!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.925 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
Father!

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
There's some food in
that bag right there.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
A storehouse down on the harbor.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:06.913 position:50% align:center
This is where we live.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
What are you doing?

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Turning a ship
into a car to enter a race.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
What? A ship into a car?

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
Oh, good, you're awake now.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
Agh.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
How many times do
I have to tell you

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
that's for my katana
not your rubbish?

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
My name is Kosame
and that man is Appare.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
You okay there, little boy?

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Are you alone?
Where's your family?

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Don't call me "little boy."

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
I'm called Hototo.
My family is far from here.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
My mother, my sister,
and my brothers.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
I came to this place
from far to the east

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
and far to the north,
all on my own.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
I'm here to take back what
was stolen from our tribe.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
And what was stolen from you?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] They took our horses
and land. Our home.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
And they...
took my father's life.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
I don't know exactly what
you've been through,

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
but once you've healed up,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
you should return
to your family.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
If these men took the
life of your father,

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.149 position:50% align:center
what can a child like you
do to bring them to justice?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Don't treat me like a child

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
when you're weaker than me.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
I won't forget the
kindness you've shown me,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
but I will never follow the
empty words of such a weak man.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
Hey, so far to the east and the
north means where, exactly?

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
It's around this area.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
It was farther to the east
before <i>they</i> showed up

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
and our land was taken from us.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
These mountains,

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
do you know of a route that
we could drive through them?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
And what's the
approximate elevation?

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
How steep's the incline?

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
You know of some places we
can resupply along the way?

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
What's the weather like there?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
Stop bombarding him with
questions and let him rest.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
He's injured.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
Sure, okay.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
This area doesn't get much rain.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
So that means it's possible
your only source of water...

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
We have to leave?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN A]
Yep, I'm sorry.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
Don't you have a heart, sir?

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
My hands are tied.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
A fellah came along
lookin' to rent

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
every last warehouse I've got.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
Some rich lad come
all the way from Europe.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
Said cost was not a barrier.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
His crew's unloading his cargo

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
from that great big 'un
over there as we speak.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
Where are you going, Appare?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
To tell him he can't.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
Hey! This ain't up
to you, ya know!

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's the spirit!

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I'm coming with you!

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
Take this to my
tent immediately.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
I need to inspect the contents.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
Al, why don't we all have
a nice tea and rest a bit

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
after such a long journey?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
Right as always,
Sofia. Thank you.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
You have a fire in you.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
Because I know that, not only
am I going to win this race,

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
I will also show
the entire world

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
that I'm talented enough
to take over BNW.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
You've got nothing
more to prove.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.615 position:50% align:center
Everyone already recognizes
how capable you are.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
No, they don't. Not yet.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
Automobiles are only
a fledgling part

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
of our family's
businesses at this point.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
But Father and my older brothers
refuse to hand over control

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
because they think I'm too
young and inexperienced.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
However, through
winning this race,

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
I will change my father's mind,

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.675 position:50% align:center
and also silence my
brothers' wagging tongues.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Excuse me!

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
Enjoy.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
Many thanks, miss.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
So you're saying that you
would like to keep using

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
the storehouses as you were.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
We would.

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
Aren't all of the other
empty ones enough

00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
to house everything
from your ship?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
If you truly believe
that my needs

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
are a matter of your concern,
you are gravely mistaken.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
I ask that you vacate at once.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
Now, Al.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
I'm not just keeping
my things in there.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
I need space to maintain
and test my machine,

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
a break area for my staff,
a place to train,

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
and a dog run for dear Alfred.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[barks]

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yelps]

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
It's barely enough as it is.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
What's your machine?

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Look behind you.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
The top drawer of BNW's
technology all in one beaut--

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Well, he's quite taken.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
So, uh...

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
Can't you find it in your heart
to give us a space to sleep?

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
I imagine there are plenty
of hotels nearby.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
We'll be making full
use of these facilities

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
until the Trans-America
Wild Race begins.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
Oh. You've come here to
enter the race as well.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
Indeed. My name's Al Lyon.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
And I shall be entering the race
under the banner of B.I.G. BOSS.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Specifically, I'm racing
on behalf of BNW,

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
thus I won't settle for
less than first place.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
So we're rivals.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
What? Wait, I'd no idea
you were competing.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
We are.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
Hey! A layman should not
be touching that!

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
So much more elegant
and well-honed

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
than any car I've
ever seen before.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Well, what do you expect?

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
There is simply no better
car in existence.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
Still, the basic design is
exactly like most other cars.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
And it's a bit too elegant.
Plenty of room for improvement.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
What do you know anyway?

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
Let's race. It'll be
your car against mine.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
What? Race your car?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
And if I win, we get to
keep using the storehouse

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
for as long as we need it.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
In ten days,

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
I'll turn that into a car
yours can't beat.

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
You realize that's just
a broken-down boat.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
[AL chuckles]

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
All right then, I agree.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
In ten days' time, we will
race wherever you like.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
And if you win, you are
free to use this place

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
in any way that you see fit.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
But I must know what the prize
will be if I'm the victor.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
You can use this place
however you like.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
Ah, but the storehouse
is mine to begin with,

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
so I would have nothing to
gain from that arrangement.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Then he'll commit <i>hara-kiri</i> .

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
I would never wish for that,

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
but there must
be something else.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
How about...? Ah! I take
your swords as my prize.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
My treasured katana have
been in the Isshiki family

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
for generations now.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
Then let's win.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
Oh, what if we have
the race in the ocean?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.093 position:50% align:center
Well, then we're sunk.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Oh? You know, you
really need to rest.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
Give your body
some time to heal.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
What are you doing with those?

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
You two barely have anything,

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
so I can't keep
living off of you.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
Did you steal those fish?

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
I caught them.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
You know, if you honor
and respect nature,

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
she will always provide for you.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
Here, there's one
for each of you.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
I'll be smoking the rest.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
I truly appreciate
your generosity,

00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
but a child like
you doesn't need

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
to take care of the
adults who have--

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
Okay, so you don't want one.
Appare, can you eat two?

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
And that's done.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What is that?

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
My windup-powered two-wheeler.
I'm goin' out for a bit.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
Hototo, could you
grill my fish for me?

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
Sure, okay.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Well, I have to turn this
thing into a car in ten days,

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna need to
find some more parts.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm coming with you! Oh.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
Can you keep an eye
on things here for us?

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
You're really not
getting fed, Kosame.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
Say what now?
The Trans-America Wild Race?

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
Our team's entering, aren't we?

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Of course we're not.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
We compete in that
and wreck our car,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
you can kiss this whole
ball of wax goodbye.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.168 position:50% align:center
Besides, our machines
aren't tough enough

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
to go all the way
across the country.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
That's the ticket, David!

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center

that up on the tr--

[XIALIAN]
Huh? Appare?

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
So this is okay?
We can just take this stuff?

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
This is basically a scrapyard
from all the wrecks we've had.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
The parts should still be good,

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
but we hardly ever
use any of them.

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
Once they need another
garage or something,

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
this'll all get thrown away.

Thanks very much.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
No problem. I actually
owed you guys a favor.

Well, Appare fixed your car,
I just watched him work.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you insisted
on it, Kosame.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
I wanted to supe it up
and make it go faster.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
Have you had the chance to
drive anymore since that night?

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
No.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Well, that's a shame.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.058 position:50% align:center
This place is a gold mine.

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
Do you really think you'll
be able to build a car

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
that can beat a BNW
in only ten days?

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yes. It'll be a short race.

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
A simple goal calls
for a simple machine.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
I've already drawn
up the blueprints.

But what if you lose?

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.240 position:50% align:center
The katanas are one thing,

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
but you'll be out on
the street, right?

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
It'll take time, but
you'll figure out that,

and lacking in manners,

his word is solid,
he never lies,

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center

that he can't deliver.

I can't believe I ever doubted
him, to be perfectly candid.

How're we going to carry all
of this stuff back with us?

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
I'll be back if I need more.

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
Come on, how about saying,
"Thank you very much"?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
You can come watch
the race if you want.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
You're a fool.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Your machine will never
be able to beat a BNW.

That's what everybody says.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
Just makes it more
interesting for me.

It seems like you're
pretty healed up, huh?

Well, guess kids
bounce back quickly.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
Weak men always
look down on others.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
That's what my
grandfather told me.

I'm not looking
down on you, okay?

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying that

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Where are they?

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
He must've realized his mistake

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
and chose to spare himself
the embarrassment.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
Look there.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Hm?

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
Speed it up, would you?
We're running late.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
In a duel of blades, whoever
shows up the latest wins.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
Hototo's beating us. Switch.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
No!

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
I remember what
happened last time,

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.555 position:50% align:center
and I'm not ready to die, okay?

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] You're being dramatic,
and there's a seatbelt now.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Forgive the delay.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
I won't scold you
for being tardy.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
Rather, I compliment you for
making it all the way here

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
in that inelegant contraption.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
I'll be taking that transport,

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
as well as your
swords, of course.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm ready.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
It's my warrior code!

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] Would you like me to
hold 'em till the race is over?

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Oh, Xialian. You're here, too.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So you actually
built the thing.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Sure did, and I'm
gonna win with it.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
Wow. I'm impressed.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
But I don't see this
thing having any chance

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
of beating his car.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.058 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but it seems
completely impossible.

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
[AL]
She's right.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
You two are like birds who
merely dream of flight.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
Let's begin. Although,
it's a total waste of time.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
I think that we should
change the plan

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
and have you drive instead.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
Good, because that
always was the plan.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
All right, this is
the starting line.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
We'll shoot the gap
between those rocks,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
then loop back around.

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
And the first one that touches
this tree is the winner.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
Since there's no road,

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
the whole wasteland
before us is the track.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Sounds perfect to me.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
So, are you ready?

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
--[KOSAME] Yes, I am.
--[APPARE] Yeah, you bet.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
Get set.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Go!

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.308 position:50% align:center
[AL]
I'm not holding back!

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
That is the noble thing to do!

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
Oh, dang! The BNW is so fast!

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry!

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Shut up or you'll end up

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
biting your tongue, Kosame.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
All right! Here we go!

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME screaming]

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
Appare turns into
a whole different person

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
when he's behind the wheel.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yeah!

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
No!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Ah, what fun!

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Of course they're no
match for his speed.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
Appare realizes that.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
Even so, he intends
to win today.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.562 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Got a cliff
coming up! Go around!

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Hold on tight, okay?

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center
Why?!

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
We're gonna show him
that these birds can fly.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
Ya see? Into the sky!

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME screams]

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
We can't fly! We're gonna die!

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yes!

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
The man's insane!

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50% align:center
But now we're all out of cliffs
he can launch himself from.

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
It's a battle of pure speed!

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Damn it! We're done.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Kosame, when I give the signal,

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
pull the red lever by your
feet as hard as you can!

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
What lever? Oh, that one.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
There's no way we're gonna lose.
The Appare will fly again.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? Again?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] 460 meters to
the finish line. 40. 20.

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
Now, Kosame!

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
Emergency acceleration
booster engage!

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Wait. Wait a second!

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
Something's wrong!

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
No!

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Whoa.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
I will not be defeated!

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
Run! Hurry!

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
They did it.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
Short after all.

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
Say what? "After all"?

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Nicely done, Appare.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
<i>I</i> crossed the finish line!

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Appare.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
You're a complete
and utter lunatic.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
This little trick won't work
in the actual race.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
But still, victory
is yours today.

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[AL] You developed
a cunning strategy,

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
chose the course,
and even built your own car.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
I chose to be complacent,

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
relying solely on my car's
performance, and I lost.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] But what about
the Trans-America Race?

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
That's actually my spare car.
I'm still entering the race.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
Driving a machine
that's even faster.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
All right! We've got a real car!

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.527 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but we'll
have to walk back.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Al!

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
I plan on building an even
better car for the big race.

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
Just wait.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
Next time, you're gonna be
behind me the entire way.

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui.</i> Until the point I cross
the finish line before you.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
Here, take this.
It's yours now.

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Uh. No.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
I do appreciate the
gesture, but I lost,

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
so I simply can't accept it.

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
I'll walk back.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
Well, if you don't
mind, I'll take it!

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Huh?

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
[SOFIA humming]

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.604 position:50% align:center
Oh, they just feel so
natural right where...

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
See ya later.

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
Hey, you sure you don't wanna
ride back with us in the car?

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:58.401 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Yep.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:05.533 position:50% align:center
I wonder... how far can I go?

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
This is gonna take a
little while to fix.

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.627 position:50% align:center
So, we're entering the big race

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
in that fancy car
we just won, huh?

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:19.422 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Huh?

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE A] I'd like you
to take care of this for me.

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center
We must let the whole world know

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
that this is not the dawn
of some new age, understand?
