[KOSAME] "I won't lose
my head, no matter what."

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.180 position:50% align:center
And that's the thought
that sealed my fate.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
Appare only thinks
about himself!

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
And as he makes his grand exit,

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
I get dragged along
for the ride!

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
Next thing I know, we're in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean!

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we were rescued,
but now we're in Los Angeles?

[ENGINEERS gasping, chattering]

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.181 position:50% align:center
Wow, this thing is
really somethin' else.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center
Good. No problem
with the engine.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can
fix the ship, Appare?!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.565 position:50% align:center
How long before we'll be
able to get back to Japan?

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Not happening.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh? Why not?

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I'm not gonna fix the ship.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:32.944 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Why not?

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.446 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Because it's experimental.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
And why does that matter?

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.407 position:50% align:center
So many questions.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
That's because I need answers!
Help me understand!

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.370 position:50% align:center
I've accomplished the
goal of the experiment,

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center
so repairing the ship to the way
it was would be pointless.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
Besides, it never had the range

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center
to cross the Pacific
in the first place.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't you just
try to improve it, then?

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
There are a lot of rudimentary
steamships around

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.508 position:50% align:center
that are good enough
to make that journey.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that our fine
ship is "rudimentary"?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
Yes. I am.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Do you really
have to be so rude?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
You do realize that it's
thanks to the nice captain

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
that we're alive and have
a place to stay right now.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
Ah, don't worry.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
We haven't used this
storehouse in quite a while.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
You can stay till someone
comes looking to rent it.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
Tell you what.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
You let me keep this little
thing, we got a deal.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Works for me.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
While you're at it, I don't
suppose that you'd be open

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
to taking us back
to Japan, would you?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
No, you fool.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
You really think I'm gonna
take you there for free?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
You're lucky I didn't
charge both of you

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
the fare for your
passage over here.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything you need.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
I can clean, or cook--
whatever to help.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
I already have cooks
and cleaners on staff.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
The genius might
actually come in handy,

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
but what else can you do?

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.099 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN A] Besides, I'm not
itchin' to hire a crewman

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
who's gonna jump ship as soon as
we get him where he wants to go.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEER A] Not to mention,
we're about to head through

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
the Panama Canal straight
on to the Atlantic.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
We won't be close
to Japan for a while.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
I see.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
I suggest you go get a job.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Because if you don't work,
you don't eat.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
And if you work like
a madman for ten years,

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
you might be able to charter a
ship back to your own country.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN A laughs]

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
We've crossed the ocean.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
We're here. We've come to...

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
...the country that
made the steamships.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Won't you please just
consider it? I'll do anything!

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A]
We're in the business

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
of making people comfortable,

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
so we can't very
well hire someone

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
from God only knows where!

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] What do you mean by
that? I'll tell you where!

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
I was born and raised
in Fuyutsuki, Shibaura.

My family name is Isshiki,
and my given name is Kosame--

Damn it.

Look, Appare, you're going
to have to find work, too.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
So you want me to hire you?

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:50.331 position:50% align:center
I have a small shop;
got all the help I need.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
That sounds perfect.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
It isn't like I
wanna work anyway.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
Some free time would be great.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
As long as you pay me a
decent wage, of course.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
So?

the places where I wanna work,

work at the places

have to look harder.

Your pride, what
you're eating today,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center

you're eating tomorrow.

No matter what we
have in reserve,

we can't rest on our laurels.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
But we have no reserves.

Isn't that enough, Appare?

I didn't take up the blade

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center

I'm up next.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
of the Big Three
automotive association--

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
that's B.I.G. BOSS
to you folks--

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
sponsors of the first
Trans-America Wild Race.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Allow me to present...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
...this modern
marvel of machinery!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
I welcome all competitors
who think they have a shot

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
against this masterpiece
of American engineering.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
If you've got what it takes,
come throw down the gauntlet!

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
There's a whopping 1.51 million
dollars up for grabs! That's...

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
Driving at such ungodly
speeds for no good reason?

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
Across an entire
continent, to boot.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
I do not see the appeal.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I'm gonna enter.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
This race. It's perfect for me.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] It would be quickest
to revamp the steam engine

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
and use that, but the other
cars don't run on steam.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
Considering our cruising range
and the distance involved...

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
Hmm. Nope, no good...

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
Poor Father and Fumi.

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they're
both worried sick.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder
if I'll ever be able

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
to get back to Japan.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
You really wanna get home, huh?

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!
I have a family, you know!

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
And my poor fiancée
must be heartbroken

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
to be kept waiting so long!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
They probably all just
think you're dead

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
and your engagement has
been broken off already.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
That make you feel better?

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
Do I look like I feel better?

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.329 position:50% align:center
"Ah, good, they think I'm
dead, that's excellent!"

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
It actually makes
things worse. Way worse!

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
You're a complex man, ya know?

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] The prize money
will get us back home.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
We get over a million
and a half dollars if we win.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, there is no way
we could ever pull that off.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Okay, if you wanna toil away
for ten years, that's on you.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
As for me, I'm planning
on crossing this continent

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
faster than anybody else.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
If you don't wanna join me,

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
I'll only need one
seat in my car, right?

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
No! I, uh...

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
[PATRON A]
Tough luck, kid.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
You really haven't seen him?

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
He's got this tattoo
on his neck.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[PATRON B]
No. Scram.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
What the--? What's the big idea?

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
Uh! Now, hold on!

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
You okay, little boy?

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50% align:center
[PATRON B]
Looky here.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
What are we, at the damn zoo?

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
[PATRON A chuckles]

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
Hey, little boy, wait.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
I'm not a little boy,
you got me?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
I guess you're not him either.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
How odd.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
No! What're you doing?

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.874 position:50% align:center
You said we were just going
to look from the outside!

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Yup. Tonight, we'll just look
at the cars from the outside.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
But we can't tell much
from outside the building.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we don't
have permission.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
Burglary always starts with
trespassing, you know?

00:11:58.677 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
If we're gonna be in this race,

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
we gotta see what
we'll be up against.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
You wanna go back
to Japan, don't you?

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hm?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
It's too dark. We need to
get some light in here.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
Dammit.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
[engine roaring]

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
Racing in the dark? Crazy.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
No! Appare!

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
Be careful!

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Uh?

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Oh, no.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Are you hurt?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yelps]

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
Uh... a woman?

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
Why are you sneaking
around here?

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.119 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, well...

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] We wanna see the
cars. Let me check it out.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
--[XIALIAN] Hey!
--Hold on, please!

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.001 position:50% align:center
We're not criminals--
we only came to look.

00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.836 position:50% align:center
But you're armed.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
Because of you two fools
I just wrecked my boss' car.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
That was quite a kick,
for a woman.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
You think a woman
can't hurt you, huh?

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
No! Wait!

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
I don't want to fight you!

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
Then get rid of your weapon!

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I can't
just lay down my katanas!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
If you must hit me, go on.

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN yells]

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yeah! I knew it!

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
So this car...
it's gas powered, right?

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
No time to lie around, Kosame.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Ouch!

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Okay, what do we have here?

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
Total displacement
is about 6200 CC's...

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
So,

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
you guys really broke in
here just to see the cars?

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
That's right.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
My name is Isshiki Kosame.
That's Sorano Appare over there.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
I apologize for breaking in.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
We don't want to cause
any more trouble.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
I'm in the same situation,
so I completely agree with you.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Meaning?

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
I work as a chore girl
here during the day,

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
but I snuck in tonight

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
to drive one of the cars
without permission.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:13.788 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
[engines roaring]

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] I came here
when I was a little girl.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
I was so impressed
by the drivers,

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:27.677 position:50% align:center
and somehow convinced them

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
to let me work here
doing small jobs.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
Right off... I learned
a tough lesson.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
Girls can't be racecar drivers.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
[MEN laughing]

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
They shouldn't drive at all.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
The only place for a dame

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
is in the passenger seat.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
[MAN C] They can drive...
after pigs fly!

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
If a gal wants to get
behind the wheel,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center
she should join the
circus, not the circuit.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
[MEN laughing]

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A] Lookit, Jing.
It takes a man to drive a car.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
Takes muscle and guts.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
And it ain't about the
fire in the engine.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
These babies run on the
fire in a man's heart!

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
It's unfair, but that's
just the way things are.

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
I see. So then, why
were you driving it?

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
Just to blow off some steam.
But now, those days are over.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Since I wrecked the car,
I'm definitely gonna get fired.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
And that's just if I'm lucky.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Both of us will swear
we didn't see anything.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
I can't lie to everybody
else like that.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
The drivers put their lives
in the hands of the mechanics.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
Lying about it means I'd
never get to be on the team.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
Uh. I don't quite
understand the problem.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
I thought you said women
weren't allowed to race cars.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
True.

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Then what's the issue?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
It may be forbidden,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:46.548 position:50% align:center
and the world may say they'll
never allow a woman to do it,

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
but I still don't
want to do anything

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
that would personally
disqualify me.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
I know. I sound like a fool.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hey!

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
How far can this thing travel
on a single tank of gas?

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Huh?

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
C'mon, now's not the time.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
50 to 55 miles, give or take.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.320 position:50% align:center
A 40-liter tank?

00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
It's 43.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
1.2 miles per liter.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
Why do you wanna
know about that?

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
We're going to build our own car

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
to compete in the
cross-country race.

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you serious?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Of course. And we'll win.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
Just a couple more idiots
who are in it for the money.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
Where are you gonna get
all the scratch for parts?

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
You know how to drive through
wild country without a road?

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
All while trying to
defend yourselves

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
from bandits and animals?

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
If you're lucky,
you'll break down

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
before you leave Los Angeles,
and if you're not,

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
you'll just die out in
the middle of nowhere!

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
We'll die out there?

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
Well, if it was easy,
it wouldn't be any fun.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I'll do something
no one else could do.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
And then the entire world
will know who I am.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, no one else can
do it 'cause it can't be done!

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
There's a huge difference
between what's impossible

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
and what's thought to be.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Like, is it impossible for a
woman to be a racecar driver?

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're a great driver.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
At least as good as
the guys we saw today.

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
And you seem to be
well versed in cars.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
What do you know anyway?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I don't know.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
That's the reason
I'm asking you.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
Why do you let others
choose your fate?

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Cut it out, Appare.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
Don't be pushy.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
You need to realize, though
you may have nothing to lose,

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
not everyone's situation
is the same.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Things are
more complex for you?

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
Either way, it's too
late at this point.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
I know I'm going to
get fired tomorrow.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Good night.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
You guys were able to break in,

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
so I trust you'll lock
up when you leave.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
We never got your name.
What is it?

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Xialian. I'm Xialian Jing.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
You have my deepest
gratitude, Miss Xialian.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.063 position:50% align:center
Feel free to look around.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's really no way
you two will ever build a car.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN'S MOTHER]
Oh, here are today's clothes.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Thanks.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
Mom?

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN'S MOTHER]
Mm-hm?

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] You'd be glad
if I took over the shop?

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I would.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
We're always so busy
and overworked.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
You're the only child we have.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
And someday, you'll get married

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
and inherit the
business from us.

00:19:57.864 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Sounds nice.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
I'll be back later.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
What? You broke Number Four?

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
I was driving it without
permission last night, and--

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
You outta your mind?

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
You must'a just dreamed it.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Look, ol' Number Four's
out there rippin' it up.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
I don't get it.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
That baby set a new record
here in the test run. Hey...

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
Wait, are those two
guys behind this?

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
No lollygagging, Jing.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
You ain't dreamin' now,
so get back to work.

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.900 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, sir.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
What you did was amazing.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
There was nothing
wrong with the engine

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
and lots of spare
parts layin' around.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
The world says they'll
never allow it.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
Well, I know that feeling.
I've heard it myself.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
They say that the new
world won't allow me

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
to keep my katana.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
That's easier said than done.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
Things have changed.
But I can't give them up.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
Well, let's head back
and eat dinner.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.481 position:50% align:center
Isn't it lucky for us
that storehouse

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
comes with a living space?

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
It's no palace, but it'll
suffice for the time being.

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
[THUGS chuckling]

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
You say somethin'
about a tattoo?

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
What'll you do,
chop down a tree?

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
Hey! That's enough!
Leave him alone!

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
He's just a kid!
What is wrong with you?

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
Whadda you care?
You his old man, or what?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
No, but I just saw that--

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
Then shut your hole!

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
These damn savages
need to be reminded

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
that we got rules
in this here country.

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
No, don't shoot him!

00:21:54.481 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME breathing heavily]

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
Kosame?

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
This oughtta calm ya down.

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
[THUG B]
The hell are you?

00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:17.462 position:50% align:center
Y'all best keep it down.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:19.714 position:50% align:center
You're killin' my buzz.
