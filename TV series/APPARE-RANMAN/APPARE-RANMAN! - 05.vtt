00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.512 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] I put my pride
on the line out there.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.681 position:50% align:center
You don't deserve to be
called a racer, coward!

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
In the end, I couldn't
pull it out,

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
but now I'm gonna show
the world what I can do

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
in the Trans-America Wild Race.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
The day has nearly come.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
From here on out,
Appare, we're rivals!

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A]
Hey. Coffee, over here!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Gladly, my friend!

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
And you.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A]
Thanks.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
And you.

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A]
Kosame!

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
Pack it in--we're done.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Yes, sir.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A]
Hm?

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
Ah. Forgot you were takin' off.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. The race
begins tomorrow.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A]
Here's a bit of severance.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.267 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
You're welcome here anytime.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
That means a great deal,
sir. Thank you.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
But I am going to win that prize
money and go back to my country.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
Don't get killed.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
Hey, Appare.
We need to get going.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
[breathing heavily]

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.634 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.059 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
What are you doing?

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.979 position:50% align:center
We have to hurry to the
pre-race party. But...

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.899 position:50% align:center
He's been working a few days
straight without any sleep.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:51.903 position:50% align:center
Whenever he does that, he goes
into hibernation afterwards.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
A bomb could go off in here
and he wouldn't even flinch.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you need to be
getting ready as well.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
What? Why?

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.706 position:50% align:center
You have to come.
You're part of the team.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
You mean you're allowing me to
join the race with you guys?

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.962 position:50% align:center
Wait, I thought you knew!
Didn't Appare tell you?

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.257 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Good grief.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
For the record,
I was against the idea

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
of bringing a kid along
for something so dangerous,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
but Appare figured you would
make an excellent guide.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
A guide?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
You know the terrain.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
And how to navigate
by the stars.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
Plus, you should be
able to help us find

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
food and fresh water
in the wilderness.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.568 position:50% align:center
You're honestly pretty
impressive, for a kid and all.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.445 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop calling me that.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50% align:center
He even said he planned
on telling you himself.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
But of course, you don't
have to come along.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
It'll be dangerous.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
I'll go. I owe that
much to Appare.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.622 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Perfect. Now go get ready.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
I meant joining the race.
I'm not going to the party.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.085 position:50% align:center
I don't care for crowds.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
They invited all the racers,

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
so we should at least
show some courtesy.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
Besides, we'll get a free
meal out of it, right?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Do you know if he'll be there?

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
Who's that?

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
Oh, from before. "Dylan"
or something, was it?

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, more than likely.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
Then I am going.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
Don't cause a scene, got it?

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
All I want is to ask
him one question.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Appare and I
each get 40% of the prize,

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
and you get 20, being,
as you are, a child.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO] Appare is the
mechanic. I'm the guide.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
What are you?

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
I'm the, uh...

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.507 position:50% align:center
I lead! So-- Oh?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
Is this the place?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
My expectations for our dinner
just went through the roof!

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
How can this man
possibly be sleeping?

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
Hey, you think he's faking it?

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Appare! Kosame! Hototo!

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
Uh! Xialian?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez. Is he okay?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, he's fine. But I'm
still a little bit in shock.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
That's quite a different look.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
You don't like it?

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I do. It's gorgeous.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
The whole team pitched in
to buy this dress for me.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
I'm here to make my debut as
a racer on the world stage;

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
I gotta look good.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
Hey, where are we right now?

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
Good, he's awake.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
See? And that's what
the leader does!

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Appare.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the help.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Shall we head in?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Let's.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
Evening.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
It looks like they sent
the invitations out

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
to more than just the racers.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
It's a real important deal.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
Fat cats from the
B.I.G. BOSS group.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
Some independent sponsors,
too. Newsmen.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
Even a few political
bigwigs in the mix.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Wow.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Thank you kindly.
Let's find our seats.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
I'll stay here long
enough to eat.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
There are more important
things I could be doing.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
What a snappy way of saying it.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
You're right, you still
need to finish the car.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really?

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
[RECEPTIONIST A]
Pardon me, sir.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid I can't let
you enter wearing that.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What?

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.934 position:50% align:center
You see, this party
has a dress code.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
I don't think I follow you.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
[SETH] You did read
the invitation, surely?

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
No, why would we?

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
And you are?

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
The name's Seth Rich
Carter--remember it.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the people
organizing this race.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
Your invitations
specified formal attire.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
You, madame, are free to enter.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
As for these other--
what's the word?

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes.

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
Slobs.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
I've seen circus monkeys dress
better for an evening like this.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
This is my formal attire, sir.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
And here's exactly
why I hate crowds.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
These men are in the race.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
They have a right to draw
for their starting position,

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
same as all the rest of us.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
I suggest they
start at the rear

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
so as not to impede the
other racers' progress.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, now...

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
That car of yours,

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
you built it from scratch
like the papers say?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
[SETH laughs]

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
You bumpkins are
in over your heads.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME growls]

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Appare, you need
to say something!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
I'm walking out the door
if someone doesn't feed me.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
I meant something snappy to
convince him not to kick us out!

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
Oh, ushers! These monkeys
need to be corralled!

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
You boys are out of your element

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
and I don't want this
becoming a scene.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
Crazy... TJ?

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
I know that name.
He's one of the Thousand Three.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
What is the Thousand Three?

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Three legendary outlaws

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
who could beat a
thousand men apiece.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
At one point, they were
all part of a bigger crew

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
called the Thousand Seven.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Whatever happened
to the other four

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
seems like these guys
are all that's left.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me. I heard
there was a party here.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
Saw somethin' about
a dress code.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
How's this?
I won't cause offense?

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:02.130 position:50% align:center
No, not in the least, sir.

Yeah, I thought so.

Huh? Who the hell
is this guy here?

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
I could ask you the same thing.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid, how'd you get
your hair like that?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
You're the one whose
hair looks like

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
you stood next to an explosion.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
Please don't say
things like that!

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
Man, I like you. You're funny!

Come on inside and
grab a drink with me.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.292 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I'll pass.
I don't drink alcohol.

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
And back off!

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
Now, may we go in, sir?

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
[groans] Land's sake.
Fine, then. Take this.

[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center

Huh? Yes. I find these
events tiresome.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
Then, shall we leave?

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh... I'm not at
liberty to do that, no.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to get used
to this sort of thing

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
if I'm to fill Father's shoes.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed.

The younger Lyon.
What a pleasure to see you here.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center

for such formality.

You're welcome to
call me "Seth."

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
Have you lost your
tie somewhere?

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I suppose
I should explain.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
There are some unsavory sorts
among our competitors,

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
one to whom I lent my necktie,
so you'd do well to be--

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
There you are, Al!

00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Ah. Hello, Kosame!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Good evening to you, Miss Sofia!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Yes, likewise.
Your tie is lovely.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
It's my formal attire.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Where's Appare?

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
Back there.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
You know these people?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Indeed. Appare's my rival.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
You're joking!

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Appare, you've finished
your car by now, right?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
He's serious.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening!

00:08:56.578 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
Our sincerest thanks for joining
us in this pre-race celebration!

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
If you couldn't tell
from the name,

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
our racers will be blazing
a trail from coast to coast

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
across these United States in
whatever vehicles they choose!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
The race begins here in
Los Angeles, California

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
and ends in New York, New York.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
And how much cash is
at stake, you ask?

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
1.51 million dollars!

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
The rules are simple.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
No changing vehicles mid-course.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
That means you can't have
the train haul you either.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
If a team decides to make
use of a supply point,

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
they won't be allowed
to leave that city

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
for a minimum of eight
hours after pulling in.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
But the true race is
from LA to New York,

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
so it's up to the racers
where they stop in between.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Quicker if we skip
them, isn't it?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
But there's no way you
can make the whole drive

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
in one straight shot.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.920 position:50% align:center
It's a long way between places
you can fill up your car.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
They put those supply points
pretty much everywhere

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
you can get gas between
here and New York.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
Even so, doesn't
ours run on steam?

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
For now.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.304 position:50% align:center
For now?

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
That's the point o' this race.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
All the folks who put this
production together

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
just so happen to be sellin'
cars that run on gas.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
And funny enough,
all the places sellin' gas

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
just so happen to be right there
handy to the resupply points.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Top o' that, whatever line
they wanna try and sell us,

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
'bout those mandatory
eight-hour pit stops?

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.741 position:50% align:center
End of the day, they got longer
range, deeper pockets,

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
and an army of mechanics.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Driver pulls into the shop,

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
they can just about build a new
car under him in eight hours.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
As for the rest of us,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
we get to waste a day
twiddlin' our thumbs.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
That's not fair.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Maybe not, but you can't drive
from Los Angeles to New York

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
without stopping for supplies.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
There's no way.
Them's the breaks.
