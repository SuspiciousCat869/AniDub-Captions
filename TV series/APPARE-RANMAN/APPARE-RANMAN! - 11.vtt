[TJ]
Gil finally made his move,

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.681 position:50% align:center
and his poison claws
cut straight to our souls!

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
Damn, this guy is
good at bein' bad!

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.476 position:50% align:center
Kosame stepped up
to protect Appare,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
but caught a bullet for it.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
Now the bleedin' won't stop!

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
This whole thing's gone to
hell in a handbasket, y'all!

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Kosame!

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.618 position:50% align:center
Open your eyes. Come on!

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.621 position:50% align:center
What did you just do?
Kosame, wake up!

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] The cars won't start.
We're stranded!

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Kosame!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] We gotta get
him to a hospital now.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
He's losing blood fast.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.050 position:50% align:center
I can help carry him!

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
It's too far to travel on foot!

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
And besides that, if we can't
slow down the bleeding first,

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50% align:center
he won't last the trip.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.102 position:50% align:center
What can I do? Tell me!

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
He can't die. Not like this.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
Put pressure on it!

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
That's all we can do right now.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
You with me? We just
have to stay calm.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.490 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
Hey!

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
[horn honks]

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
That doesn't look right.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.710 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] Chase! We could
use a hand over here!

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
I was able to remove the bullet

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
and stitch up the wound.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
But considering the
volume of blood he lost,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
it remains in question
whether he's ever

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
going to regain consciousness.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
Do you know of any next
of kin we should notify?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
He has a family, but they
don't live in this country.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
They're way off across
the sea in the far east.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
That's unfortunate.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
Kosame.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
Wake up.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Wake up and tell me
what you were doing!

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
What you did just
doesn't make sense.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Appare!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Shouldn't you
stay by his side?

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
What good is that gonna do?

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
Really, what good
have I ever done him?

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
[SETH] I want a thorough
inspection of every car.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
I expect we'll be unable
to continue the race,

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
but spare no detail
in your reports.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow I'll need to offer
a full statement to the press

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
--on our next move.
--[AL] Mr. Carter!

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Mr. Lyon.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry Sofia was
dragged into this.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Indeed.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
I will need this area
to work on my car.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
It's yours, of course, but we
have something to discuss.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
Quickly! I don't
need it perfect!

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Just get the car running
as soon as you're able!

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[MECHANICS]
Yes, sir!

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
[SETH] I've requested the
help of law enforcement

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
in the search.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
We're certain to find
the train before long.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
But still, Gil and his
gang are ready to fight.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
The police can't
simply charge in.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
Then I see no reason
to wait for them.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Mr. Lyon.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Appare!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
How is Kosame?

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
"In question."

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
'Least, that's how
the doctor put it.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
Your machine is also
in quite a bad way.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it will take
some time to fix.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I'm not fixing it.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
Huh? But why not?

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] It's useless.
Just a stupid toy I made.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
Kosame was right about
this race from the start.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
All we're doing is driving
at ungodly speeds

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
for no good reason.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
How could it be worth all this?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
Now is not the time to despair!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
I need my car back in working
order so I can rescue Sofia.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
Please, Appare,
lend me your efforts!

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
I can't help.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I can do.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
How could I not see
how weak I was?

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN] Been tryin'
to tell you for years.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like dealin'
with you right now.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
Sit and laugh if you want.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
Just don't expect me to
thank you for helping.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
He laid me out like a rug.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
Huh?

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
If you'd held on
a little longer,

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
you'd have gotten
to see it yourself.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
He snatched my picture
of Claudia offa me.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
Just lost my head.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
So that's what did it.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50% align:center
I told you more than once.

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
That woman has always been
your biggest weakness.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare speak ill of her!

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
I'm speakin' ill of you, man.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
She was an angel come to Earth

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
and she ended up gettin' dragged
down with all your shit.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
I sometimes think...
if you'da won back then,

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
and stolen Claudia away
like you wanted...

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
If it'd been you, then
maybe she'd be alive now.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
That's why you
didn't deserve her!

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
She not some prize
you won in a gunfight.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
She chose to stay with you!

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
And if that still
hasn't sunk in,

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
it's no wonder why you hung up
on some itty-bitty photograph.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
May be.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.944 position:50% align:center
Hey, buddy.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
How is he?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
[TRISTAN]
I'm sorry.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
This is for you.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.328 position:50% align:center
You still gotta eat somethin'
and try to rest a bit.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
I know, but I'd be dead
if it weren't for Kosame.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
That's why I owe it to him
to be here when he wakes up.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[CHASE]
Hm?

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
Hey! What was that?

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
Go get in there, pal!
Visit your friend!

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
I'm just... I'm gonna go
do something else right now.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
[APPRA] What would be the point
of going in? It's useless.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
I don't guess you'd be much
help walkin' into the hospital

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
lookin' like a kid
who just found out

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
there ain't no Santa Claus.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
Have some pie.

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
After the day you've had,

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
that brain of yours must
be runnin' on fumes.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
I'm not hungry.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
What, you need a silver
spoon to eat it with?

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
In these parts, you don't
turn down a meal

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
when it's offered, ya hear me?

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
Any chance you get, you eat!

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Never let a bite of
food go to waste!

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.938 position:50% align:center
That's part of the code that
keeps outlaws like us alive.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
Don't forget it!

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Correct.

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
As best we can tell,
he has three hostages,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
including the woman.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
There's also one of my
fellow GM executives

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
and another from Iron Motors.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[POLICE CHIEF A] I'm not
throwing our whole department

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
into a firefight over
three damn people!

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
But, sir--

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
[POLICE CHIEF A]
You B.I.G. BOSS fat cats

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
are the ones who brought the
Thousand Three into the race.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
You told us to leave 'em be,
now you want us to take 'em out?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
It's a complicated situation.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
[POLICE CHIEF A]
Mine's not exactly simple here!

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
I'm saying I can't help you.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
We're short-handed as is,
and if I get my officers killed

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
trying to take on Gil the
Butcher, my reputation is shot.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
The reports you
requested, sir.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Yes, I can see that.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
Please start
assembling the racers.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
We have an important
decision to make.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
Ugh!

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Dammit.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC A] Have we tracked
down all the parts?

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC B] Anybody, if you
have even a moment, please!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC C]
Mr. Lyon.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
This brake drum is beyond repair
and we have no replacement.

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever you
must do, do it quickly.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
But, sir, without the parts--

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
Damn it, there are ways
to stop a car in motion!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
Just get it running!

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
Uh. I apologize.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
Perhaps GM has something
we might use.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
Please send someone to inquire
as soon as possible.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui</i> , sir.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
Appare. How would you face this?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Is this where it ends?

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make sense.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
What am I feeling?
What's happening to me?

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center
I'm lost in the dark
in my own head.

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
I can't see anything.

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I have no idea...
what to do now.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] What can I do?
What would it matter?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
Kosame, please... I need help.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hold on, Appare.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
We've still got the
whole race ahead of us.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
Then what about you, Appare?

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.272 position:50% align:center
What you did was amazing.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.232 position:50% align:center
Appare. You better get
that car finished!

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
We can't just stop in
the middle of the race.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
And sometimes we all
do irrational things.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Appare!

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Where are you?!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Appare!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
Appare. Kosame just--

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO, APPARE panting]

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
Kosame!

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
Hey there. Did you fall for it?

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
You woke up.
You're gonna be okay!

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
That's a "no," huh? Ugh.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Don't try to move yet.
You still need rest.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
My throat is really dry.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
I'll get some water.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That sounds good.

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
Kosame?

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hm?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I made this happen.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
Don't say that.
You're gonna jinx us.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
I'll be up and around
again soon enough.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
And really, it's not
even your fault.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but--

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
I can think of a lot of things
you ought to be apologizing for,

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
but this isn't on the list.

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hm?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Don't tell me you're sorry.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
But instead, how about
a "thank you"? Fair?

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
Okay, thank you.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
"Thank you for everything.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll never ignore you
or talk back to you again."

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
Now you're pushing your luck.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME laughs, groans]

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
How does the car look?
Can you get it working?

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I'm not sure.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:21.421 position:50% align:center
And you're sitting in
here with me right now

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
instead of trying
to figure it out?

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just...
I feel kinda lost.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
Okay, something is
definitely off here.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
I'm halfway expecting the
rain to turn into snow.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
The cars look like they
went through a war zone.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
Gil and his gang
kidnapped Sofia.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
After all of this,
the race is probably over.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
I can easily build a ship that
can make it across the sea.

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why would you?

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
Well, if they do end up
canceling the race,

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
we can't use the prize
money to get home.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
I know it would take some time,
but I can get you back--

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
Slow down. There's no need.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.004 position:50% align:center
It doesn't take
anything that special

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
to cross the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
Just a standard
steamship. Right?

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
I can get back to Japan.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
If I have to work a job or two
to pay the fare, then so be it.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.433 position:50% align:center
Besides, look at what
they've done here.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.018 position:50% align:center
It's a transfusion.

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
They're replacing
the blood I lost

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
with blood from someone else.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Somebody figured out how to be
sure my body would accept it.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
And if they hadn't,
I would be dead right now.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
what that means?

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Gil thinks violence is strength,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
so he doesn't believe
anyone can defeat him.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
But we did. He tried to kill me
and technology stopped him.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Appare, how far are you
ready to take this?

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
You're the only person
who has any right to decide

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
when your journey is over.

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No way I'm letting
that guy stop me.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
That's what I thought.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
The Appare I know would
cross that finish line,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
even if there's nobody
there to wave the flag.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.943 position:50% align:center
That's who you are.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Appare.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
You should probably know
the racers are assembling.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Please try and get
some rest today, sir.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
Though it's good
to see you awake,

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.289 position:50% align:center
it's a serious wound and a full
recovery is still a ways off.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] You're doing
incredible work, doc.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
Take good care of him.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure thing.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
All right. I'm gonna go
get the car ready to roll.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
You hurry up and heal, okay?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
I'm on it, boss.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
[SETH] Chase's car is
the only one in the race

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
that can still run.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
The others are all shot to hell,

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
and we don't have half the
parts or the manpower here

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
to get them functioning again.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
On top of that, the bridge
that Gil blew up

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
was the only one in the region
that's passable by car.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
The next closest is 300
kilometers to the south.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
In light of all this,

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
it's difficult to see how
the race can continue.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
So it's over.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
I will have my car restored
and rescue Sofia,

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
whatever the organizers choose.

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
That mean you know
where Gil's hidin' out?

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
The train has been found
abandoned on a closed track

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
roughly 90 kilometers
away from here.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
Gil and the Snakes have
most likely set up camp

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
in a ghost town not
far from the site.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
And what will you do
about the ransom?

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
I would offer you
any help I can give,

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
but a million and a half plus

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
is too much to arrange
in so little time.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
[TJ]
That's what I don't get.

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Gil knows nobody can pay
that ransom out of pocket.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
If he wants a score like that,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
he can go knock over
a couple a banks, easy.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
I think this game might not
be about the money for him.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
[SETH] Even so, it would
be extremely risky

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
to show up empty-handed.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
[AL]
The greater risk is to wait!

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
I made a promise to Sofia
that I would keep her from harm.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
[SETH] Do you believe you'll
be able to fix your car?

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
If not, then I will abandon it
and ride out on horseback.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Don't even think about that!

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Appare.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I can get your car
running in no time at all, Al.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.815 position:50% align:center
We have no parts at hand.
And I'm missing a brake drum.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Don't worry about your brakes.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
Building new ones
is not a problem.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
Trust me. I know your car
as well as your crew does.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I'm still gonna
need 'em all to help me out.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
We've got four
whole cars to fix.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
Once that's done,
we gotta go kick Gil's ass,

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
rescue Sofia, and keep driving
till we reach New York.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Slow down. We can't continue
if there's no bridge.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
We can still cross the water.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
You forget that my car
used to be a ship.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Huh? But then--

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
No ifs, ands, or buts!

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
Gil wants us to give up on
the race and he won't get it!

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
There's only one
way this can end.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
The winner is the one who
crosses the finish line first.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
Until someone gets
there, it's not over.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
If you're scared,
then you can stay.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
Let him keep what
he's taken from you,

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center
but you're not gonna
talk me out of doing this.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
I'll go alone if I have to.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
That I simply won't allow.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
I'm going, too.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're in,
aren't we, Big Bubba?

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
Not like we got anything
better to do, right?

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
Guess we still got
ourselves a race.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
Now it's time to get serious.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
And does that mean you're gonna
be takin' off that dumb mask?

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
Been wonderin' what
the point of that is.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
Keeps the shine of my eyes
from blindin' y'all.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
Idjit.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
My dear friend. Welcome back.

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
Hey, would you back off?

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
First, I'll need a full
inspection of every car.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
Then once we've got a list
of all the parts we need--

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
Shit! Urgh!

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
Here. The list you
were asking for.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
Get me every craftsman
and machine shop in town!

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
We can fabricate
the parts on site!

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
You're gonna fix every last
one of these damn vehicles!

00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEER B] Even our
opponents' cars, sir?

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
Every one!

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
I could give half a damn
what team you're on now;

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.306 position:50% align:center
we can worry about that
when you're all racing again.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
GM will pick up the tab,
so do whatever it takes!

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
Got it, sir.

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Mr. Lyon's car is priority one.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
Let's show him the pinnacle
of American engineering!

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEERS]
Right!

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So much for that job.

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Thank you, Seth.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
And please, from here
forward, it's Al.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Al.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
We're up against Gil, and the
police won't be helping us.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Everyone! Do you
understand the risks?

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
Never had a cop on my side
and never wanted 'em there.

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
Mr. Carter, you do know
we're career criminals?

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
[SETH chuckles]

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
It's a complete wreck.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
You're right. Now,
time to get to work.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hototo.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
Can you hear this machine's
voice crying out?

00:21:57.901 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
"I wanna go farther.
I wanna run even faster."

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.533 position:50% align:center
Will you lend us your power?

00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
Someone needs our help
and we're all counting on you.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
Appare.

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:11.831 position:50% align:center
Gimme a hand!

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
Just getting it up and running
again wouldn't be much fun.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
Once we're done with you,

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.881 position:50% align:center
we'll show the whole world
what kind of power you've got!
