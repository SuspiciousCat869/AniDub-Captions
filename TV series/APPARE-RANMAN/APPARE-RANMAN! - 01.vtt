[ANNOUNCER]
Racers, start your engines

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
because the Trans-America
Wild Race is about to begin!

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
The rules are simple.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
Take off from our starting point
here in sunny Los Angeles

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
and the first one to
cross the finish line

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
and take the checkered flag
in New York City wins!

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
Now to kick things off right,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
today's first place
driver will take home

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
a ten-thousand-dollar prize!

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
These daredevils are
rip-roaring to go

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.465 position:50% align:center
in this contest of
speed and skill!

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
But who's got the grit and moxie
to take them all the way?

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
The signal flag is
just about to fly!

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that, Appare?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
The race is about to start;
we need to get going!

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
Just a final tuning.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
So pipe down and let me think.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
Not good. It feels like we're
behind the pack already.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.109 position:50% align:center
Relax, Kosame.
There's far to go.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
Oh, what do you know?
You're just a child!

Come on, it's not like
you had no idea

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
that the race was
starting today!

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you have
it all tuned up

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50% align:center
and ready to go ahead of time?

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Done.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
Hurry! Go! Go!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
You ready?

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
Now, hold on to your
loincloth, Kosame.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
Huh? Uh. Please be safe, okay?

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center

Show time, boys.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:54.989 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a long road,
but at the end, victory awaits!

There you are, Appare.
The race is on now!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50% align:center
I won't hold anything back!

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.326 position:50% align:center
All right, you guys. Hang on!

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
Because we're about
to blast outta here!

[KOSAME yelling]

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Have you lost your mind?

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
Careful! I don't want to die!

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Can you believe
the boy did that?

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
I know!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] So my experiment
resulted in about

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
65% of the amount of steam
pressure I was expecting.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
I'd like to get the thermal
conductivity to the boiler

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
a lot closer to my calculations.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
I'll need to readjust
the heat pipe.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
But what'll be enough clearance
between the pipe and the boiler?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll also need to
reexamine the cooling system

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
to see how long I can extend
the practical running time.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
There's still a lot of
room for improvement.

Big brother!

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Yes, Fumi. What's the matter?

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
And don't forget, in
the dojo, address me...

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
..."me as Shihandai."

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Shihandai, a messenger from
Lord Kuroda has arrived

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.943 position:50% align:center
and is requesting
that you report

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
to his lordship's
manor immediately.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
Really? Why didn't
you say that sooner?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
[KURODA]
You know Sorano Appare, yes?

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
The Sorano family's second son?

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Yes, sir.
He's a mechanical genius.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
He creates unusual
gadgets and things,

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
calling them "experiments,"

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.716 position:50% align:center
but rumor has it that he carries
on in some rather wild behavior.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
They're not merely rumors!

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yelps]

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
What in the world is that?

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
Who cares? The thing
has destroyed my garden!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
Were we still in
the Tokugawa Era,

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
I would slay him for this
disrespect no questions asked.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
But, though they may
be commoners now,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
the family were once
major merchants

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
who had official dealings
with the Shogunate.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
So I'll have to deal
with this matter

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
with some degree of restraint.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
But the boy is trouble,
one can't deny.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Which is why I called for you.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
I am ordering you to
be Appare's overseer.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who, me?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.672 position:50% align:center
Your close age means
you're the perfect fit.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
The perfect fit for
what exactly, sir?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[KURODA]
Also, from what I understand,

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
he was once a
pupil at your dojo.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
Uh, well, not quite, sir.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
His father twisted my
arm to let him join,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
but I expelled him after
just three days for--

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
This is not a discussion!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
If anything else happens, I'm
holding you responsible as well.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.984 position:50% align:center
You're to keep a
close watch on him.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Yes, sir.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
However, I wouldn't
be that surprised

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
if he's already been
murdered by his cellmates.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
I had him thrown in with
the major criminals.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
If he dies as a result of
some jailhouse scuffle,

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
well, that's hardly
any fault of mine.

You too good to say hello?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.258 position:50% align:center
No, I never say hello.
It's a waste of my time.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
Is that so? Well, then...

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center

me to, didn't he?

you how it works in here.

That won't be necessary.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
Appare, stop!

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
Just where have you been?

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
At the beach.

After that, I broke
into an estate,

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
spent some time in jail,
and now I've come back home.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
Explain yourself. What exactly
do you think you're doing, son?

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
What's the point
explaining something

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't understand?

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
Appare.

How dare you speak to your
father with such disrespect!

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
You are 19 years old.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
Stop wasting your time
with this foolishness

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
and help out with the business!

You may be the second son,
but that is no excuse!

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
I'm busy right now. I've got
some other things to do.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
Well, either you get to
work, or you get out!

00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
You see, he just opened the jail
door on his own and walked away.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
Breaking out of jail
is a serious offense.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.128 position:50% align:center
Go gather some men!

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
We'll catch him

wreak this kind of havoc again!

Is everything okay?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll handle it before
things get out of hand.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
It's fine, so don't you worry.
I'll be back home soon

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Pardon me, but I'm
looking for Sorano Appare.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're the Shihandai
from the Hangetsu Dojo.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
I'm his older brother, Hanbei.
Has he done something again?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
Well, yes, sort of.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
That fool.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
He never does any work,

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
just spends all day tinkering
with those silly gadgets.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
He's here. You'll find
him in the old storehouse.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
Just head around back outside.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
He won't lift a finger for us,

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
so please convince him
not to bother anyone else

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
at the very least!

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Appare! I know you're in there!

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
Appare! I'm coming in!

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Hm?

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
Oh. I could use some tea.

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.730 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
Seems that explosion's
happening too late.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
Guess I gotta tweak the
internal steam pressure

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
just a little bit more.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on just
a minute, please!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What is this place?

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
A western technical manual?

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Nope, not a
manual. It's a story.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
Really, you don't say.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
Whoever you are,
stop touching my stuff.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
Have you really
forgotten who I am?

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
You enrolled in my
dojo three years ago

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
and used that cowardly
weapon on me.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yelping]

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. You're the
guy who lost to me.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
That doesn't count as a loss!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
Anyway, now I'm the Shihandai
of the Hangetsu Ittoryu School.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
But that's beside the point.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Look, as we speak,
men are being gathered

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
to either arrest you or
immediately put you to death.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.209 position:50% align:center
I promise I will beg
them to let you live

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
as long as you agree
to go back to jail

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
to pay for all the things
that you've done.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
No deal. That place is no fun.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
It's "no fun"?

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
It's not a question of
being any fun or not.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
Oh, then what's it
a question of?

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
Uh. Just, well, you know,
it's about... Maybe...

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
The entire point is that they'll
be coming for you soon.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Good for them.
I'll still do whatever I want.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
Why I oughta...
This kid's so stubborn.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
You may want to believe that,

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
but you have to be very
careful about what you say.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Now is the time to start
thinking about being humble

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
and begging for your life.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
I'm actually just trying to
save your skin, young man!

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
I never asked you to.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
It's my duty, because today, I
was ordered to be your overseer.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] And if this is
how you choose to behave,

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
I must take steps to ensure
you don't cause more trouble.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hm?

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Please! I'm begging you!

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
[APPARE gapss]

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] You have to come with
me and apologize to Lord Kuroda.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
I still have an
unmarried younger sister

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
and an elderly father.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Don't make me put my life
on the line on your account.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Please! Just listen to reason!

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
I'll also mention, my father
has arranged a wife for me.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
I've yet to meet her, but I'm
sure she's beautiful, kind,

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
and quite ready
for marital bliss.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
Do you want to make her a widow
before she's even married?

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
I'm on my knees here!

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Stop! That's enough!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
I've had lots of people
try real hard

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.215 position:50% align:center
to get me to bow
down to them before,

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
but you're the first one
to ever bow down to me.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
It's making my skin crawl.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
Does that mean
you'll come with me?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
No way, not a chance.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
In exchange, I need a favor.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
Huh? What kind of favor?

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] Excuse me!
Is Sorano Appare here?

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
Yes. Is there something
you need from him?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
We need to haul him in.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
Trying to cover for him
would be very foolish.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
Where are we going?

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What is this place?

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
It's my ship's dock.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
Your dock?

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
I've been building a steamship.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
You've been building a steamship
all by yourself down here?

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yes.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
Ever since the new government,

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
it's been easier to get
foreign books and parts.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
Pretty much whatever
you'd want's

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
in the Nagasaki shipyards.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
Interesting, but does this
thing really even work?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that a steamship
could be this tiny.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
That's what's so exciting
about this new engine.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
All of the same horsepower
but shrunk down.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
Once I'm finished with it,
it's possible it could be

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
the fastest ship in
the entire world.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
You think so?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.217 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME laughs]

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
You've really got your head

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
stuck up in the
clouds, you know?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
I see what your
brother was saying.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Why don't you try doing
some honest work

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:51.599 position:50% align:center
and save your family the worry?

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
You're the same.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
Yep, I was hoping that you might
be a little different, but no.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
You're just like
my old man, too.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center
[grumbles] What do you mean?

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
You can go now. I'm outta here.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.239 position:50% align:center
You're leaving?

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Ah! Ow!

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.828 position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh? Uh, hold on!

00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
Think about what you're doing.
Please, just a minute.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
[AYANE]
Appare!

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Ayane?

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
What's up, sis?

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
Several officers just
came to the house

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
and they're looking for you.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME groans]

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
I told you that this
was going to happen.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm gonna
head out for a bit.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
[AYANE gasps]

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Mm-hm.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.942 position:50% align:center
You'll come back.

00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
It'll be a while.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:54.037 position:50% align:center
Well, off you go.
Please take care of yourself.

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
Take this.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
[APPARE grunts]

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I don't believe
in good luck charms.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
[AYANE]
Of course I know that.

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
But still, it's a small thing
you can do to reassure me.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
Take it.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
See ya.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello, everybody.
I'm so glad you're here.

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
I just had a moment
to speak to Appare.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
You know, he's not really
that bad of a guy.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
I can convince him
to turn himself in.

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
So I'd appreciate it if you'd
please just wait here a bit.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
There's no need for
any rough stuff--

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
Ah! Wait! Hold on a minute!

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
Sure about that? It's dangerous.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
--[splashing]
--[GUARDS yell]

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. It's your decision.

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
[gas hisses]

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
It's like music.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Urgh. Hey!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
Stop this ship right
now and take us back!

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
No way. I'm going on a journey.
Come with me or get off.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
To where?

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
And then, it's across
the ocean and--

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.864 position:50% align:center
You have got to be kidding me!

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
I'm going back!

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Hey! Let go!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] No, I'm turning
back! You let go!

00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:19.539 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelping]

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
Hey, be careful.

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
It's hopeless.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
We have no food or water.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Yes, I know that.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] So you had this
long voyage planned,

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
but you didn't think
to bring the essentials?

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
I brought everything I needed.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
Tools, technical manuals,
gadgets for crafting.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
But no food or water?!

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] I wasn't planning on
coming this far out to sea.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
Are you fixing it?

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
Not exactly. I'm simply
examining its overall condition.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
The emergency
acceleration device

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
was built for one-time use,

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
so it's impossible
to repair it here.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
We're also out of fuel,
and the rudder's busted.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
Is there any way that
we can survive this?

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
From the position of the stars
and our departure point,

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
factoring our original
course bearing,

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
we should likely head towards
the serpent's watch.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
The ship ran at full
speed for half a watch.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
Calculating inertia plus the
direction of the ocean currents,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
as well as our present
rate of speed, obviously.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
Distance to shore: 22 to 25 ri .

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
Hey, can you swim?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I can't
make it that far.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
Same for me.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
So, you mind if I get
back to work now?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
What's with you?

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's possible we could
both be dead by tomorrow.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
How can you be so fixated
on that machinery right now?

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
Our entire world is connected.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
When I was four years old,
I saw my very first steamships.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
I pretty much knew
that the ocean

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center
was a vastly expansive
body of water,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
but there were these huge
ships I'd never seen before

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
that came across it.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
They came from somewhere,
you understand?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
The ocean was much more
than an expanse of water.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
It connected us to a world
I'd never even seen.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
The ocean connects
to unknown lands.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
The sky connects to the moon.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
And the moon connects
to the stars.

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
But this is a story,
right? It's just fiction.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] More than that.
It's an idea, a dream.

00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
Someone thought, "What if
we could go to the moon?"

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
It's inspiring.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
How far can I go?

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
Across the sea? Beyond the sky?

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
Or can I travel all the way
to the other side of the moon?

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
As long as it's not
the ocean floor.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] If anyone can reach
the other side of the moon,

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be
the one to do it.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
This ship is just the
first of many steps.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] Sorry, but I'm afraid
it's looking more and more

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
like your final step.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME groans]

00:20:56.256 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
Fumi... please live a long and
happy life for the both of us.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Huh?

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] So the ferry that
takes us across the Sanzu River

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.944 position:50% align:center
to the underworld...
is a steamer?

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Huh?

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
[APPARE gasps]

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
Its basic construction is--

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Hey, you need to
help me out here!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
We're in America!

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
Hello, Los Angeles!

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Oh my God.
