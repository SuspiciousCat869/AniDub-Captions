00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.013 position:50% align:center
[AL] It's mystifying
that I lost that bet.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.098 position:50% align:center
Appare, you absolute madman!

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
With your absurd plan,
you won back your storehouse

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
and one of my cars
for good measure.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
But all of that was nothing more

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
than a prelude to the long,
cruel race ahead.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A]
Table five's up, Kosame.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.412 position:50% align:center
I'm on it, sir!

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
[BOSS A]
Clear table one. Hop to!

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Right away!

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A]
Service, please!

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Be right there!

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50% align:center
Hey, coffee!

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Ah, gladly!

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
Boy, I want a car.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER D] Whaddya need
with a car, ya dingbat?

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.259 position:50% align:center
The things cost
an arm and a leg,

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.469 position:50% align:center
and that's after you put
down ten years' savings.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I know!

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
If I sold the car we won,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.057 position:50% align:center
the proceeds could cover
the fare back to Japan!

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.726 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Hey. Stop!

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.105 position:50% align:center
That means we can go home

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
without entering
this ridiculous race!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.567 position:50% align:center
And Appare's not gonna
stop me either!

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
He may have been
the one driving,

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.319 position:50% align:center
but I was the one
who touched the tree,

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
which means half of that car
legally belongs to me!

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
This is it. My ticket home!

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
Hey, Appare! Listen,
about the car--

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
Right. Think I've got the
bulk of it figured out now.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
That's weird. I swear
I heard Kosame's voice.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Said he's
going back to work.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Why'd he even make the trip?

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I came up with
a really good idea.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
[HOTOTO]
Hm?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
We have three months
until the race.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
My machine will consume
the parts from Al's car,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
and from that, something
brand new will be born.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A] Come again?
You wanna try out as a driver?

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Yes.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
I told ya before,

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
ladies got no place
on the track.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
You're wrong!

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
I know I have what it takes.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
Let me prove it to you!

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
Put me on that track
and I'll change your mind!

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
Look here, this ain't
kindergarten, toots.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50% align:center
You can raise your hand

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
and make all the puppy
dog eyes you want,

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
but there's no way you're
comin' up to the board.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
[DAVID laughs]

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
C'mon, boss, it'll be fun.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
Here, think fast.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN gasps]

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
David, give it a rest. My cars
ain't your toys, ya know?

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
Hell, just put her
behind the wheel

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.688 position:50% align:center
and let her play
racer for a bit.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
I bet she'll be ready
to hang up that helmet

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.024 position:50% align:center
by the time she makes
it back around.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
If she can even
make it that far.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEERS laugh]

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.529 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Here ya go.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
And don't you forget to wash it
after you're done, darlin'.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
That's the kinda work
we know you can handle.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
You uppity broad!

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
[DAVID gasps]

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
Get offa him, Jing!

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
He's the one who came
after me! You heard him!

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
He insulted me
and mocked my job!

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
You wanna keep that job?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
Dammit!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
Say you're sorry, kid.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
If it's like that...

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
If he's really what you think
a racer is supposed to be...

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
Fine. Go on and cut me loose.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
But before you do,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.527 position:50% align:center
gimme one race
with this blowhard!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Or I could just stomp a hole
in you if you'd prefer.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
Mouthy little--

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Pipe down! That's enough!

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
If you jackanapes wanna
race so bad, then fine.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
I'll give you the course

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
for half an hour Wednesday
before practice.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
And you, Jing, you're gonna be
driving ol' Number Zero.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
That heap barely rolls downhill.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
I'm not lending any car that's
in racing shape to an amateur.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
Mechanics, that
goes for you, too.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
You wanna do any
work on the Zero,

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.264 position:50% align:center
you're doin' it
strictly off the clock.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
I'm not spending a dime
on all this malarkey.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
Ya got your race, kid.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
Once that's over with,

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
you're gonna pack up
and clear outta my shop.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
We have an understanding?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME yawns]

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
Don't yawn so loud.
You'll scare all the fish.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
You say that as if
there are any fish.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
Trade spots for a
second, would you?

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
Try out as many spots
as you want to,

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
but in the end, you still have
to be smarter than the fish.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the advice.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
--[bang]
--Huh?

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Xialian?

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Are you okay? What's going on?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN laughs]

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Uh...

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
Hi, Kosame. Is Appare around?

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
Hey, Appare! Appare!

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Is it food?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME] No, not yet.
But there's someone--

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] If it's not food,
I don't wanna hear about it.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey!

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Appare!

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, it's you.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
Hear me out. I need your help.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
So this is Number Zero?

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
The thing's got a bit
of an ornery streak,

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
so they keep it off the track.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
Got a taste of that on the
trip over here, in fact.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Had to push it most of the way.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
What about your mechanics?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
I'm on David's bad side now,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
and the boys aren't gonna put
in extra work for no money.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
How unfair.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
Hardly. It makes sense.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
He is the one who represents our
team on the track after all.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.666 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Okay. I'll take care of it.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
All we need to do is rig it
with one of my boosters and--

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
--[KOSAME] Don't you dare!
--[XIALIAN] Please, don't!

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN] I only wanna it in
good enough shape to race it.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
Because I need to win the race
with my driving skills alone--

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
not a faster machine!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
Even if I'm fighting uphill,

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
I'm going to prove
I'm the better driver.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
Anything less would be
the same as losing!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
[APPARE]
Boring.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.229 position:50% align:center
Then what about you, Appare?

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
That car we won from Al

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
would've been perfectly
suitable to enter in the race,

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
but you insisted on
building something

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
brand new from scratch.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
Okay, fair.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
But if that's what you're after,
then just go talk to that guy.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me!

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
Sorry to intrude!

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
[AL]
Uh. Hm?

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Why, hello!

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50% align:center
[AL]
That part I understand, yes.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
But I'm not sure why you
would bring the car to me

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
rather than hiring
your own mechanic.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
Because we're in a hurry.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
And in poverty, too.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
You have absolutely no shame,
have you? Goodness me.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Although, there is value
in getting our eyes

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
on a competitor's product.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.397 position:50% align:center
And it should hardly require
any great investment of effort

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
to reach such a state as to
survive a single short race.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
So...

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
We can fix it.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
Great, thank you!
I can stay here and help out!

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.741 position:50% align:center
Surely you know that a working
vehicle is not even a guarantee

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
that you'll make it
past the starting line.

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
It's fine.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
She knows what she's doing;
we've seen her driving.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
[AL] Circling the track alone
is nothing at all like a race.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
You've not had to
fight for a line

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
or been buffeted by dirty
air through a corner.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
When you drive
the circuit alone,

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
it may seem like a carefree
and peaceful place.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
But in a race, it's a dangerous,
dirty, miserable world apart.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
I'll be right at home.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
That's that, then.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
But even if you win the race,

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
you're still going to be
out of a job, right?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
So what'll you do?

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.900 position:50% align:center
What will I do?

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
What comes next doesn't
matter right now.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
I have a race to win first,
and my pride is riding on it!

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head back now.
I've got my own car to work on.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Beg your pardon.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
Well, shall I expect
great things?

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh. You'll be amazed--
they all will.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
The whole world.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
And you'll be finished
with it before the race.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
Ya know...

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter right now!

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
Yes, it does!

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
[DAVID]
We're racin' ten laps.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
Fellas, what's the
spread look like?

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
All the bets are in
and we settled on three.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
That's how many times they think
you're gonna make it around

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
before I cross the finish line.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Ten laps!

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
And I'll wager all this!

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're in a restricted area,
buddy. You can't just walk--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[TEAM MEMBER A]
What kinda car is that?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
Jeezum crow. What's Al Lyon
from BNW doin' here?

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center
[AL]
I came to spectate.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
Now, Sofia, our tea, please.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
Right away.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
Well, that was a
flashy entrance.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
Oh? Yours was rather
austere for my taste.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
Gentlemen, could I interest
you in a cup of tea?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
Ah. You're far too kind.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
Where's Appare?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME]
I invited him to come,

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
but he's very good at shutting
out my voice when he's working.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
You kiddin' me?

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
Hey! We're burnin'
daylight, here!

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
Got some friendly advice
for ya, sweetcheeks.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
Remember, the gas
pedal is on the right

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
and the brake's on the left.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEERS laugh]

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
Damn meathead.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
What would you do?

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
How do you win the race

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
when the other driver has
a more powerful engine?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
Wake up, Appare.
You listening or what?

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
Gotta focus on driving,
so no, not really.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
What is your deal?

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
I don't have enough time to
build a physical prototype,

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
so I'm driving one
in my head instead.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] Road surface.
Temperature. Weather.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
I'm testing it in a range
of driving conditions.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
I work out the kinks as I go.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
[APPARE] There's more to a car's
speed than its engine alone.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
We have to account
for aerodynamics,

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
the weight of the vehicle,
the condition of the tires,

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
the amount and quality of fuel.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
That's a good point.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
Which means, if you can't win
with pure engine power,

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
you have to beat them
some other way.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
I can do it.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
I came here to win this race.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
Good start!

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
Yes! She's first!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
Calm yourself, they've barely
rounded the first corner.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
[KOSAME grunt]

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
She's got less weight,

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
so of course her car's gonna
be quicker off the line.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
Thing is, a good start's
not gonna cut it.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
His engine may be the more
powerful, if only by a hair.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
For shame, sir!

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.804 position:50% align:center
You mustn't use such language in
the presence of a young child.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
Right, beg your pardon.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna tell her off
for calling you a young child?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
It's Sofia--that makes it okay.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've got him!

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
[AL] No. She's barely
managing to stay with him.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
He has the power advantage.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
If she makes even
the slightest error

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
and he's able break away,
then the race is lost.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
Hope ya like my ass,

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
'cause you're lookin' at it
till we cross the finish line!

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like
David can shake her off.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
Eh, she won't get
past him though.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
Come on! Two more laps!
Just keep holdin' her off!

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
Use your head.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
You boys think David
took the lead from her,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
but she let him out front.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A] Long as she keeps
nippin' at his heels like that,

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
her weaker engine can keep pace

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
without any air resistance
to push through.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
And her tires won't wear
down near as quick, either.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
And on top of all that, this
efficient strategy allowed her

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
to come to the starting
line with less fuel,

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
meaning less weight.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
So that's why she had
such a quick start.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
Just you wait.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
It all comes together going
through the final corner.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
It's all about nerves, now.

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
Don't you give an inch!

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
Show her why racing is
a man's world, David!

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
--[KOSAME] Yes!
--[HOTOTO] Nice!

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
[TEAM MEMBER A]
Just get around her!

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
[AL]
No chance of that.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
David got flustered
after her quick start.

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
He tried aggressively
to shake her off

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
and it took a heavy
toll on his tires.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center
It would seem they've
reached their breaking point.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
Dammit! Get back here!

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
It's the final corner.

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
Look! She's ahead!

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
What cowardice!

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
Um, okay.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.641 position:50% align:center
Soak your head, sweetheart,
the racetrack is a danger--

00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
You don't deserve to
call yourself a racer!

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Stop gawkin' and
get back to work!

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
I lost?

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
I was so sure I had what
it takes to be a racer.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
But now, there's no way forward.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
Enough, ya dummy.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
Your average Joe would panic

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
and start stompin'
all over the brakes

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:35.180 position:50% align:center
if they went into a spin
like you just did.

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
You'da done that?

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
We'd be cleanin' you off
the wall with a hose.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
But a few people could keep
their heads on straight,

give 'er a little bit o' gas,

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
and get the car back
under control.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Pullin' through a spin-out
like that takes a racer.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
You mean...

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
Here's the catch.

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
See, the crowd's not lookin'
for the best driver,

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
they want fierce
competition and passion.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
They wanna imagine it's
them behind the wheel.

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
And sad to say, almost
none of 'em are women.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
I don't think you're gonna see

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
all those fellas up there in
the stands rootin' for a lady,

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
no matter how good she is.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
Tell ya what.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
Take Number Zero for a while.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN]
What?

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
You were hopin' to enter the big
Trans-America Race, weren't ya?

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
Dunno if the thing coulda made
a trip across the country

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
even in its best days,

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
but I know for damned sure it'd
be a tough story to ignore.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
That old rattletrap
leading the pack

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
into the first supply point.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
And everybody would
read in the papers

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
about the woman racer
behind the wheel.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[XIALIAN gasps]

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
It all worked out in the end.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
Clearly, you're quite
a formidable racer.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
You'd be a worthy rival
in a more capable machine.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
Jing, we were all fools.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
Just say the word and we'll get
Number Zero running better

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
than the first time it
ever rolled on the track.

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
Hell, when we're done with it,

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:55.051 position:50% align:center
this machine'll carry you from
coast to coast and back again.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
[TEAM MEMBER A]
Right, boss?

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
Knock yourselves out.

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
But if you end up
with any prize money,

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
you better believe you're payin'
the shop back for that work.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
You guys.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Let's do it!

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEERS chattering]

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.032 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Any thoughts?

00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
TJ of the Thousand Three is
now driving for Iron Motors.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
TJ, huh? Walkin' sack of scat.

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.542 position:50% align:center
Pardon me, Mr. Oldin.
Are you two acquainted?

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
We are.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
Neither one of us is
too happy 'bout that.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for being facetious,
but of course I know the names

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
of the famous outlaws
called the Thousand Three.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
There's Crazy TJ,
Gil the Butcher,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
and the man they call
Dylan the Hero.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
Well, he'd call them fools.

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
[clears throat]

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
You received a
pardon in exchange

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
for your service in the war.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
But the two members
still at large

00:19:56.571 --> 00:20:00.241 position:50% align:center
are carrying bounties of over
50,000 dollars apiece.

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
The law won't be coming for
them anytime soon, however.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
B.I.G. BOSS has been
making sure of that.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
Until the Trans-American Race
is over, they're both free men.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
You think the law's gonna be

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
holding up their
end of that deal?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
Well, if the rumors are true,

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
Gil the Butcher jumped
into the race on his own,

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
hoping to claim the
purse for himself.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
We're making history.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
This race will
mark the beginning

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
of the age of the
automobile in earnest.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
But it's also the opening
salvo in a three-way war

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
between the B.I.G.
BOSS sponsors,

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
BNW, Iron Motors, and us at GM.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.068 position:50% align:center
Losing is not an option.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN] I couldn't give
a damn about all that.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
Wasn't plannin'
on losin' anyway.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you here.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
If we can bring this thing home,

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center
you'll be putting me
straight on the fast track

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
to an executive suite at GM.

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
Tch.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
Better be some fine booze
waitin' for me at the finish.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
How would a 30-year Camus
suit the occasion?

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN]
That'll do.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Here's this.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
[DYLAN] Go ahead and send
it to the usual place.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
Understood.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[SETH]
It'll be a cold day in hell

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
when they shove me back in
the engineering department.

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
As B.I.G. BOSS' sole
European representative,

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
do you have any words
for the press today?

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
I don't, but as a racer,
I'll win it. Full stop.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Get ready, Appare.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
We're to be featured
in a newspaper story!

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't you want your
picture to be in the paper?

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
Have fun. I don't really care.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
I suppose that makes me
team representative.

Got it.

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
And that does it for this place.

[KOSAME]
Huh? Wasn't there an interview?

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:04.032 position:50% align:center
Ink and paper cost more
than you might realize.

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
It's honestly a little strange

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
they even sent us
to get your picture.

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
Appare, you better
get that car finished!

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.416 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win this race,

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
and they're gonna give
us a front-page story!

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
You're damn right. Almost done.
