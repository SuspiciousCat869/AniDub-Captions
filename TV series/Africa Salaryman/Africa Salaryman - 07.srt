162
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:26,608
It's probably famous
for something.

163
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:30,192
[LIZARD] I assume so, since it's
on the famous landmark tour!

164
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:31,650
[LION]
According to the literature,

165
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,192
this place is called
Diamond Head.

166
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,275
It got its name a long
time ago because sailors

167
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,483
used to climb it,

168
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,858
thinking the calcite
crystals near the mouth

169
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:39,067
were diamonds!

170
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,567
Oh, boy, I bet they
were disappointed

171
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,400
when they got there!

172
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,483
Ha! What did they expect?

173
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,358
It's not like there'd be
a bunch of free diamonds

174
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,317
sittin' out in the open.

175
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,525
Wow, this mountain
may not be very tall,

176
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:54,150
but it's still scary to look
down from the summit.

177
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,150
[HONEY BADGER]
What are you scared of now?

178
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,650
You're still alive?
You are resilient!

179
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,983
That's 'cause I'm
the Honey Badger!

180
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,567
Honey Badger don't care!

181
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,400
Now, what's so scary here?

182
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,275
Oh, I was just steppin'
back from the railing,

183
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,692
talkin' about how I'd hate
to plummet to my death.

184
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,775
You really are a chicken,
Toucan, you know that?

185
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,733
Watch and learn, I'll show
ya how unstoppable

186
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:15,150
you can be when you're
not afraid of anything!

187
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,150
Check it out!

188
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:20,858
If I was afraid, could I do
somethin' as awesome as this?

189
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,317
[HONEYGUIDE]
Woohoo!

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,025
You're so cool, Bossman!
Yeah, work it!

191
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,025
[HONEY BADGER yells]

192
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,942
[HONEYGUIDE laughs]
What an idiot!

193
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:37,108
[NENE] Last but not least,
we have this thingy!

194
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,858
Ah, yes, the famous
"rock with a turtle on top."

195
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,358
Behold.

196
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:42,692
This is King Kamekameha,

197
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,192
who was a lot like
King Kamehameha,

198
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:45,775
except he was a turtle.

199
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,400
Made in Italy to celebrate the
centennial of Hawaii's discovery

200
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,983
by Captain Cook.

201
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,817
The original statue fell into
the sea on its way over here,

202
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,275
so this one is
actually a recast.

203
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,067
The spear in his left
hand symbolizes peace,

204
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,900
while his right hand is
open to represent Hawaii's

205
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,192
everlasting prosperity.

206
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,858
[LIZARD]
Now you know something?!

207
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,108
And this statue
was modeled after--

208
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:04,858
This statue was modeled not
after King Kamekameha the First,

209
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,108
but a particularly handsome
turtle hand-selected

210
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,108
by the ruling king at the time!

211
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,400
Crazy, right?

212
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,358
[LION]
Hey, I wanted to say that!

213
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,775
Where did you get so much
energy all of a sudden?

214
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,275
Oh, I'm glad you asked!

215
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:18,567
I'll explain everything tonight!

216
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,817
What's goin' on dude?

217
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,858
Dude, you're gonna be so rich.

218
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,150
Whoa, really?

219
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,067
Absolutely. Be there.

220
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,733
But I already have plans
with Lizard tonight.

221
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:28,983
I'll buy the drinks.

222
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,400
Say no more.

223
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:31,692
I'll meet you in the hotel
lobby right after dinner,

224
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,150
and don't you dare be late.

225
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,942
Roger that, old buddy!

226
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,150
Ah, pinch me,
I must be dreaming!

227
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,150
Free drinks! The best kind!

228
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,483
That's weird.
I just finished a thought.

229
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,275
Isn't this the part where Honey
Badger comes crashing in?

230
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,858
Hey! Where's your friend?

231
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,067
Huh? I checked the
site of his most recent

232
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,775
life-threatening injury,
and he was gone.

233
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:55,025
But if I know Bossman,
he's probably doing just fine.

234
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,525
[HONEY BADGER yelling]

235
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,608
He's gotta be dead.

236
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,400
That scream was way too long.

237
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:05,858
Don't be so sure!

238
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:08,108
He'll shake it right off. Watch!

239
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:11,317
[NENE chuckling]

240
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,525
[TOUCAN, NENE]
Cheers!

241
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,775
This rules!

242
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,650
Even the free drinks are
way yummier in Hawaii!

243
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,108
That's right,
everything's on me,

244
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:39,358
so drink as much as you want.

245
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,900
We gotta celebrate
our reunion, after all!

246
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh, Nene, where have
you been all these years?

247
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,733
Gimme a highball, wouldja?

248
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:52,233
Does this mean you're
not mad at me anymore?

249
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,942
What do you mean,
what would I be mad at you for?

250
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,233
[TOUCAN]
You know, back in grade school?

251
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,817
The first lunch period we
had after summer was over?

252
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,775
[TOUCAN] Whoa! This is
from before we left for break!

253
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,817
Ew, gross, the bread's
hard as a rock!

254
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,775
Nene!
I'm not super hungry today.

255
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:18,067
You want my roll?

256
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,275
I mean, if you're
offering, Toucky, yeah.

257
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,150
It's yours. Say "Ah."

258
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,525
[NENE]
Ah...

259
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,275
[NENE gags]

260
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,400
Oh, yeah, the whole bread thing.

261
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:35,442
Well, I did have to get dentures
for my front teeth after that,

262
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,692
but it's water under
the bridge, no worries.

263
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,483
Right, it's like it
never even happened.

264
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,692
Cool, cool.

265
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,275
And there was that
other matter, too.

266
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,608
Uh, which one?

267
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,567
[NENE] Don't pretend you
don't remember Bunnie.

268
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,775
Come on, who have
you got the hots for?

269
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,775
What? I can't tell anyone that.

270
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:52,858
My beak is sealed, I promise.

271
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:53,983
Trust me, dude.

272
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,858
It's Bunnie.

273
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,608
So then he tells me
he thinks eggplants

274
00:12:58,692 --> 00:12:59,942
are better than cucumbers.

275
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,067
Oh, really?

276
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:05,150
Hey, what are you
two talking about?

277
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,858
Wanna know something crazy?

278
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,358
Yeah, of course.

279
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,650
Earlier, this silly goose
told me that he's, like,

280
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,942
totally in love with you.

281
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,317
[BUNNIE]
Oh, uh... That's nice.

282
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,275
But I really like Impala. So...

283
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:20,692
So... so... so...

284
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,442
You said you wouldn't tell
anyone how I felt about her,

285
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:27,108
but you did.

286
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,650
You told her.

287
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,608
[TOUCAN chuckles]

288
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:34,483
Um. You're not by chance still
mad about that little slip.

289
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,108
Also under the bridge.

290
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,733
I forgot about it
until just now.

291
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:40,858
Phew, that's good.

292
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,358
Time heals all
wounds or whatever.

293
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,858
Yo! Another highball!

294
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:50,608
How 'bout we cut the chit-chat
and get down to business.

295
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,025
Oh, yeah, that's right.

296
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,108
Something about me
getting filthy rich.

297
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,150
Remember my suspiciously
detailed rundown

298
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,692
on that turtle statue?

299
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,483
Yeah, of course, it was weird
you actually knew something.

300
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,525
Ha, well, I wouldn't
go that far, but okay.

301
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,233
Prepare to be titillated.

302
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,608
Feast your eyes on this.

303
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:07,942
[TOUCAN]
Let's see here.

304
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:12,025
"King Kamekameha's hidden
treasure." What's this?

305
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,400
[NENE]
Exactly what it sounds like.

306
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,983
There's tens of billions
of dollars in riches buried

307
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,692
underneath Iolani Palace
waiting to be claimed.

308
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,150
Hold on.

309
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,733
You saying we can just walk
in and clean the place out

310
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:23,900
ourselves?

311
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,067
[NENE]
Yup.

312
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,608
So how'd you like
to live a life of luxury

313
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:28,525
from now on, Toucky?

314
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,692
It would be ridiculous
to come here

315
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,483
and not drink Blue Hawaiians.

316
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm so relaxed.

317
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,942
I could do nothing here all day.

318
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,525
I agree.

319
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,567
It's like this sunshine
