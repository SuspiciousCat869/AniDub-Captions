[GROUP]
What?!

321
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:38,442
I know it'll be difficult
with so little time left,

322
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,567
but there's always overtime!

323
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,025
Unpaid overtime, of course.

324
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:45,317
[LION]
We can't finish by next week!

[PRES. TURTLE]
Oh, you'll be fine.

326
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,942
Just pull a presentation
out of your butts!

327
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,025
Do you know what company
we'll be competing against?

328
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,275
Well... Let me see.

329
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:57,942
Well, just pull it
out of your butt.

330
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:59,358
Ah. Yes.

331
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,692
Tiger and Leopard, I do believe.

332
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,692
No. Not them.

333
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,275
What is it?

334
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,650
Well, it's just that my
old college classmates

335
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,942
are working at Tiger
and Leopard these days.

336
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,858
That's perfect,
you can call 'em up

337
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,525
and ask 'em to
go easy on us, then!

338
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,067
Uh...

339
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,442
Unfortunately, I think that
would have the opposite effect.

340
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,025
Huh? Why's that?

341
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,900
Well, uh, it's complicated.

342
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,650
Those two guys...

343
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,900
They're probably still
holding a grudge.

[TIGER growls]

345

How is it? The presentation?

346
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:45,817
[LEOPARD]
It's flawless. No weaknesses.

347
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,567
We're going to blow those
losers out of the water.

[TIGER sighs]

Looks like we're finally
getting our chance

350
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,442
at revenge, partner.

351
00:17:56,525 --> 00:18:00,733
[LEOPARD] That's right. That
Lion will pay for betraying us.

352
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:03,608
And with interest,
too, of course.

[SHISHIMURA]
Y'know, Gorimi,

356
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,400
I've been thinking.

[GORIMI]
Uh-huh?

358
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:14,858
[SHISHIMURA] The sushi here
is super delicious,

359
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,733
and a lot of the toppings
aren't even seafood!

360
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,275
Yeah, you're right!

361
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:22,608
I love this place.
There's so much variety!

Like for us?

Yup!

Who better to design a
brand-new line of sushi toppings

366
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,317
than a pair of hip
teenage girls?

I mean we do eat
a lot of sushi, after all.

We'll make millions!

Totally! Wow, you're so smart!

You think this thing is edible?

Maybe. Or maybe not.

It's a little off-putting
when you first put it

in your mouth, but it
