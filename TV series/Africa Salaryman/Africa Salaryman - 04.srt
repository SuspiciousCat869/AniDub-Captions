done slacking...

160
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,567
[LION, LIZARD]
A mascot character?

161
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,358
Yes. I would like the company
to come up with its very own

162
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,858
animal mascot to spice up
our corporate branding.

163
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,983
I think something fun
and colorful like that

164
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,400
would enhance the
Cinema Café project, too,

165
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,650
if you haven't forgotten
about it already.

166
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,442
Isn't that the same
project you mentioned

167
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,442
offhandedly a few
days ago, Big Cat?

168
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,525
I'm sorry, I wasn't
sure if that was actually

169
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:24,608
happening or not.

170
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:25,817
Of course it is.

171
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,567
I hope it's been progressing
smoothly so far.

172
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,025
Well, "progressing"
is kind of a strong word.

173
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,233
But, in our defense,

174
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,150
we haven't heard any
other details about it

175
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,442
since the day you
first assigned it to us.

176
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,108
Some information would be nice.

177
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:42,692
Hm, anyway, the first step is to
rustle up a mascot character

178
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,067
for the company.

179
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,942
All right, good meeting.
See you later.

180
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,233
Typical upper management
move for you.

181
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,525
Okay, how are we going to
put this thing together?

182
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,942
Well I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

183
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:58,233
I don't know the first
thing about mascots.

184
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,942
Do you have any ideas?

185
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,692
I've seen mascot characters,

186
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,567
but I'm just as
in the dark as you.

187
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,817
Yeah that's what I thought.

188
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,233
Huh?

189
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:09,108
You say you want to know
about mascot characters, do ya?

190
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,025
[LION]
Are you familiar, Toucan?

191
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:13,775
Sure, I could lay a
little wisdom on you guys.

192
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,150
Your smug attitude
is infuriating as usual,

193
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,733
but yes, please do.

194
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,817
[LION]
Start at the beginning.

195
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
What exactly is a mascot?

196
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:22,067
Sweet summer child!

197
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,900
Your innocent naivete
is adorable.

198
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,400
I would be more than
happy to educate

199
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:27,817
and enlighten you morons
in any way that I can.

200
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,400
On second thought,
we've all got phones,

201
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:30,525
let's just Khookle it.

202
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,025
Hey!

203
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,817
All I wanted to do was help you
two out with your problem!

204
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,567
[LIZARD] I dunno where
you got the idea that this is

205
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,650
only our problem, but whatever,
educate away, Toucan!

206
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,275
It makes no difference
to me, but!

207
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,067
If you really want
to know that badly,

208
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,858
then fine, I guess I will.

209
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,692
Okay, for someone to
qualify as a mascot character,

210
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,817
there are three key
attributes they must possess.

211
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,358
First off, they should have
a powerful message of love

212
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:58,025
and appreciation for
whatever place they live.

213
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,442
Number two.

214
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,733
They're unique, yet adaptable
to any marketing scheme.

215
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:03,900
And three, they need
a carefree personality

216
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:07,025
that's equal-parts lovable
and motivational!

217
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:09,358
Huh, I never knew mascot
characters were subject

218
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,192
to that kind of scrutiny.

219
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,817
These days, it's pretty
common to only have

220
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,192
one or two of those.

221
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,275
I mean, even big corporations
use company mascots,

222
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,317
so the requirements
can't be that strict.

223
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,567
I guess the president wants
to jump on the bandwagon too.

224
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,983
That said, I think the best
way to get the inside scoop

225
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,983
is for us to meet up
with my mascot friends

226
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,650
and see what they have
to say about the whole thing.

227
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,108
Wow, I didn't know
you had friends

228
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,150
in that industry,
Toucan. That's great!

229
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,483
[TOUCAN] You guys probably
have a few of 'em, too.

230
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,483
Look up some of your
old contacts on Fakebook.

231
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,108
I'm willing to bet at least
one person you know

232
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,233
is a mascot.
Trust me, they're everywhere.

233
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,233
Look at that, I have an
old friend from college

234
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,233
who became a mascot character!

235
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,233
[LIZARD] Ah, and apparently
someone I knew in high school

236
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,733
did the same thing.

237
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:48,900
[TOUCAN]
Told ya!

238
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,733
Now let's go hit these
guys up for intel!

239
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,275
Oh, yeah, and we're gonna
be discussing everything

240
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,525
over drinks, so remember
to save your receipts!

241
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,692
[LIZARD] He just wants an
excuse to drink on the clock.

242
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:03,817
[LION, MELONBEAR]
Cheers!

243
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,983
[LION]
I guess old habits die hard.

244
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,233
[MELONBEAR growls]

245
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,942
There's nothin' I like
better than knockin' back

246
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,567
an ice-cold beer!

247
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,108
I have to ask you.

248
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,817
Why do you have a melon
for a head now?

249
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,817
You were a normal bear
back when I knew you.

250
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,525
I'm glad you wanna know!

251
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:28,567
It's a sad tale, sad enough
to make you cry!

252
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,150
All right, thanks
for the warning.

253
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,692
Tell me everything, then.

254
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,608
Here goes.

255
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,650
After I graduated college,

256
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:39,858
I was unemployed without
a worry in the world!

257
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:43,483
Every day, I'd go and sneak
a taste of the local specialty.

258
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,817
Jubari melons! Until...

259
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:55,317
[MELONBEAR grunting]

260
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:02,650
It sounds like the universe
was punishing you for stealing.

261
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,150
Another beer please!

262
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,900
The authorities found me
and took me into custody,

263
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:12,025
so it was either face criminal
charges or become a mascot.

264
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,400
You've been through a lot
in your life, haven't you?

265
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,900
Got that right.

266
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:18,108
Not to mention, my hometown's
under federal supervision

267
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:19,733
for some financial
complications,

268
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,525
so that kinda puts a
damper on everything, too.

269
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:25,983
[LION] I'm not sure
how to respond to that.

270
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,400
But hey, it's not all
doom and gloom for me!

271
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:29,858
I'm a pretty popular character,

272
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,983
so I get invited to all
kinds of special events

273
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,067
all over the country!

274
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,567
I mean, yeah, it's work,

275
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,817
but basically I just goof
around with kids all day long,

276
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,983
so it's nice and easy!

277
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,525
Lots of people love me.

278
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,942
I'm a local hero!

279
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:43,525
[LION] I would expect children
to run away from you.

Let's rekindle our friendship

slow eater, so I can't.

I assume you're talkin'
about money,

which is the only reason why I'm
doin' this gig to begin with,

which is why I got myself
a cushy job as a mascot

Well, you're half-right.

My fans have always
called me "Heelguin"

396
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,900
because I play such a
mischievous character,

so it would be on-brand.

to harass a kid in public,

be curtains for me.

Nope. I fully intended

00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:01,567
I'm sorry, sir!

471
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,608
What? There's no need
to apologize.

472
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:05,150
It was just an accident, right?

473
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,775
[OBSEQUIOUS RABBIT] Ah!
Thanks, I'll be more careful!

Hey! No violence allowed!

Don't like it? Fight me!

Juice, anyone?

[DEER] Everyone, please
calm down! Security!

00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,733
Huh. The deer's cute.

483
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:34,858
I think she's the
best mascot here.

484
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:38,358
This thing might
not be for kids.

That's it! [yells]

00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,858
Time to show
