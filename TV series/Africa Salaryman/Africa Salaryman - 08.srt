That's where you use the

No, I'm afraid that's
not what macros are,

You're a slacker 24/7, Toucan.

get yourself going.

Ah! Sorry, I gotta take that.

167
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,442
Yeah, what's up?

168
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,358
Right. Right. Uh-huh.

No kidding. Really?

I was just so eager
to see you ladies.

Guess I rushed
through some stuff!

And after you set
all this up, too.

My bad!

You are so mean.

Turnin' down a gal without

So, the club leader

[PRES. TURTLE]
Oh, Lion!

Have you heard of these
events they call sports days?

201
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,400
They improve office
communication and efficiency,

which is precisely what
we need around here!

Huh?

[PRES. TURTLE] And you

That's for sure.

Do your best, corporate drones!

Nope, you're a show lizard.

And I'm a show bird!

00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,275
Here's the list of events.

213
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,108
Baobab-eating race,
electric eel tug-of-war,

214
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,567
a hedgehog ball toss.

like all the old standbys!

Oh, my goodness,
I forgot to bring a towel...

220
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,900
[PRES. TURTLE] So that's the
kind of worker who benefits

00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:51,275
from a sports day!

222
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,400
It turns out, when you
hold a company event

223
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,983
without any alcohol,
employees like Toucan

will turn their energy in a
completely different direction!

Think of the possibilities!

So corporate teambuilding
actually works!

Great!

the salarymen bravely tackled

after the festival was over,

232

all three of them were left
with the same question.

I went to a cookout
with my girlfriend.

Then I ran into one of my other
girlfriends while we were there,

So, how are the new employees?

You think they're
settled in yet?

a problem with him?

Plus, it makes Toucan
act even sillier.

like a ninja, too?

No, it's nothing like that.

in Portuguese.

yourself coming in here

318
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,400
as much as an adult.

319
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:27,400
That's because we
know greasy food is bad.

320
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,025
Yeah, I'm more
careful about that now

321
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,567
than I've ever been.

322
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,483
[CLERK 8A]
We'll see you next time!

323
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,567
[LION]
Oh! You guys are here too, huh?

324
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,025
Somebody's feelin' young.

325
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,067
Even at my age,
sometimes you just have to

326
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,275
chow down on some
yummy junk food!

327
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:45,108
There's somethin'
magical about it.

328
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,692
You know, I used to work at
a Moocky D's at one point,

329
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,317
but that was ages ago.

330
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,400
Avogado?

331
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,483
We don't have that, sir,
this is Moocdonald's,

332
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,858
not Smooshburger.

333
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:58,025
[TOUCAN] Do you have to make
everything about you?

334
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,775
[LION]
And it's pronounced avocado.

335
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:07,150
I've had some pretty
bad part-time jobs, too!

336
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,442
[LION]
Let me go!

337
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,317
I'm a male lion,
we don't hunt anything!

338
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,650
Yeah, same here.

339
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:16,108
I'm no chicken!

340
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,400
Look at me! I'm a Toucan!

341
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,733
Where's my lawyer?

342
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,358
Let me go!

343
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:24,108
[LIZARD] Getting arrested
is not a part-time job.

344
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,400
I wish they'd eaten you.

345
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,442
Ay! Lickety-split, forgot
to grab my shi-- Wait.

346
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,525
[screams]

347
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,942
Big Cat's scary
when he's workin' late!

348
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,525
His pupils are huge!

349
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,817
They don't look like
that during the day!

350
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,358
[LIZARD]
Well, it's night.

351
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,067
This should help.

352
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,692
[BOTH scream]

353
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,233
[LION]
Ack. So bright.

354
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:29,817
[SHISHIMURA, GORIMI]
Africa High-School Girls!

355
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:35,692
[SHISHIMURA sighs]

356
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:39,817
Oh! Just looking at a cute
guy gets my heart pumping!

357
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,067
Ugh I know, right?

358
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,733
But I wish we could meet
some hotties in person

359
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:45,525
instead of ogling them on TokTik
all the time, don't you?

360
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:46,775
Big mood.

361
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:48,650
Plus, the guys at our
school are so shrimpy.

362
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,108
I want a real hunk of a man!

363
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,608
Yeah!

364
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:52,983
Enough with the pictures.

365
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,733
I want a boyfriend I can hug
and squeeze and cuddle!

366
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,067
[GORIMI]
What's wrong?

367
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,400
Girl, I think I just
solved our dilemma.

368
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,650
We just have to upload
a super-adorable video

369
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:04,775
to TokTik.

370
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:07,150
Then the boys will
slide into our DMs!

371
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,692
That's like the best idea ever!

372
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:10,983
Okay, let's do it.

373
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,817
[SHISHIMURA, GORIMI]
We love pancakes!

374

[laughing]

376
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:20,525
Omigod, look we're so pretty!

00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,858
Wow, Shishimura!

You know what?

382
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:34,067
Extra's good, but
we're, like, too extra.

383
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,192
Yeah, we overdid it, didn't we?

384
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,650
Let's reshoot.

385
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,692
Uh-huh.
