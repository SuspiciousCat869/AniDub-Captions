How 'bout you quit pushin' me!

[ZEBRA A]
You wanna go?

Ha! Now that was exciting!
What a lucky day.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,525
I just love witnessing a fight
first thing in the morning!

And I'm the first
one here again!

Nothing like peace and quiet.

Since the boss man died,
this place is a paradise!

Now, time to start
the day by slacking off!

Oh, boss!
I didn't see you there!

You said somebody died?

throw a party, huh?

Hang on, Mr. Honey Badger, sir.
I can explain, see?

21
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,192
The party is to make sure
you're not lonely in heaven.

22
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,817
Isn't that thoughtful of me?

Yeah, except I ain't there!

24
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,317
Besides. I ain't gonna
be lonely when I die.

would make you happy.

[HONEY BADGER]
Sure made you happy, didn't it?

Well, you won't make
this mistake again.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,733
You screwed up the wall,

00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,275
which means I'll be takin'
the cleaning fee

straight outta your salary.

33

[HONEYGUIDE] Gah! But I spent
so much money putting this

to pay that penguin back

for goin' number-two
on his suit.

At this rate, I won't
have enough money

to pay for my bills!

39
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,358
And forget about
upgrading my cell phone

like I was planning to!

Oh, why must I suffer?

42
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,733
Because you're a crappy person.

You're not wrong, Toucan.

I hope it's worth it to you
in the end, boss man!

What is that disgusting thing?

169
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,275
I think it got in
my mouth for a sec!

How is he alive after that?

[LION] Oh, no! Lizard's desk
exploded for no reason!

always so noisy!

Crap!

Did I really plant the bomb
in the wrong department?

00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,150
[LION] Ah! Now the apology

Hey, Toucan.

Have you read this

[TOUCAN]
Lizard.

190
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,858
Comics aren't work-related!

191
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,983
You should read the Daily Afbiz!

192
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,275
Where'd that come from?

193
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,733
Real adults don't waste
their time on manga and anime.

194
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,317
Be a professional, would ya?

195
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,358
I'm ashamed of you.

196
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:48,692
Wait. You're the one telling
me to act like an adult?

You're doing the same thing!
Take that back!

198
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:56,817
For busy guys like us,
I suggest this.

00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,317
Oh. HR!

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,317
Ya know, no one called you.

201
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,733
Correct! I was not summoned.

202
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,358
I came here because
I have business with Lion.

What's that on
your screen there?

00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,400
Only the best app ever!

207
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,650
It's a free manga reader!

Oh, sweet!

I'll bookmark it on my
phone and start readin'!

I take it you've
already changed your mind

211
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,650
about that whole
responsible adult idea, then.

212

Excuse me, Lion,
would you please do me a favor?

213
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:28,442
[LION] If it's about early
retirement, I'm not interested.

214
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,275
Well, somebody's gotta go!

215
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,317
Guess we'll just have
to draw straws, won't we?

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,775
[LION]
To see who gets fired?

217
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,817
That's not the reason
I'm here, though.

218
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,983
I want you to join me
at a speed-dating event!

219
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,233
Sorry, but I'm happily married.

220
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:45,067
Don't get so wrapped
up in the little details!

221
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,567
Just think of it as a favor
to your dear coworker!

222
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,358
But it's a big detail.

223

Come on, I need you!

224
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,275
These things are
really competitive!

What if there's a fight?
You can't miss that! Let's go!

226
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,483
[LION] But if they're
competing for dates,

227
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,483
then I can't even participate!

228
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,567
What would my wife say?

229
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,817
[HONEY BADGER]
Competing?

230
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,733
Fine. Then all you have
to do is get a divorce!

231

Yikes, it's him!

Oh, you startled me there!

it past the most people

before time runs out!

really how it works.

00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,775
I'm not going,
so it doesn't matter.

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
Somehow, I got
roped into it anyway.

241
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,650
This should be fun!

Please fill out your profile
cards so you can join us.

Uh, sure.

He asked me to come and he
hasn't even shown up yet.

Hey, Lion, sorry I'm late!

248
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,358
There wasn't a good
stopping point in my manga,

249
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:54,942
so I just finished
the whole thing.

Ah! Here's another
new participant!

251
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,525
Please fill this card out for me
if you'd be so kind.

[CARACAL]
You got it!

253
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,900
I don't want to
disappoint anyone today.

254
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:09,858
So I'll tell them I'm married.

255
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:13,983
[LION] I can only imagine
what Honey Badger put down.

256
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,858
Awesome's not an occupation!

257
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,567
Is everyone finished?

258
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,733
Excuse me!

00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,650
Yes, can I help you
with something, sir?

260
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,275
[LION] Would you mind
telling this gentleman

261
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:25,983
what speed-dating is?

262
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,817
Yes, the shadow-boxing fellow.

263
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,442
I don't think he gets it.

264
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,400
What is he fighting?

265
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,733
Pardon me, sir.

266
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,567
But this is my
first time, as well.

267
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,317
How exactly do we progress
from date to date?

268
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,650
I'll explain the rules.

269
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,733
Each one of our beautiful
female participants

270
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,150
will be seated like so,
which will leave a spot open

271
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,442
for a man to join her.

272
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,567
Each gentleman will
take a vacant seat,

273
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,525
then chat for a little bit while
perusing the profile cards.

274
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,775
And then!

275
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,275
The gentlemen will move
to the next empty seat

276
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:58,025
until two people find that
they have a mutual attraction,

277
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,817
at which time a couple
will be born!

278
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,067
Now then!

279
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,942
If everyone's ready,
get in there and date!

280
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:05,983
Right!

281
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,317
So we just keep looking
until we find who we want?

282
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,983
You know what, guys?

283
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,358
I understand now!

284
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:21,858
Speed-dating is exactly
like conveyor-belt sushi!

285
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,275
That's kind of a problematic
metaphor, but sure.

286
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,067
Hey! No, Honey Badger, wait!

before I kick your--

I think you're the only one
who's frustrated around here.

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,483
Something just occurred to me.

294
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,817
Is it possible that
this thing was a scam?

295
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,525
[HONEY BADGER grunts]

296
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,608
[LION]
A scam?

297
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,108
[CARACAL]
Yeah, I mean, there's no way in.

298
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:19,733
[LION]
Good point.

299
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,900
Not just that, but the
women get in for free,

300
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,025
and we had to pay 5,000 yen.

301
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,692
Then there's the job
and salary restrictions.

302
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:30,733
Not to mention, they're selling
people soap and detergent.

303
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,567
They almost sold
that pot earlier, too.

304
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,025
[LION]
Hmm...

305
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:37,150
The only beverage they
offer is tap water,

306
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,650
and all the cakes are
extremely dry and tasteless,

307
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,067
to put it lightly.

308
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,483
They can't be that bad
if you keep scarfing them down

309
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,692
like that.

310
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,192
[CARACAL]
And look at that shady egret

who's running the operation.

312

He's clearly a grifter.
