So that's Lion, huh?

Come on! Use your
tapetum to spook 'em!

370
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,650
[NARRATOR]
Let me explain!

371
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:33,025
The tapetum is a layer of tissue
in the eye that reflects light.

372
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,358
It's because of this layer
that cats can see so well

373
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,275
in the dark.

374
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:37,525
But remember, kids,

375
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,192
never point a flashlight
into an animal's eyes!

376

Ha! Now you look really scary!

Were you not listening?

How 'bout that?
I'll bet you're freaked out now.

379
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,733
You want the laser eyes to stop?

00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,692
Pay me back for my suit!

[HONEY BADGER]
Oh, yeah?

00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,858
That doesn't scare me at all!

384
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,567
[TOUCAN]
What?! But how?

385
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,525
[HONEY BADGER] You're talkin' to

They really do have those
for everything, don't they?

388
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,900
Not only that, but he
also bears a striking

389
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:15,400
resemblance to the famous
Nazca lines in Peru.

390
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:17,400
I couldn't stand up
to somebody like him!
