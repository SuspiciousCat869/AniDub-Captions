Social media?

2
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:23,233
Well, in this day and age,
I would consider it

3
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:25,442
an irreplaceable business tool.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,942
For example, it allows me
to connect with my colleagues

5
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:30,608
and get their perspective
on work-related issues.

6
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:33,817
Then, I can improve my
negotiations with my clients.

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,650
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,192
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

Ah! My kid has that!

10
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:42,275
Actually, I happened to
peek over her shoulder

11
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,525
while she was checking
her Fakebook the other day,

12
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,025
and boy, did she get angry!

13
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,483
Oh, Fakebook? Duh!

14
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,608
I'm on that thing 24/7!

It's the best way to
meet babes in my area!

16
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,483
If you ask me,

17
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,733
in this industry,
mixers are less about dating

18
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:05,108
and more about the networking.

19
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:07,858
In a way, they're part
of the job description.

20
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,233
What? Mixers?

21
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,150
Oh, no, I'm much too
old to get invited

22
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,817
to those things anymore.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,400
But listen to this!

24
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,400
I've noticed that my
precious little princess

25
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:19,275
has been attending an
awful lot of them recently.

26
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:21,817
As her father, it's
concerning to say the least!

27
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:24,650
Huh?

28
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,233
To hook up with
chicks, obviously.

29
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,733
Why else would you go to them?

30
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,400
Mixers are no joke, man!

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,608
Oh, no.

32
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:35,442
I certainly wouldn't
call it earnest.

Nah, I usually tune out when you
start whining about work stuff.

43
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,233
Makes my drink taste bad.

but you picked
the worst one ever.

You gotta be able to whip
somethin' out any second.

And it has to be
super flashy too.

a real rabbit and swallowed
it all in one bite, though.

in a business setting.

If you want to make
a strong impression,

159

Can't believe I gotta

But, if I left for five minutes,

some other firm or
a group of college kids

in sick and go see a movie.

Lest we forget,
the point of this party

220
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,567
is so Lizard can learn how to
be less of a boring buzzkill.

Right, it's not, but I
shouldered the burden anyway.

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,483
[NARRATOR]
If you hadn't guessed,

321
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,608
he invented that one, too.

322
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,608
[TOUCAN] Seriously,
you are such an angel!

323
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,608
But please, let me buy you
one more drink after this song.

324
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,192
It's the least I can do!

325
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:19,192
[WALLABEA]
Oh, that's okay, really.

326
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,108
[TOUCAN] Come on,
you'd be doing me a favor.

327
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,817
I'll never forgive myself
if I don't fix this!

328
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,817
[WALLABEA] I told you,
it's not that big a deal!

329
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,233
Ah, what the heck?

330
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:29,400
Fine, you can buy me one more,

331
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,483
but only because
you're so funny.

332
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,817
[TOUCAN] At this point,
you're 70% there.

333
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,650
[NARRATOR] This is conjecture
on Toucan's part.

334
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,900
[BOTH]
Cheers!

335
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,358
[WALLABEA]
Thank you again for the drink.

336
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,483
[laughs]

337
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,608
Oh, you're welcome.

338
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,108
And I'm sorry again
for spilling mine.

339
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,733
[WALLABEA] I told you,
there's no need to apologize!

340
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,025
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

341
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:52,442
[WALLABEA laughs]
You're so weird!

342
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,275
[TOUCAN laughs]
My old man always made me salute

343
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,108
whenever I screwed up as a kid.

344
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,692
So, uh, who did you
come here with?

345
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,025
Ugh.

346
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,733
Well, at first, I was here
with a friend of mine,

347
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,858
but she went home
with some random guy.

348
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:07,400
Yeah, random guys suck.

349
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:08,942
Can't say I mind, though.

350
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,317
After all,
if she was still here,

351
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,150
then I wouldn't have been
lucky enough to hang out

352
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,525
and have drinks with you!

353
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,358
[WALLABEA]
You're such a smooth talker!

354
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,775
Actually no,
I'm honest to a fault.

355
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,817
Lawyers aren't allowed
to tell lies.

356
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,650
Little-known tidbit for ya.

357
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,025
[WALLABEA]
Oh, really, is that so?

358
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,525
Yeah. Like, someone
was lying today in court,

359
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,192
so I yelled, "objection!"

360
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:32,067
And, "You're out of order!"

361
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,692
[NARRATOR]
It probably goes without saying,

362
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,525
but every word
of that was a lie.

363
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,483
Wow. Crazy.

364
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,192
[TOUCAN]
Huh? Is she listening?

365
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,692
In case you missed it,
yeah, I'm a lawyer.

366
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,192
So, not only am I honest,
but I'm super trustworthy too.

367
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:48,942
And filthy-stinkin'-rich.

368
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,233
[WALLABEA]
Uh-huh, that's interesting.

369
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,358
[TOUCAN] Come on!
What else could she want?

370
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:55,483
I'm sorry, but...

371
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,317
Don't women go nuts for lawyers?

372
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,483
You seem bored.

373
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,900
Eh, that's not really my thing.

374
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,442
Why? Lawyers rule!

375
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,108
Well, a man's profession
doesn't determine

376
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,692
what kind of person he is.

377
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,608
Um, okay.

378
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,442
[WALLABEA] If you think you
can reel me in by telling me

379
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,942
about your cushy job,
it's not going to work.

380
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,358
That's pathetic.

381
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,233
Uh, no. I wasn't.

382
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:19,192
[WALLABEA] I mean, the fact
that you even brought it up

383
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,525
is a clear indicator you think
I'm either shallow or stupid.

384
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,025
You're speechless now?

385
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,442
Guess I hit the nail
on the head.

386
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,025
You must've pegged me
for the kind of woman

387
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,733
who only cares about money.

388
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,567
Better luck next time, loser!

389
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,525
Bet you spilled your drink on
purpose, didn't you?

390
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,900
Oldest trick in the book!

391
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:37,150
You just wanted me to
feel responsible for you...

392
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,275
[NARRATOR] As his pride
was reduced to dust

393
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,025
and his very existence
faded into oblivion, eventually,

394
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,650
Toucan stopped thinking.

395
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,275
Oh, my!
The weather's outstanding!

396
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:56,317
Isn't it, though?

397
00:17:57,983 --> 00:18:01,567
Toucan! Thank you
for securing the spot!

398
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,608
We've brought plenty
of food and beverages!

399
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,067
We're ready to party!

400
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,858
Hey. What's wrong?

401
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,650
Um.. Toucan?

402
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,150
Ugh. All right,
enough playing around--

403
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,233
[LION]
Lizard.

404
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,942
He's dead.

405
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,317
I'm beat!

406
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,692
After all the craziness that
went down at the first club.

407
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,650
I partied my sorrows
away at another one.

408
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:34,983
Huh?

409
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:38,108
Sweet, the gang's all here!

410
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,817
I can't wait to check
out the flowers!

411
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,025
Wait... Excuse me?!

412
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,400
Um...

413
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,442
Sorry, but could you please
tell me who passed away?

414
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,567
It's me!

415
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,233
Oh...

416
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:54,317
Taken long before his time.

417
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,025
We were just acquaintances at
best, but I'll never forget him.

418
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,608
[TOUCAN]
Hey, you're doing it wrong!

419
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:04,108
Damn, did I really leave such
a weak impression on Big Cat?

420
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,525
Oh, god!

421
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,775
Toucan's dead. That idiot!

422
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:08,858
[TOUCAN]
Look at Lizard.

423
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,525
He's taking the
news pretty hard!

424
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,567
[LIZARD]
He's gone!

425
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,442
This is such a tragedy.

426
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,317
That moocher owes me money!

427
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,733
[TOUCAN] That's what
you're choked up for?!

428
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,983
I've always wanted
to play one of these.

429
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,650
Now let's bury this bird!

430
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,858
Bye-bye!

431
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,233
[TOUCAN] Is this the
best funeral you jerks

432
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:25,650
could put together?!

433
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,442
When I am dead, I'm comin'
back to haunt all of you!

434
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,108
It's flower-viewing
season again,

435
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:32,483
and folks are coming
out in droves today!

436
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,525
The cherry blossoms in
Ueno Park are in full bloom!

437
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,608
What's this?

438
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,275
For some reason,
this group over here

439
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,942
is behaving like
they're at a wake.

440
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,817
Let's go and check in!

441
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,733
What brings you here today?

442
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,942
Our coworker is dead!

443
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,275
[RABBIT REPORTER 3A] Oh, my
gosh, it really is a wake!

444
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,733
I'm so sorry!

445
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:50,983
Oof.

446
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,150
This whole thing is an
absolute dumpster fire.

447
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,858
[TOUCAN groans]

448
00:19:56,942 --> 00:20:00,567
Toucan was a loudmouth,
but I know I'll miss him!

449
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,942
Yes, I agree.

450
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,025
[gasps]

451
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,733
Like my favorite
manga character says,

452
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,983
this is a dog-eat-dog world.

453
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,067
And chickens eating yakitori
is basically a trope now.

454
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,608
[LIZARD]
That rascal!

455
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,858
He was trying to teach me a
party trick from the beginning!

456
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,858
[TOUCAN]
That's a hell of a stretch!

457
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:21,233
[crying]

458
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:23,400
Thank you for your sacrifice.

459
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,400
I read you loud and clear.

460
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:28,400
You wanted me to feed
your dead body to a bird!

461
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,275
[TOUCAN]
Nope, that's not a thing!

462
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,025
There's a bird right over there!

463
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,317
Hey!

464
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,358
[TOUCAN yells]

465
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,400
Now that I look closer,
you seem a little familiar!

466
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,983
Who, me? No way, man!

467
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,400
Come with me, please!

468
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,358
Whoa, hang on, what's happening?

469
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,858
Colleagues! Listen up!

470
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,275
Toucan told me that
he'd like to be made

471
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,442
into yakitori and
eaten by a bird!

472
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,942
No one said that!

473
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:58,150
And so today, I will see that
his final wish is granted!

474
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:01,150
This man, who kind
of resembles our Toucan,

475
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,608
has graciously agreed
to do the honors!

476
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,608
[TOUCAN]
Hey, I never agreed to jack!

477

00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:20,650
[LIZARD]
He's running away!

00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,275
Catch him!

Social media, huh?

489
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,650
That's a stupid question.

490
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,817
I can't live without it duh!

491
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,025
My dad looked over my
shoulder when I was checking

492
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,942
my Fakebook profile
the other day.

Ugh, that guy has no concept
of personal boundaries.

00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,317
This is your way of
asking for my contact info.

Omigosh, you media
