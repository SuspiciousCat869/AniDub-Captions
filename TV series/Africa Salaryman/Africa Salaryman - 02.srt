Oh, g'morning, honey.

161
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,025
[GIRLFRIEND 2A]
Good morning.

162
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,733
Morning, babe.

163
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,233
[GIRLFRIEND 2B]
Good morning, Can-Can!

164
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:24,108
That hot springs getaway
sure was relaxing, huh?

165
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,233
I'd love to soak in
each other's juices again

166
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,858
sometime soon, gorgeous.

167
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,608
[GIRLFRIEND 2A]
What are you talking about?

168
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,108
We've never had a hot
springs getaway together.

169
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,567
Oh, crap!

170
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,900
[GIRLFRIEND 2A] You'd better
explain yourself, mister!

171
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,567
There's another woman,
isn't there?

172
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,150
[GIRLFRIEND 2B]
Um, whose voice is that?

173
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,483
[GIRLFRIEND 2A] I hear you
over there, you little

174
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,192
homewrecking weasel!
I guess he didn't tell you

175
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:43,442
he had a girlfriend!

176
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:44,483
[GIRLFRIEND 2B]
Who are you calling a weasel?

177
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,525
I am a rabbit,
thank you very much!

178
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,317
You're the weasel here,
you tramp!

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,150
[GIRLFRIEND 2A] For your
information, I am not a weasel.

180
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,192
I happen to be a northern
hairy-nosed wombat, missy!

181
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,567
[GIRLFRIEND 2B]
The hell is that supposed to be?

182
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,942
[arguing continues]

183
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,442
Aw, yeah!

184
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,817
A long-distance catfight,
right here in my living room!

185
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,900
Anyway, I'm totally
traumatized now.

186
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,650
Yeah, I get it. Drop dead.

187
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,942
This must be so hard.
Serves you right.

188
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,775
Hard for the women, I mean.

189
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,317
You jerk!

190
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,650
[LION growling]

191
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,567
Looking busy...
I'm looking busy...

192
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,608
[PRES. TURTLE] Hello there,
my corporate drones!

193
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:44,442
How are you all today?

194
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,317
Oh, hey, President Turtle!
You need something?

195
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,858
We're pretty busy
over here, so...

196
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:56,025
You were literally petting
a stack of paper just now.

197
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,233
By the way, I wanted to ask you.

198
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:01,275
What do you always carry a fat
wad of cash on your head for?

199
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:03,233
That old thing?

200
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:04,775
Easy, pride!

201
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,275
I'm so filthy rich.

202
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,942
It's fun to do stupid things
with it and make you poors

203
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,608
feel like trash!

204
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:13,067
Hey. Who's in the mood
for turtle soup?

205
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,233
As appealing as that may be,
we can't kill the president.

206
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,275
[LION chuckles]

207
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,275
Well?

208
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,150
What can we do for you, sir?

209
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,483
I'm here because I have
a special assignment

210
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,358
for you three.

211
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,983
Special assignment, you say?

212
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,608
Tell me more.

213
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,858
It's very simple.

214
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,525
I would like you gentlemen to
locate the Mokele Mbembe for me.

215
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,400
[TOUCAN]
Moke what now?

216
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,233
It's a mysterious thing.

217
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,525
Wow, thanks, so helpful!

218
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:47,775
It's a rare and legendary
creature, but real!

219
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,483
[LIZARD] The Mokele Mbembe
is a mysterious cryptid

220
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,233
that is rumored to, but doesn't,

221
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,692
make its home in
Africa near the water.

222
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:01,275
Theories abound as to
what this being truly is

223
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,275
and how it should be classified.

224
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,275
Is it the last living dinosaur?

225
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,900
An alien lifeform?

226
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,025
A case of mistaken identity?

227
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:12,358
A mascot character for
(bleep) Village, perhaps?

228
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,775
Eyewitness accounts
are inconclusive,

229
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,775
so the Mokele Mbembe is a UMA,

230
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:20,067
or "unidentified
mysterious animal."

231
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,733
And why are we searching for it?

232
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,858
Because, well, she's my wife!

233
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:26,775
[chuckles]

234
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:28,775
What?! Is that true?

235
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:29,858
[PRES. TURTLE]
Course not, it's a joke!

236
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,275
[LIZARD]
Lying geezer!

237
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:33,942
That I am. Now quit your
bellyachin' and say yes already,

238
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,692
before I dock your pay!

239
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:39,192
[LIZARD] Gah, this has to be
against HR rules in some way!

240
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,858
Gah! As soon as I find
out what number to call,

241
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:44,233
I'm reporting you
for workplace violence!

242
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,067
Okay, so if this is
a work-related trip,

243
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,150
I'm assuming we're allowed
to expense transportation

244
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,150
and food?

245
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,567
Absolutely.

246
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,150
Up to 100 yen for transportation
and 300 yen for meals.

247
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,150
Total.

248
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,650
[TOUCAN]
Hello, is this Jobfinder?

249
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,942
Yeah, I need to find a new
position starting immediately.

250
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,025
Sure, I'll hold.

251
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,858
[LION]
Well.

252
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,442
We made it to the jungle.

253
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,692
Uh-huh.
So why don't you lead the way?

254
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,983
[grunting]

255
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,192
Hey, why are you pushing me?

256
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,067
You never know what
kinda terrifying predators

257
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,858
we might run into, and you've
got the most fighting potential,

258
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,900
--so get movin'! Go!
--[LION] Fighting potential?

259
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:27,858
What was it called again?

260
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:28,983
Moke...

261
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,067
Mo...

262
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,025
Uh, anyway, is there
any particular area

263
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,150
we should look at?

264
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,192
The details are a bit murky.

265
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,525
Says here its current rarity
is comparable to that

266
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,233
of the lethal hamster.

267
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:45,067
You mean the one that
shows up at the office

268
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,733
wielding carving knives?

269
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,567
That doesn't help us much!

270
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,692
So, in Animal Crossroads,
it'd be tuna.

271
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:52,650
[LION]
I love that game!

272
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,358
That you get.

273
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,525
Ah!

274
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,025
Look, there's a pond!

275
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,067
I bet it's close by, right?

276
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,233
Wow, that sure is
a good-sized pond!

277
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:03,775
No animals, though.

278
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,025
Not even one.

Yeah!

I caught a tuna!

And look!
I've never seen one this big!

Ah. Nice catch, Toucan. Slacker!

Hey, you two!

287
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,608
I see something!

288
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,108
[TOUCAN]
Just a kappa.

289
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,108
[LION]
Yeah. That's nothing.

290
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,192
[LIZARD]
Kappas are mythical creatures!

291
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,942
If you're going to get
excited about something,

292
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:43,983
it should be that, not your
dumb little video game!

293
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,650
Yeah, well, I'm only
gettin' paid to worry

294
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,025
about the other thing,
so it's kinda hard to care.

295
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:52,067
[LION] Hmm. And I want to
get home by sundown,

296
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,025
so can we speed this up?

00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,358
[LIZARD]
Ugh.

298
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,567
Looks like I'm in the minority.

299
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,983
Let's just see what
this thing has to say.

300
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,067
Excuse me, but could I ask
you a question, please?

301
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,525
Sure! Ask all you want!

302
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,108
[LIZARD] That is not the
voice I was expecting!

303
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,233
Er... You see...

304
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,108
My friends and I are looking
for something called

305
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:17,150
the Mokele Mbembe.

306
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:20,275
I don't suppose you've
seen it somewhere?

307
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,608
You mean Mbembe?

308
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,775
Yeah, I can definitely help you!

309
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:24,817
Wonderful!

310
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,817
Um... In that case...

311
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,983
Where is it now?

312
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,275
I'm not gonna tell you
for free, silly.

313
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:31,733
Er, fair enough.

314
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,317
We don't have much money,
but maybe we could work out

315
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,733
a payment plan?

316
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,692
Oh, I don't need any money.

317
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:38,775
[LIZARD]
N-No money...?

318

Right, of course you do.

[TOUCAN]
Sorry, I was playin' my game.

What's goin' on now?

325
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:00,150
This one's a real catch.

He looks like a monster
with that big ugly beak.

for a small favor?

I would like a companion.

[KAPPA]
Oh, Mbembe?

He's been right over
there this entire time,
