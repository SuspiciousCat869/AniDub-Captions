Morning comes early in Africa.

Each day, the animals
wake to greet the rising sun.

Drank too much last night.

[MRS. LION] Oh, darling,
your breakfast is ready!

7
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,150
[LION]
Thank you, dear!

8
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,067
I'll be down in a minute!

9
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,233
Back to the news.

10
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,983
First, we've seen an uptick
in both road rage

11
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,733

[MRS. LION]
Pass the pepper, would you?

14
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,650
[LION]
Hm? Oh, sure.

15

Let's see.

16

Ugh, more fur.

17
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,525
Always with the fur.

18

[LION]
I'm just your average salaryman.

19

[MRS. LION] Take the trash
out when you leave!

20

Got it, honey.

21

See you tonight!

22
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:35,108
[LION] I get along with
everyone at the office.

23
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:38,108

"Big Cat."

[RABBIT MOTHER] Oh, my
goodness! Get behind me!

26
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,483
I beg you, sir, please don't
eat my innocent baby!

27
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,150
[LION] But ma'am,
I'm not going to--

28
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:53,358
[RABBIT CHILD]
Mommy!

29
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:55,608
[LION] No, no, it's not
what it looks like!

30
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,858
[LION]
I'd say I'm well-liked.

31
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,442
At least, I should be.

32

[LION]
Morning, everyone.

33
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,858
Hey, Big Cat,
it's good to see ya!

34
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,692
Welcome to work, sir.

35
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,483
Ah! Lizard!
Why are you bleeding?

36
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,817
Sorry.

37
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,817
Well, I'm so glad
you asked, my friend!

38
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,483
You'll never believe the
crazy story behind this!

39
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,608
[LION]
Tell me everything.

40
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,650
Okay.

41
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,608
[TOUCAN] Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on!

42
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,483
What kinda slowpoke
animal's drivin' that thing,

43
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,817
a friggin' sloth? Move it, bub!

44
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,900
I'm driving a Lexun,
I'm obviously more important

45
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,108
than you!

46
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:12,442
[TOUCAN] Every morning
on the way to work,

47
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,483
I tailgate compact cars
in my Lexun

48
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,400
and flip people the bird
as I'm cutting them off.

49
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,192
It's a real rush of adrenaline.

50
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,733
Really gets me ready
for my day y'know?

51
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:20,942
[LION]
I don't know.

52
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,442
The news says that kind
of thing is becoming

53
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,275
a serious problem lately.

54
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,025
You should probably
stop doing it.

55
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,275
[TOUCAN]
Anyway, my car's in the shop,

56
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,567
so I took the train for
the first time in a while.

57
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,733
Ah...!

58
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,525
That store's supposed
to say "Glasses,"

59
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,817
but the first part's missing.

60
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,483
Lizard. See that?

61
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,317
Look at what
that store's called.

62
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,275
It's "Asses"!
Ha, they sell asses!

63
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,483
Don't you see it?
It's right in front of you!

64
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:47,942
Yes, I can see it!

65
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:49,192
It's "Asses"!

66
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,483
You should stop saying
inappropriate things in public

67
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,692
or people will start
labeling you as a pervert.

68
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:57,775
That's the beauty of it, Lizard.
I am a perv.

69
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,400
[sighs] Jeez, so touchy.

70
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,317
Whatever happened
to free speech?

71
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,067
Huh? Who did that?

72
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,108
Hello?

73
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,483
Perv!

74
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,900
[TOUCAN]
Uh...

75
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,608
[GORIMI yells] This horny
hornbill touched my butt!

76
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,483
[SHISHIMURA] Yeah, how
dare you, you total creeper!

77
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,692
First, I'm a toucan.

78
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,317
And second, if you're
angling for a check,

79
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,942
article 172 of the Penal Law

80
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,733
says a false complaint
can put you in prison

81
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,567
for up to ten years,
so suck on that, ladies.

82
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,733
So mean!

83
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,067
Don't you have something
nice to say to us?

84
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,608
--Huh, mister?
--[TOUCAN] Shut up, ugly.

85
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:28,942
I hope you die.

00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,567
Please! Wait just a minute!

87

It's true this man is
an absolute birdbrain,

88
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,358
but he's no pervert.

89
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:39,067
[BOTH] What a hunk.
He's totally my type.

90
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,567
[TOUCAN] Hey, thanks for
stickin' up for me and all,

91
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,192
but you did still call me
a birdbrain, so...

92
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,067
Think about it this way, girls.

93
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,317
No salaryman would
put his career on the line

94
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,108
to hassle women,
especially someone like him

95
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:51,317
who needs to pay off a luxury
vehicle he can't afford.

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,150
The risk would
be much too great!

97
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,025
Yeah, like we'd believe that!

98
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:57,233
You better show me
some proof pronto!

at his phone then.

102
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:08,608
This man isn't attracted
to young girls like you.

103
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,483
Oh, no, only the most
professional of MILFs

Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,567
[TOUCAN] Oh, thanks for
kink-shaming me in public, dude.

106
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,192
[LIZARD]
Have I made it perfectly clear?

107
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,608
[TOUCAN]
Again, thanks for your help,

enough to convince them?

You're hitting on me now?

'Cuz I can buy you
whatever you like.

322
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,858
I brought my own
money and everything!

00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:25,483
Aw. You're trying
to buy my love.

So, babe.

How's about you and I go
paint the town after this, huh?

00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,900
Um... That's moving
a little too fast.

Uh, tell me.

You got any hobbies, or...?

Oink? Oink oink oink. Oink!

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,400
Oh. Really?

332
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:47,317
That's so interesting.

[TOUCAN]
Come on!

334
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,192
Does she seriously expect me
to understand pig language?

335
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,567
And why am I bein' polite
to her in the first place?

336
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,817
I mean, what's in it for me?

337
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,567
Hey! Bacon-breath!

338
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,900
You're gross!

339
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,692
How can you pig out like
that with all these people

340
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,233
around you?!

341
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:09,275
[CHIKO]
It's true!

342
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,733
Pigella's family owns
a huge company!

343
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:15,275
Whoever that girl ends up with,
they'll be in hog heaven!

344
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:20,608
[TOUCAN] Oh, I just love
the way you eat your food,

345
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,692
it's so primal!

346
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,025
[laughs]

347
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:26,733
Oh.

348
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,733
You've got something on
your face, sweet cheeks.

349
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,192
That ought to help ya.

350
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,233
It's my extremely expensive
St. Laurond handkerchief.

351
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,358
[laughs]

352
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,983
You know what,
you can keep that.

353
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,525
Don't worry about it.

354
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:43,025
[TOUCAN]
Damn it all!

355
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:45,650
That handkerchief cost me 30,000
yen, thank you very much!

356
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,775
It's not like I have a problem
with women who can eat,

357
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,858
but that pig-like way she
does it is enough to make me

358
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,275
lose my lunch!

359
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:52,983
Though, I guess you can't
really call it "pig-like"

360
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,108
when the chick's an actual pig!

361
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:58,817
Stay cool, Toucan.

362
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,733
As soon as we're married,
her family fortune

00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:02,525
will be all mine!

That's it.

00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,692

gets turned into those cheap

Um, hello?

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,317
I said, I would like
to stay in touch!

Huh? Uh...

00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:10,067
What's up, guys? You're quiet.

00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,567
[JACKIE] Um, what do
you think you're doing?

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,483
Uh... I'm sorry.

391
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:17,942
This lovely young lady and I

392
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,567
were about to
trade contact info,

393
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,942
that's all.

394
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,233
Contact info?

395
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:25,275
Uh, but that pig
is Pigella's pet.

396
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,400
So why would you...?

397
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,442
Huh?

398
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,858
Pigella couldn't make
it out here tonight,

399
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,067
so she thought maybe it
would be nice to send Pigette

400
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,775
to the mixer in her place.

401
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,900
Pigette's been cooped up
in the house a lot,

402
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:39,650
so it seemed like a good idea.

I don't believe this!

I don't care how rich
her owner is,

and carve it up for dinner!

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,692
which is why I'm done
with mixers for a while.

you're gonna get.

Hmm, that certainly
sounds like a trying evening.

413
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:17,233
At no point during that
story did I feel even

414
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,775
the slightest bit of
sympathy for you, Toucan.

415

Eh. I'll treat myself
to a massage.
