stuff and see what kind

468
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,567
of content works best.

469
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,067
[SHISHIMURA]
Smart.

470
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,317
[CRANE] Next up, the boss
whose face is a lethal weapon.

471
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,567
[SHISHIMURA]
"Lethal weapon"?

472
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,608
That's hysterical!

473
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:10,233
--He must be ugly!
--[CRANE] Here he comes.

474
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:11,525
Bam!

475
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,983
[laughs] Oh, wow!
No wonder this guy's videos

476
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,275
are so popular!

477
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:16,733
[GORIMI]
Wait, isn't that...?

478
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:18,650
[SHISHIMURA laughs]
I'm literally dead!

479
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,942
--[laughs]
--Um, Shishimura?

480
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,442
Yeah, what's up?

481
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:23,900
[GORIMI]
That guy on screen...

482
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,983
What about him?

483
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,108
[GORIMI]
Doesn't he look like your dad?

484
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,483
Huh?

485
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,775
[laughs]

486
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,567
Nah, there's no way
that's my dad.

487
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,525
His face isn't scary--

488
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:37,233
I mean, uh, Daddy...?

489
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:43,067
[SHISHIMURA] As soon as I catch
you, I'm ripping your wings off!

490
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:49,275
[CRANE] Next time on
Africa Salaryman: "Africa BBQ."
