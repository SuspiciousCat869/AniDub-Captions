00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,567
Guys.

320
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,317
Even though they are great,

321
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,567
we have to hold
our heads up high.

322
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,483
We worked hard.

323
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,775
And without faith, we can't win.

324
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:40,650
Heh. I never thought you would
be the voice of reason.

325
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,900
I agree. Thank you, Toucan!

326
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:45,692
In our hearts,
we're already winners today!

327
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,067
[AFCADO CHIEF]
Let's keep the ball rolling.

328
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,483
Africa Trading?

329
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:58,983
Now then, without further ado,
here is our presentation.

330
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,608
Thank you.

331
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:21,108
This concludes our proposal.

332
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,692
They had good energy and
their ideas were creative,

333
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,358
but our plan is more efficient,
so we're the obvious choice.

334
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,317
I knew we had this in the bag.

335
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,358
[LIZARD] Is he mad at us
because we threw it together

336
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,858
so quickly?

337
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:52,233
[TOUCAN] If he yells at me,
I'm jumping out the window!

338
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,858
[AFCADO CHIEF]
That was incredible!

339
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,525
[GROUP]
Huh?

340
00:17:58,608 --> 00:18:00,525
[BOTH gasp]

341
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,067
[AFCADO CHIEF]
I'm quite impressed!

342
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,525
AfCado would like to proceed
with Africa Trading's

343
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:07,275
proposal for the project!

344
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,108
We're so happy to
have your business!

345
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:11,400
--[TOUCAN] That's great!
--Are you kidding?!

346
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,775
But sir!

347
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,483
We had much lower costs
and our schedule was better!

348
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,483
[AFCADO CHIEF] I do agree
that Tiger & Leopard's plan

349
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,900
was superior in every way.

350
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:22,233
However, your plan
lacked a certain "fire"

351
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:23,608
that we felt was crucial.

352
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,942
Fire? I don't believe my ears!

353
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,983
[AFCADO CHIEF] It's just that
you seemed somewhat detached

354
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,400
from your message.

355
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,858
Was your slideshow
created by someone else?

356
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,525
[BOTH gasp]

357
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:35,525
[AFCADO CHIEF]
I'll take that as a yes.

358
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,317
[LEOPARD]
Well, even if we didn't make it,

359
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,858
the content is what matters!

360
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:41,108
[AFCADO CHIEF] We've taken
content into consideration.

361
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,733
[TIGER]
This is an outrage!

362
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,192
[AFCADO CHIEF]
We wanted a proposal that really

363
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:46,608
got to the heart
of the Cinema Café project,

364
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,692
and Africa Trading delivered.

365
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:51,483
If the cost is a little higher,
then so be it.

366
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,775
[BOTH gasp]

367
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,525
It was touch-and-go for a while,

368
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,442
but luckily, we managed
to strike a deal with them!

369
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,650
I'm so happy
everything worked out.

370
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,275
Now I won't get
fired or divorced!

371
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,858
[LION] You really had a lot
on the line, didn't you?

372
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,067
By the way, Big Cat,

373
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,358
you never told us why
they hate your guts.

374
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,942
[LION]
Well, I uh...

375
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,900
[TIGER] 'Cause he ate the
flans we were lookin' forward

376
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,275
to havin' later that day.

377
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,275
Yeah, he did us real dirty.

378
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:27,817
Wait.

379
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,233
You almost ruined our lives
over a couple of stolen flans?

380
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,400
No, they weren't just
any old flans!

381
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:34,608
They were for
a super special treat!

382
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,692
That was a classic
Toucan move, buddy.

383
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,483
I'm so proud.

384
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,608
Sorry. I'm the worst.

385
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,525
Grudges are one thing,
but food grudges

386
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,150
can run especially deep.

387
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,650
We may've lost this battle,

388
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,275
but we'll be back to get
our revenge someday!

389
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,733
[LION whimpering]

390
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,192
Hang on, what kind
of flan did he take?

391
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,150
Afaf Flan, the best kind!

392
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,900
And the most upsetting
part of it is,

393
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,900
the company that used to
make it went out of business

394
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,192
forever after that!

395
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:01,817
[TOUCAN]
Huh. You sure?

396
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,358
It says here they're
up and running again.

397
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:05,983
Really? That's amazing!

398
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,192
In that case,
I'll treat both of you

399
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,608
to some Afaf Flan next week!

400
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,192
Now that sounds like a plan.

401
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,817
Looking back on it,

402
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,567
I don't know why we got
so bent out of shape

403
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,900
over some silly flan.

404
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,108
Ten cups each!

405
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,608
Whoa, is that really
what it's like to be

406
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,150
an awkward old guy?

407
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,150
I hope I don't
turn out that way.

408
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,733
Attention, please,
let's raise a glass

409
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:37,358
in celebration of these three,
who won a major client for us.

410
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,317
I hope the rest of you
corporate drones

411
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,358
will follow their example.

412
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,692
Now for a few words from them.

413
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,400
I have to say,
this victory belongs

414
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,025
to my dearest colleagues,
Lizard and Toucan.

415
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:49,692
I could never have
accomplished this feat

416
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,025
on my own.

417
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,067
Although it's tempting
to revel in the successes

418
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,400
we've achieved,

419
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,775
I believe that this is only
the very beginning.

420
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,108
I plan to work hard
and make the Cinema Café

421
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,317
project the best it can be!

422
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Ugh. I always hate
these long speeches.

Oh, AfCado's calling me.

Hello? Sure, I can talk.

426
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,817
Wait. Huh?

427
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,567
What?! You don't want
to work with us now?!

428
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,233
Oh, no!

429
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,608
Gah! Hundreds of millions,
out the door!

430
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,483
Did they happen to mention what
made them change their minds?

431
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,692
LOL! Just kidding!

[GROUP growls]

433
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:30,733
Okay, now that I've
got your attention,

434
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,817
I say we should propose a toast!

Um, you guys look angry.

Come on, this is a party,
we're here to have some fun.

[LIZARD] You're about to learn
the difference between

438
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,483
a good joke and a bad one!

Okay, real talk.

What did everybody think
of Africa Salaryman?

Really? It wasn't funny?

What? You don't like it?

If there wasn't
a screen between us,

I'd murder you!

it's not worth it.
