I wonder if they all have
their eyes on that same

314
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,775
big company I do.

315
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:33,358
Well, no matter how
fierce the competition is,

316
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:36,817
I've worked hard for this,
and I'm not gonna lose!

317
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,983
[LION]
Oh, no.

318
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,483
I forgot my writing utensils.

319
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,108
[CARACAL]
Typical.

320
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,192
[LION]
And my application form.

321
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,483
[CARACAL]
Wow! That's not a good sign.

322
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,733
[LION] Uh-oh. I didn't bring
my cover letter, either.

323
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,983
[CARACAL]
What's wrong with this guy?!

324
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:56,108
[sighs] Come on!
Be more professional!

325
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:59,150
[LION] Excuse me, do you
have a pen I could borrow?

326
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,442
Sure. I brought several,
so don't worry about

327
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,525
giving it back.

328
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,775
[LION] Wonderful!
Thank you so much!

329
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:08,567
[CARACAL] I don't have
time for these amateurs.

330
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,942
Twenty minutes left.

331
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,692
I should head over.

332
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,025
I know my interview strategy,

333
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,900
and I made a good
impression as an intern.

334
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,983
So I have absolutely
nothing to fear.

335
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,650
Unless, of course...

336
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,150
Oh, no, what if I run into
some trouble on the way there?

337
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,442
[TOUCAN] Hey, old man!
Goin' somewhere?

338
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,983
[PRES. TURTLE]
Stop it! That hurts!

339
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:31,983
Darned kids.

340
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,275
[CROCODILE]
Stupid turtle!

341
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,317
You're frickin' ugly!

342
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,817
[CARACAL]
That poor turtle.

343
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,942
They're assaulting him!

344
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,942
[HYENA] Let me see ya
lay an egg, grandpa!

345
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:43,817
[PRES. TURTLE]
Ow, that makes no sense!

346
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,650
Listen, I swear
I'll buy you youngsters

347
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,775
anything you want,
just leave me alone!

348
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,483
[HYENA] I don't think
I can crack his shell open,

349
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,067
dude, it's way too thick!

350
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,483
Let's pretend like it's (bleep)
and throw him into traffic!

351
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:57,650
[TOUCAN] Oh, man, that'd be
such a good prank, let's do it!

352
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,775
[HYENA] Okay, so if we want
it to be just like the game,

353
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,317
then we need to find
a way to make him

354
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,942
stick his head in and
legs inside so he slides

355
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,233
like a hockey puck!
Come on, you old fart,

356
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,692
you better do what we say
if you know what's good for ya!

357
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:09,858
[TOUCAN]
...we ain't got all day!

358
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,233
[PRES. TURTLE]
I can't do that!

359
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:14,108
Stop heckling me,
I'm begging you!

360
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:18,733
[GROUP] Slide for us!
Slide for us! Slide for us!

361
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:20,817
[laughing]

362
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,358
Cut it out, you brats!

363
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,858
You're wasting my time!

364
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:27,900
I've got a very important
interview, I'll have you know!

365
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,692
[BOTH groan]

366
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,608
Another mouthy old guy?

367
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,733
You came down the wrong street!

368
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,483
Aw, yeah, this is gonna be good.

369
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,150
Teach him a lesson, dude!

370
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,108
[CARACAL] I'd rather not
resort to violence.

371
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,983
But if I must...

372
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:44,983
Face me.

373
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,900
[HYENA]
Quit actin' all tough!

374
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,942
[CARACAL yelling]

375
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,983
[HYENA]
"Face me," really?

376
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,567
Who even is this nerd?

377
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,733
That's it, rearrange his face!

378
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:10,817
Yeah, make that loser pray
for the sweet release of death!

379
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,400
[BOTH grunting]

380
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,150
[CARACAL] Well, at this rate,
I doubt I'll make my interview

381
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,567
in one piece, much less
in a timely manner.

382
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:23,025
Maybe I'll use my savings
to go to graduate school

383
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,067
and put off job-hunting
for a little while.

384
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,358
Ooh, or better yet,

385
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,358
I could pursue my
childhood dream of becoming

386
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,817
a manga artist!

387
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:35,650
Ya had enough yet,
stupid pussycat?

388
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,067
[panting]

389
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,692
[LION] Excuse me, but could I
ask you for directions?

390
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,108
[HYENA]
What do you want, you old--

391
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,567
[BOTH scream]

392
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,608
[CROCODILE]
Holy crap! He's really scary!

393
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,150
[HYENA]
We should run!

394
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,775
[TOUCAN]
Don't blame me!

395
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,525
I'm just a sweet,
innocent little kid!

396
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,317
[CROCODILE] Hey wait,
don't leave me all alone

397
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,525
with the big scary lion,
come back!

398
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,650
[LION]
Um, so, can you help me?

399
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:04,775
[CARACAL]
That really smarts.

400
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,192
[LION]
Oh, hey!

401
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,983
You're that nice gentleman
who lent me a pen earlier,

402
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,150
aren't you?

403
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,067
[LION]
Um, thank you so much again!

404
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,650
What? Oh. Mm-hmm.

405
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,817
Omigod! Look at what time it is!

406
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,817
I'll never make it now.

407
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,733
[LION]
Gosh, are... are you all right?

408
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,942
My, you really came
to my rescue there,

409
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,775
young fellow!

410
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,983
[LION]
What's wrong?

411
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,608
[CARACAL]
I had a job interview today,

412
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:37,608
but I fought a bunch
of kids instead.

413
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:40,108
Boo-hoo-hoo, life is suffering.

414
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,858
That sounds like a predicament.

415
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,483
Well, if it's any consolation,

416
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,942
I'd be happy to let you come
work at my office instead.

417
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,525
[CARACAL]
Huh?

418
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:50,858
[PRES. TURTLE] I'm president of
a company that's housed inside

419
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:52,942
that wastefully tall skyscraper.

420
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,817
[CARACAL gasps]

421
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,983
[PRES. TURTLE chuckles]

422
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,483
At my firm, you'd
have a chance to make

423
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,025
ten million yen a year,
even in your twenties!

424
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,400
If you work 200 hours
of overtime, that is.

425
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,692
[CARACAL]
What?!

426
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:06,275
[PRES. TURTLE] And you there
with the scary face.

427
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,233
You're hired too!

428
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,317
[LION]
Really? Thank you, sir!

429
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,275
That's great!

430
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,983
And that's the story
of how I landed this job.

431
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:16,858
I guess the president's
never been strict

432
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,983
in his hiring practices.

433
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,400
And it sounds like Lion's
always had a scary face.

434
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,483
Indeed I have, and that
was 20 years ago,

435
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,900
before I started growing this
intimidating beard of mine!

436
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,025
The boss hasn't
changed much, though.

437
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,942
He was born old.

438
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,900
Well, in my honest opinion,

439
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,483
this story isn't quite
appropriate for the job fair

440
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:38,942
for a lot of reasons.

441
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:42,650
Aw, but we don't have
any more material.

442
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,983
It was heartwarming,
if you ask me.

443
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,650
[TOUCAN]
Twenty years ago, huh?

444
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,150
I used to play all over
this neighborhood as a kid,

445
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,025
and I seem to remember
havin' a lot of fun

446
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:55,150
with a local
senior citizen, too.

447
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,233
[GROUP laughing]

448
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:00,525
[TOUCAN] Break his shell,
maybe candy'll come out!

449
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,442
I wonder whatever happened
to that sad, old geezer!

450
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,400
[laughing]

451
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,650
[SHISHIMURA, GORIMI]
Africa High-School Girls!

452
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:46,442
[SHISHIMURA] Nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom! Mmm!

453
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:49,317
What's wrong?
Why do you look so serious?

454
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,900
'Kay. Don't freak out, but
I think I may have just had

455
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,983
a stroke of, like,
supreme genius!

456
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,483
I'm gonna be rich!

457
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:58,775
Really? Omigod, you have
to tell me your idea!

458
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,942
Hmm! We could totally
sell yakisoba bread filling

459
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,400
without any bread!

460
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,733
Oh, yeah, everyone
would buy that stuff.

461
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,233
Ya, I know!

462
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,900
Since it's literally
just yakisoba.

463
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,358
[SHISHIMURA]
Right.

464
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:13,442
[GORIMI] But hey, you know
that pastry that's basically

465
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,192
a banana with bread
wrapped around it?

466
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,108
If you got rid of the bread
and whipped cream,

467
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:19,692
you could make
bank selling that!

468
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,483
Mmm. I mean yeah, I guess so.

469
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,358
[GORIMI] Yay, I can't wait
to be super rich and stuff!

470
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:27,900
Um, you do know that's
just a banana, right?

471
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,233
[GORIMI] Um, do you
think we might be...?

472
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:32,192
[SHISHIMURA]
Don't even finish that sentence!

473
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,817
You were like,
getting ready to call us dumb,

474
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,858
weren't you?

475
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:36,817
[GORIMI]
No. I was gonna say stupid.

476
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,692
[SHISHIMURA] Dumb is just
another word for stupid, stupid!

477
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,192
But yeah.

478
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,483
I think you might've just
proved we're not the brightest

479
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,692
of the bunch.

480
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:47,150
[CARACAL]
Next time! On Africa Salaryman!

481
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,067
"Africa! Nasty Coworker!"
