1
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,876
<i>Surreal and incomprehensible,</i>

2
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,322
<i>cobbled together during an all-night editing session,</i>

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:22,742
<i>the movie, spawned from the director/producer's
whacked out mind, was finished.</i>

4
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,293
<i>The SOS Brigade was now free to spend a
peaceful first day at the school arts festival.</i>

5
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:33,089
<i>Fortunately for me, Haruhi decided she'd handle
all the negotiating and promoting stuff by herself.</i>

6
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:37,227
<i>My job was to drop off the DVD with the
Film Club, who was screening the movie for us.</i>

7
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:42,144
<i>After that, I wandered around the campus with a
cloud-free conscience, enjoying the festival atmosphere...</i>

8
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:44,071
<i>despite my sleep-deprived state.</i>

9
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:50,521
<i>However, there was still one important
duty that I had to take care of.</i>

10
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:26,875
<i>Unlike my class of slackers, whose
activity was some kind of campus survey thing,</i>

11
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:31,271
<i>Nagato, Koizumi, and Miss Asahina were working
the attractions their classes had organized.</i>

12
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:36,427
You will buy soft-serve ice cream five
minutes and fifteen seconds from now.

13
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:39,127
You will drop it in five minutes
and twenty-eight seconds from now.

14
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:42,198
You will hit your head on a sign
seven minutes and six seconds from now.

15
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,657
And then, you will bump into
your girlfriend and fall over.

16
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:46,777
The items in her bag will scatter, leading to quarrel...

17
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:50,975
<i>Take it easy, Nagato. You're telling
their fortunes, not predicting their future.</i>

18
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,584
You and I both know very well that the law of
probability governs all of nature and the world around us.

19
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:03,342
And yet, having witnessed this phenomenon, I
now find it difficult to believe in such a thing.

20
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,473
Perhaps we should think on this
occurrence in a different way,

21
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:09,073
that we are in the midst of something supernatural,

22
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:11,682
a far cry from anything we have ever known.

23
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:14,508
For example, let us say that we have six...

24
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:15,701
<i>What is this?</i>

25
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:18,389
<i>Could you just let us know when we're supposed to laugh?</i>

26
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,457
Come on in and check out our stuff today!

27
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:21,710
You'll be sorry if you don't!

28
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,111
Yo!

29
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,107
You guys have any luck?

30
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,995
Nope. Not as much as I expected.

31
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,588
Table Tennis Club had ping pong ice cream, though.

32
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,906
Senior year, class 3, had some good udon.

33
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:34,331
Junior year, class 5, had chocolate-covered
bananas that were more bananas than chocolate.

34
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,419
You're kidding! All you're doing is eating?

35
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,281
Yeah, we're just sampling the food.

36
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,305
Now it's time to get to the real deal, though.

37
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,793
The cosplay cafe!

38
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:45,256
Man, that bunny girl outfit
from a while back was unbelievable.

39
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,898
I wonder what she's gonna wear today.

40
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,723
Yeah, well, we acted in your movie for free.
And then I was pushed in the water for free.

41
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:54,619
And all we got to show for it is a
coupon for 30% off some fried noodles?

42
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,180
You ask me, it really wasn't worth it.

43
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,156
You don't like it, don't come! Just go home!

44
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:02,688
Yeah, right! Not before I sneak a peek
at Miss Asahina in all her cosplay glory.

45
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:06,824
I wonder if she'll be a waitress in a tight
little miniskirt like she was in the movie.

46
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,358
<i>Her sense of style isn't the same as Haruhi's, buddy.</i>

47
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>But a waitress outfit handmade by one of her classmates?</i>

48
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,528
<i>I'm so there!</i>

49
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,252
Thank you.

50
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:19,478
Hey! It's Kyon and his buddies! Come on over here,

51
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,752
Thanks for coming by. Table for three today?

52
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,157
Oh, wait. What do you think about my outfit?

53
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,668
Doesn't this thing look totally awesome on me, megas?

54
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,184
Aren't I cute, kyon?

55
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,571
Oh, absolutely. You're packing them in!

56
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,599
The fish always take the bait!

57
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:35,474
I mean, it's just bad fried noodles
made with really cheap ingredients,

58
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,283
but look at all these people standing in line!

59
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:40,183
We're raking in so much money, I can't stop laughing!

60
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,793
<i>Yeah, and I'm sure it's just coincidence
that all your customers are guys.</i>

61
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,081
Oh, head over there! It's the end of the line!

62
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,728
Go on, get in line!

63
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,968
Here we are. Please pay in advance.

64
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,037
Oh! And another thing, we've only
got fried noodles and tap water.

65
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:57,323
Now, the noodles are 300 yen each, but
the water's free, so it's all you can drink!

66
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,757
So, what's this get us?

67
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:03,306
Let's see, so it's just the three of you...
With these things, we're talking 500 yen!

68
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:04,494
Some deal, huh?

69
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:11,808
Okay, boys, hang out here for a sec,
and your turn'll be coming up shortly!

70
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,874
Wow, she's a hyper girl.

71
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:18,115
Is she a member of you and Suzumiya's buncha whackos, too?

72
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:18,756
Nope.

73
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,608
By the way, don't forget to split the change with us.

74
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,266
<i>He got me.</i>

75
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:26,428
<i>The, uh, "shortly" that Miss Tsuruya
was talking about was 30 minutes.</i>

76
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,033
<i>So, we stood outside and waited
until she finally let us in.</i>

77
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:35,051
Okay. Oh! Welcome to our cafe!

78
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,564
<i>She's a dazzling waitress who'd put a
million dollar view of the city lights to shame.</i>

79
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:42,142
She's got a different glimmer here than back at the club.

80
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:45,875
Welcome! And thank you so much
for stopping by to see us today!

81
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,288
Thank you for your help on the movie.

82
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,360
<i>I see...</i>

83
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:57,112
<i>If they let you take pictures, there'd be a riot for sure.</i>

84
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,161
<i>I'd give those costumes the award for best design.</i>

85
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,781
<i>Then you've got those two,</i>

86
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:03,909
<i>who could be on the cover of a teen fashion magazine.</i>

87
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,770
Put 'em together, and it's a magnificent sight.

88
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,864
Mikuru's in charge of collecting the tickets.

89
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,264
She's also the one clearing the empty plates and
refilling the water. If I let her serve the noodles,

90
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,807
she'd probably trip and spill 'em on somebody!

91
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,466
<i>Wow, she really gets it.</i>

92
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:21,941
<i>In the end, pressured by the
super fast customer turn-around,</i>

93
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,329
<i>we inhaled the fried noodles in about five minutes,</i>

94
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,255
<i>and left the place feeling slightly less than satisfied.</i>

95
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,561
So, what do you guys wanna do?

96
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,413
I was thinkin' we could check out the movie you guys made.

97
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,006
I kinda wanna see what I look like on the big screen.

98
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:35,906
Pass! It's probably gonna be lame!

99
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:39,425
<i>I quite agree! However, hearing
that coming from you really irks me.</i>

100
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,729
Man, those fried noodles weren't enough.

101
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:45,035
Oh, yeah! Next up's the barbecue
hosted by the Science Club!

102
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:46,373
You're still hungry?

103
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,862
Before we hit the barbecue, how
'bout we score us some hotties?

104
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:51,601
Hotties?

105
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,712
That's right, Mr. Kunikida, hotties.

106
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:58,785
We find a coupla girls dressed casual, kinda like
those two. Then we make with the chit-chat, and it's on.

107
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,613
It's a tactic I developed over years of experience.

108
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,709
<i>What good is your experience
when your success rate is zero?</i>

109
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,931
Thanks, but I'll pass. You guys are on your own.

110
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,213
I think I'll pass, too.

111
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:13,010
Good luck, and if you find a girl to hang out
with, you can introduce me to one of her friends.

112
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,948
Uh, what? So you guys are just gonna chicken out?!

113
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,036
<i>I'm not a coward.</i>

114
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,873
<i>It's just that if a certain someone saw me hitting
on a girl, it could be a little bit of a problem...</i>

115
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,409
<i>Actually, a big problem.</i>

116
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:26,371
<i>Look, just try to enjoy the rest of the arts festival.</i>

117
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:28,300
<i>And do it normally.</i>

118
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,742
<i>Now then, where should I go next?</i>

119
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,150
<i>The wind ensemble's performing in the lecture hall.</i>

120
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,201
<i>Then the Rock Club's hosting a
concert with a bunch of bands.</i>

121
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,229
<i>I guess I'll head over there.
After pulling that all-nighter,</i>

122
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,844
<i>it's the perfect place to rest my sleep-deprived body.</i>

123
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:53,448
You rock, North High! We are Bandage!

124
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,117
Thank you and good night!

125
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,912
Next up, we have the Rock Club's very own, ENOZ.

126
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,884
<i>Y-You're kidding!</i>

127
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,342
<i>What the hell is she doing?!</i>

158

Miss Suzumiya's very good.

159
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,562
So is Miss Nagato.

160
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,151
What's up with that outfit you're wearing?

161
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,156
I hurried over here as soon as I heard.

162
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:05,060
The student council was buzzing with this rumor...

163
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:09,050
about how Miss Suzumiya was going to be
doing something in the lecture hall today.

164
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:11,207
This would be that something.

165
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,056
Uh, hi.

166
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,487
Everyone, this is ENOZ.

167
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,931
The name ENOZ comes from using the first
letter of the last name of each of the members:

168
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,300
Enomoto, Nakanishi, Okajima, and Zaizen.

169
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,643
Unfortunately, something happened and Enomoto and
Nakanishi couldn't come up here to perform for you today.

170
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,050
That's Yuki over there.

171
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,858
Well, she and I aren't in the band;

172
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:33,840
we're just filling in. Sorry!

173
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:36,618
Let me introduce you to the real members of the band.

174
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,884
On drums, we have Mizuki!

175
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:44,387
And that's Mai, on bass.

176
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,065
And filling in for Miss Nakanishi on guitar, Yuki!

177
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,056
And I'm filling in for Miss
Enomoto today on guitar and vocals.

178
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,149
I don't know if I can play this thing very well.

179
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:01,848
In fact, I don't know if I'm doing so hot singing either.

180
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:06,712
What I'm saying is that I got the sheet music
about an hour ago, so I'm sort of winging it here.

181
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:12,295
By the way, if there's anyone out
there who wants to hear the real song...

182
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,573
performed with the real vocalist and guitarist,

183
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,593
come see us after the show, okay?

184
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:21,451
Oh! And if you wanna bring a mini disc,
we'll make a copy of the songs for you for free.

185
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,721
Is that cool?

186
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,891
So that's that.

187
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,237
We're gonna do one more.

188
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,166
I didn't have much time, so I only got two songs down.

189
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:33,717
This'll be the last one.

190
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,313
Sorry if you were expecting more,

191
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,838
but we're playin' our hearts out up here for you.

192
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:38,877
You ready?

193
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,878

214
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,998
<i>Later, I got the whole story.</i>

215
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:09,509
I was passing out flyers for our movie, but I ran
out, so I headed back to the club room to get some more.

216
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:14,155
I was walking by the shoe lockers, and I saw the
band arguing with the Festival Operations Committee.

217
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,739
I guess they weren't going to let them on stage to play.

218
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:22,264
The lead singer, Miss Enomoto, had to go to the hospital
the night before because she got a case of tonsillitis.

219
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:25,931
And on the day of the concert, Miss Nakanishi,
the guitarist, tripped and sprained her wrist.

220
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:27,588
So, neither of them could perform.

221
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:31,223
Miss Nakanishi's a singer, and
this was her last North High festival.

222
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,173
She wanted to play even if it killed her.

223
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,906
They were going to play new songs,

224
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:38,722
but in the end, Miss Nakanishi had to
be taken away to get her wrist looked at.

225
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,723
And that's when you decided to
get involved and help the band out?

226
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,725
I can really understand how they felt.

227
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:49,339
Even if my throat was wrecked and my arm went numb,
I'd be up on that stage playing on willpower alone.

228
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:50,364
I don't doubt it.

229
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:52,126
But when I saw Miss Nakanishi,

230
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,259
I figured there wasn't anything they could do.

231
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:55,960
I mean, if you saw her,

232
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,425
you'd feel bad for the other members of the band, right?

233
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,580
They must've practiced so hard for that show.

234
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,226
So then, this is what I told them:

235
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,282
"Since you guys are in a jam,
you want me to fill in for her?"

236
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:10,389
I'm kinda surprised that the other
two girls agreed to let you do that.

237
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:14,188
I told them all I'd do is sing, and
both Miss Okajima and Miss Zaizen said:

238
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:16,213
"Hey, with you, we just might pull it off!"

239
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:21,213
After all, I was in the Rock Club for a little
bit, and they probably remember me from back then!

240
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,301
<i>Stories about Haruhi's eccentricity are pretty well-known.</i>

241
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,356
But she's also famous for being a super-utility player.

242
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,934
She can do anything and everything!

243
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,510
I wanted to play all the guitar stuff,
too, but there wasn't enough time to learn it.

244
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:38,445
I had to go over the sheet music. All
I could do was get the main chords down.

245
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:39,739
That explains Nagato.

246
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:43,889
Yeah! I barged in on her fortune-telling
racket, and when I told her what was happening,

247
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:46,464
she decided to join me! Did you see her play?

248
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:48,505
I never knew she was dexterous!

249
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,578
She took one look at the music
and then played it perfectly!

250
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,571
I wonder where the heck that girl
learned to play guitar like that.

251
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,625
<i>Probably the moment you brought it up.</i>

252
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,431
Hey, it looks like we have a couple guests.

253
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,182
They wanna see Miss Suzumiya.

254
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,306
Well? Go talk to them.

255
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,225
Okay, but you're coming, too.

256
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,264
Is your throat any better today?

257
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:21,805
Yeah, that's for asking.

258
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,153
And how's your wrist doing?

259
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:26,678
It's not 100% yet, so studying
for my exams will be a drag.

260
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,134
I wanted to thank you, Miss Suzumiya.

261
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:36,223
You won't believe how many we requests we got
for the original songs after the show, it's crazy!

262
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,910
We can't dub our stuff onto mini discs fast enough!

263
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,935
There's so many people who want it!

264
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,790
But really, it's all thanks to you.

265
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,473
Because of what you did for us,
our songs didn't have to go to waste.

266
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,271
And we really appreciate it.

267
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,156
You're something else, Miss Suzumiya!

268
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:56,838
This festival was gonna be my last memory
with the Rock Club, so I really wanted to play it.

269
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:59,422
But this was way better than having us back out of it.

270
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:00,275
Yeah...

271
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:03,185
Anyway, we want to do something for you in return.

272
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,779
No, it's okay, really.

273
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:07,178
They were great songs, and I had a blast singing them.

274
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:10,698
I'd feel bad if you guys went and gave
me something on top of that experience.

275
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:15,231
Actually, why don't you tell Yuki? I want her to
hear it 'cause I kinda forced her to come along and play.

276
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,064
We already went to her class.

277
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:20,370
She just nodded once, and then
she pointed us to this classroom.

278
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:26,073
Hey, we're gonna play a gig somewhere before we
graduate, so if you want, come check us out, okay?

279
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,755
And you can bring... your friend here with you, too.

280
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,307
<i>And after that, Haruhi slipped into one of her moods.</i>

281
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,578
<i>Then when lunchtime came around,
she rushed out of the classroom.</i>

282
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:41,136
I'm serious! There wasn't a single
decent-looking girl at the arts festival!

283
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:45,209
You wanna know what I think? I think
this school's built on a bad location.

284
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,485
We'd get a better crowd if it wasn't on this hill.

285
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,308
<i>After lunch, I took a walk.</i>

286
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,272
<i>I figured it would settle my stomach.</i>

287
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,579
<i>And no, there wasn't any other reason.</i>

288
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:08,162
Hey!

289
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,349
Yeah? What is it?

290
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,358
I didn't have time to practice, so
we had to make them sound simpler.

291
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:34,149
People wanna listen to the real thing though, don't they?

292
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:37,001
You're talking about all the people that want mini discs?

293
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:38,166
Yeah.

294
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,111
That was a heck of a performance
for being on the fly, though.

295
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,600
Don't you think it was good publicity for them?

296
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:49,672
If I just had one more day to
practice, I could've nailed it.

297
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,598
Part of me's asking, "Was it good
enough? Could it have been better?"

298
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,706
I don't know... How do I explain it?

299
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:03,261
When I was up on that stage, I felt
like I was really doing something.

300
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:13,481
This sucks. I mean, why can't
I just forget about it already?

301
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:14,855
How should I know?

302
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:17,959
<i>But I do.</i>

303
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,339
It's because you're just not
used to being appreciated by others.

304
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,734
The things you do aren't things
that people usually thank you for.

305
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,098
What is it now?

306
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:31,418
If you've got something to say,
just say it. Spit it out already!

307
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,305
It's probably something stupid anyway,

308
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,381
but don't just stand there and keep it bottled up!

309
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:36,679
It's not good for you!

310
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,849
Seriously... It's nothing.

311
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:51,056
Hey! Do you know how to play any instruments?

312
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:51,786
I don't...

313
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,848
It doesn't matter 'cause we got a whole year to
practice our butts off for the next arts festival!

314
00:21:56,873 --> 00:21:57,894
Oh, come on...

315
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:01,902
Our goal is to enter next year's
North High Arts Fest as a real band!

316
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:04,519
I'll be the lead singer, and Yuki can play guitar!

317
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:09,211
And we'll have Mikuru shake the tambourine
and be a totally awesome stage decoration!

318
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,800
And of course, we'll have to
make a sequel to our movie, too!

319
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,752
Next year, we'll be super busy.

320
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:19,266
After all, our goal each year should be to
increase the number of goals we set for ourselves.

321
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,083
Hold on!

322
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:21,761
Come on, Kyon, let's get moving!

323
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:22,671
Where are we moving?

324
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,288
We're gonna get some instruments!

325
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,111
First, we'll hit the Rock Club's room.

326
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:30,310
I know we'll find stuff they're
not using just lying around up there.

327
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:33,202
Then, we'll ask the ENOZ chicks
to teach us to write music!

328
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:34,127
Don't sweat it.

329
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,397
I'll write the songs, compose the
music, and I'll do the choreography!

330
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,880
But you don't have to do it right now!

331
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:41,364
Are you nuts? A year's gonna go by like that!

332
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,020
And what do you mean by choreography?

333
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:44,498
I thought we were gonna be a band!

334
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:47,764
We need it! We're gonna create a
new image of what bands should be!

335
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,552
But that's no different from a pop idol!
