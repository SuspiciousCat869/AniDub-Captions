1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,812
I brought some tea.

2
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:21,770
Here you go.

3
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,248
Oh, thanks a lot.

4
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:32,970
Wow, it's really good.

5
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:36,461
Here you go.

6
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,949
Why, thank you very much, Miss Asahina.

7
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:43,603
The SOS Brigade was officially created by Haruhi in May.

8
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:44,919
It's already June now.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,785
During that time, I was involved
in an incident that's, well...

10
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,353
It was like the world got a sudden case of leg cramps.

11
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,771
All that aside, today's episode
goes a little something like this:

12
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,112
Hey, you guys!

13
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,796
We're gonna enter ourselves in a baseball tournament!

14
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,245
Since the day of that "incident,"

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,224
nothing really out of the ordinary's happened.

16
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:06,973
We were enjoying our brief moment
of peace and boredom as best we could.

17
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,971
And boy, was it a brief moment.

18
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,614
You might be wondering why.

19
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,870
Because when she turns on that smile of hers,

20
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,257
somehow I'm the one who always
ends up completely exhausted.

21
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,022
What did you say we're gonna do?

22
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,871
We're gonna do this!

23
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:03,251
"Announcing the ninth all city
amateur baseball tournament."

24
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:07,593
And, who's gonna be entering
this little sandlot baseball game?

25
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,702
You've gotta be kidding! Us, of course!

26
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,040
So when you're saying "us,"
you're talking about everyone here...

27
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:15,254
Somehow, we need to find at least four more people.

28
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:19,514
<i>As usual, if somebody's opinion's
inconvenient, she doesn't even hear it.</i>

29
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,870
Hey, do you even know the rules for baseball?

30
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:23,604
Of course I know the rules.

31
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,601
When I tried out for the baseball team,

32
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,627
they gave me the rundown of all of the basics.

33
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:28,935
But I wasn't having any fun,

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,461
so I hurried up and went home.

35
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,270
Well, if you think baseball's so boring,

36
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:34,306
why do you wanna enter the tournament so badly?

37
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,369
Because it's our chance to show
the entire world just who we are!

38
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,047
If we win this baseball tournament,

39
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:44,158
the SOS Brigade will take on a life of
its own and be known all over the world!

40
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,647
It's a great opportunity!

41
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:48,191
Right, Mikuru? Isn't that a great idea?!

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,885
Huh? B-But I wo...

43
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,848
Don't you think baseball is great?!

44
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,214
In fact, we're gonna shoot for the championship!

45
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:57,959
We can't afford to lose a single
game because you know how I hate losing!

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
You got that?

47
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:03,750
Well, I think it would be all right.

48
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:06,042
Don't smile like that and give into her demands.

49
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:08,687
Why don't you try disagreeing
with her every once in a while?

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,020
Actually, I think this is much more sensible than
walking around the city looking for aliens and UMAs.

51
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:17,562
All right, when's this tournament supposed to happen?

52
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:18,541
It's this Sunday!

53
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,066
Day after tomorrow? Are you kidding?!

54
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,562
Don't you think that's way too soon?

55
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,606
But I already turned in the application.

56
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,783
Oh, don't worry about it. It's all set.

57
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,802
I put "SOS Brigade" as our team name.

58
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,559
That's one thing I made sure of!

59
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,560
And as for the other four players we need,

60
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,342
you got any ideas on where to find them?

61
00:04:34,397 --> 00:04:36,675
If I come across anybody walkin' around lookin' bored,

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,717
I'll just grab 'em.

63
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:40,159
<i>Scary thing is: She really means that.</i>

64
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,624
All right, Haruhi, just hang on a second.

65
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:46,703
I think that Taniguchi and Kunikida
might have some free time on their hands.

66
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:47,555
They'll do.

67
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,645
<i>It's true: Haruhi thinks of her classmates as objects.</i>

68
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:53,580
Okay then... Let's see, we need two more.

69
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:56,992
Uhm... If you don't mind, I think I might have a friend.

70
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:57,568
Perfect!

71
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:59,036
<i>Apparently anyone will do.</i>

72
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,228
<i>Hey, wait, Miss Asahina's friend?</i>

73
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,695
<i>Okay, that's interesting.</i>

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,060
<i>Friend from where? And what time period?</i>

75
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,733
It's okay, she's from this time... Uh!

76
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,465
I mean, she's just a friend I met in one of my classes.

77
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,645
I know someone. It's an acquaintance who's been
curious about our group for some time now and I think...

78
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,845
I'll handle it, thanks.

79
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,573
Now that that's settled,

80
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,469
it's time for some intensive training!

81
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,703
Intensive training? You mean, right now?

82
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,390
Yeah!

83
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:25,416
Yeah, but where?

84
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:26,686
Over there!

85
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:34,634
<i>So, all of us got roped into entering
a baseball tournament just like that.</i>

86
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:37,511
<i>Why, you ask? The reason's very simple:</i>

87
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:41,644
<i>It was because... Well, Haruhi was... bored.</i>

88
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,684
Hey, you guys! Can we use the field now?

89
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,389
And we also wanna borrow your equipment.

90
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,124
Huh? What the heck are you talkin' about?

91
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,764
We need to have baseball practice,

92
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,648
and we're also kind of in a hurry,

93
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:54,866
so would ya get lost?

94
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,228
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

95
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:59,602
It'll only be for a little while, right, Mikuru?

96
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,573
<i>Adolescence is so predictable.</i>

97
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:12,277
For starters, we're gonna
practice catching 1,000 grounders!

98
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:23,830
Oh, come on, the future of the SOS
Brigade is riding on that ball, so get ready!

99
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,136
<i>This is the first time that I've heard
that our future was riding on such a tiny ball.</i>

100
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,135
Okay, Mikuru, here comes some more.

101
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:46,239
That hurts! No! Stop!

102
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,159
Miss Asahina, are you all right? Can you stand?

103
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:57,295
If you're too nice to me, it'll happen again.

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,493
Please don't.

105
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:03,453
Dammit, you guys! Get back to your positions right now!

106
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,219
She's injured, okay?

107
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:06,791
Fine, then!

108
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,078
Next up, the baseball team!

109
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,630
Why do we have to do it?!

110
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,834
All right, you guys! That's it for today!

111
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,758
Well now, that's surprising.

112
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:25,398
Miss Suzumiya batted exactly 1,000 hits.

113
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:28,653
Frankly, I'm more surprised by the fact
that you counted every single one of them.

114
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,687
Hm? Oh, hey, Nagato.

115
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,224
On the day of the tournament, I was
wondering if it was possible to make it rain.

116
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,636
You know, a big one that'd
cancel the game with a rain delay.

117
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,703
It is possible, but I would advise against it.

118
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:40,570
Yeah, why's that?

119
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:46,853
Any alteration of the regional climate could possibly have
devastating after-effects on the eco-system of the planet.

120
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,728
And about when would these after-effects happen?

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,214
Several hundred to 10,000 years.

122
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:55,086
Then I guess we'd better try not to do that, right?

123
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,010
Right.

124
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,184
<i>The day of the baseball tournament has finally arrived.</i>

125
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:10,870
So, you're Kyon?

126
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:13,405
I hear an awful lot about you from Mikuru.

127
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,892
Oh, this is Miss Tsuruya, that friend I was talk...

128
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:21,268
I'm Taniguchi. It's very nice to meet you.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,602
And I'm Kunikida.

130
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:26,451
Yeah, see, when he asked me, I just
couldn't turn down my good buddy, Kyon.

131
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,662
<i>Oh, brother...</i>

132
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:29,833
Kyon!

133
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:31,886
Come over here for a minute.

134
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,779
Okay, what were you thinking? Seriously?

135
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:38,036
You gonna make something like her play baseball?!

136
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,574
Hey, don't go calling my little sister a "something."

137
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,481
She's a person!

138
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:44,749
Yeah, well, she introduced herself
as a ten year-old fifth grader!

139
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,786
I mean, she's so sweet! I can hardly
believe she's related to someone like you.

140
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,573
This baseball tournament's open to the general public,

141
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,446
it's not some crummy little league game!

142
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:54,937
You are aware of that?

143
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,395
<i>Yes, Miss Haruhi.</i>

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,028
<i>All the more reason to bring my little sister today.</i>

145
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,254
<i>We really don't have a chance of winning,</i>

146
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,395
<i>but since this is Haruhi we're talking about,</i>

147
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,483
<i>watch us win the championship by accident.</i>

148
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,314
<i>That would be a pain.</i>

149
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,812
<i>But, if we have a fifth grader in the lineup,</i>

150
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:11,363
<i>then we're sure to lose.</i>

151
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,183
Huh. Fine, whatever.

152
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:14,849
Guess it'll be a handicap.

153
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,111
I'd feel bad if we won this thing too easily.

154
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,079
She still thinks we can win this thing.

155
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,876
By the way, has it occurred to you that you need to
decide the batting order and our positions on the field?

156
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,665
Oh, I thought about that already.

157
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:31,595
Here, take a look at this: Two types!

158
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,148
One for batting order, the other for field position.

159
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,662
Oh, and I'm the pitcher, and I'll be batting first.

160
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,754
So you're saying all you've figured out
was how we're gonna decide those things.

161
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,873
Yeah, and? You gotta problem with that?

162
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,478
This is the democratic method.

163
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:47,886
In ancient Greece, they picked numbers
out of a hat to elect their leaders.

164
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,615
<i>Don't compare picking the batting
order for a sandlot ball game...</i>

165
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,993
<i>in modern Japan to how the Greeks picked their leaders.</i>

166
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,228
<i>Besides, you get to do whatever you want.</i>

167
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,496
<i>How's that democratic?</i>

168
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:59,563
<i>Whatever. All the more reason to go home early.</i>

169
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:04,883
<i>I mean, from what I hear, our first opponent is a
team of college students, the Kamigahara Pirates.</i>

170
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,356
<i>Apparently, they're the favorites to win the tournament,</i>

171
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,385
<i>and the game is called when one team gets a ten-run lead.</i>

172
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,415
<i>So it's not too early to start
packing up to go home right now.</i>

173
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,073
Play ball!

174
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,699
Hah! You kidding? You call that a pitch?!

175
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,212
Come on, everybody, follow my lead!

176
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,066
I'll try to do my best toda...

177
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:41,812
Strike!

178
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:45,143
<i>Why's he throwing so hard at Miss Asahina?!</i>

179
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:48,312
<i>If he hits her, I'm gonna
charge the mound and deck that guy!</i>

180
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:50,895
Strike!

181
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,843
Mikuru!

182
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,576
Like this! You swing it and bang!

183
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,634
You're out!

184
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,806
Damn you! Why didn't you even swing the bat?!

185
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,021
Strike!

186
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:02,890
Strike!

187
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,138
You're out!

188
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,859
Yuki, if you don't swing, you'll never hit the ball!

189
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,800
Kyon, you're batting cleanup!

190
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,390
You'd better hit the ball!

191
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:14,113
<i>What do you expect from a
cleanup hitter picked by a lottery?</i>

192
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,340
Strike!

193
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,892
<i>Haruhi hit that thing into the outfield...?</i>

194
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,793
Strike two!

195
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,039
Strike three, you're out!

196
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:33,737
<i>I have dishonored my family...</i>

197
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,895
Let's take 'em out!

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,265
Yeah!

199
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,554
Play ball!

200
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,621
Strike!

201
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:50,340
Strike!

202
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,194
Strike three! You're out!

203
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:54,288
Nice pitching.

204
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:56,593
Piece of cake, no sweat, guys!

205
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:03,129
Foul!

206
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,360
<i>She can only throw straight
pitches through the strike zone.</i>

207
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,505
<i>When they figured it out, it was only a matter of time.</i>

208
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:27,477
<i>On top of that, our defense has more
holes than an anthill in the Savanna.</i>

209
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,033
<i>We're so toast.</i>

210
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:33,245
<i>The fact that they only scored
two runs off of us must be...</i>

211
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,110
<i>because the opposing teams'
goddess of victory's running late.</i>

212
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,875
<i>I guess everyone wants to relax on a Sunday.</i>

213
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:42,405
<i>Well, the top of the second inning went by really quickly,</i>

214
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:45,218
<i>and in the bottom of the inning,
we gave up a few more runs.</i>

215
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,802
<i>Looks like we'll be heading home next inning.</i>

216
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,461
Out!

217
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,732
Phew, that was hard!

218
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:57,272
It's all I can do to just hit the ball with the bat.

219
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:00,418
Looks like I'm gonna be needing it after all.

220
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:02,967
Time out, ump!

221
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,947
W-Wait a minute! Miss Suzumiya!

222
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:08,936
Come on!

223
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:09,395
Hurry up!

224
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,896
N-N-No!

225
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,257
Get out of those right now and put this on!

226
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,895
You look good in that!

227
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,986
Can I get a picture of you guys with my phone?!

228
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,265
I wonder if up in a ponytail would be better...?

229
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,431
Fine! Cheer on!

230
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,578
I'm not really sure how to do this!

231
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:33,375
You do it like this, and yell as loud as you can!

232
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,154
Yo!

233
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:37,498
Everyone, pl-please hit the ball! I'm begging you:

234
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:38,995
Do your best out there!

235
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,821
Yeah, I'll knock this sucker out!

236
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,103
Strike out!

237
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,855
Hah, the sun was in my eyes...

238
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,898
Don't sweat it, I wasn't counting on you anyway.

239
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:02,281
Safe!

240
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:05,225
Mikuru! Just make sure to hit the ball this time!

241
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,993
Go for it, Mikuru!

242
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:11,358
Strike!

243
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,999
Mikuru! Like this! Like this!

244
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:15,536
<i>What is she doing...?</i>

245
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:19,799
Looks like she's trying to reduce the magic
points of the other team's pitcher or something.

246
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,936
Well, it seems to me that she's
trying to signal for something.

247
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,801
Did we ever decide on signals?

248
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:29,027
No. But I think that she's
signaling for a squeeze-play right now.

249
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:32,360
She's signaling for a three bunt squeeze with two outs?

250
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,891
Even the most senile coach in the league
would make better decisions than that.

251
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,686
The chances of Miss Asahina actually
hitting the ball are close to none.

252
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,623
However, if we can catch the Pirates off-guard,

253
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:47,352
by going for a squeeze-play that normal people
wouldn't think of, there's a possibility that...

254
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:49,398
one of their infielders might make an error.

255
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,055
Or, maybe she's thinkin' that somehow, Miss
Asahina might even hit the ball with the bat for once.

256
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,684
Well, it looks like they figured it out now.

257
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,294
Strike!

258
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,525
And you're out of there!

259
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,649
Mikuru, get your butt over here
and get ready for some pain, girl!

260
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,696
Take your punishment!

261
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:10,670
Let everyone have a good, long
look at that funny little face.

262
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,550
Please stop, it hurts!

263
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:13,767
Hey, numbskull.

264
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,492
It's all your fault for giving confusing signals.

265
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,199
Maybe you should've tried to
steal home yourself or something.

266
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,478
Things aren't looking so good anymore.

267
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,430
I don't wanna hear it, but go ahead.

268
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:37,010
A closed space larger than anything
we've seen before is starting to form.

269
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,435
And it's spreading at an alarming rate.

270
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,711
It will continue growing,

271
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:47,791
and the you-know-what's will keep tearing
things apart till Miss Suzumiya's mood improves.

272
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:49,987
And that's happening just because we're losing?

273
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:51,808
Oh, man, you've gotta be kidding me.

274
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,353
You're still talking as if it has nothing to do with you.

275
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,943
Believe me, you're involved
with what's happening now, Kyon.

276
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:01,090
Do you remember how we all had to pick numbers
to determine the batting order for the day?

277
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:03,728
As a result, you're batting cleanup.

278
00:16:03,808 --> 00:16:05,438
I'm not all that happy about it, you know.

279
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:09,365
That's not the point. Miss Suzumiya
wished for you to bat cleanup and you are.

280
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,166
That is not a coincidence.

281
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:16,412
Because you're not performing like one would expect from
a cleanup batter, she's feeling a little disappointed.

282
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:17,660
Well, excuse me.

283
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:22,547
In any case, we should all try to play the best we
can so that they don't and call the game this inning.

284
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,754
Because if the game ends here, you can say it's
the equivalent of this world coming to its end.

285
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,834
Let's go, dammit! Take your positions!

286
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,713
This inning, we need to hold
them to two runs no matter what.

287
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,995
<i>Two outs, man on first and second,</i>

288
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,632
<i>and we're down by nine.</i>

289
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:43,451
<i>If they score another run, this game will be over.</i>

290
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,370
It's coming this way!

291
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,811
<i>Gotta catch it...</i>

292
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,121
<i>Gotta catch it!</i>

293
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,517
Wow! Amazing!

294
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:55,776
Nice catch!

295
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,219
Getting back to what we were talking about earlier...

296
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:05,819
Little close there. What's up?

297
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:08,810
The other day when you and Miss
Suzumiya were stuck in that other world,

298
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,414
I was wondering how you managed
to get yourselves out of it.

299
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,344
Do you have to remind me of that?

300
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:17,224
It's just that if you use that trick again,
maybe everything here will start getting better.

301
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,005
Forget it.

302
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,955
That's exactly what I thought you'd say.

303
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,572
Very well, let's just go and win this game instead.

304
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,927
After all, she shares the same concerns we do.

305
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,325
Miss Nagato is finally...

306
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,926
What, are you saying there's
something the matter with her?

307
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,033
It looks like she's casting a spell...

308
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:39,603
A spell? Wait, what're you talking about?

309
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,436
Let's see... That's classified.

310
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,114
A spell, huh?

311
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:04,103
Take it. I changed the elemental boost information.

312
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,078
Elemental what?

313
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,158
Homing mode.

314
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:10,504
<i>Wow! It's flying!</i>

315
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,181
<i>I see. Homing mode, huh?</i>

316
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,130
<i>Oh man, there's gotta be a limit to this.</i>

317
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,620
<i>This is great, but if we keep doing this,</i>

318
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,680
<i>things are gonna get ugly... in all kinds of ways.</i>

319
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,159
Well, that should be enough.

320
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:32,888
I see.

321
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:35,282
Strike! Strike! Strike!

322
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:39,359
<i>I had forgotten about it, but the
first round has a 90-minute limit.</i>

323
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:41,429
<i>That means this is the last inning.</i>

324
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,489
<i>If we can keep them from scoring, we win!</i>

325
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,436
<i>Is it all right for us to win?</i>

326
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,710
It is necessary for us to win.

327
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:53,895
Thanks to all of our efforts, the expansion of the closed
space looks like it's stopped at least for the time being.

328
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:57,297
But if they suddenly make a comeback,
then that'll be the game right there.

329
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:01,325
<i>It's a waste of time to think about how
Haruhi's mood will turn if that happens.</i>

330
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:02,415
I've got a plan.

331
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,332
Are you serious?

332
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,187
Yes, I am dead serious.

333
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:11,493
It's the only option we have if we're to get
through this inning without givin' up too many runs.

334
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,079
Oh, brother...

335
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:18,296
Foul!

336
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,077
Damn you! Be serious about this!

337
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:24,017
If you lose, you're buyin' everyone lunch after the game!

338
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:28,664
<i>I know that. After all, the fate of the
entire world is resting on my pitching.</i>

339
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,405
<i>I guess the world's not worth very much...</i>

340
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,103
<i>Thanks to my Mysterious Ball...</i>

341
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:42,556
<i>I named it myself... it looks like the
world will be spared from certain annihilation.</i>

342
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,160
St-Strike two!

343
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,734
You're out!

344
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,537
<i>In just three pitches, yet another batter struck out.</i>

345
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:55,180
<i>And now it seems the last batter's
at the plate with two strikes on him.</i>

346
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,281
Kyon, wrap it up with the next pitch, okay?!

347
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,185
<i>There was no doubt about that happening.</i>

348
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:02,595
<i>Sorry about this, Kamigahara Pirates...</i>

349
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:06,285
Yeah!

350
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:07,963
Pick up the ball, Nagato!

351
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,755
Pick up the ball and throw it!

352
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,267
Hurry! Hurry!

353
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,124
Over here!

354
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,291
What the...?!

355
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:29,339
I'm terribly sorry, but you see, we're not the
typical team of athletes you're used to playing.

356
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:30,874
That's game!

357
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,107
Thanks to Nagato's magical cheating,

358
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,709
we were able to win the game.

359
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:38,569
What're we going to do about the game in the next round?

360
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:43,797
I'm gonna feel bad for the Kamigahara Pirates if
we beat them in the second round like we just did.

361
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:48,620
I'm really sorry about this, but I'm afraid I'll
need to go and help my colleagues out in a little while.

362
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,411
<i>So we're gonna be short a player then.</i>

363
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:51,687
How 'bout we forfeit?

364
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,178
Sounds like a good plan.

365
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:56,632
After today, it looks as if it's a
bad thing when Miss Suzumiya's bored.

366
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,837
We should probably keep that in
mind during any future activities.

367
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,015
Had enough fun for today?

368
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:06,384
Koizumi had to bail on us because he had
something pop up suddenly, and to tell you the truth,

369
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,577
my arms and legs are killing me right now.

370
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,944
I guess if you're all right with it, then, oh well.

371
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:20,703
Anyway, I'm hungry. How 'bout
we all go and get some lunch?

372
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:21,607
You got it.

373
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,553
Thank you, thank you! I can't thank you enough!

374
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,677
No, it's nothing! See you around!

375
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,501
Wait, you know, that bat...

376
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,599
Eat up, everyone! Kyon's treating us today!

377
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:41,152
What a game, huh, guys?!

378
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:45,653
<i>Oh, well. Thanks to the Pirates,
I gained a little extra cash today.</i>

379
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,639
<i>Kamigahara Pirates, I wish you luck.</i>

380
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:01,816
Sorry I'm so late!

381
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:04,608
So, which one do you think we should try next?!

382
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,402
Soccer or American Football?!

383
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:08,162
How many do we need to play each?!

384
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:10,650
Is the number of people we had last time enough?!

385
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:13,414
<i>As I looked over at Haruhi's brilliant smile,</i>

386
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:16,492
<i>I was trying to think about which
sport would require less people.</i>

387
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,026
<i>American Football?! No way! How 'bout bowling?!</i>
