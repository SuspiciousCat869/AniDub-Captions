00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:06,591
<i>During final exams, Haruhi, who suffered
about of melancholy during the Star Festival,</i>

2
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:10,901
<i>had recovered from the aforementioned melancholy
enough to go back to doing whatever she wanted to do.</i>

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,906
<i>However, as an adverse reaction
to her emotional improvement,</i>

4
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:18,212
<i>the blue-colored baton of
depression had been handed off to me.</i>

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,414
<i>Haruhi always seemed to have time left over
during an exam, and today was no exception.</i>

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,932
<i>About 30 minutes before pencils down,
she was sound asleep in the desk behind me.</i>

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,529
<i>Annoying. Oh, it's annoying.</i>

8
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,895
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

9
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,423
<i>According to Haruhi, there is no such
thing as a break for the SOS Brigade.</i>

10
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,856
<i>Even during exam time, when all
the other clubs went on hiatus,</i>

11
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:14,781
<i>this mysterious brigade, which wasn't really
even a club, was open every day without a holiday.</i>

12
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,502
<i>Kinda like a convenient store...</i>

13
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,319
Hey, come take a look at this.

14
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:25,819
What is it?

15
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,339
You can't tell what it is?

16
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,658
I've no idea. I don't get it at all.

17
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:32,236
It's the logo for the SOS Brigade.

18
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:37,280
A logo? That's funny, 'cause to me, it looks
more like a drunken tapeworm wrapped around a tube.

19
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:39,010
Well, take a closer look at it!

20
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:42,567
See, it says "SOS Brigade" right there in the middle!

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,971
<i>Now that she pointed it out, I can't really
say for sure whether I can or can't see it,</i>

22
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,852
<i>but I wouldn't disagree with
anybody if they said it was or wasn't.</i>

23
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,776
<i>And how many negatives did I just use in that sentence?</i>

24
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,917
<i>If somebody's got time, total it up for me.</i>

25
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:58,218
You're the one that's got the most free time.

26
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:02,993
Anyway, I was thinking of putting this thing
on the homepage of the SOS Brigade website.

27
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,733
<i>You mean, this pathetic website that only has a homepage?</i>

28
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:09,141
This website that you made isn't
getting us any visitors at all.

29
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,712
It's so frustrating.

30
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,908
There's nothing on here that spices it up.

31
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,808
It's all because you got in my way.

32
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:18,710
We'd've had a ton of hits if you'd
let me post these erotic pics of Mikuru.

33
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:24,014
So I got to thinkin', I should paste a cool
logo or symbol for the SOS Brigade on the homepage.

34
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,359
<i>Just get this stupid excuse
for a website off the net already.</i>

35
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:30,041
<i>The access counter hasn't even reached three digits yet,</i>

36
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:33,453
<i>and 90% of those hits have been
you checking the site for hits.</i>

37
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,844
Write a blog on there or something.

38
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,909
Isn't it your job to keep a
record of the brigade's activities?

39
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:40,369
Ugh, too much of a hassle.

40
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,021
<i>Well, it's a hassle for me, too.</i>

41
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:48,416
Okay, Kyon, your job for today is to make
this logo show up on the homepage of the website.

42
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,027
Why don't you do it yourself?

43
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,061
I'm the brigade leader! It's the job
of the brigade leader to give the orders!

44
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:58,207
Besides, if I did everything, there'd be
nothing left for you guys to do, isn't that right?

45
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:02,895
I'm always spelling this stuff out for you, why don't
you use your head? How do you expect to improve yourself,

46
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,212
if you only do what you're told?

47
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,054
There you go, talking in circles again.

48
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,505
Are you telling me to do it or not to do it? Which is it?

49
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,409
Enough! Get on it!

50
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:17,583
<i>Reluctantly, I shrunk the master painter
Haruhi's tapeworm into an appropriate size.</i>

51
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:21,750
<i>Then, I pasted it, still reluctantly,
into the file, and uploaded it.</i>

52
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:27,022
<i>Starting tomorrow and lasting until summer
vacation, we get to have our exam break.</i>

53
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:30,070
<i>It's also the time when my
teacher's mark my answers wrong.</i>

54
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,455
<i>Damn, that's annoying.</i>

55
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,550
<i>Guess I'll go and ogle Miss Asahina for some comfort.</i>

56
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:41,305
<i>I knocked on the door, fully expecting Miss
Asahina's voice to call out a wispy "Yes" in reply.</i>

57
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,191
Come in.

58
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:45,847
You're the only one here?

59
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,638
Yuki's here, too.

60
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:52,978
<i>She's more like an accessory to the room,
so you can't really count her as a member.</i>

61
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:57,462
<i>I mean, officially, she's a member of the
Literary Club, so I guess I should correct myself.</i>

62
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,059
You and Nagato are the only ones here?

63
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,125
You wanna file a complaint about it?

64
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:08,672
<i>If I wrote down every complaint I had about you, it would
fill up an entire sheet of A4-size paper, both sides.</i>

65
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:13,042
When you knocked on the door just now, I thought
for sure we were going to have a visitor today.

66
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:17,491
Just being careful. I don't wanna accidentally
walk in while Miss Asahina's changing.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,859
<i>That lovely, innocent young girl just
can't seem to figure out how to lock a door.</i>

68
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,929
So now, what's all this about a visitor?

69
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,748
Don't tell me you don't remember?

70
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:30,366
<i>I hope she isn't gonna say anything
about the Star Festival three years ago.</i>

71
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,360
Oh, come on, it's something you did,
and without getting my permission first.

72
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,288
I have no idea what you're talking about.

73
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,467
Those posters you put up all over the school.

74
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,940
Right, those things.

75
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:45,386
<i>Those posters were my attempt at getting the
student council to keep the SOS Brigade alive,</i>

76
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,607
<i>as a sort of jack-of-all- -trades counseling thing.</i>

77
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,270
<i>I even drew them all and stuck them up
on every bulletin board in the school.</i>

78
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,513
Anyway, take a look at this.

79
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,262
Something weird's happening here.

80
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,581
Maybe it's just the computer acting up.

81
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:04,320
<i>The SOS Brigade's logo was warped, as
if somebody used a gathering filter on it.</i>

82
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,930
<i>On top of that, the counter and title were gone.</i>

83
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,887
<i>It was subtle, but it was different from the page I made.</i>

84
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,756
It looks like the file on the server has been corrupted.

85
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,647
So do you know how long it's been like this?

86
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,919
No, it was like that when I checked it today.

87
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,069
Who do I complain to about this?

88
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,061
It isn't worth filing a complaint.

89
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,671
It's weird. Wait, I know, it's hackers
or crackers or whatever they're called.

90
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,205
No way. It's probably just an error.

91
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:42,797
It's so irritating. I can't believe someone would
make a cyber terrorist attack on the SOS Brigade!

92
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:48,280
Oh, when I find out who's doing this, I'll
make 'em do 30 days of community service, no trial!

93
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,250
Come in.

94
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,479
Well, this is unusual. Miss Asahina hasn't shown up yet?

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,479
The juniors have more exams to take, don't they?

96
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,293
<i>Hey, everyone, just hurry up and go home already.</i>

97
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,620
<i>I mean, of all places, why do you wanna meet here?</i>

98
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:07,626
<i>Oh, and Haruhi, is there any special reason
you're not saying anything about Koizumi knocking?</i>

99
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,608
<i>I'm looking forward to Miss Asahina's tea.</i>

100
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,623
That's not it! No, to the right!

101
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,741
<i>For a while, I found myself stuck there
catering to Haruhi's impossible orders.</i>

102
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,185
That's not it!

103
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:28,897
<i>At last, the sound of my salvation.</i>

104
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,898
Uh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

105
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:34,361
I had exams until fourth period.

106
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:37,906
<i>With a humble apology, she appeared, no, descended.</i>

107
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,458
<i>The angel of the club, Miss Asahina.</i>

108
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,884
Well, I, um... Let's see...

109
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:48,954
I, um, I sort of brought a visitor with me.

110
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:58,011
<i>Unbelievable! I never thought
anyone would come to us for counseling!</i>

111
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,868
<i>But somehow has, and there she is!</i>

112
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:04,794
<i>Her name was Emiri Kimidori, a
junior who seemed very quiet and pure.</i>

113
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:10,274
So, lemme get this straight. You want us, the SOS
Brigade, to go and search for your missing boyfriend?

114
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:11,878
Yes...

115
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:19,873
<i>Oh, great. It seems that she thinks the
purpose of the SOS Brigade really is to be...</i>

116
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:23,219
<i>a mobile task force or jack-
-of-all-trades counseling-thing.</i>

117
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:26,013
So, what exactly is troubling you?

118
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:30,017
He hasn't been in school for the longest time.

119
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,619
Have you tried calling him?

120
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:34,478
He doesn't answer his cell or his home phone.

121
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,259
I even went to his house, but he wasn't there.

122
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,429
What about your boyfriend's family?

123
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,734
As far as I know, he lives alone.

124
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:46,530
A while ago, I remember hearing
they lived and worked overseas,

125
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:49,134
but I don't have any of their contact information.

126
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,371
Really? Well, are his parents in Canada?

127
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,095
No, I believe they live somewhere in Honduras.

128
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:56,933
Oh-ho, yes, Honduras! Indeed!

129
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:01,233
<i>What's with this "Indeed" stuff? I
doubt she even knows where Honduras is.</i>

130
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,787
<i>Let's see, somewhere below Mexico, right?</i>

131
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:07,522
That night when I went to see
him, the house was pitch-black.

132
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,107
I'm so worried.

133
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:12,398
Yeah, I can totally understand
how you're feeling about this.

134
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,752
<i>Liar. You don't understand the feeling of being in love.</i>

135
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:19,544
Anyway, I'm surprised you came to the SOS
Brigade with this mystery. So why'd you come to us?

136
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:22,394
My boyfriend used to talk about the SOS Brigade.

137
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,374
That's why I'm here.

138
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,640
Oh? So who is this boyfriend?

139
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:28,542
Ya...

140
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:29,689
... is his name.

141
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,568
Don't know him, who's he?

142
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:42,409
To tell you the truth, he's the
president of the Computer Club.

143
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:48,618
<i>The guy Haruhi took pictures of as
he sexually harassed Miss Asahina!</i>

144
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:53,064
<i>The guy Haruhi blackmailed so she
could take his top-of-the-line computer.</i>

145
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,621
<i>The poor guy who was forced to hook
the computer up with tears in his eyes.</i>

146
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,315
<i>I totally forgot about him.</i>

147
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:03,112
Okay, I got it. Don't worry,
we'll do something about this.

148
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,615
Miss Kimidori, today's your lucky day!

149
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,010
Since you're the SOS Brigade's first client,

150
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:10,544
I'll solve the case of your mystery boyfriend for free!

151
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,527
<i>You planned on charging money for this?</i>

152
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,009
Hey.

153
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,833
Taking her case was the easy part, but
what're you gonna do if you can't solve it?

154
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:26,547
We'll solve it.

155
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:31,015
I'm sure the Computer Club chief's suffering from
the May Melancholies, even if it's a couple months late.

156
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:35,613
We'll just stroll into his house, grab him,
slap him around a little, and drag him outta there.

157
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,443
<i>I think she's serious about that.</i>

158
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:42,209
<i>But if he's got a girlfriend like Miss Kimidori,
why's that guy hiding out in the Computer Club?</i>

159
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,534
Are you and Miss Kimidori friends or something?

160
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:49,323
Mm-mm. I've never spoken to her before today.

161
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,822
<i>If she needed help, why didn't
she go to a teacher or the police?</i>

162
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,055
<i>No, maybe she did, but they didn't take her seriously.</i>

163
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,230
<i>That's why she came to the SOS Brigade for help.</i>

164
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,097
<i>Yeah, that's what's going on here.</i>

165
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,394
<i>Looks like Haruhi's using this as an
opportunity to attract bigger cases.</i>

166
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,391
<i>Bet she can think she can solve those, too.</i>

167
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:10,749
We could always pass out flyers at
the front gate like we did last time.

168
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:14,649
<i>The president of the Computer
Club lived in a one-room condo.</i>

169
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,912
<i>The building wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst.</i>

170
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,937
<i>It was your typical three-and-a-half
story deal, nothing special.</i>

171
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,263
Let's do it.

172
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,753
Well, this is the place.

173
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,253
But how're we gonna get in there?

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,325
<i>Next time, try that first.</i>

175
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,336
How 'bout if we go up on the balcony in the back?

176
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:38,040
Maybe we can get in if we break the glass or something!

177
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:43,840
<i>The room's on the third floor, and it's not like
we're a gang of teenage burglars trying to rob the place.</i>

178
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,660
<i>I don't want a criminal record yet.</i>

179
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,503
Yeah, okay. Then let's go down to
the manager's office and borrow the key.

180
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,505
We'll just tell the manager that we're
friends of his who are worried about him.

181
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,448
<i>That excuse is getting a little old.</i>

182
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,728
<i>With eyes like liquid helium, she stared back at me.</i>

183
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,483
You've gotta be kidding. I didn't
realize it was open. Whatever.

184
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,247
Guess we might as well go in.

185
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:11,774
He's probably hiding under the bed or something.

186
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:13,993
Come on, let's drag his butt outta there.

187
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,727
<i>She doesn't even feel guilty for swiping
that computer right out of his hands.</i>

188
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:26,494
Well, that's strange. I totally thought we'd
find him in a corner of the room curled up in a ball.

189
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:31,939
Kyon, do you know where someone with a case of
the May Melancholies in July might scurry off to?

190
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:36,719
<i>He's either traveling in Central or South
America, or he really doesn't wanna be found.</i>

191
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,277
We should leave now.

192
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,612
<i>That's the first time she's spoken today.</i>

193
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:42,384
Miss Nagato's right, we need to go.

194
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:45,891
<i>Don't sound so serious, don't breathe on me,
you're too close, and you're freakin' me out.</i>

195
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,820
I'm feeling a little strange in here.

196
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,560
It's a sensation I'm all too
familiar with, so we should get going.

197
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:55,885
It expired three days ago,
but I'm sure they're still good.

198
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,894
Come on, let's eat!

199
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,075
Say "ah," Mikuru!

200
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,287
What do you mean "familiar"?

201
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:09,060
It's a familiar scent. This room has
the same kind of smell as closed space.

202
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:11,842
<i>Come to think of it, you're a real life ESPer, aren't you?</i>

203
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,499
There's another dimensional layer.

204
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,711
As we stand here, it's beginning to shift.

205
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,712
<i>Okay, looks like it'd be best if
we all got the hell out of here.</i>

206
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:26,578
I am so hungry.

207
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:28,423
That's it for today. Dismissed!

208
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,242
Hey, wait! What about the case?

209
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,107
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

210
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,066
See ya!

211
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,366
<i>She's already bored.</i>

212
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:46,016
Um, is anything the matter? Why did you want us
to come back here without telling Miss Suzumiya?

213
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,509
Those two seem to think there's
something fishy with that room.

214
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,424
Isn't that right?

215
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,222
Yes.

216
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:55,006
I'm sure we'll find out once we get back inside.

217
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,284
Right, Miss Nagato?

218
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,924
There is a localized non-corrosive
alternate space in this room.

219
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:05,489
It's happening independently in limited mode.

220
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:10,640
<i>Wow, it almost sounds like you're just flipping
through a dictionary, pulling out words at random.</i>

221
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,829
She's saying that there's something
similar to closed space in here.

222
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,598
It's not the same as the ones created by Miss Suzumiya.

223
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,639
The one in this room smells different.

224
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:22,888
Do you think the disappearance of the
Computer Club President is related to this space?

225
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:23,748
Yes.

226
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:29,929
<i>I should've told her to wait.</i>

227
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:36,603
<i>I couldn't enjoy the feeling of Mikuru clutching my arm,</i>

228
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,970
<i>because I was trying really
hard to figure out where I was.</i>

229
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:44,268
<i>I remember I was standing in a small, one-room
condo a second ago, not this creepy place.</i>

230
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:48,107
I have analyzed the entry
code. It overlaps standard space.

231
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,515
It is merely out of phase.

232
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,672
This doesn't seem to be closed space, though.

233
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:54,839
It's slightly different. In
one segment of this spatial data,

234
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:58,682
there is junk information that seems
to have originated with Haruhi Suzumiya.

235
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:00,304
Can you tell how much?

236
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,024
Insignificant levels. She only triggered this situation.

237
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,080
I see, so that's what happened.

238
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:08,454
<i>Can Miss Asahina and I join this conversation?</i>

239
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:12,308
So the president of the Computer
Club is somewhere in here?

240
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,601
It seems that way.

241
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:18,775
This alternate space created itself in his room,
and for some reason, he became trapped within it.

242
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,318
Then where is he?

243
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,994
Wait!

244
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,617
Do you think you can tell me what you're gonna do first?

245
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,482
I just wanna be ready for it, okay?

246
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,396
Nothing.

247
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,219
There it is.

248
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:33,948
<i>What is that?!</i>

249
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,589
I can definitely feel its animosity.

250
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:42,019
<i>Those two have ways of defending themselves,
but Miss Asahina and I don't even stand a chance!</i>

251
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,776
You wouldn't happen to have... laser guns or anything?

252
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:49,742
We're forbidden to carry firearms because it's dangerous.

253
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,549
<i>Sure, I can understand that.</i>

254
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:55,918
<i>They wouldn't do her any good anyway. Besides, she
might accidentally leave it on the train or something.</i>

255
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,571
<i>Do you guys know what camel crickets look like?</i>

256
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:07,137
<i>For those of you who don't, I'd like to
show you what I'm looking at right now.</i>

257
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,750
What is this?

258
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:09,919
A camel cricket.

259
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:11,678
<i>Got it. Thanks, Captain Obvious.</i>

260
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,898
It's the creator of this dimension.

261
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:15,945
<i>No way. Did Haruhi do this, too?</i>

262
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,729
The cause is different, but she was the catalyst.

263
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,906
Okay, you can move now.

264
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:27,320
Looks like I can still access my powers in here.

265
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,649
At least, partially.

266
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:31,525
But it's only a tenth of what I usually work with.

267
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:34,653
Maybe it was determined that
this was all the power I needed.

268
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,267
Yeah, great. Uh, Nagato, what is that
insect and where is the Computer Club guy?

269
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,972
It is a data life form. It is currently using the male
student's brain to increase its probability of survival.

270
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:49,484
Are you saying the president's inside that thing?

271
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:50,464
Exactly.

272
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:55,678
I see... This camel cricket is a manifestation
of the thing the president fears the most.

273
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:58,370
If we defeat it, we can shut down this alternate space.

274
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,639
Am I mistaken?

275
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:00,943
No mistakes.

276
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,877
Then this should be relatively easy.

277
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,541
<i>Miss Asahina's giving me a workout. I'm so gonna lose it.</i>

278
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,554
<i>And she's taken away my mobility so I can't escape.</i>

279
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,275
Don't worry, it'll be over soon.

280
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,862
Just hurry up and do it.

281
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:15,787
Roger that.

282
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,714
Fumoffu!

283
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,026
Pausing integral seconds between display.

284
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,257
A force field?!

285
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,122
Second Wave!

286
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:51,944
Did that work?

287
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:56,825
I guess it didn't work.

288
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:08,758
Is it over now?

289
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,090
<i>Looks like he's still alive.</i>

290
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,062
<i>I suddenly found myself standing
in that one-room condo again.</i>

291
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:26,602
It arrived 280 million years ago.

292
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:31,682
When "it" landed on this planet, "it" could
not find the necessary means to survive here.

293
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,940
To preserve itself, "it" went into hibernation.

294
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,609
When humans created the computer network,
"it" shifted into a half-wakened state.

295
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:45,270
Then, an explosion of unmeasured amounts of data
from a parallel world caused "it" to fully wake.

296
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:50,889
<i>That explosion of data from a parallel world
turned out to be the SOS Brigade logo that Haruhi drew.</i>

297
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,337
<i>That was the trigger.</i>

298
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:58,334
In Earth measurements, this emblem
contains approximately 436 petabytes of data.

299
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,384
<i>No way! That thing isn't more than 100 kilobytes!</i>

300
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,756
A symbol she happens to draw
turns out to be something amazing.

301
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,773
Only Miss Suzumiya could do that.

302
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,314
<i>Now I was honestly starting to get scared.</i>

303
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,413
<i>It can't just be coincidence.</i>

304
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:16,895
<i>The SOS Brigade is formed Miss Asahina
joins because she's the perfect mascot.</i>

305
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,014
<i>Koizumi joins because he's a transfer student.</i>

306
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,626
<i>Nagato joins because she's been there from the start.</i>

307
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,581
<i>On top of that, Miss Asahina came from the
future, and Nagato is sort of... alien-ish.</i>

308
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:30,700
<i>If all of this really was Haruhi's
doing, it's just too good to be true.</i>

309
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:36,526
<i>Koizumi says that it's all because
Haruhi wished it, but I don't believe that.</i>

310
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,522
<i>Look, I'm just an ordinary guy.</i>

311
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:43,491
<i>And, if it's really true that everything
Haruhi does is significant in some way,</i>

312
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,697
<i>why did she choose me to become
a member of the SOS Brigade?</i>

313
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:53,042
<i>Is it because I've got latent super-crazy powers, or
do I have a secret identity that no one's told me about?</i>

314
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,519
<i>What in the hell am I, anyway?</i>

315
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:03,061
<i>I know, I'm the conscious of the SOS Brigade.</i>

316
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:07,319
<i>I'm here because I have to stop
Haruhi's illegal club activities.</i>

317
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:10,214
<i>It's my job to make her have a normal high school life.</i>

318
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,466
All right, you gotta tell me what that camel cricket was.

319
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,680
A data life form.

320
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,570
Any relation to your entity thingy?

321
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:20,970
A similar source. The other life form
evolved differently and its race perished.

322
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:24,223
<i>Or so you thought, until you found a survivor right here.</i>

323
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:26,219
<i>Why Earth of all places?</i>

324
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,509
<i>It would've been nice if it decided
to hibernate on Neptune or something.</i>

325
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:33,657
<i>To think the internet was the nursery
for an evil overlord-y thing like that.</i>

326
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,009
Hang on a second.

327
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,492
I just realized, nothing happened in this
room when Haruhi finished drawing the logo,

328
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,877
And when she showed it to me,
nothing happened then either.

329
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,077
For a while now, this room has
been in an alternate dimension.

330
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,728
Elements and force fields collide with one another here,

331
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,741
cancelling each other out and
creating a sort of saturation.

332
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,233
But there's no room left for anything else to blend in.

333
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:58,413
So, while I wasn't looking, this room
was turned into an ominous den of weirdness?

334
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,393
Not to worry, I think it's harmless. Probably...

335
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:04,566
Oh brother. I really don't feel like going insane,

336
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:08,072
or looking for a rope to hang myself
with just because this place is so strange.

337
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,256
I'm doing my best to make sure that doesn't happen.

338
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:14,213
Well, I hope and pray that this kind of stuff
isn't happening because you're doing your best.

339
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,923
There's almost 30,000 hits on this thing!

340
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:24,923
The data life form reproduces itself by
installing hyperlinks at various locations.

341
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:30,728
It then copies information about itself into the brains
of humans who see the emblem creating more closed space.

342
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:37,589
<i>However, since the data's become corrupt, the humans
who saw it most likely did not suffer a negative effect.</i>

343
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:43,294
<i>According to Nagato, there were eight other idiots
who saw the logo, five of which were North High students.</i>

344
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:45,736
<i>Guess this means we have to go rescue them, too.</i>

345
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,851
All right, dammit! Hustle up, take a knee!

346
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:52,647
<i>If you look at it long enough, the
thing actually says "ZOZ Brigade."</i>

347
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:56,004
<i>Nagato redid the logo and I stuck it back onto the page.</i>

348
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:58,919
The Computer Club guy came back today.

349
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,858
Oh, really?

350
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:03,896
It was either a case of the May Melancholies
or an argument with his girlfriend.

351
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:07,906
Hey, isn't it amazing though?
Our website's gotten 30,000 hits!

352
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:10,392
It's like people know a good thing when they see it.

353
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:15,497
<i>I wonder... Could it be that
she's the one who destroyed the data?</i>

354
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,185
<i>And the girl who came to us, Miss Kimidori,</i>

355
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:22,037
<i>I asked the Computer Club chief, and
he said he doesn't have a girlfriend.</i>

356
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:26,039
<i>Nagato's always been in the middle
of this elaborate scenario, hasn't she?</i>

357
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:32,138
<i>It wouldn't surprise me at all if you told me
this omnipotent alien terminal had done something...</i>

358
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:34,920
<i>... to Miss Kimidori, making her come to us with a case.</i>

359
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:39,999
<i>Maybe sending a fake client to us was her way of
getting rid of Haruhi's boredom for a little while.</i>

360
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:42,942
<i>I wonder if she's been doing this the whole time.</i>

361
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:48,110
<i>Keeping the weirder things at bay and not saying
anything to anyone. Quietly, from the shadows...</i>

362
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:54,346
<i>Or maybe... getting involved with this
case was something that Nagato wished for.</i>

363
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,918
<i>An android made by aliens living
in an empty room for years on end.</i>

364
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,149
<i>Nagato... Is it possible that you get that way, too?</i>

365
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:08,209
<i>I wonder... Do you feel lonely when you're alone?</i>
