1
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,346
I don't think you should move him.

2
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:30,821
The master's dead.

3
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:32,969
It's a fruit knife.

4
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,947
This is definitely not good.

5
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,892
The knife went all the way through the notebook.

6
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:55,312
At least one thing's for certain:
whoever did this must be really strong.

7
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>If that's the case, then another thing's certain.</i>

8
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:00,754
<i>The culprit has to be a man.</i>

9
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:04,316
<i>And since we haven't seen Mr. Yutaka Tamaru around today,</i>

10
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,460
<i>well...</i>

11
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:08,308
What do you wanna do about your little sister?

12
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:10,865
I don't want her to know anything about this.

13
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:14,271
It looks as if we have a real mystery on our hands here.

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,965
In fact, what we have is a closed circle.

15
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:22,209
First impressions are that this is a murder.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,914
We have a room where the door and
windows are locked from the inside.

17
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:30,184
Now then, if the room was locked when we got to it,

18
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:33,710
how did the killer enter the room,
commit the crime, and then leave the scene?

19
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,359
Uh. Kyon, did something bad happen?

20
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,546
I told you already.

21
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:19,052
Mr. Keiichi got sick and he's resting in his room.

22
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,382
So we have to stay here, okay?

23
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,724
So, is Mikuru sick?

24
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,154
Kyon, can we talk?

25
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:35,584
Yuki, lock the door.

26
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:38,617
And don't open it for anyone, no matter what. Got that?

27
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:39,879
I understand.

28
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,191
Do you think he was murdered?

29
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:46,818
That's what it looks like.

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,005
Oh, this is nuts.

31
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,834
I never thought something like
this would ever really happen.

32
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:55,486
But all you keep saying is how badly
you wanted something mysterious to happen.

33
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:59,031
Well, yeah, because I never
really thought it would happen!

34
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,376
<i>A murder happens in a locked room on a
deserted island in the middle of a typhoon.</i>

35
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,470
<i>What're the chances we'd stumble onto
something like that while on vacation?</i>

36
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:10,523
<i>Then again, maybe this is happening
because Haruhi wished for it to happen.</i>

37
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,422
We're in some really big trouble, aren't we?

38
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,209
<i>Right now, she looks like a mischievous little boy,</i>

39
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,463
<i>worried about how an April
Fools joke went from bad to worse.</i>

40
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,643
I hate to say this, but as far as prime suspects go,

41
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:26,556
Mr. Yutaka is front and center.

42
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,001
No one knows where he is. It's
like he just up and vanished.

43
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,268
Hey, wait a minute.

44
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,517
Yesterday, Mikuru told me something.

45
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,020
Don't let it hit the water!

46
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,632
Nice! Here comes another one!

47
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,058
She saw them arguing?

48
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:43,355
That's what it looked like anyway.

49
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,876
And last night, I overheard something.

50
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:48,605
Remember? I went to the bathroom during the game.

51
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,974
I was standing in this same spot.

52
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,795
Yeah, I'm in a hurry.

53
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,400
Get my passport and traveler's checks ready, okay?

54
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,323
Now I know what that was about.

55
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,793
I'll bet you anything that he
was arranging his escape overseas.

56
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,382
But what about the sealed room?

57
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:07,126
He wasn't trying to fake Mr. Keiichi's suicice, so
what's the point in locking up the room like that?

58
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,092
I can't just stand here and not do anything. Come on.

59
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,626
We're gonna go take a closer look in Mr. Keiichi's room.

60
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,751
I'm sorry. I called the police already,

61
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:21,084
and they insisted that no one is allowed
inside the room until they arrive on the island.

62
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,812
Did they say when they would get here?

63
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:28,126
I checked the forecast, and right now, it looks like
the weather will start clearing up by tomorrow afternoon.

64
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,208
It's safe to assume that the
police will arrive around then.

65
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,468
Was his door locked all night long?

66
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,951
I have no idea.

67
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,498
When I saw that the door was closed, I knocked.

68
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,407
And that's it?

69
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:41,840
Mr. Keiichi keeps important
work related documents in there,

70
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:44,684
and it was forbidden to open
the door if he didn't answer it.

71
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:46,506
He was very adamant about that.

72
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,834
So Mr. Keiichi and Mr. Yutaka
didn't get alone with each other?

73
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:54,657
I really wouldn't know anything about that.

74
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,334
There are many things regarding
those two with which I am not familiar.

75
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:02,806
You see, Ms. Mori and myself have been
employed here at the mansion for only one week.

76
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,084
Only a week?

77
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:09,470
Ms. Mori and myself are working part time
as Mr. Keiichi's temporary maid and butler.

78
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,346
Our contract with him was brief.

79
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,209
It was to last a mere two weeks out of the summer.

80
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:20,168
So, you two were just hired to work here
and you never worked for him before this?

81
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:21,191
Precisely.

82
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,916
As for the relationship between the two brothers,

83
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:28,205
all I know is that Mr. Yutaka was
an employee in Mr. Keiichi's company.

84
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,438
<i>Something's not right.</i>

85
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:37,847
<i>I've suddenly got a strange feeling about this.</i>

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,892
Koizumi! What're you doing?

87
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:46,481
I was just having a look around the mansion.

88
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,422
I can't find Mr. Yutaka anywhere. How 'bout you?

89
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,349
I'm going outside to see if the boat's still there.

90
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:54,559
I don't think you'll find the boat.

91
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:55,547
What do you mean?

92
00:06:55,803 --> 00:07:00,476
Well, late last night, I noticed that
Mr. Yutaka seemed as if he were in an awful hurry.

93
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,639
I saw him heading for the front entrance.

94
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:07,150
Then, are you implying that Mr. Yutaka
took the boat and left the island?

95
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm not positive that's what happened, no.

96
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,666
But that was the last time I saw Mr. Yutaka.

97
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:14,212
About what time?

98
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,866
I believe it was around one o'clock in the morning.

99
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>One wrong step and we'll both fall off the cliff.</i>

100
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,882
<i>Oh well, even if we fall, when I'm with her, I
feel like my chances for survival are pretty good.</i>

101
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,346
Kyon, do you see that?

102
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,382
The boat's gone.

103
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,306
So Mr. Yutaka did it after all.

104
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:41,283
<i>Grey skies and black seas,</i>

105
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,898
<i>it reminds me of being inside a closed space.</i>

106
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,774
<i>There's no way I'd ever get used
to a monochromatic world like this.</i>

107
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:49,485
Kyon!

108
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,549
Someone's there! See! Just past the rocks!

109
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:55,432
I wonder if somebody else is out there looking.

110
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,831
Or maybe that's the... the... the murderer!

111
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:58,952
Haruhi! Wait!

112
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,257
Hey. Are you sure you saw him come down this way?

113
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:08,319
He had to. This is the only path.

114
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:10,329
Haruhi!

115
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:20,921
Kyon.

116
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:23,535
Kyon! Kyon!

117
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,450
Are you all right? Are you alive?

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,878
Yeah, I guess I'm okay.

119
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,299
Looks like we're in a tough spot.

120
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:35,224
Yeah.

121
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,842
I don't think we can make it back to the path.

122
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,461
Hey, over there.

123
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,758
<i>Forunately, it was warm inside the cave.</i>

124
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,207
<i>Was it just the Earth's heat?</i>

125
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:50,683
<i>Or was there an underground hot spring near by?</i>

126
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:53,183
I know I saw a shadow back there.

127
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,443
You sure it was even a person?

128
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:57,531
I mean, maybe it was something else.

129
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,741
No way. I saw what I saw.

130
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,307
Although, I was thinking...

131
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,222
Hey, Kyon.

132
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,732
Do you really think Mr. Yutaka killed Mr. Keiichi?

133
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:09,212
What're you getting at?

134
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:11,669
Well, I've just been thinking about everything.

135
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,138
According to what Ms. Mori said a little while ago,
Mr. Yutaka left the island around one in the morning.

136
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,662
When we found Mr. Keiichi's body, I touched him.

137
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,751
He was still warm. You see what I'm getting at?

138
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:29,194
His body was still warm. That means Mr. Keiichi
was killed right before we found his body.

139
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,769
So what does that mean?

140
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,217
Mr. Yutaka left the mansion at
night in the middle of a typhoon,

141
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,595
hid till morning, then stabbed
Mr. Keiichi before splitting the island?

142
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,602
But I don't think that's how it happened.

143
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:43,520
Look, even if Mr. Keiichi was
killed an hour before we found him,

144
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,985
that means someone should've seen or heard something.

145
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,121
Remember, we were all awake
and wandering around the place.

146
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,919
Someone should've heard something.

147
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,512
A sound. A scream.

148
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:53,850
Don't you think that's strange?

149
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,060
I mean, you really think

150
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:59,494
that Mr. Keiichi stayed alive for hours on end and
managed to lock himself in his room after beind stabbed?

151
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:00,440
Think about it.

152
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,552
If Mr. Yutaka wasn't the
murderer, then why'd he run away...

153
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,014
Wait! I got it!

154
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,724
Now I've got it. I know what happened in there.

155
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,893
Are you even listening to me?

156
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,190
Yeah. Come on then, let's hear it.

157
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:19,376
I'm sure Mr. Yutaka's the one who stabbed Mr. Keiichi.

158
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:23,196
Like you said, why else would he run
away unless he was the guy that did it.

159
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:24,416
Yeah, that's true.

160
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:29,512
So Mr. Yutaka stabbed Mr. Keiichi,
we know that, but how did it happen?

161
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,409
I'm pretty sure it was an accident.

162
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:37,065
They were arguing. Mr. Yutaka lost his temper, picked
up the fruit knife, started waving it around, and bam!

163
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,747
But the knife didn't go all the
way through to Mr. Keiichi's heart.

164
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,326
The notebook stopped the knife.

165
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:48,657
It was stuck in him, but it wasn't fatal.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,527
Here's where it gets complicated.

167
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:54,184
Mr. Keiichi went into shocked and
passed out right there on the spot.

168
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:58,276
When that happened, Mr. Yutaka
though he'd killed his brother and ran.

169
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,401
Now comes the tricky part.

170
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:05,986
Mr. Keiichi, who wasn't dead, stayed unconscious
throughout the night and came to the next morning.

171
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:09,148
When he woke up, Mr. Keiichi was in a daze.

172
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:11,860
He stood up, but his legs were a little wobbly.

173
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:17,162
He remembered how his brother tried to kill him,
so he staggered over to the door to lock himself in.

174
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:20,204
This part's the most tragic of all.

175
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:25,266
Mr. Keiichi, still dazed, trippped over
his own feet and fell face down on the floor.

176
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:32,031
The weight of his body pushed the knife up into
his heart, and that's what caused Mr. Keiichi's death.

177
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,665
That's how it happened.

178
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:36,992
Wait a minute. You honeslty think
it all went down that smoothly?

179
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:39,381
What're gonna do? That's the way it happened.

180
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,196
Unless you've got a better idea.

181
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,793
I'm sure Mr. Yutaka would know if
he really killed his brother or not.

182
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:48,034
Besides, when we got to him,
Mr. Keiichi was lying face up.

183
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:54,107
If everything happened the way that you said, we
would've found Mr. Keiichi lying face down, not face up.

184
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:56,400
Well, that's true, but...

185
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:58,936
No... No wait!

186
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,241
If that's how it really happened, then...

187
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,123
Hey, what's wrong?

188
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,780
Uh. Oh, nothing.

189
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,680
I guess I wasn't thinking straight there for a second.

190
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,684
Hey! Can you hear me?

191
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:14,794
You guys okay?

192
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,411
<i>It looks like Haruhi's deduction has completely crumbled.</i>

193
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,939
<i>But if that's the case, what really happened?</i>

194
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:28,005
<i>Mr. Yutaka wasn't on the island when Mr. Keiichi died,</i>

195
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,898
<i>which means that somebody else is the murderer here.</i>

196
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,366
Which one should I eat?

197
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:37,852
Hey.

198
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,988
Kyon, you scared me! Stop it!

199
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,662
Stealing food, eh?

200
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:43,416
But!

201
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,726
I was hungry. You're mean.

202
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:47,643
I'm sorry about that.

203
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,847
I'll bring something up to your room right away.

204
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,779
Hey, no fair.

205
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,950
Someone got to eat their food before anyone else.

206
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,218
Yes, it was Mr. Arakawa.

207
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,885
He hasn't had a thing to eat since this morning,
so I delivered his meal ahead of everyone else.

208
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:04,689
You always find a way to embarrass me, don't you?

209
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:08,615
Is somethin' wrong?

210
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,990
Yuki, it's me. Open the door.

211
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,346
I was told to not open the door for anyone.

212
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,329
But it's okay now. Open up!

213
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,434
Then I would be opening the door for someone.

214
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,601
I was told not to open it for anyone.

215
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,299
I take it Ms. Asahina's still unconscious in there.

216
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,692
I'd assume she is, otherwise, we'd hear her.

217
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:32,512
Yuki, when I said anyone, I meant anyone
who isn't a member of the SOS brigade.

218
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,414
I mean, we're all members, right?

219
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,146
That is not what I was told.

220
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:41,059
I was given an order to lock this door and
under no circumstances was I to open it for anyone.

221
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:44,831
But, Yuki, you didn't say anything
when I left the room a little while ago.

222
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:48,808
My orders did not specify the door
being opened from inside this room.

223
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,345
Hey, Nagato.

224
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:55,368
As of right now, Haruhi's order has been retracted.

225
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:58,074
If you want, I'll just give you a new order.

226
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,469
Look, my sister's out here. Please open the door.

227
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:10,168
Jeez, you don't have to be so literal all the time.

228
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:15,518
<i>Maybe that was Nagato's way of playing a joke on us.</i>

229
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:17,198
<i>Come on, Nagato.</i>

230
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,828
<i>No expression. Not even a blush? Your face never changes.</i>

231
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,903
<i>You can't be serious all the time, can you?</i>

232
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,124
Thanks, Yuki!

233
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,755
What do you think we should do now?

234
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,919
Do you wanna keep trying to
find the answers to this mystery?

235
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,205
Not anymore. I guess I'm not the
great detective I thought I was.

236
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:36,680
Oh, well. We'll let the police handle this one.

237
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:46,290
I see. So that's what you were talkin' about in the cave.

238
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,890
But something's strange.

239
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,338
If she really wanted to play the detective so much,

240
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:52,572
why did she just suddenly drop the whole thing like that?

241
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,044
I think I can understand that.

242
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,098
Or at least, where she's comin' from.

243
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,396
Would you like to hear my theory about it?

244
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:00,845
Yeah. I'm all ears.

245
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,981
Up to a certain point, Ms.
Suzumiya's deductions are correct,

246
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,588
but the last part of the
mystery is where she got it wrong.

247
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,408
Mr. Keiichi was stabbed by Mr. Yutaka.

248
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,486
However, he didn't die right away.

249
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,269
Mr. Yutaka thought he killed him, so he fled.

250
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,626
That's all correct.

251
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,964
But Mr. Keiichi came to because
of our knocking and shouts.

252
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,715
And just before we tried opening the
door, he staggered over, dazed, and locked it.

253
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,241
And then...

254
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,936
That was the moment the knife was pushed
through the notebook and into Mr. Keiichi's body.

255
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,455
In other words, he was really killed...

256
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,808
...by the people who rammed the door in.

257
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:47,038
Basically, it was me and it was
you and it was also Mr. Arakawa.

258
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:54,764
I'm positive Ms. Suzumiya figured all that
out, and that's why she didn't say anything.

259
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,109
She was protecting us.

260
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,955
That's why she decided to keep
the truth of this case to herself.

261
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,664
Your theory does make a lot of sense.

262
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,794
But it's unfortunate you had to figure out the truth.

263
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,976
All I have to do is keep you
quiet, and this whole thing goes away.

264
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,959
No one will ever know. Isn't that right?

265
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,843
Someone help me! Help me! Help me!

266
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:23,740
It's Koizumi.

267
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,943
I don't know who, but somebody stabbed
him in the chest with a knife, and he's dead!

268
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:29,410
What did you say?

269
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,459
Impossible!

270
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,953
Come on! Follow me!

271
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,473
Hurry! Hurry!

272
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,395
I never thought you'd be such a badass.

273
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,317
Yeah. Well, just keep your mouth
shut, and I won't have to kill you, too.

274
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,698
Here's how it goes.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,285
Mr. Yutaka snuck back here and killed Koizumi.

276
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,389
Only a killer knows their motive, right?

277
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,746
So we say that we thought he seemed a little... off.

278
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,863
Yeah, he was acting weird. That'll be the story.

279
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,273
You think the police would actually buy that?

280
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:04,733
Yeah, but first, we're gonna have
to stab the corpse a few more times.

281
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,660
It'll make Mr. Yutaka seem like a total psycho.

282
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:09,393
Here goes!

283
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:10,408
Wait!

284
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,748
Well, it looks like we've been found out.

285
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,586
The game's over and we lost.

286
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,815
It's true, you beat us fair and square.

287
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm sorry. I did it 'cause Kyon told me to.

288
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,155
Right. Now, Madame Haruhi,
supernatural genius and number one sleuth,

289
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,902
will reveal the results of her amazing detectiving.

290
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,371
<i>Why don'tcha pat yourself on the back a little bit harder.</i>

291
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:44,857
By now, it should be evident that the
murder mystery was, in fact, an elaborate hoax,

292
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:49,761
designed and orchestrated by Koizumi, the
Tamaru brothers, Mr. Arakawa, and Ms. Mori.

293
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,893
It was an impressive plot, especially
with that red herring at the end.

294
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,633
Nice observation.

295
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:59,283
It was all in fun, though. A surprise
party with a twist, if you will.

296
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:01,868
<i>I'm sure she knew what was up right from the start.</i>

297
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:06,608
I hate to admit it, but in the
beginning, you guys had me going.

298
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:12,081
Until I got your fake solution where Mr. Keiichi was
killed by Kyon and the boys busted through the door.

299
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,814
But I realized something.

300
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,894
If he really did collide with the door hard
enough to push the knife through to his heart,

301
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,309
then the door should've had blood or scratches on it.

302
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,976
But there wasn't anything like
that on the inside of the door.

303
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,408
<i>I noticed that, thank you.</i>

304
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,520
Okay, but you're talkin' about a really sturdy door there.

305
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,186
I mean, I don't think that gives you
very much evidence to suspect anything.

306
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,141
There were other fishy things, as well.

307
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:38,123
Like the day when Koizumi first met Mr. Arakawa.

308
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,797
He said, "I haven't seen you in so long."

309
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:45,971
But Mr. Arakawa said he only started working here a
week ago, so it would've been the first time they met.

310
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,241
You are 100% correct.

311
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:49,679
<i>I figured that one out, too.</i>

312
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:53,335
There was also that time when we
all ran up to Mr. Keiichi's room.

313
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,699
You headed right down the hall
to his door, right, Koizumi?

314
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:59,773
So how could you have known which room was his?

315
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,978
You told us this was the first
time you'd ever been here, remember?

316
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:04,643
I can't believe it.

317
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,018
Not just one, but two mistakes?

318
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,526
But that's not so strange.

319
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:12,553
He could've found out which room was mine while
the rest of you were off doing something else.

320
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,612
That is correct.

321
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:17,238
However, the final clue was the
empty plate Kyon saw in the kitchen.

322
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,468
I'll let Kyon take this one, 'cause
I didn't actually see the plate.

323
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:25,556
I noticed that Mr. Keiichi is the only one on this island
who eats with a fork and knife instead of chopsticks.

324
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:29,569
Of course, there's the possibility that
Mr. Arakawa eats with a fork and knife, too.

325
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:32,544
But, you see, the carrots remained on the plate untouched.

326
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:36,110
That's when I realized that it
was actually Mr. Keiichi's meal.

327
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,663
If you add it all up, there's only
one conclusion to come to and that is...

328
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,676
...there was never a murder to begin with!

329
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:47,440
Mr. Keiichi was, is, and always has been alive!

330
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:51,705
Wow!

331
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:56,037
<i>I'm sure that, in her mind, Haruhi's probably
hearing applause that's 100 times bigger than that.</i>

332
00:19:56,645 --> 00:20:00,478
So, we decided to turn the tables
and put on a little show of our own.

333
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,739
Then the fight I saw on the balcony
that day was part of the act as well.

334
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,565
That's right.

335
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,721
And that late night phone call was a fake, too.

336
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:13,095
I was planning on lettin' the
cat out of the bag at some point.

337
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,933
I'm still amazed you solved the mystery so quickly.

338
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,650
Well, all of your sleuthing caused
their whole dasterdly scheme to unravel,

339
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,428
that was some nice detective work there.

340
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,553
Of course!

341
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:24,613
It's elementary, my dear Watson!

342
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:25,628
Elementary!

343
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,630
So all of this was something your organization cooked up?

344
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:37,723
Yes. The Tamaru brothers, Mr. Arakawa,
and Ms. Mori are all collegues of mine.

345
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,001
I told ya we'd have a blast!

346
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:43,485
We believed it would be best if Ms. Suzumiya had a
mystery to keep her mind free of any strange thoughts,

347
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,570
if you know what I mean.

348
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,858
Well, you do.

349
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,446
Although, bringing your sister
along was not a part of the plan.

350
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,188
I asked you at the beginning of this trip and you told me
that the organization didn't have anything to do with it.

351
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,608
Naturally!

352
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,685
I couldn't tell you the truth
about their involvement right then.

353
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,710
If you don't mind me asking,
when did you catch on to our scheme?

354
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:08,593
To tell you the truth, I knew
about it right from the beginning.

355
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:09,620
Indeed.

356
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,939
An incident like this could never happen.

357
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:17,772
Because there's no way that Haruhi would
ever really wish for someone to be murdered.

358
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,390
That's just how she is.

359
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,051
Then you really trust Ms. Suzumiya, don't you?

360
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,815
And there's one more thing that I wanna know.

361
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:32,680
Haruhi said she saw a shadow.

362
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,501
You had something to do with that, right?

363
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,967
I don't know anything about that.

364
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm tellin' the truth! The mystery solved,
so there's no reason for me to keep acting.

365
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:43,839
Well, she saw something. What do you think it was?

366
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:45,394
Can't be...

367
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:51,157
Apparently, Ms. Suzumiya wished for a murderer that
wasn't one of us, and that was probably the shadow.

368
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,658
But if it was something Haruhi
wished for that came to life, then...

369
00:21:57,478 --> 00:22:02,805
That means... there's some kind of horrible...
something lurking on that island right now.

370
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:07,230
Naw, it was probably just the storm
that was making Haruhi see things.

371
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,754
So, where do you wanna go next?

372
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:14,952
How about the Bermuda Triangle?

373
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:17,569
Is Bermuda really a triangle?
