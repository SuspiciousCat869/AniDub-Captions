1
00:00:02,318 --> 00:00:05,266
Next up is the inter-club relay race.

2
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:06,494
On your mark...

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,868
Get set...

4
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:18,527
Here I go!

5
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:23,832
Here.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,549
Darn it.

7
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:32,894
I wanted to come from last
place and pass everyone at the end!

8
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:36,883
But thanks to Yuki, we blew 'em
away, and left 'em chokin' on our dust!

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,890
It was a fantastic effort though.

10
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:43,484
I just hope the track team doesn't lost
their confidence because of our excellence.

11
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:45,827
Come on, guys, this isn't funny at all.

12
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,235
Everybody's gonna think we're
weirder now, than they ever did before.

13
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:52,276
<i>Although, it's a little late to be worrying about that.</i>

14
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:59,427
<i>And yes, the outfits and the headbands with odd phrases
were all Haruhi's idea, but I bet you knew that already.</i>

15
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,874
<i>Why are we doing this again?</i>

16
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:03,845
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>

17
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,172
Can I change out of this thing now?

18
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,177
You and Miss Suzumiya's band of freaks
are still the weirdest cats in school.

19
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:16,085
It's epic stuff, my brother.
Keep up the good work, you hear?

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,978
Cut it out.

21
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:20,526
I'm doing everything I can to be as
low-profile around here as possible.

22
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:23,595
Running in that outfit was definitely low-profile, sir.

23
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, it wasn't easy, let me tell you.

24
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,278
Yeah, I think you're sorta missing the point.

25
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:32,663
I bet they're gonna stick a picture of you
wearing that in the yearbook. Can't wait to see that.

26
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,200
Gimme a break already.

27
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:39,058
Who's that?

28
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:39,918
Ew!

29
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:40,637
Gross.

30
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:45,118
Did you see the one with the
ponytail? She's such a cutie pie!

31
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:48,457
<i>Our neverending, endless summer vacation had ended.</i>

32
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,909
<i>And here we were, second term,
and having an athletic festival.</i>

33
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,771
<i>Of course, Haruhi wasn't gonna sit
still on a beautiful day like today.</i>

34
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,312
<i>Just look at the poor souls left in her wake.</i>

35
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,211
<i>Yeah... That's Haruhi.</i>

36
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:04,758
<i>She sure loves her festivals, doesn't she?</i>

37
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:38,548
<i>Our bizarre day of athletic festivities was over.</i>

38
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,649
<i>It was the beginning of a new month,</i>

39
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:43,495
<i>and our school arts festival was right around the corner.</i>

40
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,634
<i>And, as you can see, everyone
was busy getting ready for it.</i>

41
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:53,333
<i>By the way, if you were wondering
what me and Haruhi's class were doing,</i>

42
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,427
<i>check out the board.</i>

43
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:59,210
<i>Yep, we wussed out, and decided that our
class project was gonna be some kind of survey.</i>

44
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,851
<i>Ever since Ryoko Asakura "left" back in the spring term,</i>

45
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,856
<i>there wasn't anyone crazy enough to take
over the leadership duties of our class.</i>

46
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,144
We're going, Kyon.

47
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,817
<i>So, with a level of disinterest bordering on apathy,</i>

48
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,271
<i>I find myself once again trudging over to the club room.</i>

49
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,080
<i>Why? Well, I'll tell you why.</i>

50
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,034
<i>It's all because the girl who's marching
along beside me said the following:</i>

51
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:34,199
I can't believe our project is gonna be a survey.
That's gotta be the dumbest idea I've ever heard!

52
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:37,026
Why did they have to go and
pick the least fun thing to do?

53
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,239
Well, maybe you should've said
something about it when you had the chance.

54
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:41,772
Didn't you see the class?

55
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,885
And that look on Mr. Okabe's face?

56
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:45,704
It was like someone had died.

57
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,392
Oh, whatever.

58
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:51,163
It wasn't like I was gonna participate
in anything the class was doing anyway.

59
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:57,776
<i>Although, I think I remember you having something to do
with our class winning the track and field championships.</i>

60
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:02,184
<i>And, if I'm not mistaken, weren't you the
one who entered every event and won all of them?</i>

61
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:05,607
<i>That was you, wasn't it? Or was that someone else?</i>

62
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:07,910
This and that are two different things.

63
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,534
I'm talking about the school arts festival.

64
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,455
It's like the most important, super event we get a year!

65
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,709
Oh, it is, is it?

66
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,043
Absolutely! And this year,
we're gonna do something so cool,

67
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,966
it's gonna blow everyone's mind!

68
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:24,741
<i>The look on Haruhi's face when she said
that, full of confidence and shining brightly,</i>

69
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:29,566
<i>it must've been what Hannibal looked like as
he crossed the Alps during the Second Punic War!</i>

70
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,668
It's the school arts festival!

71
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,889
So get with the program, and act more excited about it!

72
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:43,376
This is the only chance we'll get
to experience this as tenth graders!

73
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:47,293
I know, I got it. But I just don't see
the point in getting all riled up about it.

74
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:50,985
But if you don't get all riled up about
it, then there's no point in doing it!

75
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:54,058
All the school festivals I've ever been to were like that.

76
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,860
Did you guys go all out at
your old junior high or something?

77
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:58,872
Not even.

78
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:00,572
They were all pretty lame.

79
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:04,557
That's why I want all my high
school festivals to be exciting!

80
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,048
Then, what'll it take to make this one exciting for you?

81
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,431
<i>And please, explain it so I can understand.</i>

82
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,396
Oh, all right.

83
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,796
I'll tell you about it when we get to the club room.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,107
<i>The scent of lavender!</i>

85
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,263
Oh! Hello, there!

86
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:27,693
<i>I thought flowers were blooming.</i>

87
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,503
I'll go prepare some tea, okay?

88
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:30,748
<i>Oh, don't trouble yourself.</i>

89
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:33,050
Stop it, you look like a dirty old man!

90
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,443
Hey, Mikuru, where's Koizumi?

91
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,918
He hasn't come by yet.

92
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,892
I think he's running late.

93
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,718
Mikuru, what's holding up the tea?

94
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,342
I-I'm bringing it now!

95
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,381
Mikuru.

96
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:53,350
Yes?

97
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:56,429
Don't you remember all that stuff we talked about before?

98
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,418
Huh? What do you mean?

99
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,168
I mean, whenever you serve tea,

100
00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:05,148
you have to try to make sure you trip
and stumble at least a third of the time!

101
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,135
You know, you're not acting like a klutsy maid at all.

102
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,751
Huh? Oh. S-Sorry!

103
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:11,875
<i>What's up with her?</i>

104
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,354
Does she think all maids have to be clumsy or something?

105
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:18,493
Don't worry. Today's your lucky day.
You get to go and practice on Kyon!

106
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,538
Your goal is to get the cup
to land upside-down on his head!

107
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,280
Really?

108
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:26,334
Miss Asahina, Haruhi's the only person
who's gonna think a joke like that is funny.

109
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:27,850
<i>You should know that by now.</i>

110
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,752
Hey, dummy.

111
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,636
I never joke about stuff like that.

112
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,687
I am always super serious!

113
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,796
<i>If that's the case, then we're in big trouble!</i>

114
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:39,877
All right, Mikuru, I'll demonstrate the
proper technique, and then it's your turn.

115
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,107
But I... Huh?

116
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,148
Hey!

117
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:53,728
Hold it!

118
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,583
Hey, you! Stop interfering!

119
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:03,354
Are you crazy? I'm not gonna just sit here and
do nothing while you pour boiling water on my head!

120
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,132
Here you are.

121
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,071
<i>Oh, Nagato.</i>

122
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:27,381
<i>If she made Taniguchi a cup,
he'd cherish it for three days!</i>

123
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:32,406
I'm sorry, everyone. Homeroom ran a little late today.

124
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:36,063
I hope our meeting wasn't delayed
too long because of my tardiness.

125
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,960
Wait, what meeting?

126
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,053
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

127
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:40,766
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,

128
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,471
but I let everyone else know about it at lunch today.

129
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,865
I guess I just figured I'd tell you whenever.

130
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:48,791
How come you have the time to go
to their classrooms and tell them?!

131
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:50,850
I sit right in front of you all day long.

132
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,438
Telling me couldn't be any easier!

133
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,234
Yeah, like it even matters.

134
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,417
The problem isn't so much when you found out
about it, it's what you're going to do about it!

135
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,941
<i>Was that supposed to be profound?</i>

136
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:03,568
The SOS Brigade's gotta start thinking
now about what we're gonna do next!

137
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:06,101
<i>Are we talking about now-now or later?</i>

138
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,182
<i>And by "we," did you mean we as in us? Or "we" as in you?</i>

139
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,503
Everyone here is gonna participate.

140
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,960
This is an SOS Brigade event, after all.

141
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,460
And by that, you mean...

142
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,337
We were just talking about it!

143
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:20,825
The school arts festival, what
else is going on around here?!

144
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,580
Right, well that's something
the whole school's involved in.

145
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,293
And if you're so hot and bothered
about being the main attraction,

146
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,736
you should've signed up to be on the festival staff.

147
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,303
They probably could use all the help they can get.

148
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,251
That's a total waste of time!

149
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:36,283
We have to do something that's
up to SOS Brigade standards.

150
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:40,224
I worked hard to build this brigade into
the coolest thing the school's ever seen.

151
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,701
Everyone knows about us!

152
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,651
We've got a reputation to uphold!

153
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:47,897
<i>It's easy for you 'cause all you
do is come up with crazy schemes.</i>

154
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,734
<i>Miss Asahina and I have to suffer through them</i>

155
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,856
<i>Koizumi just sits there, smiling like a weirdo.</i>

156
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,570
<i>And Nagato never helps with the brainstorming.</i>

157
00:09:57,408 --> 00:09:58,942
<i>I'm the normal one here.</i>

158
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,995
<i>She should consider that for a change.</i>

159
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,069
We have to do something that
lives up to their expectations.

160
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:07,228
<i>Now what exactly does anyone expect from the SOS Brigade?</i>

161
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,730
<i>I know, let's take a survey and find out!</i>

162
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,210
Hey, Mikuru, what's your class gonna do?

163
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,353
My class?

164
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,460
A yakisoba cafe.

165
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:19,098
I bet that means you're gonna be a waitress, huh?

166
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,002
How did you know about that?

167
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,150
Everyone in my class said I'd be perfect for it.

168
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:30,992
What about you, Koizumi?

169
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:34,293
Well, my class decided it
would be fun if we put on a play.

170
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,385
But we're debating whether to do
a classic or something original.

171
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,238
<i>Now they sound like a lively bunch of people.</i>

172
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>And pretty annoying.</i>

173
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,872
And Yuki?

174
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:46,856
Fortune-telling.

175
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:47,717
Really?

176
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:48,832
Yes.

177
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,542
<i>Nagato telling fortunes? Or telling futures?</i>

178
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:56,793
Oh! I got a great idea!

179
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:57,651
How 'bout this?

180
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:01,254
Let's mix everything together and do
a survey-cafe- fortune-telling-theater!

181
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,472
Stop being a dork and let's
get this meeting started already!

182
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,701
Not sure what you want us to look at.

183
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,180
There's nothing written on it yet.

184
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,837
Just hold your horses.

185
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,569
Hey, Mikuru. Since you're the secretary,
make sure you write everything down.

186
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,914
Uh... Okay.

187
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,962
<i>I didn't know Miss Asahina was our secretary.</i>

188
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,690
<i>I doubt anyone knows 'cause it's
something Haruhi just came up with.</i>

189
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,862
We, the SOS Brigade, are gonna
show a movie at this year's festival!

190
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:58,004
<i>I have absolutely no idea what goes on
inside that head of hers. And I don't wanna know.</i>

191
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,918
<i>This is typical Haruhi.</i>

192
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,009
<i>However...</i>

193
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,198
How in the heck is this a meeting?

194
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,970
It's like you're on a soapbox giving a political speech.

195
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,651
This is normal for us.

196
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,052
<i>Ugh! Too close!</i>

197
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:12,860
It looks like Miss Suzumiya decided on
what we were gonna do right from the beginning,

198
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:15,059
and negotiations are out of the question.

199
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,688
But I wonder why she decided on a movie.

200
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,860
<i>Maybe she saw a really bad flick on TV last night.</i>

201
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:24,791
<i>And if the movie was especially horrible, it
could have put her in a lousy mood or something.</i>

202
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,312
You know, there's something I always wondered about.

203
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,543
I wonder what's inside your head.

204
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:35,610
How come on TV shows, when they
get to the last episode, someone dies?

205
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:39,651
That always feels really fake to me.
I mean, their deaths are so convenient.

206
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:45,726
It's weird. I guess that's why I can't stand shows or
movies or anything where a character dies at the end.

207
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,520
I would never make a movie that ended like that.

208
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,176
That's what I mean! Now do you get it?

209
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,945
What do you mean, "That's what I mean"?

210
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,145
All you said was that we're gonna be showing a movie.

211
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,901
But where's this movie coming from?

212
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,527
Oh, Kyon, you're not very smart, are you?

213
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,712
We are gonna make our own movie.

214
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,832
And then, we're gonna show it at the school arts festival!

215
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:15,335
And the credits are gonna read:
"Presented by the SOS Brigade."

216
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,824
When exactly did we become the Movie Club?

217
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,877
What are you talking about? We're still the SOS Brigade.

218
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,324
Nobody said we turned into the Movie Club.

219
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,411
I think I understand what's going on.

220
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:30,401
She's saying we're going to shoot our own
movie, and then screen it during the arts festival.

221
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:31,691
That's the plan, isn't it?

222
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:33,495
That is the plan!

223
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:36,830
But um... why did you decide to shoot a movie?

224
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,318
If you really wanna know, I was
having trouble falling asleep last night.

225
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:44,001
I turned on the TV and this crappy movie was on.

226
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:44,866
<i>I knew it!</i>

227
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,960
It had to be the worst movie
I've ever seen in my whole life!

228
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:51,889
It was so bad, for a sec there, I was
thinking about crank-calling the director!

229
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,210
And that's when it hit me!

230
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,597
If that's the best they can do,

231
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,712
I can definitely make a better movie!

232
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,254
So I figured, what the heck, let's go for it!

233
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:05,176
If you wanna be a director or
a producer, that's fine with me.

234
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:07,922
Good for you, godspeed, and so on and so forth.

235
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:11,026
But, some of us might have other
things we'd like to do, you know?

236
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,136
What do you mean?

237
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,585
What would you do if we said
we didn't feel like doing this?

238
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,638
I mean, think about it. You can't
make a movie with just a director.

239
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,765
Don't worry about that! I'm almost done with the script!

240
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,585
Yeah... I don't think you understood
what I was talking about there.

241
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,610
Oh, come on, don't sweat the small stuff.

242
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:28,610
Just follow my lead like always,
and everything will be fine!

243
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,732
You don't have to worry about anything at all!

244
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:31,507
<i>I'm worried.</i>

245
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:34,617
Just leave everything to me!
I'm gonna plan the whole thing out!

246
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:35,774
Now I'm really worried.

247
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,785
I said we're doing it, and that's that.

248
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,485
Stop being so annoying.

249
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,792
Our goal is to be voted the No.1 event of the festival!

250
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:47,960
Maybe then, those jerks in the student council
will recognize the SOS Brigade as a legitimate club!

251
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,251
No, we're gonna make 'em recognize us.

252
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:53,160
And to do that, we're gonna
need to get the public on our side.

253
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:54,919
And how are we gonna pay for all this?

254
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,440
We'll just dip into our funds.

255
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:57,474
What funds?

256
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,142
We've got the literary club's money.

257
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:02,235
But that's their money for their projects.

258
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,904
You can't just decide to take it.

259
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:06,837
Yuki, is it okay if I have your money?

260
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,791
Yes.

261
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,550
Listen up, people!

262
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:21,465
Whatever your classes are doing, this is more important!

263
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,489
If anyone thinks different, we'll
talk about it after the festival.

264
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,378
The director's will is supreme!

265
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:27,188
Got it?!

266
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,668
<i>First, she's the brigade leader. Now, she's a director.</i>

267
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:33,135
<i>What does she wanna be next? Please, please don't say god.</i>

268
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:39,195
Okay. We're done for today! Since I'm producing
this thing, I've got a lot to think about!

269
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,552
We'll go over all the details tomorrow.

270
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:53,246
This isn't such a bad thing. If you want to know the
truth, I'm actually quite relieved this is happening.

271
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:56,616
It's not like we have to catch
a space monster for a slide show.

272
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:59,553
Or shoot down a UFO and make an exhibit out of it.

273
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:04,569
Besides, I'm a little curious to see what
kind of movie Miss Suzumiya wants to shoot.

274
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,658
This should make for an interesting festival,

275
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,576
very interesting indeed.

276
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:16,008
D-Did you want something?

277
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:20,784
<i>Nothing... Just wondering what kind of
costume Haruhi was gonna bring in next, that's it.</i>

278
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,444
<i>Shooting a movie... Uh-oh.</i>

279
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,511
<i>A movie, huh?</i>

280
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,187
<i>To be honest, I was kind of interested in the idea.</i>

281
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:41,986
<i>Not as much as Koizumi though. I guess, at the
very least, I should try to be more psyched about it.</i>

282
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,342
<i>After all, I doubt anyone's expecting much.</i>

283
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,704
<i>I take back everything I said.</i>

284
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,153
<i>I shouldn't have been psyched.</i>

285
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,933
<i>Because the next day, after school,</i>

286
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,290
<i>I became very, very sad.</i>

287
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,893
So, what exactly am I supposed to do on this thing?

288
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:17,566
Take a look; it's on the board.

289
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,418
Am I really supposed to be the heroine?

290
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:24,172
Because if it's possible, I'd like
to play a part that's less prominent...

291
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:27,359
No way! You're gonna play the flashiest role ever!

292
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,914
Besides, you're kinda the brigade's mascot.

293
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:32,934
Oh! And you might wanna start practicing your autograph!

294
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:37,276
When we have the premiere, I bet
you're gonna get swarmed by a ton of fans!

295
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,186
<i>Where are you gonna hold a premiere?</i>

296
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:42,499
But, I've never acted in anything before.

297
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,740
Don't worry about a thing! I'm an awesome director!

298
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:50,266
I am a little concerned about Yuki and Koizumi though.

299
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,492
They know this project takes
priority, but they're still in class.

300
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,924
I have to give them a warning for showing up late.

301
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:00,018
It's a little odd that me and Miss Asahina
were here on time and ready to go though.

302
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,214
Miss Asahina, is it okay that you're
here and not at your class meeting?

303
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:10,882
Since I'm just going to be a waitress, all
I have to do is get fitted for my costume.

304
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,865
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

305
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:14,398
Actually, I can't wait!

306
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:18,718
<i>Miss Asahina's blushing smile proved
that she'd gotten used to cosplaying.</i>

307
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:22,931
<i>Well, at least now, she'll get to wear
the proper costume for the proper occasion.</i>

308
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,672
<i>More than she does for the SOS Brigade, anyway.</i>

309
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,876
If you really wanna be a waitress,
I can totally make that happen!

310
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,594
I've got a buncha costumes I can bring in for you!

311
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,113
Just let me know, okay?

312
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,602
By the way, Kyon, what's the one thing every
movie has to have before you start shooting?

313
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:48,168
<i>I guess it would be an original idea
and the passion to tell a compelling story.</i>

314
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,860
No, you need a camera.

315
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:52,215
How're we gonna shoot a movie without a camera?

316
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:55,218
I wasn't looking for one of your abstract answers.

317
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:59,255
<i>That's fine, but I didn't wanna give you
an answer that sounded too practical, either.</i>

318
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:00,888
<i>Whatever...</i>

319
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:05,603
Here's what we're doing next: Our mission
is to go find ourselves a video camera!

320
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,226
M-Miss Suzumiya... There's something I have to do,

321
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,543
so c-could I go back to my class?

322
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,712
Shut up and sit down.

323
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:17,393
There's no need to worry!

324
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:19,958
I've yet to find an occasion
when you told us not to worry,

325
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,733
and we really didn't have to worry.

326
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:26,424
Look, it's not like I'm gonna use
your body to pay for that stuff we need.

327
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,699
I just need your help today, that's all.

328
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,085
You're gonna tell us what you need her for.

329
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:35,350
If you don't, Miss Asahina and I
refuse to get outta these chairs to help.

330
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:40,208
We have to go look for sponsors! They'll take us
more seriously if we have the lead actress there.

331
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:43,363
And you're gonna come, too. I
need some help carrying stuff.

332
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,051
<i>It's supposed to be fall now,</i>

333
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,194
<i>but the temperature hasn't cooled off.</i>

334
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:56,190
<i>I guess the planet has finally gone completely insane,</i>

335
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,492
<i>'cause it forgot to switch the
season in Japan over to fall.</i>

336
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:12,141
<i>After we finished walking down the hill, we hopped
on the local line and took it for about three stops.</i>

337
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:16,002
<i>Our destination wasn't too far
from that place with the cherry trees,</i>

338
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:19,107
<i>where Miss Asahina and I had that talk a while ago.</i>

339
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:28,182
We're here!

340
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,783
We are indeed.

341
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,233
<i>I guess this is the store she's
planning on getting all our equipment from.</i>

342
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,719
<i>I wonder how she's gonna do it though.</i>

343
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,376
You guys wait here.

344
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:40,446
I'm gonna go inside and talk to the guy.

345
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:42,391
Here! Hang onto this!

346
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:43,214
Okay.

347
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:53,224
<i>I swear, if Haruhi does anything even remotely suspicious,</i>

348
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,557
<i>I'm gonna grab Miss Asahina and split.</i>

349
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:04,710
<i>I should probably warn that relatively pleasant looking
man that nodding his head at whatever Haruhi's saying...</i>

350
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:07,010
<i>... is a very, very bad idea.</i>

351
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,067
I wonder what she's doing.

352
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:09,853
Dunno.

353
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:13,376
She's probably asking about one of
the high-end digital cameras he's sells.

354
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:16,771
And knowing how she operates, I bet
she's tryin' to get it for nothing, too.

355
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:20,140
<i>She's definitely someone who
would try to do something like that.</i>

356
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,132
<i>She's such a pain.</i>

357
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,324
<i>Haruhi thinks her ideals and opinions are absolute.</i>

358
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:29,100
<i>And sometimes, she even thinks other
people share her warped views about things.</i>

359
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:33,692
<i>Well, actually, that pretty much happens all the
time, so I guess you could say she just doesn't get it.</i>

360
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:37,778
<i>If you wanna go faster than the speed of
light, make sure Haruhi's on your space ship.</i>

361
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,382
<i>She'd just ignore the laws of relativity for you.</i>

362
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,676
Look! I think they finished.

363
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,414
Ta-da!

364
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,292
Our first mission was a success,
and we're right on schedule!

365
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,693
I wanna know how you managed to get
an expensive camera like this for free.

366
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:58,056
I hope you're not doing something
crazy like blackmailing that poor old guy.

367
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:02,488
No way! I just explained our
situation to him, and he gave it to me!

368
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,986
<i>If that's what really happened, tell me what you said.</i>

369
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,008
<i>I want one, too.</i>

370
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,646
All I did was tell him that we wanted to shoot a movie.

371
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,317
Then, he just gave me the camera, no problem.

372
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,809
<i>There's no problem now, but I
have a feeling there will be later.</i>

373
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,207
Oh, stop worrying so much!

374
00:22:17,327 --> 00:22:20,931
All you have to do is be my subordinate
and do whatever I tell you to do.

375
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:25,757
Come on! Let's go to the next store!

376
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:34,670
<i>I was beginning to understand.</i>

377
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,529
<i>Whenever Haruhi pointed at us, she
was actually pointing at Miss Asahina.</i>

378
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:44,609
<i>I think the idea was for Miss Asahina to be
the currency for all the stuff Haruhi was getting.</i>

379
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,407
<i>I wonder if I should tell her.</i>

380
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,704
Ta-da!

381
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:49,942
Now, what'd you get?

382
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:51,350
Weapons!

383
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,315
Here.

384
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:55,293
Ugh, what am I gonna do with these?!

385
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:57,352
We're gonna use 'em for our action scenes.

386
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,442
Nothing's more entertaining
than flashy gun-fighting action!

387
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,143
In fact, I was even thinking we
could blow up a whole building!

388
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,360
Which reminds me, do you know any
place where we can get some dynamite?

389
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:07,976
How 'bout that shop on the corner?

390
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:11,044
How would I know? I'm pretty
sure you can't buy it online though.

391
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,793
What am I supposed to do with all this stuff anyway?

392
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:17,086
It's too late to go back to school
with it now, so just take it home!

393
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,851
Don't forget to bring it to the
club room tomorrow though, okay?

394
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:20,454
Really?

395
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:21,484
Yeah, really.

396
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,704
<i>That's her special SOS Brigade smile,
the one you don't see in class too often.</i>

397
00:23:26,027 --> 00:23:30,685
<i>When I see that smile, I know I'll be doing
damage control after some catastrophe she's caused.</i>

398
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,243
<i>I'm like the Anti-Straw Millionaire!</i>

399
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:35,799
Excuse me?
