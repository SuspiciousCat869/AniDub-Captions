1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:03,046
Do you want me to do anything?

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,206
Nope, not a thing! You're good to go.

3
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:08,619
You can go home now. We're done for today!

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:12,509
<i>You heard what she said.</i>

5
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:15,637
<i>Our Haruhi-esque activities are over for the day.</i>

6
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:20,835
<i>Either through skilled negotiations or outright
blackmail, she managed to score all this stuff.</i>

7
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:23,849
<i>No money changed hands; it was 100% free.</i>

8
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:28,286
<i>There's an old saying: "There's nothing
scarier than something that's free."</i>

9
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:31,999
<i>As far as I can tell, Haruhi isn't afraid of anything.</i>

10
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:35,684
<i>But if anyone out there knows of something
that would scare her, give me a shout.</i>

11
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,271
<i>I wanna know what it is.</i>

12
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,785
Whatcha got there? Presents for all the good little kids?

13
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,282
Yeah, what do ya think?

14
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,358
'Course not.

15
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:19,401
Model guns, right on. Didn't know you were into those.

16
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,772
I'm not, these things belong to Haruhi.

17
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,535
Ohh... Suzumiya's, huh?

18
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,253
Well, guess it must be tough for ya.

19
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,614
That reminds me.

20
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,260
Hm? What's up?

21
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,619
Well, the arts festival is coming up.

22
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,242
I was just wondering what you guys were gonna be doing.

23
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,913
What are you asking me for?

24
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,428
Yeah, like I'm definitely gonna
get a serious answer from Suzumiya.

25
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,733
Nagato doesn't say anything,
so there's no point asking her.

26
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:49,562
Miss Asahina won't come anywhere near me,
and the other guy's kinda creepy, ya know?

27
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,895
I'm outta options, so that's why I'm asking.

28
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,560
Yeah, that's me-- PR guy, nice guy, whatever.

29
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:58,014
You're definitely in the latter category.

30
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:00,719
Well, yeah. I mean, you're so nice,

31
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:04,505
you'd stick with someone even if you knew
they were headed straight for the edge of a cliff.

32
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,372
The typical nice guy.

33
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,331
Okay then, when I find anything
out, you're gonna be the last to know.

34
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,204
Hey!

35
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,393
<i>I already knew that Haruhi's latest path
to fun and adventure was gonna lead nowhere.</i>

36
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,126
<i>I didn't need to be reminded of that.</i>

37
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,558
<i>The thing is, me and Haruhi weren't
the only ones walking down that path.</i>

38
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,379
<i>There were three others who
were shuffling right along with us.</i>

39
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:30,813
<i>Now, I didn't have to worry about two
of them; they'd be okay on their own.</i>

40
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,783
<i>But Miss Asahina wasn't safe.</i>

41
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,518
<i>I mean, you'd think if she was from the future, she
could predict all the crazy stuff she gets put through.</i>

42
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,049
<i>But, since that's not the case,</i>

43
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:42,170
<i>it was up to me to protect her.</i>

44
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,499
What? I'm just helping you get undressed!

45
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:54,436
Stop struggling!

46
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,769
Come on!

47
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:02,600
Come in!

48
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,241
What the?!

49
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,054
Well?

50
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>She looks amazing in that outfit!</i>

51
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,835
<i>I wonder if it's Kyonic.</i>

52
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,510
Hello, everyone!

53
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,859
Oh, pardon me.

54
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,187
Ooh, wow! That looks wonderful on you, really!

55
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:21,768
<i>Yeah, guy, no kidding.</i>

56
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,455
<i>I'm having a hard time understanding
why we've got a waitress here.</i>

57
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,489
This is a club room, not a cafe.

58
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,015
I'll tell you why.

59
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,430
This is the costume Mikuru's
gonna wear in our awesome movie!

60
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:34,171
Really?

61
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,340
Won't the maid outfit you make
her put on work just as well?

62
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,384
Of course not!

63
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,680
A maid provides a more personal service,
usually she's in a big mansion somewhere.

64
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,471
But waitresses are different.

65
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:48,877
They work at restaurants and cafes, and the
services they provide are for the general public.

66
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,517
Yeah, I know the difference.

67
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,390
But that doesn't explain why
Miss Asahina has to wear that.

68
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,099
Oh, you get so hung up on the tiny details.

69
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:58,221
She's dressed like that because it feels right!

70
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,900
Anyway, I'm cool with it.

71
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,216
<i>Okay, but is it cool with Miss Asahina?</i>

72
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:07,611
Well, this feels like it might be a bit too small for me.

73
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,009
I... I can't... I don't...

74
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,136
It's perfect!

75
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:14,375
The fit's perfect, you look
perfect in it, everything's perfect!

76
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,958
<i>No use, she's made up her mind.</i>

77
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:20,914
People! This is gonna be the
concept for our awesome movie!

78
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:26,110
As the director, I've dedicated myself to
providing quality entertainment for the masses!

79
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:30,965
And when the credits roll, everyone will be
on their feet! I'm talking standing ovation!

80
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:47,646
Yes! Yuki! You totally understand, don't you?

81
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,106
Yeah! That's it!

82
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:54,295
<i>Not sure what "it" is, but that has to be her
costume for her class's fortune-telling thing.</i>

83
00:05:54,824 --> 00:06:00,236
<i>At least, that's what I could figure out based on the
answers Nagato gave to Haruhi's rapid-fire questions.</i>

84
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:05,926
<i>Either way, I wonder what she was thinking, walking
all the way over here from class dressed like that.</i>

85
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,724
That costume couldn't be more perfect
for the character I have in mind.

86
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,708
How is that supposed to be perfect?

87
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:14,403
Look!

88
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,189
<i>No way! Is this my fault?</i>

89
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:26,548
You're right, it's perfect!

90
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,344
But then I shouldn't be surprised.

91
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,098
I'd expect nothing less from you, Miss Suzumiya.

92
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:33,291
It's wonderful casting.

93
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,992
<i>Don't smile at me, I'll turn to stone.</i>

94
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,553
<i>Yeah, I hear ya.</i>

95
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,785
Okay, Kyon. I want those guns ready
for some action by the end of the day!

96
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,166
We start shooting tomorrow, so we'll need 'em.

97
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:50,057
Oh! And you have to figure out how to use the camera, too.

98
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:50,725
Got it?

99
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,093
Do you think there's going to be trouble?

100
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,777
When have we ever not had any
trouble with her crazy schemes?

101
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,853
Trouble, he says. Don't make me laugh.

102
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,052
Well, it's not a laughing matter, per se.

103
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:03,802
But there's no reason to worry, either.

104
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,911
How can you be so sure? The parts she's
cast us in are just characters in her movie.

105
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:13,788
I seriously doubt Miss Suzumiya believes
I'm a teenage ESPer. It's just a coincidence.

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,818
It's like this: The Itsuki Koizumi in
the movie is just a character I play.

107
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:23,059
The fact that he's an ESPer, too? Again, coincidence.

108
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,651
And if you're worried about
her putting two and two together,

109
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:30,365
it's hard to believe anyone would
confuse an actor with the role they play.

110
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:34,755
I'm sure some people might, but I
highly doubt Miss Suzumiya is one of them.

111
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,606
Yeah well, that still doesn't
make me feel better about it.

112
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,468
There's no guarantee that what you said is the way it is.

113
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:43,441
If she was the kind of person
who'd mix reality and fiction,

114
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,432
then you can be pretty sure our world
would be much more fantastic than it is.

115
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,357
Consider that for a moment, and you'll see.
Miss Suzumiya is a rational human being, after all.

116
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,825
<i>A rational human being, he says.</i>

117
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,568
<i>Well, thanks to her rational god-like ways,</i>

118
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:03,479
<i>I've had the pleasure of being dragged head-first
into some of the weirdest situations of my young life.</i>

119
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:06,282
<i>Haruhi doesn't even know what she's capable of.</i>

120
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:11,459
Of course, we can't let Miss
Suzumiya find out who we really are.

121
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:16,017
I'm sure at some point, we might very well
have to reveal our true identities to her.

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,467
But now is definitely not the time for it.

123
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:23,410
Thankfully, Miss Asahina and Miss Nagato's
respective groups are in agreement with mine.

124
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,785
To be honest, I wouldn't mind if
things just stayed they way they were.

125
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,449
Then that makes two of us.

126
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,487
I'm not too crazy about seeing the world go to pieces.

127
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,760
If I might make a suggestion, you should
stop worrying so much about the world.

128
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,851
You should be more worried about yourself.

129
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:42,484
If necessary, there are others
who can replace Miss Nagato and I.

130
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:45,048
However, there is no understudy for you.

131
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,483
Man! All this festival crap pisses me off!

132
00:08:58,618 --> 00:08:59,340
Why?

133
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:04,647
Every time I turn around, I'm seeing people having
a blast. I'm like the only one not having any fun.

134
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,707
And seeing all the couples is the worst.

135
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,165
I'm gonna kill somebody!

136
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,208
<i>Jealousy rears its ugly head.</i>

137
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,743
What does our class wanna do? A freaking survey!

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,569
Lame!

139
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:19,242
If you've got a better idea, why didn't
you say something when you had the chance?

140
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:23,302
<i>If you had, maybe Haruhi wouldn't
have come up with this movie idea.</i>

141
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,708
Yeah! No thanks!

142
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,089
I don't wanna be in charge of putting it all together!

143
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,631
Yeah... I wish Miss Asakura were still here.

144
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,696
She'd do it.

145
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,793
I know.

146
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,858
She was double A+!

147
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,455
It really sucks she had to transfer out of school.

148
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,968
I wonder if it's too late for me to change classes.

149
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,399
Which one would you wanna go to? Are
you thinkin' about Miss Nagato's class?

150
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:48,657
Hang on, I just remembered! I saw her walkin'
around in some kinda witch costume yesterday.

151
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:49,743
What was that about?

152
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,898
Yeah, like I'd know. Sorry, pal.

153
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,359
I just remembered!

154
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:57,350
That time I walked in on you and her
all tangled up on the classroom floor.

155
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:58,944
That was nothing.

156
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:03,052
Yeah, I know. It was just something
Suzumiya cooked up or something, right?

157
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,205
Oh... Yeah...

158
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:09,282
<i>Taniguchi's complete and utter
misunderstanding of that day gave me some relief.</i>

159
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:12,840
<i>Thanks, Taniguchi. Your stupidity will save the world.</i>

160
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,711
Man... This is boring...

161
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,975
Okay, people! Let's shoot a movie!

162
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:20,367
This is sudden.

163
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,858
I looked all over the school for a good location.

164
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,696
But nothing worked, so we'll have to find some place else.

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,890
Come on, Mikuru! Get ready!

166
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,345
Um, do I really have to go too?

167
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,952
Well, yeah... We can't shoot
anything without our lead actress!

168
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:37,836
Uh, okay, but... do I have to wear this outside?

169
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,915
You sure do!

170
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:43,056
Can't I at least wear a jacket over this?

171
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:46,452
No! The more you think about it,
the more nervous you're gonna get.

172
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,779
How do you expect to win the Golden
Globe if you're behaving like this?

173
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:53,530
<i>I thought we were trying to be the
#1 event of the festival or something.</i>

174
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,268
Oh, yeah! Yuki!

175
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,366
Here! Hang onto this!

176
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:01,460
I changed your character into an
evil alien witch. So, what do you think?

177
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,397
<i>She's already rewriting the script!</i>

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,996
<i>I guess Nagato's powers could
be considered magical, though.</i>

179
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,214
Come on, Kyon! Get the camera ready!

180
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,734
Right! Let's shoot a movie!

181
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:15,821
Here we go!

182
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,837
God help us. She looks like she's serious.

183
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,891
Huh?! The heck's that?!

184
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:31,836
Hey, Haruhi, wait a sec.

185
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:37,080
It's just... I don't think it's a good idea for
these two to get on the train dressed like this.

186
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,076
I don't see anything wrong with it.

187
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,361
There definitely is!

188
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:47,146
Uh-uh! If they were butt-naked, then yeah, they'd
get arrested, but they're both wearing clothes.

189
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:50,149
Or maybe, you'd prefer the bunny-girl outfit!

190
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,110
Oh, you shoulda said so earlier.

191
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:56,075
<i>After going to all the trouble to find this
waitress costume, I'm shocked to hear you say that!</i>

192
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:59,675
Wait, didn't you say her being a
waitress was part of the concept?

193
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,376
Right now, what's important is your
ability to adapt to the situation.

194
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:06,814
Adaptability is how all life
on this planet evolved, right?

195
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,572
And if you don't evolve, you're gonna get left behind.

196
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:13,624
<i>Then if the planet were sentient, it would
have chucked Haruhi way out into space by now.</i>

197
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,975
Look! The train's here!

198
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,978
Come on, Mikuru! Stop stalling!

199
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:24,239
Hey, there! We're here!

200
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,876
Oh, and right on time, I see.

201
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,243
Is this the same girl from yesterday?

202
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,826
I didn't recognize her.

203
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,026
Okay then, you better get to it!

204
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,837
Just leave everything to us!

205
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,554
All right, people!

206
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,541
We're gonna have a quick meeting, so gather 'round.

207
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:45,505
Here's the deal, we're gonna shoot a commercial!

208
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:56,717
Hi... Um, this store is neat, and the
owner's a really friendly person, too...

209
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,927
H-He's a really nice guy, too!

210
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:06,077
And, um, they've been in business a long
time, ever since Mr. Eijiro's grandpa opened it.

211
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:10,541
It's all right here, from batteries
to refrigerators, they have it all!

212
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:16,449
And, um... Anyway, come on down to Ohmori
Electronics, where good deals are made every day!

213
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,636
Okay! Cut it!

214
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:24,993
I'm just not feeling the emotion in this scene. The
vibe's all wrong, but I'm not sure how to tweak it.

215
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,529
Mama, what's that?

216
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:29,022
Shh, those are crazy people.

217
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:30,315
I've got it!

218
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,092
<i>Oh, for the love of God, please don't "get" anything else!</i>

219
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,040
A waitress doesn't belong outside an electronics store!

220
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,295
<i>That's what you "got"?!</i>

221
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,033
Gimme that small bag over there, Koizumi. I need it.

222
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:41,560
Right.

223
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,993
<i>"Give me a camera and I'll put a commercial
for your store in the middle of the movie!"</i>

224
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,067
<i>"Sounds good!"</i>

225
00:13:47,219 --> 00:13:49,441
<i>That's the conversation Haruhi and the owner had.</i>

226
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:51,309
<i>Cut down to five seconds, though.</i>

227
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,972
C'mere, Mikuru!

228
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:56,122
What a relief!

229
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:59,102
Doesn't look like I'm gonna get any lines in this today.

230
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:05,420
You see, I'm also supposed to be acting in my
class's stage production for the arts festival.

231
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:08,717
Thing is, I've having a little
trouble remembering my lines.

232
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:09,846
You don't say...

233
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:14,018
I'd actually prefer it if the role I'm playing
in the movie didn't have too much dialogue.

234
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:17,034
I know! What if you took over the lead role for me?

235
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,895
Haruhi's the one to talk to about the casting decisions.

236
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,587
If you want to switch with me,
you should probably talk to her.

237
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:26,434
Do you honestly think I'm capable
of doing something so frightening?

238
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:29,651
After all, these are Miss Suzumiya's orders.

239
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:34,236
Imagine the consequences if I disobeyed
her. That's something I don't wanna think about.

240
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,260
That makes two of us then.

241
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:39,846
Now you know why I'm just standing
here, biting my lip and running the camera.

242
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:40,965
We're back!

243
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:43,889
<i>Whoa!</i>

244
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:48,816
<i>It's the return of Miss Asahina's greatest
costume ever! The flawless bunny girl!</i>

245
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,628
<i>Last time I saw her in that was six months ago.</i>

246
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,664
<i>So much has happened since then.</i>

247
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,608
<i>Looking back, they're all such fond memories now.</i>

248
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,255
<i>Yeah! Like hell they are!</i>

249
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,820
Okay! Now that's much better!

250
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:05,758
There's nothing like a hot bunny girl to sell a product!

251
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,075
Get ready! We're gonna take it from the top!

252
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,796
Kyon, fire up the camera.

253
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:12,727
Take two's up!

254
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,362
<i>Anyway, we wrapped the commercial
for the electronics store.</i>

255
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,153
<i>Our day wasn't over though. If you
recall, there was another sponsor we visited.</i>

256
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,415
<i>We were trudging over there right now.</i>

257
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:31,150
Okay, Mikuru, you ready?

258
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,785
Do it just like before. There wasn't
anything wrong with your performance.

259
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,461
<i>Everything was wrong with it!</i>

260
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:38,765
And... action!

261
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:44,360
Ah... I'm standing here in front
of Keiji Yamatsuchi's Model Shop.

262
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:47,958
He opened it last year after
quitting his dead-end corporate job!

263
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:52,811
And... models were his hobby, so
he figured why not open a store?

264
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,513
Unfortunately, his sales have been down for a while...

265
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:05,527
And... compared to last year, his first-half
earnings for this year are down about 80%...

266
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:08,940
And so, everyone should come
down here and buy lots of models!

267
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:09,816
Thank you!

268
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,663
Huh? You want me to hold it?

269
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:24,862
Y-You should never shoot this
while pointing it at other people.

270
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,105
You should only shoot empty cans with it.

271
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,962
Huh? You want me to shoot?

272
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,915
And... cut it!

273
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:37,550
Not too shabby for a day of shooting.

274
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,791
But get ready 'cause tomorrow, we start on the movie!

275
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,464
We've already got 15 minutes
worth of commercials in the camera.

276
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,509
How long is this movie supposed to be?!

277
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:50,302
We'll just shoot as much footage as we
can, and then figure it out when we edit.

278
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,677
Cutting it together on the computer should be a snap!

279
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,775
<i>And who's gonna be doing all this "snapping"?</i>

280
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:58,349
<i>I have a feeling "editor" was one of
the jobs that was listed under my name.</i>

281
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:02,993
Tomorrow's Saturday and there's no
school, so I want everyone to show up on time.

282
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,684
We'll meet at Kitaguchi Station at 9 am.

283
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:10,944
Hang on a sec, Haruhi. Don't you think you should
maybe do something about Miss Asahina's costume?

284
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:15,136
There's gotta be something else should could wear
that's a little more... appropriate for fighting.

285
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,740
Maybe something like a plug-suit or a stealth suit.

286
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,910
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Then there would be no
surprise when she actually started fighting!

287
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,139
I want the audience to freak out when this
timid little waitress starts kicking butt!

288
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:29,679
It gets their attention!

289
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,783
That's what a concept's all about!

290
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:34,961
<i>I wonder if she even understands
the meaning of the word "concept."</i>

291
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,510
<i>Thanks for explaining what a concept's about.</i>

292
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,636
We all know she's from the future,
but why's it so important to the story?

293
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,919
Uh... That is--I-- I mean her character!

294
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:46,348
Her character doesn't have to
be from the future, does she?

295
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:47,300
Don't worry.

296
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:51,001
Those are details we can figure out
when we get to that point in the story.

297
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:54,243
And, if we can't figure something out, we just ignore it.

298
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,017
As long as it's entertaining, it's gonna be cool!

299
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,575
<i>But for that to work, it's gotta
be entertaining in the first place!</i>

300
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,990
There's no point in making this if
you're the only being entertained!

301
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:08,610
Are you trying to get a Golden
Raspberry for amateur film-making?!

302
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:09,605
Are you kidding?

303
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,194
We've only got one goal: To be the #1
event in the arts festival this year.

304
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,105
And after that, we're aimin' for the Golden Globes, too!

305
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:20,156
Show me the script then. I
wanna see how it's coming along.

306
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:25,368
Don't worry about that. I've
got all that stuff right up here.

307
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:28,492
The script and the storyboards are
done, and they're all ready to go!

308
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:29,182
See?

309
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,285
You don't have to do any thinking!

310
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,013
<i>If that's the way you want it.</i>

311
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,427
<i>You don't have to do any thinking either.</i>

312
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,877
<i>Sit and stare out the window for all I care.</i>

313
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:43,368
<i>You could be as cute as Miss Asahina if you could
just figure out how to be more pleasant to deal with.</i>

314
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:44,799
Hm? What?

315
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,944
It's nothing.

316
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:48,757
Okay, guys, let's get fired up for tomorrow!

317
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:52,203
The only way to grab the glory
is to have a positive attitude!

318
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:56,586
When you free yourself from the stuff that holds
you back, your hidden strengths will be revealed!

319
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,802
Then, you'll be able to tap into unimaginable powers!

320
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:03,243
<i>You sound like a character in a
manga unleashing a counter-attack.</i>

321
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:06,677
Look! It's a balloon!

322
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:07,797
<i>The next day,</i>

323
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:13,004
<i>we were about to find ourselves thrown into the
middle of some totally bizarre situation that...</i>

324
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,521
<i>Wait, I lost my train of thought.</i>

325
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,165
<i>What did Haruhi say again?</i>

326
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:21,620
<i>Something like, "When you free yourself
from the stuff that's holding you back,</i>

327
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,855
<i>your hidden strengths will be revealed,
and you'll tap into unimaginable powers."</i>

328
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:29,493
<i>Yeah, but Haruhi, you did it.</i>

329
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,377
<i>You have that kind of power.</i>

330
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:34,100
<i>You just can't ever find out about it.</i>

331
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:36,544
You're late again!

332
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,885
It's not even 9:00 yet.

333
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,483
You're the last to show up.

334
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:43,150
As punishment, you're gonna pay for lunch!

335
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:44,795
Yeah, whatever.

336
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,499
I have decided to cover everyone's bus fare.

337
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,443
It's a necessary expense.

338
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:56,985
Thank you.

339
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,789
Oh, yeah! I need to put this on!

340
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:03,253
You're wearing your uniform on Saturdays now?

341
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,977
She told me yesterday I had to wear it.

342
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:07,535
It's for my part.

343
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:10,927
Since I'm supposed to be an ESPer
disguised as an ordinary high school student,

344
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:12,982
the uniform is essential to the character.

345
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,678
So you're just playing yourself.

346
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:16,164
There, that should do it.

347
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:18,593
Okay, guys, the bus stop's over there!

348
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,094
Come on, Kyon! Hurry up!

349
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:26,385
<i>After half an hour of rattling around on a bus,</i>

350
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,010
<i>and another half hour of walking, we ended up
at a location that could only be described as...</i>

351
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,996
<i>...the place where no one ever goes.</i>

352
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:35,452
Man, it's hot. It's hot.

353
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:38,173
Would you like some?

354
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,960
I hope you don't mind, I drank out of it first.

355
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:43,042
Thanks! I'll totally have some!

356
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,135
You can have a drink later, got it?

357
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,612
That goes for you, too!

358
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:53,132
You don't have time to be givin' the PAs a
drink when we've got so much work to do today!

359
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,501
As soon as the camera comes out, we shoot!

360
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,260
Get changed!

361
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:57,543
But I...

362
00:20:57,636 --> 00:21:01,410
No one's gonna see you... Just
go behind a tree or something!

363
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,057
Uh, thank you!

364
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:07,677
Hey, no peeking!

365
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:08,759
I wouldn't dare.

366
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,909
Ta-da! It's a colored contact!

367
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:17,702
It's super important for any self-respecting
heroine to have different colored eyes.

368
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,766
If one eye's different, it
enhances the character's mystique!

369
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:23,077
Besides, it's symbolic, so there!

370
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,236
It's all about the secret behind her blue eye!

371
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:30,824
Okay... But it wouldn't really make sense if her
eyes were different colors for no reason, right?

372
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:32,547
So, what's the secret?

373
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,509
It's still a secret!

374
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:38,513
Come on, Mikuru. Now's not the
time for you to get cold feet!

375
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:42,343
Oh, come on, Mikuru!

376
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,589
Don't be so shy, keep running!

377
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,534
Get into the character! Become the heroine!

378
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:52,090
Let's try it one more time from the top, okay?

379
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,709
<i>So... It looks like this is our opening sequence, folks.</i>

380
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,116
<i>I was expecting to see a script
or at least a treatment by now.</i>

381
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,380
<i>But Haruhi said there wasn't gonna be one.</i>

382
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,452
If I wrote it down and it got leaked,
it would be the worst thing ever!

383
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,177
<i>That's the reason she gave.</i>

384
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,486
<i>I wonder when this turned into a Hong Kong production.</i>

385
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,154
Okay! Hit me one more time!

386
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,853
Just like you did in take three!

387
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,326
Next up, we got the fight scene between Mikuru and Yuki!

388
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,702
Mikuru, empty your clips into Yuki, okay?

389
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:28,603
What? But I thought you weren't
supposed to shoot anyone with these.

390
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:32,493
No, it's okay! I doubt that you're
even gonna hit her, so just fire away!

391
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,589
Besides, Yuki can dodge the
pellets if they get too close to her!

392
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,107
Go on.

393
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,773
Shoot me.

394
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,565
See? She's cool with it!

395
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,451
Light her up!

396
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:48,220
Oh, but don't fire them at the same time. Alternate.
It's the basic technique of two-gun shoot-outs!

397
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:58,977
Yeah, sure, I guess that'll work.

398
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,468
Can I say something?

399
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:03,014
This doesn't seem like a movie.

400
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,402
I have no idea what's going on or anything.

401
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,396
Don't worry.

402
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:10,069
It'll all come together in editing after
a little cutting and pasting, you'll see.

403
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,905
And who's gonna be doing all
this "cutting and pasting," huh?

404
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,486
You could at least put some dialogue in the movie.

405
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:19,660
It's okay. We'll take out the
sound and stick the dialogue in later.

406
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,995
I wanna put in some cool sound effects and music anyway.

407
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:26,116
Don't think so hard, just go with the flow.

408
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,483
<i>Yeah, well, since the story's all in your head,
I guess there's nothing for us to think about...</i>

409
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,412
<i>...even if we wanted to.</i>
