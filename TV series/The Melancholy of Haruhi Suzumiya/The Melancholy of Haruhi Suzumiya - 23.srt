1
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:14,942
Well, here we are!

2
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,771
<i>Doesn't that mean we shouldn't be going in?</i>

3
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:22,562
<i>Even little kids would avoid shooting in a spot like this.</i>

4
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,987
<i>Except for the stupid ones, that is.</i>

5
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,364
Don't just stand there.

6
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,429
Hurry up and climb over already!

7
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:30,843
<i>Oops, forgot. She's really stupid.</i>

8
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,035
Come on, Mikuru. Hurry up!

9
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:40,783
The fence is rather high; it might be
too difficult for everyone to climb over.

10
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,690
Would you have a solution for us?

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,375
Wow, that gate's gotta be really old...

12
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,020
Am I gonna have to play a sea monster or somethin'?

13
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:57,078
The lake didn't always have this fence around it.

14
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:59,303
You know, people used to fall in a lot.

15
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,610
<i>Thank god, they're all so clueless.</i>

16
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,730
There. That'll do the trick.

17
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:14,098
So this is the scene where
Mikuru gets cornered by the baddie.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,084
She can't use her beam 'cause Yuki neutralized it.

19
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:19,345
Well, the cue cards are done.

20
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,194
Here, hang onto this for me, kid.

21
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:21,979
Huh?!

22
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:23,875
Mikuru, are you ready?

23
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:26,302
Yes.

24
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,402
Come on, louder!

25
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,031
Yes!

26
00:01:28,437 --> 00:01:29,790
<i>I feel your pain.</i>

27
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,465
Okay! Here we go!

28
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:34,031
And... action!

29
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:39,777
E-E-Even in times like this, I won't ever run away!

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,999
Y-You're an evil bad alien...

31
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:46,617
And... now, you better leave this planet at once!

32
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:47,395
Cut!

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,152
For he is very valuable to us, you see.

34
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,635
And while we're seizing him and his
hidden powers, we will also invade the Earth.

35
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:55,396
Cut!

36
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,819
I-I won't let you get away with that!

37
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:00,179
I will risk my own life to stop you!

38
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:00,810
Cut!

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,726
See? You're startin' to get the hang of it!

40
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,675
Good job!

41
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,202
Okay, c'mere a sec.

42
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:09,204
I gotta talk to you about the next shot.

43
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,920
Okay...

44
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:17,394
<i>I hope we get out of here soon, before
anybody in the neighborhood notices we're here.</i>

45
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,216
So that's your video camera, huh?

46
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,331
I betcha got a lotta goofy shots of Mikuru on there.

47
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:28,685
<i>I don't see what's so funny.</i>

48
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,832
<i>There's a lot of damaging stuff in there.</i>

49
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,959
<i>What if Miss Asahina stops coming to school because of it?</i>

50
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:35,040
We're back!

51
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:37,556
And we're gonna be kickin' things up a notch!

52
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:38,578
Check it out!

53
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:39,605
Cool, huh?

54
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,217
<i>Oh god, no!</i>

55
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,533
<i>It's gonna be a repeat of what happened yesterday!</i>

56
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:45,762
This is bad!

57
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,482
Go ahead, Mikuru.

58
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,710
I don't care what comes outta that miracle Mikuru IR.

59
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,026
Whatever it is, make sure it's destructive!

60
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh, come on, Yuki! You're supposed to be an evil witch!

61
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:03,016
Stop whipping out the wrestling moves!

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,579
Well, I guess this works, too.

63
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,274
Whatever gets more viewers.

64
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:12,014
Hey, Kyon! Why aren't you rolling?
This is Yuki's concept! Don't waste it!

65
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,243
<i>It's not a concept.</i>

66
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:15,954
<i>This is racy stuff...</i>

67
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,385
<i>I shouldn't be shooting this, but... Put
the target in the center and hit record.</i>

68
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,901
<i>No, I mustn't, I mustn't.</i>

69
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,165
You better leave this planet at once!

70
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:34,477
Oh, geez! I can't believe we lost another contact!

71
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,687
My mistake.

72
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:38,552
I disabled the laser function she had access to.

73
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:42,361
However, a high-frequency molecular cutter was activated.

74
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:49,073
That looks like damage from a mono-filament attack.

75
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,176
Oh, no!

76
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,297
I'm really sorry about that.

77
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:55,521
But, um... what did you inject me with this time?

78
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,810
I altered the phase of your dimensional cycles,

79
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,737
and generated a force field around your body,

80
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:06,196
which alters gravitational waves.

81
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,846
I understand.

82
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:10,545
For the time being, it looks like it's been taken care of.

83
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,910
Yep, still don't get it.

84
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:16,558
As for what happened to the fence, the others
seem to think it was old and falling apart.

85
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,170
And thankfully, it was the only thing that got damaged.

86
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:21,725
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?

87
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:23,652
I mean, if we keep shooting this thing,

88
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,959
I'm scared that something really bad's gonna happen.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,006
Regardless, we can't interfere
with the completion of the film.

90
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:33,618
Can you imagine what Miss Suzumiya would do
if we tried to force her to stop shooting it?

91
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,422
I don't care.

92
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:38,765
I guarantee, she wouldn't be happy at all.

93
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:41,695
A closed space would be torn apart by the Shinjin.

94
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:46,204
You have to understand, Miss
Suzumiya's having so much fun,

95
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,802
she just can't help herself.

96
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,885
And in a way, this is a chance for her to play god.

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,177
The process of putting the movie together
is Miss Suzumiya's way of creating a world,

98
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,326
that functions according to her will.

99
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,333
<i>Selfish as ever, I see.</i>

100
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,656
Of course, Miss Suzumiya doesn't
realize any of this is happening.

101
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:06,311
She thinks she's creating a fictional
world for the story of her movie.

102
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:10,123
However, I believe that subconsciously,

103
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:15,139
she's so passionate about it, she's actually
starting to change the reality of this world.

104
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,550
<i>Fiction, he says.</i>

105
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:19,165
Either way you slice it, we get a bad ending.

106
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,030
If we have to choose between stopping
the shoot or seeing it through to the end,

107
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,935
I would strongly recommend we finish it.

108
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,642
Even if Miss Asahina turns into some kind of super woman?

109
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:34,810
Compared to having the Shinjin
appear, it's a small price to pay.

110
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,968
Think about it.

111
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,911
Wouldn't it be easier to deal with
abnormal phenomena one at a time,

112
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,684
as opposed to having the world rebuilt
from scratch right under your feet?

113
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,353
If you ask me, it's all pretty
much the same thing, isn't it?

114
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,777
Here's another option for us to consider:

115
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:54,103
We could knock Haruhi out cold and
wake her up after the festival's over.

116
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,270
That's a frightening thought to consider.

117
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:59,909
But if you're prepared to take
responsibility for the outcome,

118
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,720
I wouldn't get in your way.

119
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,306
I don't think my shoulders can
handle the weight of the world.

120
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,867
I don't want you to worry about me.

121
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,496
I'll be okay and find a way to get through this.

122
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:19,327
<i>I am in awe of her selflessness!</i>

123
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:22,005
These are the characters you guys play.

124
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,188
Here's the deal,

125
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,998
since Mikuru's the hero, she doesn't
believe in hurting innocent people.

126
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:31,094
Yuki takes advantage of this and uses
her magic to get you guys to attack her.

127
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:34,104
Since Mikuru wouldn't hurt you guys, she gets beaten up!

128
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,460
Mikuru's gonna get beaten up!

129
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:38,527
Here's what you do!

130
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,593
The three of you are gonna
throw Mikuru right into the lake!

131
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:45,629
Wait a second, you wanna throw her in there?

132
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,012
The water might be warm but it's cold out!

133
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,229
Besides, that water's pretty filthy!

134
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,485
B-But Miss Suzumiya, couldn't we do this at a pool?

135
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,806
No one said this shoot was gonna be easy.

136
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,506
So suck it up already!

137
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:03,886
You have to make these kinds of sacrifices, especially
if they're gonna help us get the realism we're after!

138
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,110
You can't let something like this stand
in your way! You have to overcome it!

139
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,496
This is a big step up for you as an actress!

140
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:11,734
See what I'm saying?

141
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,062
Good! Get ready!

142
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,141
Hang on!

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,678
I-I'll... Okay! I'll do it!

144
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:29,821
Thatta girl!

145
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:30,702
Yes!

146
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,975
That's why I picked you to be a brigade member!

147
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:36,581
<i>Miss Asahina...</i>

148
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,646
One, two, three!

149
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:44,257
<i>Heaven protect her.</i>

150
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:46,536
What's happening? Just grab my hand. It's okay.

151
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:53,344
<i>Good grief!</i>

152
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:56,050
<i>We've got enough crap here to open up a pawn shop,</i>

153
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:57,761
<i>but we don't have a towel for her?</i>

154
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:59,058
<i>What's up with that?</i>

155
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:02,397
<i>This could work for the scene where they meet.</i>

156
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:05,477
You can feel the awkwardness between Itsuki and Mikuru.

157
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,243
<i>Really?</i>

158
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,089
<i>Looked like Koizumi was just acting like he always does.</i>

159
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,659
We're moving on to the next setup!

160
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:17,486
It's the scene right after Itsuki saves Mikuru,
where he picks her up and carries her back to his house.

161
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,513
Hang on!

162
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:21,586
That makes absolutely no sense at all!

163
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,145
What happened to Nagato, Taniguchi, and the others?!

164
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:27,785
The audience is gonna get totally lost
if they just disappear from the story!

165
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,054
Oh, be quiet!

166
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,485
The audience is gonna be so wrapped up
in the story, they'll be fine with it!

167
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:33,518
No they won't!

168
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:36,022
You just wanna see Miss Asahina get tossed in the lake!

169
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:40,344
My house isn't too far from here,
and Mikuru looks like she's freezing.

170
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:44,078
Is it cool if she changes clothes?
'Cause she might end up catching a cold!

171
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,652
That's a great idea! Can we use
your house for our next location?

172
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:52,198
It's the perfect place to shoot the scene
where they get all friendly with each other!

173
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,661
Yep! Go ahead, knock yourself out!

174
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,502
Uh, what do you want us to do?

175
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,448
You can go home. I'm done with you.

176
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,596
<i>Congratulations, you guys have been sacked.</i>

177
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:06,020
<i>It looks like you're about as important
to Haruhi as a bunch of spent BBs.</i>

178
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:09,240
<i>Which isn't such a bad thing, if you wanna know the truth.</i>

179
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,640
Ta-da! Here it is!

180
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:12,902
<i>Ginormous!</i>

181
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:17,831
<i>What sorts of evil things do I have
to do to live in a place like this?</i>

182
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,027
So anyway, this is my room!

183
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,795
You guys can wait here till Mikuru's done with her bath.

184
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,318
Whoa, this place makes my bedroom look like a cat condo.

185
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:28,595
Great room!

186
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,532
This is a perfect location!

187
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:31,503
Oh, yeah!

188
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,447
Hey, Tsuru, I wanted to ask you something.

189
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:35,547
When you get the...

190
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:44,048
Sorry to keep you waiting!

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,136
Here you go.

192
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:46,264
Thank you!

193
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:47,687
Thanks for waiting.

194
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,323
Sorry I took so long.

195
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,575
Here you go!

196
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,486
<i>Am I being tested here or something?!</i>

197
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,777
<i>Miss Asahina, that outfit is absolutely criminal!</i>

198
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:58,554
Here you go! Drink up!

199
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:01,420
Thanks.

200
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,134
Thank you.

201
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:08,290
Watching her take a sip is
another direct hit to my libido!

202
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:10,343
Okay, let's knock this one out!

203
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:12,427
<i>And with that, we started shooting.</i>

204
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:17,440
<i>In the shot, Koizumi carried the
pretending-to-be-unconscious Miss Asahina into the room.</i>

205
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:21,834
<i>For some unknown and convenient reason,
there was a futon spread out on the floor.</i>

206
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:24,371
Go, Mikuru, start waking up.

207
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:26,824
Are you awake now?

208
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,012
Yes...

209
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,874
But, um... I don't know where I am.

210
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,284
You're in my room now.

211
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:36,899
Thank you for taking care of me.

212
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:38,668
<i>She seems a little too sexy.</i>

213
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,615
<i>Is that acting?</i>

214
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,230
Bring your faces closer together.

215
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,092
Yeah!

216
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,042
Now, Mikuru, close your eyes.

217
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,048
Koizumi, put your arm around her!

218
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:50,132
All right, now push her down and kiss her!

219
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,867
Hold it!

220
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:04,402
This is going too far! Why is
this scene happening anyway?!

221
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:05,475
What is this?!

222
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,714
It's a love scene, of course.

223
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:10,564
We have to have one to pat out the picture's run-time.

224
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:11,767
You're crazy!

225
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,355
Are we shooting a movie for late-night TV or what?!

226
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,930
And why are you suddenly getting into it, Koizumi?!

227
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:19,127
If this thing ever screens at the school festival,

228
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:23,163
I guarantee you're gonna get a ton of hate
mail crammed in your shoe locker the next day!

229
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,862
I'll even write some myself!

230
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:28,088
Mikuru, you're so weird!

231
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,542
<i>Normally, I'd disagree,</i>

232
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,750
<i>but she is acting a little strange.</i>

233
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,736
<i>Her eyes are all glazed over, and her cheeks are flushed.</i>

234
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:37,701
<i>She looks like she'd let Koizumi do whatever he wants!</i>

235
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,447
<i>This isn't funny anymore!</i>

236
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:44,295
Hey... Koizumi, I feel hot... and my head's all heavy...

237
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,344
<i>Geez, it's like somebody drugged her or something.</i>

238
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:55,011
Sorry, I sorta spiked her juice with a little bit of sake.

239
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,894
I was told it would help her loosen up and act better.

240
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,579
It's not right to get people loaded like that!

241
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,691
Just look at her, she's sexier now than ever before!

242
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,035
Don't listen to him, kiss her! Go ahead!

243
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,497
Kiss her right on the mouth!

244
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:13,920
Don't do it, Koizumi.

245
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,522
Madam Director...

246
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,072
I hate to say it, but I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.

247
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:26,124
Besides, it looks like Miss
Asahina's reached her limit, too.

248
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,421
Nah... I feel fine... Let's keep shouting...

249
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:31,970
Aw, geez! This won't do...

250
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:39,647
Man, I can't believe you'd get so
plastered from just a little sake.

251
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,721
<i>I can't believe you made her drink it!</i>

252
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,595
Come on, snap out of it!

253
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,759
You call that a reaction?

254
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:52,542
Whenever I tap you on the head with this
thing, you have to straighten out your back.

255
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,630
That's the rule!

256
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:57,260
Let's try it again, okay? Now focus!

257
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:10,498
Cut it out!

258
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,618
How is that supposed to help?!

259
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:14,819
And how is any of this gonna fit in the movie?!

260
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,835
Huh?! What's your problem?

261
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:20,340
I don't have to tell you how I'm
gonna use this, that's my business!

262
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,511
You can't tell me because you have no idea!

263
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,123
Stop making excuses!

264
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,043
Yeah! Like you know anything!

265
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,875
You don't even know what this movie's about!

266
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,616
How dare you make selfish demands?!

267
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,667
You're the one who's being selfish here!

268
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,920
You're just hitting Miss Asahina because you want to!

269
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,519
How dare you treat her like that?!

270
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,043
Don't you talk to me like that!

271
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,413
Who do you think you are?!

272
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,247
This is called "story" and it's important for my movie!

273
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,044
Get it now?!

274
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,382
It's not important!

275
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,139
Know what?! This sucks!

276
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,014
Miss Asahina is not your toy!

277
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,936
Shut up! It's important to me!

278
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,526
And I can treat her like a toy if I want to!

279
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,674
Wha-What is it?!

280
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,757
What is your problem anyway, huh?!

281
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:19,759
You just have to do what I tell you!

282
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:22,619
I'm the brigade leader! I'm the director!

283
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:30,454
Whatever! Do what I say or get out!

284
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:38,748
Let go, Koizumi!

285
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:43,238
I don't care if it's a person or an animal, if
they won't listen, they deserved to be smacked!

286
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,050
If she doesn't learn her lesson now,

287
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:47,733
she's gonna grow up to be some kind of lonely freak!

288
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,989
Stop it! Don't!

289
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,058
Stop fighting... Stop it!

290
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,450
Or else... Never-mind, it's classified anyway...

291
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,763
I'm sorry, Kyon. I got a little carried away.

292
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,562
You don't have to worry about Mikuru.

293
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,872
I'll take her home or have her stay the night.

294
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:30,057
I always thought of you as being
more rational than you were back there.

295
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,026
Yeah, so did I.

296
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:34,885
The good news is that closed space hasn't appeared.

297
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,277
It looks like Miss Suzumiya's subconscious
was able to control itself this time.

298
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:41,283
Awesome. Less work for you.

299
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:43,690
By the way, if you're free,

300
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:45,579
there's a place I'd like to take you to.

301
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,843
And what if I said no?

302
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:50,364
I don't think this should take too long.

303
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,655
Do you remember what Miss Suzumiya said yesterday?

304
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:59,818
How am I supposed to remember
all the crazy stuff she says?

305
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:03,553
When you see this, I'm sure it'll come back to you.

306
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,885
I think they've been like that ever since this morning.

307
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:14,440
Did someone come out here and paint 'em all or something?

308
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,065
No, that's the natural coloring of their feathers.

309
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,290
There's no mistaking it.

310
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,730
Well, maybe all the gunfire
yesterday scared the heck out of 'em.

311
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:23,819
Even if that were really the case,

312
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,972
do you think this is what would happen?

313
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:27,831
Yeah, I know.

314
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:30,804
It would be so awesome if the pigeons were all white,

315
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,329
but I guess it doesn't matter what color they are.

316
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,650
Apparently, it did.

317
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:38,016
Here's my perspective on the situation.

318
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,542
Miss Suzumiya's special.

319
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:44,302
However, at one point, she was given her
godlike powers by someone or something else.

320
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,680
Ultimately, she's just an ordinary
human being, as opposed to a divine being.

321
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:51,071
Her presence in this world is proof of that.

322
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,184
Well, that's a new spin on things.

323
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,059
Correct me if I'm wrong,

324
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,096
but didn't you say something
before about how Haruhi was a god?

325
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,866
Really? Did I say that?

326
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:01,229
Don't mess with me.

327
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,280
Of course I'm only kidding.

328
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,574
Miss Suzumiya is the one who
can create the world around us.

329
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,018
And at the same time, she can destroy it.

330
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:13,775
Perhaps the reality we're currently in
isn't working as efficiently as it should.

331
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,027
And perhaps the only person who has the
power to fix this failed world of ours...

332
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,719
is the one we've come to know as Miss Suzumiya.

333
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:21,913
Yeah, sure.

334
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,160
Consider this:

335
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,053
If she's creating all this strange phenomena
to fix whatever's wrong with the world,

336
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,374
then our attempts at covering it up might
be preventing that change from taking place.

337
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,247
Humph. So what?

338
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,728
It means we could be in a lot of trouble, that's what.

339
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:40,948
When Miss Suzumiya changes this world
to a version that's functioning properly,

340
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:45,659
do you think there would still be a
need for us and our special abilities?

341
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:49,830
Or, will we be considered the
bugs in the program and exterminated?

342
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,005
Who knows?

343
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:54,815
Honestly, with all its faults,

344
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:56,480
I like the world the way it is.

345
00:17:56,944 --> 00:18:00,078
It's been built piece by piece
by so many different people,

346
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,332
from ancient times to the present.

347
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,442
If I had my way, I wouldn't
change a single thing about it.

348
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,503
That's why I do what I can about Miss
Suzumiya and the situations she puts us in.

349
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:14,714
I wonder if this world is really worth
all the trouble you're going through.

350
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:20,807
I thought you of all people felt it was. Otherwise, you
wouldn't have come back from closed space that one time.

351
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,848
Or am I mistaken?

352
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,011
Well, who knows? I don't.

353
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:35,142
It's out of character for me to be so presumptuous.

354
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:40,018
And for a second there, I might've sounded like I
was inferring that we were the protectors of this world.

355
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,375
Please forgive me.

356
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:03,872
Rather than being angry today, it seems
Miss Suzumiya is too busy feeling sad.

357
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:06,160
Really? Why's that?

358
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,980
I thought you of all people would know why.

359
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,886
I don't mind explaining it, though.

360
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:16,090
Miss Suzumiya always thought that no matter
what happened, you'd be right there, by her side,

361
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,481
even though you'd sometimes complain.

362
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,524
You alone would forgive her.

363
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:25,041
<i>Yeah, well, the only one who could
forgive her now would be a martyred saint.</i>

364
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,506
Do you think you could say something
to Miss Suzumiya to cheer her up?

365
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:31,384
If you don't, she might continue to get depressed.

366
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,529
And then something much worse
than closed space could appear.

367
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,985
I don't even want to think about
what would happen to the world if...

368
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,686
...well, if she were to sink into a deep depression.

369
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,039
So, you're telling me to go cheer her up.

370
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:46,597
You just need to get back together with her again.

371
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,855
Yeah, see, that's where you're wrong.

372
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,752
I was never "with her" to begin with.

373
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh, well...

374
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,732
I thought that you would've cooled off a bit more by now.

375
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,203
I guess I was wrong.

376
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,937
<i>The reason I got so angry yesterday,</i>

377
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:03,250
<i>was because I couldn't stand watching Miss
Asahina getting abused and degraded like that.</i>

378
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,934
<i>But that's not the only reason.</i>

379
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:09,416
<i>I could've been suffering from calcium deficiency.</i>

380
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:14,214
<i>So, before bed last night, I downed a liter of milk.</i>

381
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:16,407
<i>And it seemed to calm me down a little bit.</i>

382
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,409
<i>It... could've been a placebo effect, though.</i>

383
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,234
Yeah, movie, what a joke.

384
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,352
Don't listen to him.

385
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:28,188
He's just upset 'cause he wanted to hang
out with you guys and Miss Suzumiya some more.

386
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,254
He even canceled his plans on that day.

387
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,411
Don't tell him that, you jerk!

388
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:37,127
So anyway, you can just forget about me
helping out on any more of your stupid projects.

389
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:38,732
Movie... yeah, right.

390
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,929
Nobody's gonna watch that trash!

391
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:41,799
For real.

392
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,252
You're the last person I wanna hear that from.

393
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,726
<i>It's not like I can't imagine it, though.</i>

394
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:52,071
<i>But hearing a guy like him say it really pisses me off.</i>

395
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:55,832
<i>At least Haruhi's doing something for the school festival.</i>

396
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:59,318
<i>She's trying to get involved.
Can you say the same about yourself?</i>

397
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:02,943
<i>Who cares if it's stupid?! At
least she's trying to make something.</i>

398
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,197
<i>Look at you! You're just sitting there complaining!</i>

399
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,112
<i>Man... That really pisses me off!</i>

400
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,172
<i>Why am I so angry about it though?</i>

401
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,578
<i>I wonder...</i>

402
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:17,154
<i>Is it because I've suddenly found a
passion for making movies or something?</i>

403
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:19,894
Is there something wrong, Kyon?

404
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,293
Miss Suzumiya looked upset, too.

405
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,898
Did something happen?

406
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:25,820
Lovers' spat, whatever.

407
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:29,284
<i>I get it now.</i>

408
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:32,870
<i>I do what Haruhi tells me to do, and
then I go out and complain about it.</i>

409
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:35,482
<i>There's no difference between me and Taniguchi.</i>

410
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:41,171
<i>I mean, I got so mad at the stuff he was saying just now,
but how's it any different from what I've said before?!</i>

411
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,161
<i>Dammit! Taniguchi, you bastard!</i>

412
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:47,154
<i>Thanks to you, I've realized
something and I'm not happy about it!</i>

413
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:50,346
<i>And now, I'm gonna go do something I know I'll regret!</i>

414
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:52,953
<i>Dammit... Dammit! Dammit!</i>

415
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,377
Hey, Haruhi.

416
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,473
What do you want?

417
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,578
We're gonna finish this movie, and it's gonna be awesome.

418
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,522
Well of course, it will!

419
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:25,068
I am the director, after all.

420
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:27,183
Everyone knows it's gonna be awesome.

421
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,294
I certainly don't need you to tell me that.

422
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,489
<i>Man, talk about a mood swing.</i>

423
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:35,610
<i>Oh, well. Things get weird when Haruhi's grumpy,</i>

424
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,402
<i>so I guess this really is for the best.</i>

425
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:38,781
Here we go!

426
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,808
You could've at least tried to
pick a better way to say it to her.

427
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:47,769
Sorry.

428
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:52,132
Not only is she back to her old self,
now she's even more powerful than ever!

429
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:53,307
Sorry.

430
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:56,437
We won't be able to cover things up for much longer.

431
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:02,736
Can you believe how perfect this is?!

432
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:05,535
I was just thinking about a scene with cherry blossoms!

433
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,371
This weird weather came along right at the nick of time!

434
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:10,731
Let me see your victory pose!

435
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:14,258
I know!

436
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:15,897
We need to find ourselves a cat!

437
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:16,728
A cat?

438
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:21,360
Yeah. Every witch needs a familiar,
right? And nothing says familiar like a cat!

439
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,624
I wonder if there's a black cat around here.

440
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:27,295
Wasn't Nagato supposed to be
playing an evil alien in this thing?

441
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,771
You and your details.

442
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:31,280
I need a cat for this movie, so let's find one!

443
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,052
How 'bout it, Yuki? Do you know any place
around here where we can find a buncha stray cats?
