1
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:05,689
<i>Something's... wrong.</i>

2
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,399
<i>That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

3
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,222
<i>The game on TV was between schools from another town.</i>

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,085
<i>Now, I had nothing to do with either school,
but because I tend to sympathize with underdogs,</i>

5
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:19,361
<i>I found myself routing for the losing team.</i>

6
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:23,108
<i>And right about then, I suddenly
got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

7
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,983
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,312
I know, I know.

9
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,159
Hey, you're free, right?

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,540
Good, meet us at 2:00 o'clock in front of the station.

11
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:39,541
Don't be late!

12
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:43,194
I didn't even have the chance to say anything.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,307
It's your phone again.

14
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:47,339
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:48,975
Now what?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,165
I forgot to tell you, make sure to bring
your swim trunks, and some money, too.

17
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,293
And your bike.

18
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,230
Definitely bring your bike. That's it! Over and out!

19
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:04,120
<i>It was like I knew what Haruhi
was gonna say before she said it.</i>

20
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,610
<i>Yeah, no.</i>

21
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,288
<i>Actually, it felt like we had
the exact same conversation before.</i>

22
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,505
<i>Like déjà vu or something.</i>

23
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:18,802
And it's over the fence. Another home run.

24
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,779
That makes is eight for Jyonan.

25
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,798
Well, you're late, Kyon! Where's your motivation, huh?

26
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,852
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.

27
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:45,906
No worries, I just got here too.

28
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,990
And now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

29
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:49,517
Where?

30
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:52,034
The public pool! Where do you think?

31
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:53,479
<i>Yeah, that figures.</i>

32
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,668
We've got lots and lots of summer vacationy things
to do during our break, we've only so much time,

33
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,978
and once it's gone, it's gone for good.

34
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:07,016
So we're gonna do everything we can while we
can during our only summer as tenth graders.

35
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:10,708
And for starters, we're gonna ride the bikes to the pool.

36
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,601
Did everyone ride their bikes today?

37
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:16,367
No. The only bikes we have are the ones you and I brought.

38
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,626
Okay, you guys. Are you ready?

39
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,159
<i>Is anyone ever ready?</i>

40
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,460
I'm good to go.

41
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:25,573
Don't let Koizumi beat you, okay, Kyon?

42
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:27,583
Full speed ahead!

43
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,512
<i>Damn it!</i>

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,642
Kyon.

45
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:09,495
We're trying to have fun, so stop acting tired.

46
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,926
You're such a slacker.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,004
And whose fault is that, huh?

48
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:18,181
Ah. Can you smell the chlorine?

49
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,692
That really makes it feel like summer.

50
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,186
Come on, it's time for a swim! I'll race ya!

51
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,699
<i>Can't you see the no diving sign?</i>

52
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,385
Hurry up and get in!

53
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,075
Come on! The water's all warm and perfect!

54
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,229
Well, you have to admit, that
certainly does look like fun.

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,248
I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya
enjoy herself in a normal way,

56
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:46,252
it's rather charming, don't you think?

57
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:50,072
As long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and just havin' a good time,

58
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,210
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events, do we?

59
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:56,956
<i>Hm. I hope you're right.</i>

60
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,411
Is something wrong?

61
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:04,379
Hey, Koizumi.

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,354
Don't know. Maybe it's just my imagination.

63
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,926
But with everything that's happened since we met,

64
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:13,813
you could say that I've become slightly paranoid.

65
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:16,446
Come on, let's go for a swim.

66
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:18,605
Hey!

67
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:20,947
Hey!

68
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,184
Take that!

69
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,457
Come back!

70
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,816
<i>Jeez. Now I know why they call
it a "public swimming pool".</i>

71
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,007
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

72
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,232
<i>That's weird.</i>

73
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,302
<i>It's like I've seen this happen once before.</i>

74
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,813
<i>With Nagato looking kind of bored like that.</i>

75
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,275
<i>And then...</i>

76
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:57,990
Kyon!

77
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,302
<i>Uh-huh. And then Haruhi shows up and she says...</i>

78
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,176
These two guys are my brigade members,

79
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:07,000
they do what I say, so if you want something, ask them.

80
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,658
It's time to have some fun!

81
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,039
Come on! Let's go play water soccer!

82
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,496
<i>Oh well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

83
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,035
Here I go, Mikuru!

84
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,256
Okay!

85
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,481
Sorry!

86
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,217
What's that for?

87
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,159
I got thinking about some of the fun things we
could be doing. So I came up with this schedule...

88
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,508
of how we're going to spend the rest of our vacation.

89
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:37,117
Just think about it, we've only
got two more weeks before it's over.

90
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:41,284
And even though we've done a lot up till
now, it still feels like we've got a lot to do.

91
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:45,756
Since we've only got a little bit of time left,
I made this list so we could pick up the pace.

92
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,526
Is there anything you want to do, Mikuru?

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,624
Umm... I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

94
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:56,388
Okay! Goldfish scooping.

95
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,448
Could I see that?

96
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:03,492
Thank you.

97
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:09,728
Does anyone know if there's a bon festival
happening close by? Or a firework show?

98
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,292
I can check and see if there's anything.

99
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:14,874
Oh! Don't forget about the goldfish scooping.

100
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,809
It's Mikuru's only request.

101
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,224
I'll get right on it, then.

102
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,885
Okay, Kyon! We're starting tomorrow!

103
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:32,666
<i>The next morning, I was waken from my
peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.</i>

104
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,884
<i>She said they found a bon festival.</i>

105
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,500
<i>It was happening tonight at a park... somewhere.</i>

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,410
Mikuru and Yuki say they don't have yukatas.

107
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:47,007
So I decided we're gonna go out
and buy some to wear for tonight.

108
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:51,401
I don't have one either, but I found a place
in town that sells them in sets for really cheap.

109
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,380
And you guys get to come with us!

110
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,127
<i>So, we went to a clothing outlet.</i>

111
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,252
<i>Haruhi picked out yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato.</i>

112
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,871
<i>Then, marched them straight into the changing rooms.</i>

113
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:07,486
<i>After making us wait about an
hour or so, insert yawn here,</i>

114
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:08,867
<i>they finally emerged.</i>

115
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,560
<i>Excellent.</i>

116
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:14,242
The three of you look wonderful in those.

117
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,904
Of course we do! I picked 'em out myself.

118
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,768
Especially Mikuru's.

119
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,037
Look at you. You're so cute. I'm a genius.

120
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,159
Huh... Uh, thanks.

121
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:27,505
<i>Miss Asahina, you look awesome!</i>

122
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,265
<i>It figures it'd be so crowded.</i>

123
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,705
<i>There it is again. That feeling.</i>

124
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:46,895
<i>I haven't been to a bon festival in a
while, but it feels like I just went to one.</i>

125
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:48,313
<i>That tower.</i>

126
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:49,546
<i>Those vendors.</i>

127
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,706
<i>Weird.</i>

128
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:52,178
Mikuru!

129
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,135
Come on! Look!

130
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,711
They've got goldfish scooping just like you wanted!

131
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,970
Over here!

132
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,817
Oh, uh, okay!

133
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:02,281
How 'bout it, wanna scoop some fish?

134
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:04,554
No, I think I'll pass.

135
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,399
Don't tell me you're actually into this kinda stuff.

136
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:22,992
Which one? It's on me.

137
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:23,739
No.

138
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:25,414
That.

139
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,256
Righty-o!

140
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,652
<i>I wish she would've let me buy that for her.</i>

141
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,484
<i>It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.</i>

142
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,952
I caught 13 fish!

143
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,386
It's like the most unbelievable haul ever!

144
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:45,713
But I don't have any place to keep 'em all,
so I kept one and gave the other to Mikuru.

145
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:50,573
Yuki? What's up? What's with the mask?

146
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:52,300
I bought it.

147
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:53,739
Okay.

148
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,781
I need your back for a second.

149
00:09:58,809 --> 00:09:59,367
Why?

150
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:00,814
Just turn around.

151
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,309
Hey, don't!

152
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:05,757
Fireworks! That's what we're gonna do next!

153
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,098
We'll have a firework show to end the day!

154
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:11,858
<i>Do you even understand the meaning of the word moderation?</i>

155
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,603
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

156
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,845
<i>And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

157
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,967
<i>But the truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

158
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:30,585
Okay, everyone. Tomorrow, we're gonna go catch some bugs.

159
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,391
It's the SOS Brigade cicada catching contest!

160
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:38,964
And whoever catches the most bugs tomorrow in
gonna get to be brigade leader for one whole day!

161
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,998
Haruhi, I don't wanna spoil your fun,
but have you finished your homework yet?

162
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:43,717
Huh?

163
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:49,633
You're kidding me, right? That stuff's totally
easy. You can finish it in like three days.

164
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,525
You have to get rid of that junk first,

165
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,181
so you can spend the rest of your summer
having fun and not worrying about it.

166
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,407
That's the only way to really
get the most out of your vacation.

167
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,618
Wow.

168
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:03,104
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

169
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,677
<i>The next day was beautiful, sunny and bright.</i>

170
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,685
<i>In fact, it was the perfect day to have
our SOS Brigade cicada catching contest.</i>

171
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:15,916
<i>And although everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,</i>

172
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,995
<i>the winner of the contest ended up being, you guessed it,</i>

173
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:19,998
<i>Haruhi.</i>

174
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:26,216
<i>We met the next day, even though
we had no idea what was going on.</i>

175
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,850
<i>Our cluelessness continued as
we were made to wear frog costumes</i>

176
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,503
<i>and hand balloons out in front of the local supermarket.</i>

177
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,737
<i>Welcome to our part-time job.</i>

178
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,129
Is everything okay down there?

179
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,102
I thought I was gonna die!

180
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,968
Thanks for all the hard work, especially in this heat.

181
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,646
The manager's super grateful for everything.

182
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,096
Who the hell cares how grateful he is. What about our pay?

183
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:51,149
This is it.

184
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,022
I've had my eye on this guy for a while.

185
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,505
The manager gave it to us, 'cause
Mikuru looked so darn cute in it.

186
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,182
<i>That's what we worked so hard for?</i>

187
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,949
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear 'em whenever you want.

188
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,454
Isn't he awesome?

189
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:06,745
<i>Ribbit.</i>

190
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:15,892
Later that night,

191
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:20,074
my peaceful slumber was interrupted by a phone call.

192
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:23,701
Ugh, damn it.

193
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:27,613
Hello.

194
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:32,115
Kyon...

195
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,610
Is that you, Miss Asahina?

196
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,796
Yes, it's me.

197
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,180
Something really bad... I don't know...

198
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,159
What's wrong...

199
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,473
Hello. It's Koizumi.

200
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,299
Why are you with Miss Asahina in the middle of the night?!

201
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:53,011
We have a situation here.

202
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,569
Is it possible for you to come meet us right now?

203
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,409
Of course! I'll be right over!

204
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,799
Miss Asahina, what happened?

205
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,318
It's terrible, Kyon.

206
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,185
I can't go back to the future anymore!

207
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,241
You can't go back?

208
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:32,371
But you're... What are you saying?

209
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,820
I'll explain it the best I can.

210
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:39,199
We're currently stuck in a time
loop that seems to have no end to it.

211
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,388
Huh? A what?

212
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:44,936
We're currently stuck in a time
loop that seems to have no end to it.

213
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,188
We're currently stuck in a time
loop that seems to have no end...

214
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:49,453
Come on, Koizumi.

215
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,293
Do you realize what you just said?

216
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,094
Yes, of course I do.

217
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,151
And much more than I want to, believe me.

218
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,774
Earlier, I was having a word with Miss Asahina.

219
00:13:58,234 --> 00:13:59,300
<i>Call me, next time.</i>

220
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:03,825
And that was when we both realized something
seemed a little off about the current flow of time.

221
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,200
Actually, Miss Asahina was the one discovered it first.

222
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,786
Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

223
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,221
Suspicions?

224
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:14,614
We've been reliving the same
period of time over and over again,

225
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,085
stuck in an infinite time loop
without any way of getting unstuck.

226
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,841
I know, you already said that.

227
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:24,582
We've been repeating every single day
between August the 17th through the 31st,

228
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:28,838
and have become stuck right in the middle of
what seems to be an endless summer vacation.

229
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:31,734
Well, we're definitely in the middle of something.

230
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,825
It's a never-ending, endless summer to be precise.

231
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:37,866
The future doesn't exist in this world any longer.

232
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,242
All time stops at September the 1st.

233
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:44,195
And that's the reason Miss Asahina
can't travel back to the future.

234
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,534
It's only natural that she can't
return to a future that no longer exists.

235
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:49,988
Are you kidding me?

236
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,812
There's nothing natural about a concept like that.

237
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,059
Who's gonna believe such nonsense?

238
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:59,559
For starters, we were sort of hoping you would.

239
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:02,064
Hey, guys.

240
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,947
I think I can try to explain it.

241
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,250
Here I go...

242
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:11,101
Because I have to classify information,

243
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:15,060
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

244
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,091
The thing is,

245
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:21,710
I haven't gotten any classified information for a week.

246
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,839
So we started to think how weird that was.

247
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:26,234
I was so surprised.

248
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,826
I classified information, I really did...

249
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,769
<i>Oh, Miss Asahina.</i>

250
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:36,061
<i>Are the classified information things
you're talking about stuff you can't say on TV?</i>

251
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,575
So, what about those closed
spaces you were talking about before?

252
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,909
Is it possible we're trapped in something like that?

253
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,784
No, it's not one of those.

254
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:49,785
A specific section of time has been torn away.

255
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:53,965
At exactly midnight on August the 31st, everything resets,

256
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,459
and then time reverts straight back
to the morning of August the 17th.

257
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:58,917
That's the process.

258
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:00,168
What about our...?

259
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:02,419
Wait, what about the whole world's memories?

260
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,214
Their memory resets as well.

261
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,421
Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning again.

262
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:10,305
Perfect. It's another problem involving time.

263
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,942
Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised about that.

264
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,808
No, Miss Asahina doesn't have anything to do with it.

265
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,059
Okay. What does?

266
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,734
Miss Suzumiya does.

267
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:29,584
Somewhere deep down inside her, there's a
desire to have summer vacation last forever,

268
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,572
and I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.

269
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:32,325
No way.

270
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,594
Are you saying she still hasn't had enough fun?

271
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,219
That's what it looks like to me.

272
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,551
Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs
to happen before our summer vacation can really be over.

273
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:43,881
<i>Oh man.</i>

274
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,296
<i>The trouble she gets us into is always galactic in scale.</i>

275
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:54,185
You know, you're acting like you're enjoying
this an awful lot, you wanna tell me why?

276
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:59,061
Please don't take that the wrong way, but this
explains the feelings of déjà vu I've been having.

277
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:04,602
And looking back on it now, they were most likely
the residue of my memories whenever time had been reset.

278
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,813
You've been feeling them too, haven't you?

279
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,660
Are we the only ones, or can other people feel it, too?

280
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,262
It looks like you and I are exceptions to the rule.

281
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:23,929
The only people who can sense this strange feeling
would be the ones who are the closest to Miss Suzumiya.

282
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:25,034
Then what about Haruhi?

283
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:26,899
Does she even know this stuff's even happening?

284
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,948
No, I don't think she really does.

285
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,823
Besides, I think it would be
very, very bad for us if she did.

286
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,904
But... there's someone else.

287
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:41,722
Someone who isn't affected by the time loop or
the feelings of déjà vu we've been experiencing.

288
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,235
They remember it all.

289
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,514
Really? And who would that person be?

290
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,513
I think you know who it is.

291
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,950
Nagato. Is that the truth?

292
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:54,941
It is.

293
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,771
And you can remember everything?

294
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:57,815
I can.

295
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,154
Then, can you tell me how many
times this has happened so far?

296
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:07,991
This would be 15,499 times.

297
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,055
<i>Fifteen thousand, four-hundred ninety-nine?</i>

298
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:15,550
<i>What do you mean 15,499?</i>

299
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:17,631
<i>What are you saying, Nagato?</i>

300
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,652
Okay, are you being totally serious?

301
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:22,577
Yes.

302
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:27,347
So, what you're saying we've done the
exact same things every time that many times?

303
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,659
Not necessarily.

304
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:32,105
Throughout 15,499 repetitions,

305
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:35,941
we did not attend a bon festival the 2,391st time

306
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:38,182
and the 11,054th time.

307
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:43,723
We went to a bon festival but did not
go to a fish scooping booth 437 times.

308
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,224
We obtained part-time jobs 9,026 times

309
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:49,160
and worked six different jobs.

310
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,110
In addition to handing out balloons,

311
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,687
we worked as movers, cashiers,
we handed out flowers, worked as...

312
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,583
I got it. That's enough.

313
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,002
<i>Fifteen thousand, four-hundred ninety-nine times.</i>

314
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:15,276
<i>That's what she said. Times
two weeks. That's... 594 years.</i>

315
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:18,535
<i>She's the only one who remembers everything we did.</i>

316
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:21,295
<i>And she's had to repeat them over and over again.</i>

317
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,557
<i>Nagato.</i>

318
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,954
<i>What's it like to relive the same things that many times?</i>

319
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,383
<i>That's gotta be the craziest story ever.</i>

320
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,943
<i>The next night, we went stargazing.</i>

321
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:42,324
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's
apartment and Koizumi brought the telescope.</i>

322
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:47,064
I'm getting bored.

323
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,468
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

324
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,985
Uh! Hey! Haruhi, you'll break it! Wait! Stop!

325
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,564
Don't spin it like that!

326
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,999
I wish I knew what else she wants to do.

327
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:08,461
Well now, that's the all-important question, isn't
it? If we knew the answer, we could solve this problem.

328
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,272
I've got an idea, how 'bout we try this?

329
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:15,075
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

330
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,211
and then they whispered, "I love you" right into her ear.

331
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:20,040
And who's going to be doing this?

332
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:22,295
Who else could play that role other than you?

333
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:24,088
Well, you can count me out then!

334
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,777
All right. How 'bout if I give it a try?

335
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,498
No, I'm just kidding.

336
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,804
I really don't think I can pull it off anyway.

337
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:39,401
And besides, it would just end up confusing Miss Suzumiya.

338
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:46,012
<i>We kept chugging along, doing
all kinds of summer vacation things.</i>

339
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,615
<i>We went to the batting cages,</i>

340
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:50,581
<i>to a real firework show,</i>

341
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:53,249
<i>and we even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.</i>

342
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,614
<i>We did the "test of courage."</i>

343
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,214
<i>Watched some movies, went to the beach,</i>

344
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,460
<i>bowling, and karaoke.</i>

345
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,636
<i>Yup, we were always doing somethin'.</i>

346
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,074
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was going to be enough for Haruhi.</i>

347
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,164
<i>But what could I do about it? Nothing.</i>

348
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:16,000
<i>So, I just bit my lip and watched as the
last days of our summer vacation went by.</i>

349
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:19,838
<i>And then, before I knew it, August the 30th was here.</i>

350
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:20,989
<i>Again.</i>

351
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,460
That's it, we've done everything on our list.

352
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,332
But now I'm wonder if we did enough.

353
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,043
Eh, oh well, I guess we got to do a lot.

354
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,294
Hey, does anyone wanna do anything else?

355
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,174
Oh, okay.

356
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:49,860
I guess we did everything that we set out
to do this summer, so that's good enough.

357
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,418
<i>No, it's not, Haruhi.</i>

358
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:52,901
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

359
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,683
<i>You're still not satisfied.</i>

360
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,866
Okay, guys, we're done for today.

361
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:02,023
I set tomorrow aside just in case,
but I guess you can take the day off now.

362
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:04,559
I'll see you all at the club room on Monday.

363
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,301
<i>W-wait, Haruhi!</i>

364
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,829
<i>There's that feeling again.</i>

365
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,345
<i>And it's way stronger than all the others.</i>

366
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,152
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave.</i>

367
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,845
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

368
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,559
<i>we'll end up reliving the past two weeks
again and again for a thousand more times.</i>

369
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:27,182
<i>But... what should I do?</i>

370
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,041
<i>What should I say?</i>

371
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:33,962
<i>There must've been a clue in
something Haruhi said, but what was it?</i>

372
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,159
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

373
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:40,838
<i>I don't know...</i>

374
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:43,603
<i>Can't remember.</i>

375
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,660
<i>It's August the 31st.</i>

376
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,091
<i>I haven't touched my homework.</i>

377
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,572
<i>Whatever. It doesn't matter.</i>

378
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,651
<i>There isn't any point in doing it.</i>

379
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:17,768
<i>We're just gonna keep reliving
the last couple of weeks over again.</i>

380
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

381
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,575
<i>a different version of me will have to deal with it.</i>
