1
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:13,315
<i>Something's... wrong.</i>

2
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,697
<i>That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

3
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,750
<i>I didn't care about the baseball game on
TV 'cause it was between some other schools.</i>

4
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,773
<i>For some reason, I got into anyway,
and started rooting for the losing team.</i>

5
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:31,446
<i>And that's when I got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

6
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:35,842
<i>What does she want?</i>

7
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,635
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

8
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,165
I know; you don't have to tell me.

9
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,667
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

10
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,853
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

11
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:49,235
<i>I didn't have a chance to say anything.</i>

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,220
Now, what?

13
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:57,605
I forgot to tell you, make sure to
bring your swim trunks and some money, too.

14
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,429
Oh, wait, and your bike. Definitely bring your bike.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,997
That's it. Over and out!

16
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:08,663
<i>Well, that was weird. It was like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say before she even said anything.</i>

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,434
Yeah... No...

18
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:18,271
<i>Actually, it felt like we'd had that exact same
conversation before, like déjà vu or something.</i>

19
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:24,682
<i>Summer's almost over...</i>

20
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,400
You're late again, Kyon!

21
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,063
Where's your motivation, huh?

22
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,160
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,225
You're the only reason I showed up anyway.

24
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,188
Thanks, that's really sweet.

25
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,455
Now that we're all present and
accounted for, we can get going!

26
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:23,208
Where to?

27
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,580
To the public swimming pool. Where do ya think?

28
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,219
<i>That figures... considering the stuff I brought.</i>

29
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:31,788
We've got lots of summer vacation-y
things to do during our summer break!

30
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,261
But we've only so much time because
once it's gone, it's gone for good!

31
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,614
We have to do what we can, while we can
during our one and only summer as tenth graders!

32
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,542
It's up to Kyon and Koizumi to get us to the pool.

33
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:47,163
I know I'm gonna hate asking this,
but what did you mean by that last thing?

34
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,620
You guys are taking us there on your bikes!

35
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,649
Mm, can you smell the chlorine?

36
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:58,730
That really makes it feel like summer!

37
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,599
<i>Restrain thyself!</i>

38
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,370
<i>Canst thou not see the "no diving" signs?</i>

39
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:11,845
Hurry up and get in, guys! The water's warm! It's perfect!

40
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,627
Doesn't that look like fun?

41
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:26,373
I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya enjoy
the day in such a normal fashion.

42
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,261
It's rather charming, don't you think?

43
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,601
First, she called me up and told me what to bring,

44
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:33,793
And then, she demanded I meet her
without telling me what was going on.

45
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,046
I'm sorry, but I don't see anything
charming or normal about that.

46
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:40,745
Well, when she gets an idea, she
tends to strike while the iron's hot.

47
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, but every time she strikes, something goes wrong.

48
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:46,791
And by wrong, I might nightmarishly wrong.

49
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,009
You have a point,

50
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,073
but it's peaceful enough around here.

51
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:53,162
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and having a good time,

52
00:04:53,187 --> 00:04:55,872
we don't have to worry about any earth-shattering events.

53
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,831
Now what is it?

54
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,093
It's nothing...

55
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,514
Just my imagination, I guess.

56
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:07,751
With everything that's happened since we
met, you could say I've become slightly paranoid.

57
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,859
Let's race one more time!

58
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:15,996
It's like...

59
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:36,432
<i>Yum! It's strawberry-licious!</i>

60
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:43,819
Get it!

61
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,891
<i>Geez...</i>

62
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,350
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

63
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,573
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

64
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:52,207
<i>I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.</i>

65
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,331
<i>There's that weird feeling again.</i>

66
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,886
<i>It's like I've seen this happen before.</i>

67
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,955
<i>Nagato, sitting there... all alone, looking bored.</i>

68
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:08,908
Kyon!

69
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:15,164
<i>Yeah... And then Haruhi shows up and says...</i>

70
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,613
<i>"So, these two guys are my brigade members.</i>

71
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:20,649
<i>They do what I say, so if you want something, ask them!"</i>

72
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:21,619
Okay!

73
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:22,938
Time for some fun!

74
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,851
Let's go play water soccer!

75
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:27,058
Yeah, sure...

76
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:30,028
<i>Oh, well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

77
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,663
I've been thinking of some fun
things to do, so I came up with this.

78
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,365
What is that thing for?

79
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:42,782
It's a schedule of how we're gonna
spend the rest of our summer vacation!

80
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:44,511
A schedule for who?

81
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,102
For us, that's who!

82
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,627
We've only got two weeks of vacation left.

83
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,664
That fact alone blew me away.

84
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:53,847
We've done a lot of cool things,
but we're running outta time.

85
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:56,635
There's still a bazillion more things left for us to do.

86
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,550
I say, we gotta pick up the pace!

87
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,220
<i>Two weeks to do all that?!</i>

88
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,682
Mikuru, is there anything else you wanna do?

89
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:06,122
I think I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

90
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,085
Okay!

91
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,546
Goldfish scooping, it is.

92
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:12,756
Could I see that?

93
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,238
Okay, thanks.

94
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,411
We'll start the list tomorrow!

95
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,457
Do you guys know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

96
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,393
Or a place to see fireworks?

97
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,606
<i>Why don't you find that stuff yourself?</i>

98
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,494
I can check around for those.

99
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,572
I'll call you if I find anything.

100
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:31,363
Perfect!

101
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:32,887
I'll leave it up to you!

102
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,268
That's it for today! See ya!

103
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,346
Hey, Nagato?

104
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,580
Uh, well... It's nothing important or anything,

105
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:52,695
but I was just wondering... Is everything okay?

106
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:53,738
It is.

107
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,487
That's good to hear.

108
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:57,456
Yes.

109
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,108
Okay...

110
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,136
That's it. You can go.

111
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,535
Sorry to keep you.

112
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,940
<i>What was that?</i>

113
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,909
<i>Why'd I want to talk to her?</i>

114
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:26,142
And just like that, Koizumi managed to find
a bon festival happening the very next day.

115
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:27,618
Wow!

116
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:30,743
So this is what festivals were like back in this time.

117
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:34,431
<i>I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's so crowded.</i>

118
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,179
Look, Mikuru!

119
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,171
They've got goldfish scooping
over there, just like you wanted!

120
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,450
Let's catch a ton and break some scoopers!

121
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,781
<i>Don't break the scoopers.</i>

122
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,056
I didn't know you were into stuff like that.

123
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:58,080
I got it.

124
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:58,860
No.

125
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:00,738
That one.

126
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,865
Okay, it's yours for 800 yen!

127
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,265
Thanks!

128
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,276
<i>I wish she would've let me buy that for her...</i>

129
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:12,287
<i>It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.</i>

130
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,389
What an unbelievable haul!

131
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,923
But, I don't have room for all
those fish, so I just kept two for us!

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,288
Anyway, let's go shoot off some fireworks!

133
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,095
It's the perfect way to end the day!

134
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,252
<i>Come on! Don't you ever get tired?</i>

135
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,484
<i>Oh, well. If anything, Haruhi's endless
energy is one her better qualities.</i>

136
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,139
<i>Reckless as always.</i>

137
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:42,571
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

138
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,892
<i>And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

139
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,748
<i>Truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

140
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,410
Tomorrow, we're gonna catch some bugs.

141
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:54,688
I don't want to spoil your fun, but
have you finished your homework yet?

142
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:57,517
You gotta be kidding. That stuff's totally easy.

143
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,357
You can finish it in like three days.

144
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,182
<i>Three days?!</i>

145
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,825
You have to get rid of that junk first,

146
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,225
so you can spend the rest of your summer
having fun and not worrying about it!

147
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,929
That's the only way to get the most out of your vacation!

148
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,144
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

149
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:14,380
<i>The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.</i>

150
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:17,600
So anyway, tomorrow we're gonna go bug-catching!

151
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,509
And the prize for catching the most bugs is gonna be...

152
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:24,777
Um... He, he, the winner gets
to be brigade leader for a day!

153
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,586
<i>That's the last thing I'd wanna be!</i>

154
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:30,102
That sounds like a lot of fun,
but can we catch just any random bug?

155
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,730
No... Only cicadas!

156
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,042
That's it, I'm calling it

157
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,651
the SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest!

158
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,365
<i>The next day was another beautiful day, sunny and bright.</i>

159
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:45,793
<i>And the winner of the contest ended
up being... You guessed it, Haruhi.</i>

160
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,256
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

161
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,980
I mean, if we let 'em go this time,
they might come back and return the favor!

162
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:58,405
<i>If something were to come back and return the
favor of being randomly captured and released,</i>

163
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,450
<i>I'd say they'd have to be as dumb as a bug.</i>

164
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,651
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

165
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,401
Wel-Welcome to our store!

166
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:21,107
<i>The next day, our fearless
leader got us some part-time jobs.</i>

167
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:22,732
Would you like a balloon?

168
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:23,573
No?

169
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:24,576
Take it.

170
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:25,405
Gimme!

171
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:26,250
Sure...

172
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:27,651
Thank you!

173
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,543
<i>Wearing a costume in heat like this isn't a job.</i>

174
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:33,061
It's more like a test of endurance.

175
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,662
Like I said, our pay is the costume Mikuru's wearing.

176
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:42,024
I've had my eye on this little guy for a long time now.

177
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,876
The manager gave it to us
'cause Mikuru looks so cute in it!

178
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:47,798
<i>We worked in the sun, sweat pouring down our foreheads...</i>

179
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:48,469
<i>...for that?!</i>

180
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:51,343
We'll keep this froggy in the club room as a souvenir.

181
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:54,402
And Mikuru, you can wear him whenever you want to, okay?

182
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,229
You have my permission!

183
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:12,486
Dammit...

184
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,522
Hello?

185
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:19,727
Kyon...

186
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,985
Miss Asahina, is that you?

187
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,030
Yes... It's me...

188
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:26,409
Something... really bad...

189
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,128
Is this really Miss Asahina?

190
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,896
Oh, hello! It's Koizumi.

191
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,522
How about you tell me what
you're doing with her at this hour?!

192
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,476
We have a bit of situation here.

193
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,383
And it's a pretty dire one, at that.

194
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,304
You could even say it's an emergency.

195
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,639
Sorry we had to call you out so late.

196
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,175
Miss Asahina! What happened?

197
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,807
I'm gonna kill you, Koizumi!

198
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,099
Oh, Kyon...

199
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:58,029
I-I can't go back to the future!

200
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,990
Because I have to classified information,

201
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:10,972
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

202
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,388
I haven't gotten any classified
information for about a week.

203
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,376
And I started to think how weird that was, and I...

204
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,841
I was so surprised, I classified
information, I really did.

205
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,101
But it was classified information, too.

206
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:31,193
And now I don't know what to do!

207
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,720
<i>Are all the classified information things
you're talking about, stuff you can't say on TV?</i>

208
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,361
I'll explain it the best I can.

209
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,514
We're stuck in a time loop that seems to infinite.

210
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:47,058
We're repeating every day between
August the 17th through the 31st.

211
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,056
You see, time doesn't exist after September the 1st.

212
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:54,798
It's only natural Miss Asahina
can't go back to the future,

213
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,232
when there's no future to go to.

214
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,029
There's nothing natural about not having a future.

215
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:01,866
I mean, who's gonna believe such a thing?

216
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,520
Actually, we were sort of hoping you would believe it.

217
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,993
<i>They say, "Believe and you'll be saved,"</i>

218
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,927
<i>but I've yet to be saved from anything, even once.</i>

219
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,238
Well, what's causing this to happen? Got any ideas?

220
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,612
Wait, you mean you don't already know?

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,242
I don't want to, so there.

222
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,561
It's Miss Suzumiya.

223
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,343
I'm sure she doesn't even realize it's happening.

224
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:28,114
It's a result of her subconscious desires.

225
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:30,688
She wants summer vacation to last forever.

226
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,244
You're kidding! She still hasn't had enough fun?

227
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,172
That's what I think.

228
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:40,351
Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs
to happen before our summer vacation can really be over.

229
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:45,094
<i>Oh, man... The trouble she gets
us into is always galactic in scale.</i>

230
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:51,798
Well, anyway, at least now I have an explanation for
all those weird feelings of déjà vu I've been having.

231
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:56,002
You too? Do you think it's possible
other people are having the same feelings?

232
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,430
I doubt it, but you and I are different.

233
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,012
The only people who can sense this strange thing
happening are the ones who are closest to Miss Suzumiya.

234
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:09,390
However, there's someone who doesn't seem
to be affected by these feelings of déjà vu.

235
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,084
As a matter of fact, this person
remembers everything that's happened.

236
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,419
Well, are you gonna tell me who it is or what?

237
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,841
I think you already know that, too.

238
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,403
Is that true?

239
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,879
It is.

240
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,563
You can remember everything?

241
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:25,485
I can.

242
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,381
Then, how many times has this happened to us?

243
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:34,571
This would be 15,532 times so far.

244
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,428
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred thirty-two?</i>

245
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,140
Nagato, I'm having a hard time processing all this.

246
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:50,563
But are you serious?

247
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,427
I am.

248
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:55,719
You're saying we've done the exact
same things, every time, that many times?

249
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,685
Not necessarily.

250
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:08,405
Throughout 15,532 repetitions, we did not attend a
bon festival the 2,391st time and the 11,054th time.

251
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:14,168
We went to a bon festival but did not
go to a goldfish scooping booth 437 times.

252
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:20,285
We obtained part-time jobs 9,056 times
and performed six different types of jobs.

253
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:23,305
In addition to handing out balloons,
we worked as movers, cashiers...

254
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:23,821
Stop!

255
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:26,567
Okay... I got it.

256
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:33,186
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred thirty-two times...</i>

257
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,054
<i>That's what Nagato said.</i>

258
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:40,656
<i>Times two weeks... That's, uh... 595 years!</i>

259
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,959
<i>She's the only one who remembers everything we've done.</i>

260
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,556
<i>And she's had to repeat those
same things, over and over again.</i>

261
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,680
<i>Nagato...</i>

262
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,367
<i>What's it like to re-live the same things that many times?</i>

263
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:02,490
<i>That's gotta be the craziest story ever.</i>

264
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,763
<i>The next night, we went stargazing.</i>

265
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,808
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's apartment.</i>

266
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,509
<i>And at first, Haruhi was all over that telescope.</i>

267
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:18,109
<i>But eventually...</i>

268
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,626
Oh, man. I wish I knew what else she wants to do.

269
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,429
That's the question, isn't it?

270
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:29,669
If we knew the answer, we'd be
well on our way to solving this thing.

271
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,410
I have an idea we can try if you want.

272
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:36,173
What if someone were to grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

273
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:39,151
and then whispered, "I love you," right into her ear?

274
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:40,997
And who's gonna be doing this?!

275
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,522
Can you think of anyone better suited for that role?

276
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,283
My turn! I summon my veto card!

277
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:48,873
All right. How about if I do it?

278
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,373
I'm just kidding.

279
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,832
I don't think I could pull that role off anyway.

280
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,706
Besides, it would just confuse Miss Suzumiya.

281
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,641
<i>We chugged along, doing all
kinds of summer vacation things.</i>

282
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:20,729
<i>We went to a real fireworks show, and we
even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.</i>

283
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:26,700
<i>We did the test of courage, watched some
movies, went to the beach, bowling, even karaoke.</i>

284
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,393
<i>We were always doing something, always on the move.</i>

285
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:34,564
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was going to be enough for Haruhi.</i>

286
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,388
<i>But, I couldn't do anything about it.</i>

287
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:41,294
<i>So, I just bit my lip and watched as the
last days of our summer vacation went by.</i>

288
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:46,038
<i>And then, before I knew it, August the 30th was here.</i>

289
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,618
Well, that's it. We finished everything on our list.

290
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,866
I know we did a lot, but now I wonder if we did enough.

291
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:07,520
Hmm... Oh, well. Yeah, I guess we did do a lot.

292
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,641
Unless there's something else you guys wanna do?

293
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:22,322
Oh, okay then.

294
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:26,193
We pretty much did everything we set out
to do this summer, so I guess that's enough.

295
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:27,909
<i>No, it's not.</i>

296
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,409
<i>You're still not satisfied.</i>

297
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,110
I guess that's it for today.

298
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:38,365
I set tomorrow aside just in case,
but I guess you can take the day off now.

299
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,709
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday!

300
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:42,818
<i>Wait, Haruhi!</i>

301
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,748
<i>There's that feeling again!</i>

302
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,017
<i>And it's stronger than all the others!</i>

303
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,407
<i>Now I know we've done this ten thousand times before,</i>

304
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,408
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave. If I let her walk out that door,</i>

305
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:00,348
<i>we'll end up re-living the past two weeks again and again!</i>

306
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:01,896
<i>But, what should I do?</i>

307
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,734
<i>There must've been a clue in something Haruhi said.</i>

308
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:08,339
<i>But what? What? What?! Come on! Remember!</i>

309
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:11,666
<i>It's something I'm worried about,
but I'm putting it off for some reason.</i>

310
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,165
<i>If I don't do something now, she'll go home!</i>

311
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:17,496
<i>I can't let that happen! If I do, nothing will change!</i>

312
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:20,483
<i>Try to remember! What've we done up till now?</i>

313
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,005
<i>What didn't we do?!</i>

314
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:25,150
<i>There's no time to think about it anymore.</i>

315
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,936
<i>It doesn't matter if it doesn't work.</i>

316
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:29,448
<i>Just say something, anything!</i>

317
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,572
Hang on a second!

318
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,678
We're not done yet!

319
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,894
Homework! Homework!

320
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,230
What are you talking about?

321
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:03,257
None of my homework's done! I haven't even started it yet!

322
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,036
My summer can't be over until I finish it!

323
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:07,337
Are you nuts?

324
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,520
Koizumi! Did you finish your homework?

325
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,583
No, uh, we were so busy, I'm only half-way done with it.

326
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,954
Let's do it together!

327
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,386
You too, Nagato. I bet you're not done yet.

328
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,506
And you're coming with us, Miss Asahina.

329
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,177
Uh, where are we going?

330
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,037
We're all gonna meet at my house!

331
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,572
Bring all your notebooks and
textbooks, and we'll work on it together!

332
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:28,588
We'll finish our summer activities once and for all!

333
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:32,063
Nagato, Koizumi, I need to copy whatever you've got.

334
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,909
Roger that!

335
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,112
We're gonna start first thing tomorrow morning.

336
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:37,643
And we're gonna go all day until we finish!

337
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:38,861
Hold it right there!

338
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,345
How dare you give the orders?!

339
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:49,850
I'm the brigade leader, and as your
superior, you need to get my permission first!

340
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:51,515
Who do you think you are, huh?!

341
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,455
Acting without my permission is against the rules!

342
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,622
I wanna come over, too!

343
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:38,855
It looks like I hit the jackpot.

344
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,038
Miss Suzumiya is a smart and talented person.

345
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,361
She's always been that way, and she always will be.

346
00:22:46,543 --> 00:22:51,720
And that's probably why it never occurred to her that
summer homework could also be a bit of a pain for others.

347
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,466
Since she's never had to do the study group thing before,

348
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,917
I can see how she'd overlook an opportunity like that.

349
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:03,043
<i>It was the first day of the new term.</i>

350
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,550
<i>I should have gone home by now,
but I ended up coming here instead.</i>

351
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:09,794
<i>Koizumi showed up, too. Probably for the same reason.</i>

352
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:13,388
<i>It was weird though. Nagato wasn't there.</i>

353
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,075
<i>I couldn't tell by looking at her, but
I'll bet she must've been pretty exhausted.</i>

354
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:26,544
The thought of us re-living the past two weeks
tens of thousands of times seems like a bad dream.

355
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,427
I'm not at all surprised you feel that way.

356
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:36,741
We don't share any memories with the versions
of us who had to go through 15,531 time loops.

357
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:44,011
That's because on the 15,532nd time, we
snapped back into the normal time flow.

358
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,481
How about a game of poker?

359
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:51,702
Yeah, sure. Why not? I don't have any money though.

360
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:53,426
Then we'll play for fun.

361
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:56,039
<i>I did get a lot of hints,</i>

362
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:58,606
<i>hints like those feelings of déjà vu,</i>

363
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,226
<i>especially the last one.</i>

364
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,368
<i>I wonder if it could've been a memory
sent by one of the previous versions of us.</i>

365
00:24:05,831 --> 00:24:11,334
<i>I'm here because of all the us'es, if that's
even a word, who had to repeat those last two weeks.</i>

366
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,714
<i>That's the way I have to think about
it, so that it wasn't all for nothing.</i>

367
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:17,011
<i>If I did forget, then I'd be like Haruhi,</i>

368
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:18,960
<i>who's unaware those summers even happened.</i>

369
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:24,247
How many?

370
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,239
I'm good.

371
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:26,614
Then, so am I.

372
00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:30,160
<i>If I had the chance to live today all over again...</i>

373
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,115
Whoa!

374
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,890
<i>I hope I remember to put some cash down on this hand.</i>
