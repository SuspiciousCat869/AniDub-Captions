1
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:06,021
Lord Suzumiya, we have report from the scout fleet.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,192
The enemy ships have been located.

3
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:11,363
Enemy fleet at altitude eight minutes, twenty seconds.

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:16,267
Distance to our location is 6.3
astronomical units at 60% light speed.

5
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:19,877
The enemy's fleet consists of approximately 15,000 ships.

6
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,880
They're here! We're gonna annihilate 'em!

7
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:24,721
All ships to battle stations!

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,784
Aye, aye, ma'am.

9
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:29,480
All ships to battle stations!

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,691
Set all reactors to combat output.

11
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:34,147
Set all thrusters to first stage speeds.

12
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:37,425
3... 2... 1... Ignition!

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,498
L-Loading all cannons with super gravitational torpedoes!

14
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:46,075
And um... L-Load the super proton cannon, too.

15
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:49,509
Um... All cannons stand by to fire!

16
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,920
Maximum boosters.

17
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,955
Initiate electronic warfare.

18
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,689
ECM, ECCMs are fully operational.

19
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:56,615
Excellent!

20
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,492
All ships, full speed ahead!

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,306
Hey, Haruhi, don't you think it'd be better
if you pulled your ships back a little bit?

22
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:04,528
Your fleet shouldn't be so far in front of us.

23
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:05,772
What are you talking about?!

24
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:08,618
I wanna shoot beams and missiles at the enemy, too!

25
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:13,214
Look, when you're playing shogi or chess, the
king isn't the one who charges into enemy territory.

26
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:16,362
Oh, yeah... Good thinking.

27
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,777
Okay, Kyon. You guys take care of it.

28
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:22,721
Go find the enemy leader, and give
him a good pummeling with your cannons!

29
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,857
And make sure you win!

30
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,422
I want you to take those fools from the Computer Club,

31
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,391
and beat the living daylights out of those geek boys!

32
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,891
Wouldn't it better if we just raised the white flag now?

33
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,255
Well, I guess that's not gonna be an option today.

34
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:12,566
<i>It is autumn now.</i>

35
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:15,854
<i>And the arts festival ended
several days ago without incident.</i>

36
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,307
<i>Peace and quiet had returned to the campus.</i>

37
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,784
<i>You could say, it was just another ordinary day.</i>

38
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:26,788
<i>Then again, I shouldn't be so quick to label an afternoon
spent at the SOS Brigade headquarters as "ordinary."</i>

39
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,712
<i>I mean, every day, I hang out with an
alien, a time traveler, and an ESPer.</i>

40
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,196
<i>And I'm still as sane and objective as ever.</i>

41
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:37,327
<i>I wonder if that makes me special or something.</i>

42
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,778
<i>I'm sure Lacan's dying to have a word with me.</i>

43
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,038
You seem worried.

44
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:42,421
Is something wrong?

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,169
Nope.

46
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,017
I was just thinking about how awesome I am for
being able to cope with this absurd situation.

47
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,766
And if you ask me, I think I'm due for a little praise.

48
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,155
You're right.

49
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:58,230
Well? Would you like me to give
you some words of praise then?

50
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,564
You praising me won't make me any happier.

51
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,582
All it'll do is make me think
you've got something up your sleeve.

52
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:05,798
True enough.

53
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,047
I'm sorry this took so long.

54
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,803
I bought this stem tea called karigane.

55
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,078
It's the first time I've ever
made it, so I hope I brewed it well!

56
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,184
<i>Nonsense.</i>

57
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:20,684
If the divine hands of Miss Asahina touched it, even tap
water would taste better than melted snow from the Alps!

58
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,596
I hope you like the flavor!

59
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,851
By the way, where's Miss Suzumiya?

60
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:28,289
She's got cleanup duty.

61
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:31,598
<i>Sure is peaceful when she's not around, isn't it?</i>

62
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,373
Yes! I'm coming!

63
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:42,849
It's the president of the Computer Club.

64
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,612
Isn't your leader here today?

65
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:48,192
You guys want something?

66
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,204
First, I want you to take this.

67
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,020
You'll find some game software on that disc.

68
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:59,251
Yeah, it's an original game
that we designed and developed.

69
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:01,665
We had it on display at the arts festival.

70
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,171
Maybe you saw it?

71
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,537
I don't remember.

72
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:10,249
<i>The only memory I want to retain from the arts festival
is the image of Miss Asahina wearing that maid outfit!</i>

73
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:11,755
Really?

74
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:14,685
Perhaps we were exhibiting it in the wrong place?

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,018
So what did you guys want?

76
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,298
That's right!

77
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,496
We've come here to challenge you and your brigade thing.

78
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,589
A duel!

79
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,915
We fight a duel using our game!

80
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,466
Really, a duel!

81
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,562
We wanna duel against...

82
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,320
<i>I beg you...</i>

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,208
<i>Please stop repeating the word "duel" over and over!</i>

84
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,125
<i>If Haruhi's ultra-sharp ears could
hear you, you'd be as good as...</i>

85
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:35,427
Chief!

86
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:38,367
So, you want a duel? Who are you guys anyway?

87
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:43,964
A-ha, I bet you creeps are some kinda secret
syndicate trying to muscle my SOS Brigade outta the way.

88
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,594
I won't let that happen!

89
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:50,789
Annihilating evil and shining light upon
darkness is the sworn duty of a hero of justice!

90
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:54,132
Haruhi? You should listen to what
people have to say before you kick them.

91
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:57,836
Kyon, a duel is a duel from the
very moment the word is mentioned!

92
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:01,060
Anything the loser says after that is just an excuse.

93
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,024
It's you guys?

94
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,279
Why are the Computer Club geeks pickin' a fight with us?

95
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:10,449
That's exactly what they were about to
explain to us before you took 'em out.

96
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,247
Oh? They were, huh?

97
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,525
Ugh, rotten SOS Brigade.

98
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,141
Whatever!

99
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:20,585
We, the members of the Computer Club,
hereby challenge the SOS Brigade to a duel!

100
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,656
A duel, huh?

101
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:24,221
Chief!

102
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:27,242
<i>Come on, guys. It's time to move the story along.</i>

103
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,322
Well? What's this all about?

104
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,339
We made a game, and we wanna fight you guys in it.

105
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,861
And if we win, you have to return "it" to us.

106
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,604
What do you mean? Return what?

107
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,610
If you're not using it, give back our computer!

108
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,643
But, I use this thing all the time!

109
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:43,188
A coupla days ago, we cut our movie on it.

110
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,564
<i>Actually, I did that.</i>

111
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,501
And we made our homepage with it.

112
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,552
<i>Yep, did that, too.</i>

113
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:48,744
What are you talking about?!

114
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,669
You barely even update your homepage!

115
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:54,040
<i>Ah-hah, so he's the guy who's always visiting our site.</i>

116
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,150
That explains the camel cricket.

117
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,561
Wait a second, when I went over there, and I
said I wanted it, you said you'd give it to me!

118
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:02,906
You remember it, too. Don't you, Kyon?

119
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,066
You sure about that?

120
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,137
The deal is off! And besides, you bullied me into it!

121
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:12,373
In fact, I'm even willing to forget the mental trauma
you inflicted upon me when you abducted my computer.

122
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:15,974
Yes, I want to forget it. We should both forget it.

123
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:19,480
Anyway, whatever! We wanna fight you, you got it?!

124
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,707
Sure, you got it.

125
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,910
If you wanna fight us so bad,
then we accept your challenge!

126
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,772
Now then, what do you guys give us if we win?

127
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,181
Well, let's see...

128
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,386
How about four brand new laptops?

129
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,498
That's one laptop for each member.

130
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,439
Are you serious?!

131
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:35,358
Oh, yes.

132
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,788
Really? I'm not gonna let you
call it off if you change your mind.

133
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,852
You understand?

134
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,907
Don't worry. You have my word.

135
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:44,515
You're pretty confident, aren't you? All right.

136
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,190
Now that I think about it, you guys
don't have any girls in your club.

137
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,642
If you guys beat us, we'll give her to you.

138
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:51,717
How 'bout that?

139
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm sure you guys can find a good use for Yuki!

140
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:59,828
Since you're putting up four computers against
the one we have, Yuki helps to even out the stakes!

141
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:00,482
Yeah! Well...

142
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:00,985
<i>No.</i>

143
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:04,339
<i>There's a big difference between
the specs of four laptops and Nagato.</i>

144
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,759
But you wouldn't know that.

145
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,451
Really? Then do you want Mikuru instead?

146
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,859
Why don't you be the prize?

147
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,647
If you're gonna bet anything, how
'bout you go ahead and bet your own body?

148
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,505
Stop being so selfish for once.

149
00:08:17,646 --> 00:08:19,179
What are you talking about?!

150
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:22,942
Are you forgetting that I'm the divine
and sacred figurehead of the SOS Brigade?!

151
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,316
I'm your leader, dummy!

152
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,730
I will never give up this position except
to the person I feel is the chosen one.

153
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:31,380
<i>You mean you're gonna stay here even after you graduate?!</i>

154
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,605
What's it gonna be? Who do you prefer?

155
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,522
Well... I... Uh...

156
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,525
I see, so that's how it's gonna be.

157
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,094
If you insist, you can have me.

158
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,882
No! No! Absolutely no. No way.

159
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:47,080
The game is an online space battle
simulator. Five players versus five.

160
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:50,205
The battle will begin at 4:00, one week from today.

161
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,849
Until then, you should brush up on your skills.

162
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,966
We'll be disappointed if you're too weak.

163
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:56,904
<i>He's acting like he's already won.</i>

164
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,043
How generous of you to give us our prizes in advance!

165
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:04,009
After all, each brigade member
should have their own computer!

166
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,096
<i>And she's acting the exact same way.</i>

167
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:09,225
About this duel coming up,

168
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,120
let's just try not to cheat, okay?

169
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,452
Cheat? Us?

170
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,880
Yeah, this time around,

171
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:19,196
all alien, futuristic, and ESPer methods of
cheating are 100% completely off-limits. You got that?

172
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:23,755
We will fight fairly and accept the outcome,
whatever that may be. That is the best way.

173
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,139
Then you won't mind if we just happen to lose the game.

174
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:30,165
That's right. The only thing we're gonna
lose is that computer we stole from them.

175
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,005
And I guess that's not such a big deal.

176
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,907
<i>Although, if that does happen, I'm
gonna need to relocate the Asahina gallery.</i>

177
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,914
Oh, I'm not talkin' about the computer. Miss
Suzumiya doesn't like to lose at anything, ever.

178
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:43,652
Remember?

179
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,701
Whenever she feels like she's going
to lose, she creates closed space.

180
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,147
And then, she lets those you-know-what's loose.

181
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,755
You'll be okay with that?

182
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,127
I don't really care.

183
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:55,891
Besides, it's about damn time
that girl learned her lesson.

184
00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,663
What's up? You're creeping me out.

185
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,388
No, sorry. I just got a bit jealous, is all.

186
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:07,497
I admit, I'm a little envious of the invisible
trust that exists between Miss Suzumiya and yourself.

187
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,830
I don't have any idea what you're talking about.

188
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:13,099
Let's say we lose the game
against the Computer Club next week,

189
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:16,105
and based on what you've already seen with your own eyes,

190
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,958
you're choosing to believe that Miss
Suzumiya won't create a closed space this time.

191
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,837
Well? That's because you trust her.

192
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,672
Then, there's Miss Suzumiya. She believes you're
the one who's goin' to lead our team to victory.

193
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:29,432
So, she trusts you.

194
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:33,950
She's so confident she's going to win that
she'd risk losing her own members in the wager.

195
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,558
That, is trust.

196
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:38,182
Although she'd never come right out and say it,

197
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:43,488
the truth of the matter is that between the two of
you, there is the most ideal bond of trust I've ever seen.

198
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,684
"The Day of Sagittarius Part Three," huh?

199
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:54,519
So there was a part one and part two before this version?

200
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:55,233
Lame.

201
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,469
Sounds like they were going for something cool sounding.

202
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,143
Doesn't make any sense, though.

203
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:02,715
<i>What're you talking about? Is
the "SOS Brigade" any better?</i>

204
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,383
Well, at least the game looks simple enough to play.

205
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,630
Each of the five players is
given a fleet of 15,000 space ships,

206
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:11,753
which they're able to command from their own computer.

207
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:17,100
You win the game by destroying all the enemy
ships or by blowing up the enemy leader's flagship.

208
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,078
What's with this bright spot?

209
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,514
That's your line of sight.

210
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,890
You can see enemy and obstacles
only when they're inside that bubble.

211
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:30,102
In order to play, you'll have to send out scout
ships from your fleet to increase your field of vision.

212
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:34,562
Basically, in order to win this thing, it looks
like you need to find out where your enemy is,

213
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,287
and take 'em out as fast as you can.

214
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:39,075
So you can't see the enemy in the beginning?

215
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:44,368
Um, Kyon? I, uh... I'm not really good at stuff like this.

216
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,294
I don't think I understand it at all.

217
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,286
Hey, don't worry.

218
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,403
Just take your time, get used to the
controls, and try and have some fun with it.

219
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,162
This is not supposed to be fun!

220
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:55,752
We're gonna crush the Computer Club
so hard, they won't be able to stand up!

221
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,745
Now let's get some training happening!

222
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:02,036
Naturally, I'll be commanding this
outfit. Now hop to it! Battle positions!

223
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,153
<i>At least we've got Nagato on our side.</i>

224
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,190
<i>I take it back. We're dead!</i>

225
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,263
All ships, attack!

226
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:15,298
All ships, attack!

227
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:20,549
All ships, attack!

228
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,107
All ships, attack!

229
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,512
We got beat again!

230
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:29,953
Killing in this rotten game's irritating me!

231
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,808
It's because you keep rushing in!

232
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:34,022
You don't just charge into battle in the beginning.

233
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,430
Geez! This thing is such a drag!

234
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,316
I'd much rather play something easier to understand.

235
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:44,559
<i>Is it just me or are you having fun over there?</i>

236
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:49,296
<i>I meant what I said before, There's
absolutely no cheating this time, okay?</i>

237
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,474
Today, the skies are clear and the waves are high.

238
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:01,353
This battle will decide the destiny of the empire!

239
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,782
And believe me, this is just the beginning.

240
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:06,370
We'll vaporize anything that gets in our way.

241
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,845
The SOS Brigade will make its name
known to the ends of the universe!

242
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,410
One day I'll talk to the Board of Education about creating
branches of the SOS Brigade in every public school!

243
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:19,067
Obviously, we're going to win,
but I still won't allow any slacking!

244
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:20,893
Now, pulverize 'em!

245
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,689
<i>Whatever gives her that confidence, I want it.</i>

246
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:26,018
<i>Even if it's only two milligrams, I want it.</i>

247
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,417
Oh, really? Do you want me to pump some into you?

248
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,264
There! Bet that did the trick!

249
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,855
What good does it do to stare
at me and make me uncomfortable?

250
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,823
I charged my glare with a bunch
of energy and sent it to you!

251
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,493
You probably felt something like your body getting warmer.

252
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,018
Maybe you're starting to sweat!

253
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,087
You feel it, don't you? You feel it?

254
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,554
<i>No, I felt like my life was in danger.</i>

255
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,439
Looks like the game's about to begin.

256
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:04,772
All ships, ahead!

257
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:07,404
<i>Well, the game's begun.</i>

258
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,763
<i>And as luck would have it, we've
just run across an enemy fleet.</i>

259
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:15,087
<i>Thanks to Nagato, we've somehow managed
to figure out the enemy's movements.</i>

260
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:19,450
<i>She scouts and fights the enemy
simultaneously. Talk about bravery.</i>

261
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,279
<i>Miss Asahina, the gaming novice, and Haruhi,
the charging idiot, are completely useless.</i>

262
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:27,078
<i>It's five against three, and we're the ones outnumbered.</i>

263
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,771
The enemy's usin' a "V" formation to
try to lure us into their firing range.

264
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:34,023
I think we should counter with a defensive strategy.

265
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,660
Sounds like a great plan. But what would
Haruhi say about this strategy of yours?

266
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,117
What the...?!

267
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,468
We're being attacked by another enemy fleet?

268
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,064
Where'd these guys come from?!

269
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:46,912
They're goin' after my fleet, too!

270
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:48,871
How did they figure out where we were?

271
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:52,421
What're you doing?! Hurry up and start retaliating!

272
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,204
I didn't need you to tell me that.

273
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,462
Starboard, 90 degrees. Open all cannons.

274
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,238
It sounds like someone's getting serious about this game.

275
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:05,201
Enemy fleet in range! Beam
cannons, open fire! Wait, hang on!

276
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,444
Damn, they got away.

277
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:11,571
Same over here. They unloaded on us for
a bit, then they vanished into thin air.

278
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,654
The old hit-and-run tactic, huh?

279
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,923
Whoa! They're back. Other side.

280
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:17,729
They're just picking us off.

281
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,562
What are you doing, slow poke?! They're getting away!

282
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,552
I know! But I can't do anything to stop
them! Those jerks are hitting us from both sides!

283
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:26,501
It's time to launch the... dams.

284
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,338
Here I go! Wait!

285
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,489
Can someone please tell me where I am right now?

286
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,201
I can't take this anymore!
Attention, fleets! Full speed ahead!

287
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:41,126
I'm gonna find the enemy leader and pummel him to bits!

288
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,178
What're you doing? Pull back!

289
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,889
He's right; leave this to us!

290
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:48,667
Out of my way! The leaders are
gonna duke this out, one on one!

291
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,486
Fall back! We don't even know where he is!

292
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:52,500
Then leave it to me! I'll find him!

293
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,988
I'm telling you, fall back!

294
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,546
Let's calm down. The enemy's shooting at us.

295
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:58,788
Hey, guys! Where did everyone go...

296
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,164
Move!

297
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:01,939
I can't! I'm stuck here!

298
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,090
<i>We're gonna lose this thing.</i>

299
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,037
What the...?!

300
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:08,978
Wow, she split up her fleet.

301
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,275
You can do that?

302
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,603
I remember reading about it in the back of the manual.

303
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:16,965
Apparently, you can split your fleet up
into 20 squadrons and control them separately.

304
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:22,467
The thing is, it isn't humanly possible to
control so many squadrons at the same time.

305
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,066
So, nobody was doing it.

306
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,513
<i>Isn't humanly possible, huh?</i>

307
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:32,564
Aren't you afraid you'll break
the keyboard hitting it that hard?

308
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:36,608
Anyone accepting defeat will be punished
by running ten laps around the school!

309
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:37,669
Naked!

310
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,516
And you'll have to yell, "Green martians
"are chasing me!" for the whole ten laps!

311
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:42,862
Uh... You know... Hm?

312
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:48,454
<i>Um, Miss Nagato? Yeah, hi. What
exactly are you doing right now?</i>

313
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,789
Hey, Nagato.

314
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:51,426
What?

315
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:54,545
I thought I told you before that
we weren't gonna cheat this time.

316
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:58,902
I am not. Currently, I am not
engaged in manipulating special data.

317
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,943
I am adhering to the rules of the game.

318
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,868
Uh... You're serious?

319
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:06,397
I am serious. The Computer
Club is the one that is cheating.

320
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:08,841
They are? Then, what are they doing?

321
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:11,765
They've deactivated their scouting mode.

322
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:16,744
Since the beginning of the game, everything on
the map, including our positions, has been visible.

323
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,333
It's amazing! I understood what you just said.

324
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,325
They've got it fixed so that we can't see where
they're hiding, but they can see where we are.

325
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,162
It's no wonder they're killing us.

326
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:26,678
Yes.

327
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:30,022
Since we started playing, we
never had any option except losing.

328
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,387
I want to change that.

329
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,551
Okay, they've been cheating, I understand that.

330
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:40,838
However, if we start using magic to cheat back at them,
at the end of the day, we're no better than they are!

331
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:44,275
You get where I'm coming from?
In fact, we'd be worse than them.

332
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,128
I repeat, I am not disobeying your orders.

333
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:52,388
I would like to modify the program in a matter that is
consistent with the current levels of earth technology...

334
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,709
ensuring equal playing conditions.

335
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:56,741
May I?

336
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,903
<i>Are you doing this because you want to win?</i>

337
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,003
Okay! Let's do it then!

338
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:20,206
Done.

339
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,866
Nice! Very Nice!

340
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:27,088
I was a little worried there when they fired up
the squadron mode, but we've still got the advantage.

341
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,654
We see them, but they can't see us.

342
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:33,246
Time to wrap this up. Destroy them!

343
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,363
Annihilate the SOS Brigade!

344
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,894
Wha...?!

345
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,404
Chief! Scouting mode has been activated!

346
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,563
They're attacking our blind spot!

347
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,231
We can't figure out their movements!

348
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:52,142
What're you idiots doing?!
Deactivate scouting mode! Turn it off!

349
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,659
We can't change it! It's denying access!

350
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,083
We're locked out!

351
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,676
That's... Impossible!

352
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,758
I gotcha! Fire, fire, fire!

353
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,869
Say good night!

354
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:07,213
Damn you, Kyon! That's my enemy!

355
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:09,697
We've managed to destroy two of the enemy's fleets.

356
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,951
And the others are lookin' a bit confused.

357
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:17,038
Thanks to Miss Nagato's squadrons, it looks like
the tides of war have finally turned in our favor.

358
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,447
Yeah, but the enemy leader's still out there.

359
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:20,950
So how're we gonna take him out?

360
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:23,378
No problem. I'll force him your way.

361
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,919
D-dammit!

362
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:29,335
Wow, he's driving his fleet right into our sights!

363
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,040
Just like a mouse caught in a trap.

364
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,560
Um... Am I supposed to shoot this thing?

365
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,351
I don't get what just happened, but great job, guys!

366
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,374
All ships, open fire!

367
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,781
Go out there and burn the enemy
leader with all the fires of hell!

368
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,636
He's getting away!

369
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,336
This can't be happening! Glory to the Computer Club!

370
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,049
I lost... We were beaten...

371
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:19,465
I'll apologize now. I admit it, I'm sorry.

372
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,452
But I can't believe... I...

373
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:25,876
I just can't believe the program
was rewritten during game-play!

374
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,398
That's impossible!

375
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:31,650
What are you mumbling about? Whatever.
You do remember your promise, right?

376
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:36,492
These laptops belong to the SOS Brigade
now, and I won't let you back out of it.

377
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:37,271
Hey...

378
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,671
Tell me, I wanna know who did it.

379
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,370
Whoever cracked that program
has to be some kinda super hacker.

380
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,223
Never-mind, I think I know who it was.

381
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,366
If you ever have free time,

382
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,462
I was wondering if you'd consider
participating in Computer Club activities. Please?

383
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,514
<i>Great, he's trying to recruit Yuki.</i>

384
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:03,437
Whoa! Hang on! You can't just rent
Yuki without my permission! Got it!?

385
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:08,895
She's the silent character in the SOS Brigade
line-up! And besides, I saw her first, so there!

386
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,111
Hang on.

387
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,567
<i>I think that even someone like
Nagato has to have other interests.</i>

388
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,245
<i>Now, I can't be sure,</i>

389
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,976
<i>but it looked to me like she was having
fun, pounding away on that keyboard.</i>

390
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:26,848
<i>Besides, I'll bet she gets tired of
observing Haruhi all the time. I know I would.</i>

391
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:32,883
<i>I mean, even a humanoid interface designed for contact
with organic life forms needs a break every now and then.</i>

392
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,963
Just do what you want, okay?

393
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:40,747
If you feel like going next door, and playing
around on their computers, it's totally cool.

394
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,553
Perhaps I will.

395
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:51,574
Seriously?!

396
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,149
Oh, thank you!

397
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:53,899
There you go.

398
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,633
I guess it's okay if Yuki's fine with it.

399
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:58,147
Oh, by the way...

400
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,573
The Computer Club lost the game!

401
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,227
And as the losers, you have to do
whatever the winners tell you to do!

402
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:04,770
What?!

403
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,839
All you need to do is swear your absolute loyalty to me.

404
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:10,454
Oh, don't worry. I'll treat you nice.

405
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,252
And if you guys work real hard, I just
might let you become a member of the brigade!

406
00:22:15,472 --> 00:22:18,421
Koizumi! Draw up a contract for him to sign!

407
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,189
As you wish, Your Highness.
