1
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:03,538
<i>Okay.</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,069
<i>Asking somebody how long they've
believed in Santa Claus is so stupid,</i>

3
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:10,566
<i>you can't even consider it a
topic suitable for idle conversation.</i>

4
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:15,467
<i>But if you still wanna know how long I've believe
in some old, fat guy who wears a funky red suit,</i>

5
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:16,952
<i>I can tell you this:</i>

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,410
<i>I've never believed in him... ever.</i>

7
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:23,353
<i>The Santa that showed up at my
kindergarten Christmas festival?</i>

8
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,475
<i>I knew he was fake.</i>

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,250
<i>And I never saw Mommy kissing Santa or anything.</i>

10
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,758
<i>But I have to say that even as a little kid,</i>

11
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:33,568
<i>I knew better than to believe in some
old man that only worked one day a year.</i>

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,104
<i>Now, having said that, it wasn't
until I got older that I realized...</i>

13
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,848
<i>aliens, time travelers, ghosts,
monsters, ESPers, evil syndicates,</i>

14
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:46,135
<i>and the anime slash manga slash fantasy-flick
heroes that fight said evil syndicates...</i>

15
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:47,454
<i>... were also fake.</i>

16
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:50,260
<i>Okay, I guess I always knew those things were bogus,</i>

17
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:51,550
<i>I just didn't want to admit it.</i>

18
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:52,693
<i>All I ever wanted was...</i>

19
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:57,577
<i>... for an alien, time traveler, ghost, monster,
ESPer, evil syndicate or the hero who fought 'em...</i>

20
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,718
<i>to just appear and say, "Hey."</i>

21
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:03,300
<i>Unfortunately, reality is a hard road indeed.</i>

22
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>Yep, you gotta admit, the laws of
physics definitely puts a damper on things.</i>

23
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>I even stopped watching those TV
shows about aliens and ghosts and stuff.</i>

24
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:14,121
<i>Aliens, time travelers, ESPers, 'course they don't exist.</i>

25
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,327
<i>But a little part of me wishes that they did.</i>

26
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:21,092
<i>I guess I've grown up and realized that I can
think about those things and still accept reality.</i>

27
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,761
<i>But by the time I got out of junior high,</i>

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,734
<i>I pretty much outgrew that kinda stuff.</i>

29
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:31,189
<i>And I guess I got used to the
idea of living in an ordinary world.</i>

30
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,501
<i>And just like that... I was in high school.</i>

31
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,726
<i>And that's when I met her...</i>

32
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,899
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya from East Junior High.

33
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:45,417
First off, I'm not interested in ordinary people.

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,155
But if any of you are aliens, time
travelers, or ESPers, please come see me.

35
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,282
That is all.

36
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,914
Is that supposed to be funny?

37
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:02,102
<i>There stood before me this amazing, beautiful girl.</i>

38
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:13,994
<i>O-kay... Next?</i>

39
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,498
<i>I bet everyone thought she was kidding,</i>

40
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,403
<i>but it wasn't a joke.</i>

41
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,339
<i>And it wasn't anything to laugh about.</i>

42
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,992
<i>Haruhi is always dead serious.</i>

43
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,800
<i>And that's how we first met.</i>

44
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:29,067
<i>Looking back, I wanna believe
that it was just a coincidence.</i>

45
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:04,490
<i>As long as Haruhi Suzumiya is sitting quietly,</i>

46
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,652
<i>she's just like any other
extremely beautiful high school girl.</i>

47
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,718
<i>And my seat just happens to be in front of her.</i>

48
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>I mean, can you blame me for wanting to
exploit this seating arrangement so I could, um...</i>

49
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:17,212
<i>get to know her better?</i>

50
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:22,001
Hey, that stuff you were saying when you were
introducing yourself, were you serious about all that?

51
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:24,919
What about the stuff I was saying?

52
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:27,088
Well, you know, about aliens and stuff.

53
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,193
Why? Are you an alien or something?

54
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:30,232
Well, no, but I just...

55
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:31,772
Well, no, but you just what?

56
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,959
Well, I... Just forget it.

57
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,785
Then why are we even talking right now?

58
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,572
You're wasting my time. Ugh.

59
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:44,262
<i>Later on,</i>

60
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:48,422
<i>I found out that quite a few of my new
classmates were from the same junior high as Haruhi.</i>

61
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:52,077
Look, if you've got the hots for her, take my advice:

62
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,425
Forget it.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,171
After being in the same class as her for three years,

64
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,639
I know her pretty well.

65
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,165
Let's just say she's what you might call beyond eccentric.

66
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,451
Like her introduction?

67
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:07,186
Yep! In junior high, I can't remember a day
when she wasn't doing something completely wacky.

68
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,683
You ever hear the quad scribbles incident?

69
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:10,879
No, what's that?

70
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,600
You know that thing that draws
lines on the athletic field?

71
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,402
Agh, what d'ya call that thing again?

72
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:20,017
Whatever. Well, she used that thing to draw
this big, mysterious symbol on the school quad.

73
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,508
She snuck into the school grounds at night to draw it.

74
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,600
Yeah, I remember reading about that.

75
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,782
I think it was in the local
section of the daily newspaper.

76
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,065
It sorta looked like a botched
version of a Nazca drawing, didn't it?

77
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,701
So, you're telling me she did this all by herself?

78
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,213
No doubt. And she totally admitted doing it.

79
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,085
Oh yeah, and then one morning, I get to class early.

80
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,432
All the desks were shoved out into the hall!

81
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:43,841
Then there's the time she painted a star on the roof.

82
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,508
And this other time when she plastered these talismans...

83
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:46,472
<i>What the hell's she doing...?</i>

84
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:50,133
You know, like the ones you use to reanimate corpses?

85
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:51,735
I have no idea why.

86
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,706
But all the same, man, she's pretty popular with the guys.

87
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,433
She's not too hard to look at, you know?

88
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,378
And she's freakin' good at sports.

89
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:00,556
And, on top of that, she gets good grades.

90
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:01,985
She's a super weirdo.

91
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,401
But if she's standing there quietly, you'd never know.

92
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,800
Somethin' tells me you have more to say about her.

93
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,795
For a while, she was goin' out
with one joker after another.

94
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:12,680
I think the longest any one guy lasted was about a week.

95
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,995
And the guy that had the shortest relationship with her?

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,999
He asked her out, she said okay,
and it ended five minutes later.

97
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:21,716
I don't have any time to deal with ordinary humans!

98
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,428
Then why the hell'd you say okay?

99
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,537
I mean, that's what I heard, really!

100
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:31,476
I don't know why, but she never turns a
guy down when he steps up to ask her out.

101
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:35,263
And so, before you get any
bright ideas, buddy, take my advice:

102
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,060
Forget it.

103
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,304
<i>Forget it? What's to forget when
I haven't even though about it?</i>

104
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:47,399
If you were me, there's only one girl
in this class to go after. And that's her.

105
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:53,775
Ryoko Asakura. And I'm telling ya, she's
in the top 3 on the freshman hottie list.

106
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,662
So what, are you telling us that you've
already checked out all the freshman girls?

107
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,063
Heck yeah! I ranked 'em all from A to D，

108
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:04,024
and I even went so far as to memorize the
full names of all the A-list girls, buddy.

109
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,112
Really? So what ranking did Asakura get?

110
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,773
She gets Double-A plus!

111
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:10,714
On top of being gorgeous, I
bet her personality is wonderful.

112
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:21,230
<i>Now, all this was happening when Haruhi
Suzumiya was still acting sorta normal.</i>

113
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,026
<i>For that whole month, even I was feeling pretty good.</i>

114
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:25,889
<i>However, it should be noted that:</i>

115
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,956
<i>bits and pieces of Haruhi eccentricities
were already starting to make themselves known.</i>

116
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,979
<i>Haruhi Eccentricity number 1:</i>

117
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:34,950
<i>A different hairstyle everyday.</i>

118
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,175
<i>Monday.</i>

119
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:36,948
<i>Tuesday.</i>

120
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,716
<i>Wednesday.</i>

121
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:38,466
<i>Thursday.</i>

122
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,171
<i>Friday.</i>

123
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:42,745
<i>As the days passed, the number of
places she'd tie off her hair increased.</i>

124
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:46,629
<i>On Monday, she resets her hair, and then
adds off a tie-off point each day until Friday.</i>

125
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,675
<i>Wonder what her hair looks like on Sunday.</i>

126
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,115
<i>Think I'd like to see that.</i>

127
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,063
<i>Haruhi Eccentricity number 2:</i>

128
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,194
<i>Our PE class is separated into boys and girls.</i>

129
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:58,300
<i>When changing into uniforms,</i>

130
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:01,770
<i>girls use the odd numbered classrooms
and boys used the even numbers.</i>

131
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,025
<i>It didn't matter that guys were standing around,</i>

132
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,635
<i>she'd just start changing out of her school uniform.</i>

133
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:16,620
<i>To Haruhi, guys were pretty
much the same as a bag of potatoes.</i>

134
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,394
<i>Eccentricity number 3:</i>

135
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,113
<i>It was rather irritating that Haruhi joined every team
in every extra-curricular club the school had to offer.</i>

136
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:32,097
<i>Every single one of the sports clubs
lobbied for her to join their respective teams,</i>

137
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:33,868
<i>and she'd turned every one of 'em down.</i>

138
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:37,087
<i>She'd change clubs on a daily basis depending on her mood.</i>

139
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,931
<i>In the end though, she didn't remain
a member of a single one of the clubs.</i>

140
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,650
<i>I mean, what the hell does she wanna do anyway?</i>

141
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:48,868
<i>And before I knew it, it was the
day after the Golden Week vacation.</i>

142
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:49,593
What's up?

143
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:51,001
Hey.

144
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,874
<i>And by the way, Kyon? That's my nickname.</i>

145
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:56,949
<i>And I really wish people would
stop calling me that already.</i>

146
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,570
Oh. I guess today's Wednesday, isn't it?

147
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:06,650
<i>And with that thought, something
must've snapped inside me.</i>

148
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,284
<i>I can't think of any reason why...</i>

149
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:13,300
So, do you change your hairstyle
everyday to ward off alien invaders?

150
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,841
<i>I was talking to Haruhi Suzumiya.</i>

151
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,373
So when did you notice?

152
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,267
Mmm... A while ago.

153
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,521
Oh, I see.

154
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,241
Actually, I have this theory that each day of
the week has its own image with a specific color...

155
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,996
that only goes with that day.

156
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:29,815
And by colors, I'd say...

157
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:33,273
<i>It felt almost like we were having a
real conversation for the first time.</i>

158
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:38,740
And Thursday's green. Friday is gold, and
Saturday is brown. And the color for Sunday is white.

159
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,341
<i>Hey, I kinda understand what she's talking about.</i>

160
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,494
So, if you turn that into numbers,

161
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,050
Monday'd be zero, and Sunday'd be six, right?

162
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:46,780
Right.

163
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,401
I kinda feel that Monday's more like a one.

164
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,431
I don't think anybody was asking for your opinion.

165
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:55,160
<i>Oh, is that so?</i>

166
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:13,387
Have I met you somewhere before? Like,
maybe in the past, or something like that?

167
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:14,381
Not likely.

168
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:19,060
<i>Usually, an event is triggered by
something that's considered trivial.</i>

169
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,466
<i>Well, this must've been my trigger.</i>

170
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,837
<i>I was surprised that Haruhi even
replied with a half-decent answer.</i>

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,648
<i>I totally thought she'd say something like,</i>

172
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,549
<i>Shut up, loser! Who cares?</i>

173
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,639
<i>I mean, you get the picture...</i>

174
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:37,058
<i>And so, when Haruhi came to class the
next day with her long hair all chopped off,</i>

175
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,416
<i>I was rather disturbed by it.</i>

176
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,847
<i>I mean, cutting it short like that
the day after I made my comment...</i>

177
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,856
<i>It's a little rash, don't you think?</i>

178
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:47,344
<i>Not really.</i>

179
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:50,357
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

180
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:54,123
<i>talking to Haruhi right before homeroom
started was becoming sort of a ritual.</i>

181
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,870
Is it true you've dumped every guy you've ever dated?

182
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,264
And just what gives you the right
to ask me a question like that?

183
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,609
I don't know about anything you've heard.

184
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,349
Whatever. You wanna believe it? It's probably true.

185
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:10,767
Well, with all that dating, wasn't there at
least one guy you were even a little serious about?

186
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,008
Absolutely not.

187
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:14,169
They all took themselves way too seriously,

188
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:18,607
and not even one of those dorks was an
alien, time traveler, or even an ESPer.

189
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:19,897
<i>That's how people are normally.</i>

190
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:22,866
Okay, so what's with most of
them asking me out over the phone?

191
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,703
I mean, shouldn't important stuff like
that be done face-to-face, not phone-to-phone?

192
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,974
Yeah, I mean, if it were me...

193
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,677
<i>I'll just agree with her for now.</i>

194
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,028
Yeah, well, none of that's important anyway!

195
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,149
<i>So what is?</i>

196
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,383
Here's the problem:

197
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:39,633
So far, the way it looks is that all the
men in this entire universe are pathetic.

198
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:43,428
I mean, all through junior high, that was
the one thing that irritated me the most.

199
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:47,105
All right then, so what kind of guy would you
have really have been into? An alien or something?

200
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,420
Yeah! Anything like an alien or
something else along those lines.

201
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:53,357
Anyway, as long as the person isn't an ordinary human,

202
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:54,650
I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

203
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,473
Hang on a sec, what's wrong with being human?

204
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,249
I mean, why do they have to be an alien?

205
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:02,327
Because that way, life's more interesting.

206
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,103
Hey, Kyon!

207
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,574
You need to tell me what kind of magic spell you're using.

208
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:17,883
What're you talking about?

209
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,525
I have never seen Suzumiya talk that long before,

210
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,301
and I'm not exaggerating, man!

211
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,715
What the hell'd you say to her?

212
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:24,834
<i>Huh...</i>

213
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:26,575
<i>Wonder what I could've said to her.</i>

214
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,925
<i>I think it was all pretty random stuff.</i>

215
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,550
This is a phenomenon.

216
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,820
Kyon's always gone after the strange ones;

217
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:33,989
The weirder the better.

218
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,522
Little louder, please, so everyone can hear you.

219
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,224
I wanna know how you did it.

220
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,549
No matter how much I've tried to talk to her,

221
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:43,546
I can't get Haruhi to answer any of my questions.

222
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,469
What do you do to get her to open up?

223
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,812
Do you have any tips for me?

224
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:47,845
No idea.

225
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,933
Hmm... Still, I think it's a good thing.

226
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,692
I've been sorta worried about her
always being completely alone in our class.

227
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:57,685
I think it's really great she's
made at least one friend here.

228
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,142
A friend, huh?

229
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:04,282
Well, just keep doing whatever you're doing,
cause maybe she'll warm up to the rest of us.

230
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:06,141
I mean, since we're all in the same class,

231
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,062
it'd be really for the best if everyone got a long,

232
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,527
and that's why I'm counting on you.

233
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:10,542
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

234
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,086
In fact, from now on, if there's
anything we need to say to her,

235
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,722
we'll just talk to you, and you can tell her for us.

236
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,900
Hey, hang on a sec! What do ya think I am;

237
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,093
Am I supposed to be your spokesperson or something?!

238
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,111
Pretty please?

239
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,889
Kyon, we're buddies, aren't we? We're pals, right?

240
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:36,762
<i>Everyone's turned into an idiot.</i>

241
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:39,701
<i>Apparently we're changing seats.</i>

242
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,704
<i>I picked a number out of a cookie tin that gave
me the seat next to the window second from the back.</i>

243
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,073
<i>An awesome seat if I may say so.</i>

244
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,139
<i>Farewell, Haruhi. Forever.</i>

245
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,484
<i>Coincidence?</i>

246
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,054
Hey, I heard you checked out all the clubs at school.

247
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:58,299
Give me a heads up if you know
about any interesting ones, okay?

248
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,789
Absolutely none.

249
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,835
<i>An instant reply.</i>

250
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,216
Absolutely none!

251
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:06,250
<i>It seems she likes to use the word "absolutely" a lot.</i>

252
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,281
I thought things would get a little
better when I got into highschool,

253
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,962
but it's the same here as it's been
throughout all these mandatory school years.

254
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,872
Maybe I'm just in the wrong school.

255
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,326
<i>I sorta wonder what her criteria are.</i>

256
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,864
There was a club called the "Mystery Research Club."

257
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,224
Yeah? How was that?

258
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:26,776
It was hilarious. They told me they've never
had anything they could even remotely call a case.

259
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,900
And the members were a bunch of mystery novel otakus.

260
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,883
Definitely not master detectives.

261
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:32,987
<i>Well, that figures.</i>

262
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:36,936
Yeah, well I had high hopes for the
Supernatural Phenomenon Research Club, too,

263
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,433
but that thing was just a bunch of occult freaks.

264
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,506
What do you think of it?

265
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:41,551
I don't think about it.

266
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,579
Oh man! I'm so bored!

267
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:47,510
With all these clubs, you'd think they're be
a couple of really strange cool ones out there.

268
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,442
Listen, you can't help it if there aren't any.

269
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:53,796
Besides, us normal human types, we gotta be happy
with what we're given, you know what I'm saying?

270
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,059
You could look at it this way:

271
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,031
The people who don't like what
they got are the same people

272
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,048
who invent things and make
discoveries and advance civilization.

273
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,154
They made airplanes 'cause they wanted to fly,

274
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:04,958
and they made cars and trains 'cause
they wanted to go from place to place.

275
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,164
It's as simple as that.

276
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,956
The only reason that we've got
all the things we have now...

277
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,025
is because a certain group of people got together...

278
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,092
and used their talent or imagination or
genius or whatever to make it all possible.

279
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:19,788
Ordinary people are probably better off living
their ordinary, little lives in an ordinary manner.

280
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:20,640
Shut up.

281
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:21,434
Hmm?

282
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,584
<i>Perhaps it was this conversation that sparked the idea...</i>

283
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:31,311
<i>It happened suddenly.</i>

284
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,596
What's wrong with you?!

285
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:39,871
I got an idea!

286
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,034
About what?

287
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,110
I can't believe I didn't realize it before!

288
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,548
It's so obvious!

289
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:45,376
What is?

290
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,996
If it doesn't exist, I should just make it myself!

291
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,482
Make what yourself?

292
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:50,839
Make a club!

293
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,329
I hear ya, but you gotta calm down, all right?

294
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,388
What's with you?! This is what we're talkin' about!

295
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,564
You should be happy you're about this development.

296
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,201
Well... we're in the middle of class.

297
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,064
You're gonna help.

298
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,817
<i>I feel like I'm being bullied outta my lunch money.</i>

299
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:18,171
What d'ya need help with?

300
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,154
Starting my new club, that's what!

301
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,154
First, tell me why I'm the one who's gotta help
you set up a club that's your idea in the first place.

302
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,678
And you can let go of the tie, now.

303
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,833
I'll find us a room and some members, and I
want you to personally handle all the paperwork...

304
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,214
<i>She's not listening.</i>

305
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,179
Why don't you tell me what kind of club it's gonna be.

306
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:35,911
Who cares about that right now?!

307
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,780
We've gotta go make the club first!

308
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:40,804
You got it? Do all that stuff before school ends today.

309
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,848
I'll find a room for the club by then!

310
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,054
Okie-dokie?

311
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:48,829
<i>Rules for the creation of a new extra-curricular group...</i>

312
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,184
<i>At least five members, a teacher to supervise,</i>

313
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,800
<i>a name, the name of the person in charge,</i>

314
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,377
<i>the purpose of the organization.</i>

315
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:57,965
<i>There's nothing for me to do.</i>

316
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,318
<i>It's all in the back of the student handbook.</i>

317
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,621
<i>And I can bet money on this:</i>

318
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,883
<i>Haruhi's little scheme?</i>

319
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:07,644
<i>Nothing about it's gonna contribute to
making school life more creative or more fun.</i>

320
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,132
<i>Of that I'm positive.</i>

321
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,282
This is going to be our new clubroom!

322
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,220
Hang on, I don't even know where we are right now.

323
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,540
This is the cultural department!

324
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,220
The art club's got the art room,

325
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:25,085
and the wind ensemble has got the music room, am I right?

326
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:30,456
Club's that don't need specialized classrooms like
that end up in this wing of the cultural department.

327
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,284
They call it the old building.

328
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,065
This room's for the literary club.

329
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,889
So then it's the literary club's room.

330
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:41,754
Yeah, I know, I know, but this past spring all the
senior members left, so now the club's got no members.

331
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,732
And if nobody else joins, then that club's gonna be cut.

332
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,258
Oh, and this girl's a new freshman member.

333
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,389
So, the club hasn't been cut then.

334
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:51,725
It's the same difference.

335
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,638
Besides, she's the only one here.

336
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,251
But what're we gonna do with her?

337
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,180
She told me that she wouldn't mind it.

338
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,428
You sure about that?

339
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,490
When I saw her at lunch, I asked
her if we could use the club room.

340
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:05,365
She said go ahead. She doesn't really
care as long as she has a place to read.

341
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,672
I guess some folks are just strange like that, you know?

342
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:09,864
<i>Look who's talking...</i>

343
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,769
Yuki Nagato...

344
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:17,261
Miss... Nagato, was it?

345
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:21,126
You understand my colleague here wants to
use this room for some other type of club.

346
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,418
Are you okay with that?

347
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,302
I'm fine.

348
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,091
You are?

349
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:27,481
O-Okay, but I'm pretty sure we're gonna
end up causing you a lot of trouble though.

350
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,507
No problem.

351
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,879
But someday you might get kicked out of this room.

352
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:31,810
Go ahead.

353
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:34,932
Well, there you have it!

354
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,340
From now on, we're gonna meet
here in this room right after school.

355
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:42,219
And ya better show up, mister, 'cause
if you don't it's the death penalty!

356
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,055
Understood.

357
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:46,142
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

358
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,328
We need to find club members.

359
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,686
We're gonna need at least two more people.

360
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,675
What, that means you already have that
literary club girl included in the head count?

361
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:58,219
<i>Does Haruhi think she comes with
the room like some kind of accessory?</i>

362
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,702
Don't worry, I'll get 'em in no time.

363
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,630
I gotta couple leads on some random people I can bring in.

364
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,831
<i>And so, the next day...</i>

365
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,156
I'll meet ya there!

366
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,307
<i>I guess I had no choice.</i>

367
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:14,101
<i>I found myself shuffling over to the club room.</i>

368
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,859
So, whatcha readin'?

369
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,347
Is it interesting?

370
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:24,988
Unique.

371
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,448
So, what part's unique?

372
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:29,308
All of it.

373
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,460
Huh, you really like books.

374
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:34,776
A little...

375
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,252
I see...

376
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,876
<i>Can I go home now?</i>

377
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,258
Sorry about that!

378
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,526
I'm a little late today 'cause
it took me forever to catch her.

379
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:51,526
<i>It was another girl. A really beautiful girl.</i>

380
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,175
Where am I? W-Why did you bring me here?

381
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,267
Who are you people anyway?

382
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,816
Why are you locking the door?!

383
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,881
What do you want from me?!

384
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,042
Just be quiet.

385
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,903
Allow me to introduce Mikuru Asahina.

386
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,139
<i>So much for introductions.</i>

387
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,861
Where did you kidnap her from?

388
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:17,591
I didn't kidnap anyone, she came here on her own.

389
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:18,793
<i>Same difference.</i>

390
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:22,183
I caught this one daydreaming her
brains out in the junior's classroom.

391
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,638
During recess, I make it a point to
walk every inch of the main building.

392
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:29,205
I remembered seeing her around a
couple of times, and, well, here she is.

393
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,723
<i>So that's why I haven't seen her during recess.</i>

394
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:32,940
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

395
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,293
Uh, hang on a second, did you say she was a junior?

396
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:37,999
Well, so what if she is?

397
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,719
Yeah... Um, it's Miss Asahina, wasn't it?

398
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,514
Why pick her of all people then?

399
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,556
What're you, blind? Just look at her!

400
00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:49,131
She's a total little cutie!

401
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,609
<i>Great. Now she sounds like a pervert.</i>

402
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:55,664
In this situation, moe is an
important concept to keep in mind.

403
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,314
Sorry, what'd you say?

404
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,756
Moe! Moe!

405
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,830
This girl's a prime example of moe.

406
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,580
It's a rule that in stories with strange things going on,

407
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,566
you need to have one moe character.

408
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:08,550
Someone with glasses or in a maid costume,

409
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,679
or anything fetish-y. It's essential.

410
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:14,052
And that's just the beginning!

411
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:20,268
She's tiny, but she's got bigger breasts than me!

412
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,585
I mean, look at these things! They're immense!

413
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,987
This is another important aspect of moe!

414
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:25,812
<i>Indeed...</i>

415
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,943
Man, these suckers are huge!

416
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:29,343
It kinda pisses me off.

417
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,967
I mean, she's so cute and her
boobies are ginormous compared to mine.

418
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,156
What're you, an idiot?

419
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,475
But they're totally huge! Really!

420
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,001
You wanna feel 'em for yourself?

421
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,305
I think I'm gonna pass.

422
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,061
So Haruhi, you brought this girl, Miss Asahina,

423
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:47,254
all the way up here just because she happens
to be cute, tiny, and extremely well-endowed?

424
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,696
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

425
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:49,615
That's right!

426
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,610
<i>She truly is an idiot.</i>

427
00:21:51,635 --> 00:21:54,949
I figured what the club needs
more than anything is a mascot.

428
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,333
Mikuru, are you a member of
any other school clubs right now?

429
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,983
The calligraphy club...

430
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,458
Oh, you can quit that one.

431
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:03,827
It'll just get in the way of our club's activities.

432
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:17,388
Well...

433
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:18,880
Okay...

434
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,150
I understand...

435
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,342
<i>What did she understand?</i>

436
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:25,348
I'm going to quit the calligraphy club and join this one.

437
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:29,535
However, I don't really know what the literary
club does, could you at least tell me that?

438
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:31,791
We're not the literary club, Mikuru.

439
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,176
We're sorta borrowing this clubroom for now,

440
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:37,508
and the group you're about to join is
something that Suzumiya is gonna be starting up,

441
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:42,366
and so far she hasn't figured out a name and has
absolutely no idea what we're gonna be doing here anyway.

442
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:46,918
Oh, and by the way, the girl siting over there
reading the book is the real literary club member.

443
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,092
Oh...

444
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:49,711
Okay, I've got it!

445
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,100
I just figured out what we're gonna call ourselves!

446
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:53,703
Well, spit it out.

447
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:56,347
<i>May I have your attention please.</i>

448
00:22:56,372 --> 00:23:01,028
<i>The name of the hereto for nameless start up
club has just been decided and its name is...</i>

449
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:03,070
The SOS Brigade!

450
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:09,436
<i>The "Spreading Excitement All Over
the World. With Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade".</i>

451
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,080
<i>The SOS Brigade for short.</i>

452
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,510
<i>Yeah... It's okay to laugh now.</i>

453
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,178
<i>Actually, the name should be something like,</i>

454
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:21,033
<i>"Spreading Excitement All Over the
World With Haruhi Suzumiya Organization",</i>

455
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:24,075
<i>but we don't have the right to form an organization yet.</i>

456
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,786
