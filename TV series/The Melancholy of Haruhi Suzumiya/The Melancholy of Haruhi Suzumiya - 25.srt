1
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,996
<i>Her name is Mikuru Asahina.</i>

2
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,969
<i>On the outside, she seems like a
normal, kind, and extremely cute girl.</i>

3
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,196
<i>But in reality, she's a battle waitress from the future.</i>

4
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:58,423
<i>Don't ask me why she's from the future or why
she's a waitress 'cause that's not important right now.</i>

5
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,726
<i>It's just a couple of minor details
you need to have shoved down your throat,</i>

6
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,899
<i>before this particular story can kick into gear.</i>

7
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:12,268
Um... Not to bother you people or anything. We got a
lotta good, crispy nappa cabbage in the store today.

8
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:15,501
Uh... Did I mention that for the next hour only,

9
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:18,816
all nappa cabbage is on sale for half price!

10
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,684
<i>By the way, earlier I mentioned she was a battle waitress,</i>

11
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:26,051
<i>so you're probably wondering why
she's wearing a bunny girl costume here.</i>

12
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:27,935
<i>You see, that's because during the day,</i>

13
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,966
<i>she has a part-time job attracting customers
to the store in the local shopping area.</i>

14
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:33,754
I can't believe it.

15
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,835
Look, the nappa cabbage is cheap today.

16
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:41,187
Yes, we should hurry up and buy some.

17
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,132
Hi, Mikuru! Looks like you're workin' hard out here today.

18
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:48,148
Why, yes! I'm trying my best!

19
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,864
<i>Mikuru answers cheerfully,</i>

20
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,215
<i>in an outfit that screams "trying too hard."</i>

21
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:56,588
<i>And so, thanks to her innocent charm,
the nappa cabbage sold out in record time.</i>

22
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:58,730
You worked so hard.

23
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,952
Sorry this isn't much, but I want you to have it.

24
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,725
Oh, no! I'm sure it's more than enough!

25
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,889
I should be the one apologizing to you.

26
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:11,223
This is pretty much all I can do anyway.

27
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:22,085
See you later. I have to head over to the
butcher shop right away now, without delay.

28
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:25,343
Accuse me... Ah! Excuse me.

29
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,089
<i>The girl had become a sort of
mascot for the local retailers.</i>

30
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:34,423
<i>And she was loved by all the
people who lived in the neighborhood.</i>

31
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:36,560
<i>You can do it, Mikuru!</i>

32
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:41,113
<i>Bring back the customers who flock like lemmings to
that huge mega-warehouse store that opened last year.</i>

33
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:46,077
<i>The fate of this neighborhood and its mom and
pop stores is riding on your shoulders, Mikuru.</i>

34
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:50,615
<i>Unfortunately, none of this
has anything to do with the story.</i>

35
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,244
<i>Anyway, getting back to the story,</i>

36
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,619
<i>she's actually a battle waitress.</i>

37
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:04,374
<i>She was sent back in time to secretly watch
over someone, and make sure no harm came to them.</i>

38
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,043
<i>And that someone's name is Itsuki Koizumi.</i>

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,501
<i>Looking at him, you'd think he was your average,
carefree high school student. In reality, he's an ESPer.</i>

40
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:16,409
<i>Unfortunately, he's not aware of his powers yet.</i>

41
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:22,985
<i>It seems he needs a catalyst or trigger to awaken all
the super, incredible powers lying dormant within him.</i>

42
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:32,008
<i>She looks like she's got a high school crush on
a boy who she can't express her true feelings to.</i>

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,532
<i>But, we'll just say that was a little sigh
of relief because she saw Itsuki was safe.</i>

44
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:42,887
<i>Mikuru finishes her other part-time job,
which also requires her to be scantily clad,</i>

45
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:46,877
<i>and goes home to her tiny room at
the back of the stationery store.</i>

46
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:54,350
Aah, welcome back. My, Mikuru, you seem a bit tired.

47
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,714
Oh, well, I'm fine. Really.

48
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,770
There were a lot of customers today.

49
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,304
It was quite a busy day!

50
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:05,268
Aah, that's good. Have a good evening.

51
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:18,171
<i>With her work done for the day,</i>

52
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,685
<i>Mikuru can finally take off that sleazy outfit,</i>

53
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,238
<i>change into something comfier,</i>

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,489
<i>and settle down for a good night's sleep.</i>

55
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:28,960
<i>Okay, we stopped the camera just
before she took her clothes off.</i>

56
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,608
<i>So, don't bother asking us for the
footage 'cause we don't have it. Honest!</i>

57
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,879
<i>Yuki Nagato stands here dramatically.</i>

58
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,485
<i>Although we don't really know why,</i>

59
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:47,174
<i>you could say she's not an ordinary
girl, and maybe she's a little weird.</i>

60
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:52,115
<i>Well, you're right because she's
actually an evil witch who's also an alien.</i>

61
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:58,078
<i>Okay, at this point, you're supposed to get that
Yuki's planning something diabolical that involves Itsuki.</i>

62
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:01,966
<i>But there's no reason for her to be hanging
out at the high school after he's gone home.</i>

63
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,501
<i>Also, the lighting's changed. It
was early evening in the last scene.</i>

64
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,603
<i>But now, it's obviously the middle of the day!</i>

65
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:12,558
<i>I mean, you can do whatever you want, but inserting
cut scenes like this makes it really hard for the editor.</i>

66
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:14,105
<i>Moving right along,</i>

67
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,628
<i>we've got the first battle scene between Mikuru and Yuki.</i>

68
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,107
<i>All the stuff about them meeting for the
first time, and the reason why they're fighting,</i>

69
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:23,455
<i>I guess that's all gonna be left up to
the viewers' imagination for various reasons,</i>

70
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,046
<i>which shall remain unexplained.</i>

71
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:30,213
<i>In fact, with the way this has been going,
we'll be lucky if this movie makes any sense at all.</i>

72
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:40,446
Koizum... Uh, I mean Itsuki, is
not a person that you can control!

73
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,985
I'll protect him with all I've got!

74
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,741
<i>Allow me to explain:</i>

75
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:54,088
<i>The, uh, staff with the creative design?</i>

76
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:57,686
<i>It's called the Starring Inferno,
and it's supposed to be a magic wand.</i>

77
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,652
It's time to use my secret weapon!

78
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:07,855
Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!

79
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:09,905
<i>Let me explain.</i>

80
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,976
<i>The Mikuru Beam is a super dangerous laser beam.</i>

81
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,548
<i>That shoots out of Mikuru Asahina's left eye.</i>

82
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,657
Cut! Cut!

83
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,816
<i>I'm literally on the edge of my seat
wondering what's gonna happen next.</i>

84
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,768
<i>Will Mikuru escape?</i>

85
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,280
<i>And why has Itsuki suddenly shown up?</i>

86
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:27,959
Th-This store is...

87
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,881
The owner's a really friendly person!

88
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,750
He's a really nice guy!

89
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:41,652
They've been in business ever since Mr. Eijiro's
grandpa opened it. Uh... It's all right here!

90
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:44,128
Batteries to refrigerators, they have it all!

91
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:48,561
Uh... And they... have a lot of things...

92
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:53,350
J-Just hope on down to Ohmori Electronics,
where good deals are made every day!

93
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,211
<i>Following her defeat,</i>

94
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:01,171
<i>Mikuru walks the streets alone, deep in thought.</i>

95
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,897
The Mikuru Beam had no effect on that alien witch.

96
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,610
What will I do now?

97
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:15,177
<i>Other heroes can transform into their alter egos,</i>

98
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,191
<i>but Mikuru has to change her clothes.</i>

99
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,790
<i>You see, she's off to work
again today, and mustn't be late.</i>

100
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:27,576
<i>Meanwhile, Itsuki was walking along,
staring blankly at the world as he always does.</i>

101
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,607
And who might you be?

102
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:39,332
I am an alien from beyond the
stars that uses the art of magic.

103
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,184
Well, is that so?

104
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:43,660
It is.

105
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,376
And what do you want with me?

106
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:50,268
I have come from outer space with only one goal:

107
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:52,276
To take your hidden powers from you.

108
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,799
What would you do if I said you were being a nuisance?

109
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,197
I am prepared to use force if I have to
to take your hidden powers away from you.

110
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,749
Just how would you use force to obtain my powers?

111
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:05,785
Like this.

112
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,458
Look out!

113
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,115
Uh... I will never let you get
away with him, you alien witch, you.

114
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:22,158
You have won today's round, Battle Waitress.

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,249
And I promise you won't be so lucky next time.

116
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,589
Please make your funeral arrangements,
for when next we meet, it will be the last.

117
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:34,880
Next time, you may be certain that I will intend
to take you down and destroy you with no mercy.

118
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,604
And who might you be?

119
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,641
Just an innocent bunny girl passing through here.

120
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,701
That's all I am. Well, goodbye!

121
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,418
Just who in the world, is she?

122
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,955
<i>With a forced look of awe on his face,</i>

123
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,810
<i>Itsuki watches Mikuru run off.</i>

124
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:07,210
<i>And what's with the camera tilting up like this?</i>

125
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,951
<i>Once again, a huge chunk of the story has been left out.</i>

126
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,379
<i>After this and that, involving you-know-what,</i>

127
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,451
<i>uh... the flames of battle have burst up again.</i>

128
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:16,201
<i>I think.</i>

129
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,867
E-E-Even in times like this, I won't ever run away!

130
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,079
Y-You're an evil, bad alien...

131
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:27,071
...and now, you'd better leave this planet at once!

132
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:33,576
But it is you who should leave
this time plane immediately, not I.

133
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,402
For we shall seize him and his hidden powers.

134
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,379
For he is very valuable to us, you see.

135
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:43,737
And while we're seizing him and his
hidden powers, we will also invade the Earth.

136
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,331
I-I won't let you get away with that!

137
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,648
I will risk my own life to stop you!

138
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:52,410
Prepare yourself then, for I am about to take your life.

139
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,206
But Tsuruya! Don't tell me that even you...

140
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,678
Please get yourself back together!

141
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,721
I can't take you seriously when you're dressed like that.

142
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:19,817
I'm sorry, Mikuru. I'm being
controlled by the alien right now.

143
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:22,092
Here goes nothing...

144
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:28,887
<i>Uh... Some kind of electromagnetic waves
coming out of the so-called Starring Inferno wand,</i>

145
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:32,616
<i>has turned Tsuruya and the guys
into a trio of mindless puppets.</i>

146
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:34,456
<i>Now she's trapped!</i>

147
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:36,126
<i>What are you going to do, Mikuru?</i>

148
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,426
<i>She couldn't do anything.</i>

149
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:42,658
What's happened?

150
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,244
Just grab my hand, it's okay.

151
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:51,244
<i>Okay, Itsuki just showed up,
but where's he been all this time?</i>

152
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,372
<i>I think they accidentally got
him in the shot a few moments ago.</i>

153
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,471
The water's so cold...

154
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,613
Would you please tell me just what
in the world you were doing here today?

155
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,152
Huh? Um.. Oh, yeah.

156
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:08,242
Evil people and the lake and uh... I don't...

157
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:10,323
This is when you're supposed to faint!

158
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,874
Get a hold of yourself!

159
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:19,210
<i>Normally, in a situation like this, you'd call an
ambulance or flag down a passerby to get some help.</i>

160
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,774
<i>But this boy decides to carry this
unconscious, innocent, young beauty,</i>

161
00:12:22,894 --> 00:12:24,944
<i>and is attempting to take her away somewhere!</i>

162
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:25,908
<i>Damn you!</i>

163
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,967
<i>Anyway, Yuki's gang seems to have bailed without
finishing Mikuru off, which they totally could've done.</i>

164
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:33,114
<i>With so many mysteries, contradictions,</i>

165
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:37,937
<i>and plot threads left dangling, we tilt up again
as the story finally reaches the halfway point.</i>

166
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:40,355
<i>Hold on, we're only halfway through this thing?</i>

167
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:46,986
<i>We're back!</i>

168
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,701
<i>And I think we're in Itsuki's house.</i>

169
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:52,182
<i>What bothers me, though, is that
Mikuru, who's been carried here by Itsuki,</i>

170
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,012
<i>looks like she's just gotten out of the bath!</i>

171
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>Maybe we're supposed to think that she was
given a bath by Itsuki while she was unconscious?!</i>

172
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,475
<i>You gotta be kidding me!</i>

173
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,001
<i>Then this would be the point where
anyone's doubt turns into a white-hot rage,</i>

174
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,092
<i>building into a desire to kill.</i>

175
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,478
<i>But for now, I will not give it much thought, doing
away with all the emotions that might be bubbling up.</i>

176
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:17,772
<i>We are, after all, just watching a movie with
actors, playing characters. This isn't reality, right?</i>

177
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,019
<i>O-Okay, how is this happening right now?</i>

178
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:33,391
<i>If your mouth gets any closer to her, someone standing off
camera is gonna step into frame and kick your ass, dammit!</i>

179
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,973
Hold it right there.

180
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,645
Itsuki Koizumi...

181
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,871
You should not be making the choice of that female.

182
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,744
You must choose me instead,

183
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:49,021
for the true potential of your hidden powers
will only be realized when they mingle with my power.

184
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,719
Please explain exactly what you mean by that.

185
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:55,250
Okay, why isn't he at least a little
surprised to see Yuki at the window?

186
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:00,152
All I can tell you at this very moment is
that you have two choices before you right now.

187
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,685
The first choice is to be with me and to
make this universe evolve into what it should be,

188
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,426
and the second is to be with her,
but that will only destroy the future.

189
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,044
<i>Itsuki was worried now, more than he ever was.</i>

190
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:17,499
<i>But, what Nagato... I mean, Yuki. What she
said just now, she was talking about him, right?</i>

191
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:18,864
Very well!

192
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:20,645
I understand that he...

193
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,728
No, in this scene, it's me, so I...

194
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:28,058
I am a kind a of key, and a key all by
itself does not have any power whatsoever!

195
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,659
And a key is nothing but a tool
with which you can open the door.

196
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:35,045
And when that door is finally
opened, something is going to change.

197
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,349
And I know that what will change is...

198
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:42,147
That's about all I understand, Yuki.

199
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,877
But right now, I don't have
the right to make that decision.

200
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,496
In fact, I think it's far too early
for me to come up with a decision.

201
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:52,034
Maybe we should put all of this
deciding stuff on hold for a while,

202
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,080
I really feel that we need more
time to think this whole thing through.

203
00:14:55,448 --> 00:15:00,001
Although, if you ever decide to tell me the
whole truth about it, now that is a different story.

204
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,900
There will be time enough for that in the near future.

205
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:06,284
I know that now is definitely not the time for it.

206
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:12,168
We consider a lack of information to be more
of an obstacle, a handicap, a critical flaw.

207
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:17,708
We are unable to make decisions based on
information that relies on what is possible or probable.

208
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,149
<i>You could say they're setting up a plot
line, but that dialogue was incomprehensible!</i>

209
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:26,111
<i>The important thing to note is that the two
of them have reached some sort of understanding.</i>

210
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:33,076
Uh, I'm standing here in front
of Keiji Yamatsuchi's Model Shop.

211
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:36,616
He opened it last year after
quitting his dead-end corporate job.

212
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:41,530
And models were his hobby, so
he figured why not open a store.

213
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:46,250
Unfortunately, his sales have been down for a while.

214
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:54,166
And compared to last year, his first-half
earnings for this year are down about 80%.

215
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:58,404
And so, everyone should come down
here and buy lots of models! Thank you!

216
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,351
Huh? You want me to hold it?

217
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:15,832
Y-You should never shoot this while pointing it at
other people. You should only shoot empty cans with it!

218
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,705
Huh? You want me to shoot?

219
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,151
<i>I know you've probably lost
all interest in the story by now,</i>

220
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,910
<i>but here's an interesting development.</i>

221
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:30,276
<i>Mikuru and Itsuki have started living together.</i>

222
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:35,749
<i>Well, now this is like one of
those cute, young housewives' shows.</i>

223
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,786
<i>And it makes you wonder what all
those sci-fi battle scenes were about.</i>

224
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:44,386
<i>Are they trying to spice up the story by tossing out
the plot and throwing all of those moe situations at us?</i>

225
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:50,603
<i>And who the heck is that supposed
to be? Is she Itsuki's little sister?</i>

226
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,927
<i>And wasn't that cat staying on
Yuki's shoulder a couple of scenes ago?</i>

227
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,496
<i>Now, Yuki tries a different plan.</i>

228
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,279
<i>And it looks like she's
transferred into Itsuki's high school.</i>

229
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,293
<i>Yuki attempts to ensnare Itsuki by using her sex appeal.</i>

230
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,695
<i>And if you ask me, I guess I'd have to
say that all's fair in love and war, right?</i>

231
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,080
<i>Eventually, Mikuru also transfers
into the same high school.</i>

232
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:28,085
<i>You might be thinking, if her job is to protect
him, why didn't she infiltrate his school earlier.</i>

233
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,649
<i>But, you're asking the wrong guy.</i>

234
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:34,358
<i>Yuki and Mikuru's story of battling has
now turned into a heated romantic comedy.</i>

235
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:37,295
<i>Or rather, nothing more than a love triangle.</i>

236
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,578
<i>When they're at school, they seem to
have agreed to a truce of some sort.</i>

237
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:46,543
<i>We must've missed the scene where they do
the whole "realizing your true nature" thing,</i>

238
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,702
<i>and the two of them are now back to pretending
to be the battle waitress and the alien magician...</i>

239
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,800
<i>engaging in really lame fight scenes.</i>

240
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,559
<i>As for what's gonna happen next,</i>

241
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:57,139
<i>even I, the cameraman, don't know the answer.</i>

242
00:17:57,304 --> 00:18:00,889
<i>It's a fight to the death that
completely lacks any sense of excitement.</i>

243
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:13,331
<i>This schizophrenic story reaches its final act,</i>

244
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,403
<i>as if it were written by a drunk child.</i>

245
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:19,356
<i>I'm assuming the director of this film
felt that they needed to end things quickly,</i>

246
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:21,150
<i>and it really didn't matter how they did it.</i>

247
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,009
<i>It's a bit late, but that's okay.</i>

248
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,342
<i>Anyhow, Yuki challenges Mikuru to a final showdown.</i>

249
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,504
I see now.

250
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,078
<i>What exactly did she see?</i>

251
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:35,026
Why the long face, Mikuru? Is
another creepy old geezer stalking you?

252
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:37,910
Or did your doctor tell you you've got athlete's foot?

253
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,368
The time has finally come at last!

254
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:46,286
I must go and have the final
battle with the evil alien witch!

255
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:50,200
That sounds amazing, Mikuru. We're counting on you.

256
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,989
The Earth is in your...

257
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,605
<i>I know I'm nitpicking here, but I don't
see how Mikuru and Tsuruya know each other.</i>

258
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,846
<i>Sure, you could say that they met after
Mikuru transferred to the high school,</i>

259
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,896
<i>but then how does that explain the scene
where Tsuruya attacked Mikuru at the lake?</i>

260
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,600
<i>That happened before Mikuru started going to the school.</i>

261
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,001
<i>That's a huge error in continuity
and if you don't know what to do next,</i>

262
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,187
<i>slowly pan the camera and shoot the sky...</i>

263
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:15,366
<i>Anyway, we've reached the climax of the film... finally.</i>

264
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,945
And now, let us settle the final score once and for all.

265
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,927
I am afraid that you and I do not
have very much time left anymore.

266
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,525
We must resolve our conflict
before our lunch break is over.

267
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,729
That is something we both agree on!

268
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:33,459
However, I'm positive that Itsuki
will say that he's gonna choose me!

269
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,826
Um... Well, I just know that he's gonna pick me!

270
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:41,630
That is unfortunate for you because I do
not intend to acknowledge his free will at all.

271
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,351
At last, his hidden powers will all be mine.

272
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:47,297
<i>If she wants him so badly, why
doesn't she just go and get him?</i>

273
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,909
<i>Am I the only one thinking this?</i>

274
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,650
I won't let you do it!

275
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:55,197
That is the reason why I have come
here all the way from the future!

276
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:13,277
Jump!

277
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,625
Mikuru! You have to get up and fight! Hurry!

278
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,837
Hey! What's going on out...

279
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:26,918
<i>Never-mind the teacher that came bursting
through the door, the battle continues on the roof.</i>

280
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,040
<i>And it looks like Mikuru's finally been cornered.</i>

281
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,451
It's really high...

282
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:35,360
The time has come for you to give in to me.

283
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,635
The hour of doom is at hand.

284
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:41,962
<i>Yuki unleashes her death blow upon the helpless Mikuru.</i>

285
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:46,666
<i>I know the special effects here are weak, but there's
really no other way to make this thing more thrilling.</i>

286
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,093
<i>So please, use your imagination to embellish.</i>

287
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:51,753
<i>It really looks hopeless! What'll you do, Mikuru?</i>

288
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:57,558
Are you all right?

289
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,385
That's enough, Yuki! Stop this at once!

290
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,238
Stop talking and get on with it.

291
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,003
The only thing you have To do is take
over his mind, and then we're done here.

292
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,414
It's not like you haven't done something like that before,

293
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,337
so just wave your little stick at him and...

294
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,612
I am also a ventriloquist.

295
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:19,650
Take this, Itsuki Koizumi.

296
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:23,518
I will now proceed to take
control of your thoughts and actions.

297
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,487
Curses!

298
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,657
At last, it is over, Miss Asahina.

299
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:46,300
<i>Itsuki's unexplainable powers have awakened,</i>

300
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:50,162
<i>and Yuki, the alien witch, was transported
to the far reaches of the universe.</i>

301
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:54,795
<i>Peace has returned to our
world. Thank you, Mikuru Asahina.</i>

302
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:59,352
<i>And thank you, Itsuki Koizumi.
All is well, that ends well.</i>

303
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,951
<i>And we're tilting up again?</i>

304
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,335
This story is a work of fiction.

305
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:16,149
All character names, organizations, incidents,
and any other names, phenomena, and such,

306
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,741
are fictional as well. It's all made up.

307
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,282
Even if it resembles someone,
it's probably just a coincidence.

308
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:29,615
Except for the commercials. Shop at Ohmori Electronics and
Yamatsuchi's Model Shop for great deals! Stop by and buy!

309
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,079
Huh?! I gotta say it again?

310
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:38,388
This story is a work of fiction. All character
names, organizations, incidents, and any other names...

311
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:41,947
Hey, Kyon! Why do I have to say all this stuff anyway?

312
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,421
It's finished!

313
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,877
That totally rocked!

314
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:53,297
The SOS Brigade doesn't know the
meaning of the word "impossible!"

315
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:54,654
Isn't that right, Kyon?

316
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:57,002
<i>You're actually gonna show this to people?!</i>

317
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,293
It's so good the theater will be packed
for every screening during the arts festival!

318
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,546
Maybe we should charge admission to see the film!

319
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,774
Oh! I should touch base with the Film Club...

320
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:10,235
<i>I think I'm gonna skip the festival
today and take a nap somewhere.</i>

321
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:11,762
Right, Kyon?
