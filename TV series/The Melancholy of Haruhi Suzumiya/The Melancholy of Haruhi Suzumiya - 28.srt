1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,352
<i>The arts festival and its chaotic aftermath were over.</i>

2
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:18,532
<i>The mountains winds are beginning to whip up, and you
can just hear the footsteps of winter drawing ever closer.</i>

3
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,677
<i>December is almost upon us.</i>

4
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:25,249
<i>Now this old building, also known as the club
room wing, has been here since the school was built.</i>

5
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:28,630
<i>And thanks in part to its thin
walls, even though we were inside,</i>

6
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,284
<i>you could still feel the chill right down to your bones.</i>

7
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,536
The SOS Brigade always seems to
get involved with strange things.

8
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,574
Well, actually, I'm the one
getting involved with strange things.

9
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:56,877
<i>But even so, it's not something weird
has to happen to us on a daily basis.</i>

10
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:02,520
<i>Besides, if life dropped a crazy bomb on me every
day, my body wouldn't take it. And it'd just crumble.</i>

11
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,648
<i>It would be even worse for my mood.</i>

12
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:14,693
<i>Still, when Haruhi isn't around, it's really quiet.</i>

13
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,745
<i>It's kinda nice.</i>

14
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:21,098
<i>Then again, maybe it's a bit too quiet.</i>

15
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:32,665
<i>Come to think of it, it's been six months since
I first met Haruhi, Miss Asahina, and the others.</i>

16
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,665
<i>We've been through a lot together.</i>

17
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:41,187
<i>And sure, Haruhi's provoked a lot
of it, but not necessarily all of it.</i>

18
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,649
<i>Well, either way, one thing's for sure.</i>

19
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:47,034
<i>It was always at times like this when
we were just kicking back and relaxing...</i>

20
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,438
<i>that Haruhi would bust through that door...</i>

21
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:49,782
Everyone! Listen up!

22
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:51,641
I've got some really good news!

23
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:53,224
<i>What? Again?</i>

24
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,787
<i>Whenever Haruhi describes something as being "good,"</i>

25
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,803
<i>news or otherwise, rarely has that ever been the case.</i>

26
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,994
<i>And that's especially true for Miss Asahina and myself.</i>

27
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,861
What is it this time?

28
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,982
I've got everything all set up to get
us a heater for this ice box of a room.

29
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:12,930
Oh! Your tea!

30
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,435
You know that appliance store that sponsored our movie?
Well, I just got the owner to give us a heater for free!

31
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:22,171
He called me up and said he had an
extra heater he wanted to get rid of!

32
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:26,351
It's a model from last year, and it's been
sitting in storage so long, they forgot they had it!

33
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:30,495
<i>I just can't believe there's an appliance store
owner out there who's both willing and kind enough...</i>

34
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,441
<i>to call Haruhi and offer her anything.</i>

35
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,178
<i>I'm sure she must've forced the deal on him somehow.</i>

36
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:39,140
Okay, Kyon! I want you to go to the
store and pick it up for us right now.

37
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,794
Right now? Like now-now?

38
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,625
Right. You, now, right now.

39
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:44,205
Lemme get this straight:

40
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,697
You want me to go down the mountain, the
one I have to climb up and down every morning.

41
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:52,201
You want me to go down that thing right now to an
appliance store that is two whole train stations away,

42
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,135
pick up a heater, and then lug that thing back here?

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,332
That's right! 'Cause if you don't, the guy might
change his mind, and then we're out a free heater!

44
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,431
Don't complain, just hurry up and go!

45
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:02,055
You're bored anyway, aren't ya?!

46
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,326
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

47
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,883
<i>Sitting in this room was enough
to label you as being bored, nice.</i>

48
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,301
Aren't you bored? Why don't you do it?

49
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:12,613
I can't! There's something important
I need to take care of right now.

50
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,518
Koizumi is the deputy chief, and
you're just a rank and file member.

51
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,441
That's the deal in every group I know of.

52
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:22,332
The grunts always work their butts off.

53
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,956
Naturally, the SOS Brigade totally supports that policy.

54
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:26,958
<i>Oh, well...</i>

55
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,746
<i>For once, Haruhi's made a reasonable request.</i>

56
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,781
<i>I give up.</i>

57
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,301
<i>Besides, I was just thinking how
this place could use a heater anyway.</i>

58
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,813
<i>If she's going to force Miss
Asahina or Nagato to go, then I'll go.</i>

59
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:46,137
Hold on!

60
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,041
I heard it's going to be chilly today!

61
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,393
Thank you.

62
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,848
Hurry up and go!

63
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:57,207
Go on, get going!

64
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,883
Well, now that he's outta the way,

65
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:28,039
Mikuru, I wanna take a couple of
pictures of you. Do you mind posing?

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,528
What are the pictures gonna be for?

67
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:31,801
It's for the DVD!

68
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:35,162
I'm gonna make a DVD of "The
Adventures of Mikuru Asahina."

69
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,549
And I still need to shoot a sexy cover for it.

70
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,957
Wha... You mean you're really
going to go through with that?

71
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:43,312
B-But I thought you said you weren't going to.

72
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,910
I just said that 'cause Kyon was naggin' me about it.

73
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,929
But now that I got rid of him, nothing's gonna stop me.

74
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:56,601
<i>The first day I had to climb this
hill to get to school, I hated it.</i>

75
00:06:56,993 --> 00:07:00,742
<i>But after walking up and down the thing for
the last six months, I've gotten used to it.</i>

76
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,955
<i>I've gotten used to A., hiking to and
from school, and B., the SOS Brigade.</i>

77
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:07,540
<i>Funny how that works.</i>

78
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:15,603
<i>I wonder what Haruhi's doing
right now, since I'm not around.</i>

79
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:20,073
<i>I just hope she's not bored and treating
Miss Asahina like some kind of toy or something.</i>

80
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:23,630
Koizumi! Hold the bounce card for me.

81
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,901
Right, got it.

82
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,810
Mikuru, stop spacing out! Pose!

83
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:29,310
Come on, pose! Pose!

84
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:31,196
O-Okay...

85
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:37,138
Come on, smile like you're flirting
with a cute guy. More seductive! Come on!

86
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:39,997
That's not gonna cut it for the male fans.

87
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,641
Get sultry, girl!

88
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,837
Cool! Costume change!

89
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:55,789
Put this one on!

90
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,083
Come on, stop stalling!

91
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:03,796
Mikuru! Come on! Let's go!

92
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,781
No! I can do it myself!

93
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,006
Like I haven't seen it before!

94
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,845
Here, it's faster if I help!

95
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,424
No, not my bra, too!

96
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,521
Well, you're gonna have to take it off anyway.

97
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:19,777
Mikuru! Wow, those things are
even bigger! You look dynamite, girl!

98
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:20,744
It's cold!

99
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:24,189
Hold still!

100
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,628
Oh! That's not good. My tea's gone cold.

101
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,493
Ohh... It's really cold in here!

102
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,729
Could we stop now? This is so embarrassing!

103
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,124
Mikuru... You need to have a
little more confidence in yourself.

104
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,353
You're the best mascot on campus! I wouldn't
have picked you if you didn't have what it takes!

105
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:50,563
Right, Koizumi?

106
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:52,195
It's exactly as you say.

107
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,576
Okay, next! Try this!

108
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,001
Again? No!

109
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,003
I can do that myself!

110
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:03,632
Hurry up!

111
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,554
We have to finish shooting this stuff today!

112
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:06,715
Come on!

113
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,627
Put this one on next!

114
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:25,296
But this nurse outfit and that one... Um... I don't
really remember wearing either one of them in the movie.

115
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:29,125
Are these pictures we're taking
really for the cover of the DVD?

116
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,599
Yeah! Of course they are!

117
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:33,017
But I just came up with another idea!

118
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:35,811
With all these photos, we can publish a picture book!

119
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,766
What do you think about that, Koizumi?

120
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:39,482
I think it's a great idea.

121
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,063
No! Wait!

122
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,362
The DVD needs a bonus features section!

123
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,048
We could put these pictures there!

124
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,617
What do you think about that idea, Koizumi?

125
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,633
I think it's a fantastic idea.

126
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,196
Stick your arm in there!

127
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:06,500
Looks like we might be in for a
little bit of rain today, doesn't it?

128
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:07,383
Nice!

129
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,742
It's the funniest thing ever.

130
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:09,989
You're kidding!

131
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,326
Well, no, not really.

132
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,397
Good! Next outfit!

133
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,000
What?! We've got more outfits?

134
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,028
Just gotta find the zipper...

135
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,805
No! I-I need that!

136
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,858
I want a shot of you flashing some panty at us!

137
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,779
So these have to go! And soon!

138
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:39,017
This is so fun! Taking all your clothes off!

139
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,823
Well, there's the heater I promised her.

140
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,673
Can you carry it back okay?

141
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:48,516
Oh, yeah. I think I can manage.

142
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,868
And about the girls, how are those
three cutie pies doin' these days?

143
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:54,828
Pretty good. The energetic
one's starting to get on my nerves.

144
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:56,916
The commercial help business any?

145
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,098
Honestly, I haven't seen any difference so far.

146
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,251
<i>Figures.</i>

147
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,891
<i>Putting a commercial in the middle of a
movie showing at a high school arts festival...</i>

148
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,402
<i>isn't what you'd call a stroke of marketing genius.</i>

149
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,513
<i>I'm surprised this guy actually sponsored it.</i>

150
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,452
That reminds me.

151
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:13,889
When the energetic one called today,
she mentioned something about a sequel.

152
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:16,705
Is it true? Are you really going to make another movie?

153
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,448
Well, if she says we're making another
movie, we're making another movie.

154
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:24,191
She asked if I'd want to sponsor it,
and I told her I'd be happy to, so...

155
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:29,636
So I guess you can consider this heater
my donation to your next cinematic wonder.

156
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,253
<i>So that's how she got it.</i>

157
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:32,944
Guess I'll head back now.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,396
Thank you very much for the heater.

159
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:36,783
No worries, take care!

160
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:46,447
Ameobas are red, a-i-u-e-o!

161
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:50,715
Little shrimp in floating moss, swimming to and fro!

162
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,874
Persimmon tree, chestnut tree, ka-ki-ku-ke-ko!

163
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:59,500
A woodpecker pecking at a dead zelkova tree just so!

164
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,397
Pour some vinegar on cow-peas, sa-shi-su-se-so!

165
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:09,804
I stabbed a fish in a stream that was very, very shallow!

166
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:16,355
We all stand up when the trumpet blows, ta-chi-tsu-te-to!

167
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,189
When we stood, it flew off with a...

168
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,226
Konk-konk-konk-konk-boom!

169
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,045
A slow crawls very slow, na-ni-nu-ne-no!

170
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,564
Na-ni-nu-ne-no!

171
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,956
Aha! So you are the culprit!

172
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:36,419
Oh, the red player has picked number 14!

173
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,677
Very well, I wonder how that's
going to affect the game today!

174
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,902
Next question!

175
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,277
Amazing! Just by showing up, she's
changed the atmosphere on the stage!

176
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,643
But she seems completely different, doesn't she?

177
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:50,315
She's not the same as she was a few minutes ago!

178
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,105
What a terrifying little girl!

179
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,375
Tanmen noodle set!

180
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,536
Fried rice set!

181
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:00,509
Tempura and cold soba set!

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,033
Young man, ace!

183
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,013
Middle aged, ace!

184
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,014
Retirement, ace!

185
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,169
Non-promoted, ace!

186
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,560
Next year, ace!

187
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,523
Unfortunate, ace!

188
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:16,161
I love it after all, ace!

189
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,880
Why don't you do your best to beat me?!

190
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,104
Bring it on!

191
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:25,394
What you guys have done is snappy,
crackly, and totally obvious to us!

192
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,020
He looks like a child!

193
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,886
But he's pretty subtle on the inside.

194
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,562
A powerful ally all over town!

195
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,798
Now, now, now, now!

196
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,687
Can you not see this crest that I hold?

197
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:44,251
Because... I... am the queen of France!

198
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,442
Now that hit a weird spot!

199
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:48,482
You've still got a way's to go!

200
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:05,528
Hello! We're the Arctic Sea ice candies!

201
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,149
Bang.

202
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,152
You know, Yuki, you're as sexy as ever!

203
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:10,302
Where are you lookin', pervert?

204
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,652
I'm callin' the cops.

205
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:12,967
Starting with a low blow?

206
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:15,969
I feel like I've been accused of
groping people on a crammed train.

207
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,578
Yeah. By the way, it's winter now.

208
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:18,753
Right, it's winter.

209
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:19,608
And speaking of winter...

210
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,715
Baseball's off season.

211
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,712
Cool point there, Yuki. Why, even
the WBC is shaking in their cleats!

212
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,427
I'm really looking forward to
seeing who gets the pink slip.

213
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,096
That's a really dark way of enjoying it.

214
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,685
But okay! Well, you know! It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

215
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,392
I wanna eat a hot pot.

216
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:34,035
Right!

217
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,231
You can't do without hot pots in winter!

218
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:37,964
What do you put in your hot pot?

219
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:41,819
Let's see! Nappa cabbage,
chicken, pork, leeks, natto, tofu!

220
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:43,152
Well, what about you, Yuki?

221
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:44,069
Brown bear.

222
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:45,902
Wow, Yuki! You're a hunter?

223
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,886
Even Masaki would cry and run away!

224
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,773
Yeah, but I think about how the bear feels.

225
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:51,453
I feel sorry for it and lose my appetite.

226
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:53,851
Then don't put it into your hot pot to begin with, woman!

227
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,637
I'll play the part of the brown bear.

228
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:56,662
What? You will?

229
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,812
And you play the pot.

230
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,142
Here it comes, folks!

231
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,437
The worst comedy skit in history! Get ready!

232
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:02,361
Hey, Kyon!

233
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,733
What are you lurkin' around down here for?

234
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:06,050
It's obvious, isn't it?

235
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:07,611
I'm carrying stuff around.

236
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:11,587
Hah! You sure are a hard worker! You're
running errands for Suzumiya, aren't you?

237
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:17,088
<i>I guess six months was all it took for my classmates to
fully comprehend the situation I've gotten myself into.</i>

238
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,423
Are you takin' that thing back to school?

239
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,353
Oh, wow! You're a hard worker!

240
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,277
You're telling me.

241
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,199
Well, see ya.

242
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:23,676
Yeah.

243
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,933
See ya tomorrow!

244
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:31,629
Damn!

245
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:33,033
Now it's gonna start raining!

246
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:37,306
<i>The weather forecast said there
was only a 10% chance of rain today.</i>

247
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,631
<i>Yet another thing that can't be trusted.</i>

248
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,033
I hope it doesn't turn into a downpour.

249
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,910
Looks like it started raining.

250
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,983
I wonder if Kyon's all right.

251
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,930
<i>I've never wanted to be in that room more than I do now.</i>

252
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:58,229
<i>First thing I'm gonna do is grab myself a
cup of Miss Asahina's tea and warm up my body.</i>

253
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,927
<i>Along with my heart.</i>

254
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:04,204
Hey, is Mikuru here?

255
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:06,372
Nagato? Are you the only one here?

256
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:11,618
I wanna see if she'll trade cleaning
duties with me tomorrow. So I came to ask her.

257
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,861
Do you know where she is?

258
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,315
Oh, she's over there, huh?

259
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,154
Cool, thanks!

260
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,079
To the left!

261
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,832
Right, left, right, left, right, left!

262
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,067
To the right!

263
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,717
Right, left, right, left, right, left!

264
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,298
Stand in place!

265
00:16:37,323 --> 00:16:39,782
Right, left, right, left, right, left!

266
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,291
Side to side!

267
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,989
Right, left, right, left, right, left!

268
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:53,102
Oh, brother.

269
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,789
Hey, Kyon! Were you out running errands again?

270
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:58,688
Miss Tsuruya!

271
00:16:58,713 --> 00:16:59,703
That's why!

272
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,275
Huh? What do you mean?

273
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,261
Nope, nothing at all!

274
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,596
You hard worker!

275
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,719
Hm... You're soaked to the bone.

276
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:08,237
Here!

277
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:09,791
Thank you.

278
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,126
Well, see ya!

279
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:14,261
Just give my handkerchief to
Mikuru when you return her scarf.

280
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,961
<i>I don't think I'll ever get
what's going on in that girl's head.</i>

281
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,491
<i>She's a nice person though, I'll say that.</i>

282
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:30,016
Oh, Nagato.

283
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,747
You're the only one here?

284
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,348
So, where's Haruhi and the others?

285
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,775
Yeah! Now that's how you're supposed to land on your butt!

286
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,581
We got it! Moving on!

287
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,373
Ouchie!

288
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:04,791
I'm in awe of your clumsiness.

289
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,337
Are you doing this on purpose?

290
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,545
Koizumi! Take over for me.

291
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,744
This is how ya do it, like this.

292
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:20,678
<i>I'm a little worried about where the three
of them are and what they're doing right now.</i>

293
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:24,394
<i>But schlepping that rotten heater
up that hill really wore me out.</i>

294
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:28,961
<i>The worst part is, I'm gonna have to go
right back down that hill again when I go home!</i>

295
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:30,455
<i>How messed up is that?</i>

296
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,504
<i>Come on... Come on, come on.</i>

297
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,803
<i>Man! My hands are so cold.</i>

298
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,155
<i>I'm just so tired...</i>

299
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:20,020
Oh, Haruhi, it's only you.

300
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,001
Yeah, so? Is that a problem?

301
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,405
No, I don't have a problem with it.

302
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,604
You didn't go and draw something
silly on my face this time, did you?

303
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:31,264
Of course not! I'm not a little kid, Kyon!

304
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,287
Hey, where's everybody else?

305
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:37,159
It didn't look like you were gonna wake
up any time soon, so they all went home.

306
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,522
But... you coulda just gone home. Why'd you stay behind?

307
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:44,506
I couldn't really help it! You were
still sleeping. Whaddya want me to do?

308
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,745
I gotta lock the door before I leave.
Besides, it's still raining out there!

309
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,259
Okay, hand it over.

310
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,386
My cardigan!

311
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,775
<i>Okay... So that one belongs to Haruhi.</i>

312
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,396
<i>But... who does this other sweater belong to?</i>

313
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:20,975
<i>Whoa, that means that Miss Asahina was changing
clothes right next to me while I was sleeping!</i>

314
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,819
<i>Dammit! Why did I have to fall asleep?!</i>

315
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,907
<i>If I pretended to be asleep, I could've seen...</i>

316
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,286
Well? Everyone left school a while ago.

317
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,668
Come on, let's get outta here.

318
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:30,595
Okay.

319
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,386
I'm kinda stuck though.

320
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,249
I didn't bring an umbrella with me today.

321
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,959
One'll be enough for the two of us.

322
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,394
Aim that thing over here more.

323
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:44,757
I'm getting all wet.

324
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,959
But you've got a ton of umbrella over there.

325
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:50,461
Uh! Oh, nice one. This isn't even yours.

326
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,735
This thing's got "faculty" stenciled on it.

327
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:58,061
It belongs to the school, so there shouldn't be
anything wrong with a couple of students using it, right?

328
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,315
What? You wanna go home all sopping wet?

329
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:02,327
Fine! Then I won't let you use it!

330
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,235
<i>Geez... I went to all that
trouble bringing the heater back,</i>

331
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,043
<i>and little miss brigade leader over
there can't even say, "Thank you."</i>

332
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:10,639
<i>Typical Haruhi.</i>

333
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,023
Hey, wait up!
