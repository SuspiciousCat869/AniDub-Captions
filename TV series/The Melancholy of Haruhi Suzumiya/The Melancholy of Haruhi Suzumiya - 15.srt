1
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:06,210
<i>Something's wrong... That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

2
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,420
<i>I didn't care about the baseball game
on TV, but I ended up watching it anyway.</i>

3
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:17,557
<i>And right about then, I suddenly
got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

4
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,901
Hey Kyon, your cell phone's ringing.

5
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,496
Yeah I know; you don't have to tell me.

6
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,681
Hey, Kyon! You're free today, right?

7
00:00:35,885 --> 00:00:38,432
Good. Meet us at 2:00 in front of the station.

8
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:39,624
And don't be late!

9
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>I didn't even have a chance to say anything.</i>

10
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:50,554
Now what?

11
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,210
I forgot to tell you something.

12
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,887
Make sure and bring your swim trunks and some money, too.

13
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,423
Oh, and don't forget to bring...

14
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:58,345
Don't forget to bring my bike, I know.

15
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:01,170
Uh... Right! Yeah, bring it.

16
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,427
And if you're late, you're buying lunch!

17
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,473
<i>How did I know about the bike just now?</i>

18
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:16,061
Look! I think that one's gonna make it over!

19
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,319
I knew it!

20
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,114
<i>I wonder where I put my swim trunks.</i>

21
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,950
<i>Summer's almost over.</i>

22
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,105
You're late, Kyon!

23
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,313
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,387
I'm sorry if I kept you guys waiting.

25
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,873
No worries. I just got here, too.

26
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,912
You have absolutely no motivation whatsoever.

27
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,343
Now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

28
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:12,653
Where are we going today?

29
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,903
To the public swimming pool! Where do you think?

30
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:18,374
<i>That figures... considering the stuff I brought.</i>

31
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:23,191
But, we've only got so much time
because once it's gone, it's gone for good!

32
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:27,526
So we're going to do everything we can
during our only summer as tenth graders.

33
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,037
Hey, Kyon? Are you listening?

34
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,407
Uh... Yeah.

35
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,417
For starters, we're gonna ride the bikes over to the pool!

36
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,109
Okay. Did everyone ride their bikes today?

37
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,439
Well, actually...

38
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,954
The only bikes we have are the ones you and I brought.

39
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,053
<i>In other words, you mean...</i>

40
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,254
You gotta be kidding!

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,469
All right, Kyon, you can't let Koizumi beat you!

42
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,017
Come on! Full speed ahead!

43
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,511
<i>You demon! You fiend!</i>

44
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,178
What are you doing?

45
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,837
We're trying to have fun, so stop acting tired!

46
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,430
<i>And whose fault is that?!</i>

47
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,563
Wow! Look at all the people!

48
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:04,986
And can you smell the chlorine?
That really makes it feel like summer!

49
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:09,222
Come on, guys, it's perfect! Let's find
a place to dump our stuff and go swimming!

50
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:10,158
Okay.

51
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,539
Hey! Wait a se... cond...

52
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,269
<i>Can't she see the "no diving" signs? They're everywhere.</i>

53
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:20,806
Come on! The water's warm! It's perfect!

54
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,672
Mikuru! Yuki! Don't just stand there!

55
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,220
Guess you better go have fun. We're
never gonna hear the end of it, if you don't.

56
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,128
Oh! Okay!

57
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,649
Miss Suzumiya! Wait up, we're coming!

58
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:33,960
Slow poke!

59
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,510
In... you... go!

60
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,026
It's such a peaceful scene, isn't it?

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,909
What?

62
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,105
I was talkin' about Miss Suzumiya.

63
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,738
She's enjoying herself in a normal way.

64
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,590
It's rather charming, don't you think?

65
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,203
She called me and told me what to bring.

66
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:55,768
And then, she ordered me to meet her
without telling me what was going on.

67
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:57,232
That's not charming or normal.

68
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:01,257
If you ask me, none of what you
mentioned is anything to make a fuss over.

69
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,330
As long as Miss Suzumiya's having a good time,

70
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,535
we don't have to worry about any earth-shattering events.

71
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:09,878
I hope you're right.

72
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,282
Something wrong?

73
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:14,450
Nothing...

74
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,166
I guess it's just my imagination.

75
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:24,049
With everything that's happened since we
met, you could say I've become slightly paranoid.

76
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,968
<i>Him too? Weird.</i>

77
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,386
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

78
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,835
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

79
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,019
<i>She's been over there this whole time?</i>

80
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,183
<i>Why's she sitting over there by herself?</i>

81
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,402
<i>What the...?</i>

82
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:01,903
<i>That's so weird!</i>

83
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,039
<i>It's like... I've seen this happen before.</i>

84
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:08,086
<i>Nagato... all alone...</i>

85
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:08,736
Kyon!

86
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:11,607
<i>Haruhi...</i>

87
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,527
<i>Yeah... That's right...</i>

88
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,551
<i>She shows up and says...</i>

89
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:19,936
<i>"These two guys are my brigade
members. They do what I say.</i>

90
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,173
<i>So if you want something..."</i>

91
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:22,336
...you can ask them!

92
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:26,498
It's time for some water soccer.
I need everyone in the pool!

93
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:27,767
Yuki!

94
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,446
<i>Have I become like a psychic or something?</i>

95
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:31,851
Heads up, Kyon!

96
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,462
Ugh!

97
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:33,887
<i>...or not.</i>

98
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,572
Oh, well. I guess déjà vu's happen sometimes.

99
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:41,912
That's all it was.

100
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,801
<i>I've been thinking of some fun things to do!</i>

101
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,781
What's that for?

102
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:51,763
I came up with this schedule of how we're
gonna spend the rest of our summer vacation!

103
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:52,358
We've only got two weeks...

104
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:53,985
<i>Two weeks to do all that?!</i>

105
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,839
Is there anything you wanna do, Mikuru?

106
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:00,191
Um... Maybe goldfish scooping?

107
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:03,505
Okay! Goldfish scooping, it is.

108
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,286
Um... Could I see that for a moment?

109
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:11,887
Thank you.

110
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,794
We'll start the list tomorrow!

111
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:17,856
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

112
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,260
Or a firework show?

113
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:22,502
I can check around for them. I'll
give you a call if I find anything.

114
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,122
Don't forget about the goldfish scooping.

115
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,840
After all, it's Mikuru's only request.

116
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,534
I got stuck with the bill again.

117
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,004
Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're late!

118
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:36,167
That's it for today, guys! Okay? I'll see you tomorrow!

119
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:39,274
Well, I'm off, too.

120
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,455
I'll see you later!

121
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,176
Okay!

122
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:52,535
Nagato!

123
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,372
I... I was... It's nothing important or anything...

124
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,095
So, uh... How have you been?

125
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,302
Is everything going okay with you?

126
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:07,231
It is.

127
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay, then. I guess that's a good thing.

128
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,505
Yes.

129
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,229
Ah! Well, uh, that's all I was wondering.

130
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,090
So yeah, I'm, uh... sorry to keep you.

131
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,008
<i>What the heck?</i>

132
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,234
<i>What was that? Why'd I talk to her?</i>

133
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:40,052
<i>The next morning, I got another call from Haruhi.</i>

134
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,692
<i>They found a bon festival.</i>

135
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,143
<i>It was happening at a park tonight.</i>

136
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:46,987
Sorry, guys!

137
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,480
Well, it's about time...

138
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,900
The three of you look wonderful in those!

139
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:53,378
Well, of course we do!

140
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,119
I picked 'em out myself, y'know.

141
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:58,224
Especially Mikuru's! You're so cute! I'm a genius!

142
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,680
<i>Oh, Miss Asahina! Yes! Yes!</i>

143
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:11,607
There's a lot going on here, but I
wonder where all the things we wanna do are.

144
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,894
<i>What the...?!</i>

145
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:14,895
<i>It feels like I was just here!</i>

146
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:18,820
<i>That tower... Those vendors... I remember them.</i>

147
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,307
Look! Mikuru!

148
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,698
See? They have goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!

149
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,612
We're gonna catch a whole bunch!

150
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,393
Miss Suzumiya, don't pull so hard!

151
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,010
Do you wanna go scoop some fish, too?

152
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:32,687
Nah, I think I'll pass.

153
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:34,769
So how 'bout you, Nagato?

154
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,280
You wanna go grab some food or somethin'?

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,004
Are you actually into that stuff?

156
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,405
Okay! I got it!

157
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:48,021
No.

158
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:48,820
But...

159
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,181
That one.

160
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,925
It's yours for 800 yen!

161
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,547
<i>I wish she would've let me buy that for her...</i>

162
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,513
<i>It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.</i>

163
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,329
I caught thirteen!

164
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,258
But, I don't have enough room for all of 'em.

165
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:03,770
That's way too many fish.

166
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,000
So I kept one, and gave one to Mikuru!

167
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,343
Here! Go ahead and have one! But only one, okay?

168
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:10,741
Okay. Thanks.

169
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:14,338
Woah! Hey, Yuki? What's the deal with the mask?

170
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,187
I bought it.

171
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:18,612
Oh! Okay...

172
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,595
Let's shoot off some fireworks next.
It'll be a great way to end the day!

173
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:28,417
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

174
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,007
<i>I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

175
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,138
<i>Truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

176
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,085
Tomorrow, we're gonna catch bugs!

177
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,214
Hey, Haruhi?

178
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:39,199
Yeah? What?

179
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:42,369
I don't wanna spoil your fun,
but have you finished your homework?

180
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,856
Finish my homework?

181
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:48,049
Aw, that stuff's easy. You can
finish it in like three days.

182
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:53,262
You have to get rid of it first, so you can spend
your summer having fun and not worrying about it!

183
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:56,027
That, is how you get the most out of your vacation!

184
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,631
<i>The gods can be so cruel...</i>

185
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:01,800
So tomorrow, we're all gonna go bug catching!

186
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:02,987
But only cicadas.

187
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:06,562
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest!

188
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:10,137
<i>The next day was unbelievably
beautiful, sunny, and bright.</i>

189
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:14,889
<i>Perfect for the SOS Brigade's cicada
catching contest, which was currently underway.</i>

190
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:20,661
<i>And although everyone caught bugs the best way they
knew how, the winner of the contest ended up being...</i>

191
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,296
<i>Surprise! Haruhi...</i>

192
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:28,362
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

193
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:31,851
I mean, if we let 'em go now, they
might return the favor some time.

194
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,884
<i>Now, what could a cicada possibly do for me?</i>

195
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,757
<i>I sorta feel like Pandora, opening her box.</i>

196
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,319
<i>We met the next day, even though
we had no idea what was going on.</i>

197
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:55,530
<i>Then, we had to wear frog costumes and
hand balloons out in front of the supermarket.</i>

198
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,286
<i>This was our part-time job.</i>

199
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,759
I feel like the Gundam Virtue after it pops its armor.

200
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,871
Good work, you guys!

201
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:07,085
What's with the special treatment?

202
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:08,459
You're the best!

203
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,137
The manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

204
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,908
Who cares how grateful he is? Where's our pay?

205
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:15,298
That's it!

206
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,037
Huh?

207
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,330
I've had my eye on him for a while now.

208
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,565
The manager said we could have it
'cause Mikuru looks so cute in it!

209
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,843
We were working, sweat pouring down our foreheads...

210
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:27,728
...for that?!

211
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,330
We'll keep him in the club room as a souvenir.

212
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:34,239
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear him whenever you want.

213
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,860
Isn't he the greatest?!

214
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,470
Uh... Okay...

215
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,282
Um... Thank you, I guess...?

216
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:47,577
<i>Later that night, my peaceful
slumber was interrupted by a phone call.</i>

217
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,668
Shut up...

218
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,559
Shut up!

219
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,099
Ugh, dammit...

220
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:03,480
Hello?

221
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:05,363
Kyon...

222
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,189
Kyon...

223
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,637
Miss Asahina?

224
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,923
Yes... It's me...

225
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,617
Something... really bad...

226
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,745
I don't know...

227
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:20,121
At this rate... I... I...

228
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,695
What's wrong?

229
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,441
Hello, it's Koizumi.

230
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:27,957
What are you doing with Miss
Asahina in the middle of the night?

231
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:29,611
We have a situation here.

232
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,186
Is it possible for you to come meet us?

233
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,399
Oh, absolutely!

234
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:36,483
Miss Asahina!

235
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,182
What happened? Are you okay?

236
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:46,305
Oh, Kyon! I can't... Future...

237
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,006
Future? W-What?

238
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,098
I can't go back to the future!

239
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:55,684
I'll explain it the best I can.

240
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,630
We're currently stuck in a time
loop that seems to have no end.

241
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,407
It's hard to believe you're
serious with that smile on your face.

242
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:11,155
Come on, Koizumi. Do you have any idea what you just said?

243
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:14,175
Of course, I do. Much more than I want to, believe me.

244
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,565
Anyway, I was having a chat with Miss Asahina earlier.

245
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,219
<i>Next time, call me when you have a chat with her!</i>

246
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:25,771
And that's when the two of us realized that something
seemed a little off about the current flow of time.

247
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:28,848
Actually, Miss Asahina discovered it.

248
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,517
Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

249
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:35,195
What kind of suspicions?

250
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,097
That we've been re-living the same
period of time, over and over again.

251
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,017
Yeah, you already said that.

252
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:46,060
We've been repeating every day
between August the 17th through the 31st.

253
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:50,460
We've become stuck in the middle of what
seems to be an endless summer vacation.

254
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,006
<i>Well, at least it's summer vacation...</i>

255
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,464
A never-ending, endless summer vacation.

256
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,648
The future doesn't exist in this world anymore.

257
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,970
Time stops at September the 1st.

258
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,179
That's the reason Miss Asahina can't travel to the future.

259
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,695
It's only natural.

260
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,638
There's nothing natural about not having a future.

261
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,741
Who's gonna believe such a thing?

262
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:20,109
Well, for starters, I guess we were
sort of hoping that you would believe it.

263
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,276
Maybe it's one of those closed
spaces you were talking about before.

264
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,096
Could we be trapped in one of those things?

265
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,415
That's not it. This time, it's different.

266
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,102
A specific section of time has been torn away.

267
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:32,833
At exactly midnight on August the 31st,

268
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:37,802
everything resets. Time reverts
to the morning of August the 17th.

269
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,101
That's the process.

270
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,773
Perfect, another problem involving time.

271
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:46,415
But I guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering
there's a time traveler hanging out with us.

272
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:47,090
No...

273
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:50,244
Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

274
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:52,420
Okay... Then what's causing it?

275
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,674
Miss Suzumiya.

276
00:15:56,156 --> 00:16:00,191
Somewhere inside her, there's a desire
to have summer vacation last forever.

277
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,669
I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.

278
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:05,386
You mean she still hasn't had enough fun?

279
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,760
That's what I think anyway.

280
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,719
Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs
to happen before our summer vacation can truly end.

281
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,487
All right, what do you want me to do about it?

282
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:21,689
If I knew that, we'd have this problem solved by now.

283
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,182
You seem like you're enjoying this.

284
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:30,239
Please don't take that the wrong way, but this
explains the feelings of déjà vu we've both been having.

285
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:32,478
Are... we the only ones?

286
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:34,718
Or can other people feel this happening, too?

287
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:36,697
It doesn't seem like it.

288
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,915
But then, you and I are exceptions to the rule.

289
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:46,263
The only people who can sense these strange feelings
happening are the ones who are closest to Miss Suzumiya.

290
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,155
But, what about Haruhi?

291
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,235
Doesn't she get that weird feeling, too?

292
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:52,198
No, I don't think she does.

293
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,220
Besides, it would be very bad for us if she did.

294
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:57,489
But...

295
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,467
...there is someone else.

296
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,359
Someone who isn't affected by the time loop,

297
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,703
or the feelings of déjà vu we've had.

298
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:06,252
She remembers it all.

299
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:09,909
I can't imagine what that would be like for someone.

300
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:11,960
Okay then, who is it?

301
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,514
You already know. Don't you?

302
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:19,884
The thought entity transcends
time and space, and so does she.

303
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,849
Nagato, is that true?

304
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:25,862
It is.

305
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,027
So, then you can remember everything?

306
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,159
I can.

307
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:34,091
Okay then, how many times did we
re-live the last two weeks up till now?

308
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:40,295
This would be 15, 513 times.

309
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,614
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred thirteen times?</i>

310
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,387
<i>What do you mean 15,513 times?</i>

311
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:54,179
<i>Nagato, do you know what you just said?</i>

312
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,689
And... you're being completely serious?

313
00:17:58,814 --> 00:17:59,502
Yes.

314
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,589
So, you're saying that we've done the exact
same things every single time, that many times?

315
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,195
Not necessarily.

316
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:09,486
What do you mean?

317
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:19,989
Throughout 15,513 repetitions, we did not attend a
bon festival the 2,391st time and the 11,054th time.

318
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:26,223
We went to a bon festival but did not
go to a goldfish scooping booth 437 times.

319
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:32,263
We obtained part-time jobs 9,031
times and worked six different jobs.

320
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:36,840
In addition to handing out balloons,
we worked as movers, cashiers...

321
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,836
Got it. I got it.

322
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,351
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred thirteen times...</i>

323
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,916
<i>That's what she said.</i>

324
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,683
<i>Times two weeks...</i>

325
00:18:55,708 --> 00:19:00,062
<i>That's, uh... about... 594 years.</i>

326
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,812
<i>She's the only one of us who remembers everything we did.</i>

327
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:07,844
<i>And she's had to repeat them over and over and over again.</i>

328
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,703
<i>Nagato...</i>

329
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,786
<i>What's it like to re-live the same things that many times?</i>

330
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,830
I wonder if they're real.

331
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:23,345
Who?

332
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:24,655
Martians.

333
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,392
I kind of hope they aren't.

334
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,892
I bet they're a noble race of
beings who have to live underground.

335
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:33,008
They're probably friendly, too.

336
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,033
Yeah, dream on.

337
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,904
This is boring... I know!

338
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:39,804
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

339
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,402
You know, I wish I knew what else she wanted to do.

340
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,751
Yes, what indeed.

341
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,168
If we knew that, we'd be on
our way to solving this problem.

342
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,181
I know! Why don't we try this out?

343
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:55,905
What?

344
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,560
What if someone were to grab Miss Suzumiya from behind?

345
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,757
And then they whisper, "I love you," right into her ear?

346
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,075
And who's gonna be doing the whispering?

347
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,062
Can you think of anyone better
suited to play that role than you?

348
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,106
I'm exercising my right to veto!

349
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,269
I won't do it.

350
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,932
If that's how you feel...

351
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,109
All right, then I'll give it a shot.

352
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,095
Just kidding.

353
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,394
That role requires a certain something which I lack.

354
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,938
Besides, it would just confuse Miss
Suzumiya, and we wouldn't want that.

355
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,198
Hey, Nagato.

356
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:35,464
You knew about this time loop thing we're stuck in
way before Miss Asahina figured it out, didn't you?

357
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,329
Yes.

358
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,819
So, how come you didn't say anything about it?

359
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,448
My function is to observe.

360
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:44,984
Understood.

361
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:46,992
All right!

362
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,853
I did it! Look! I got a home run! Yay!

363
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,580
<i>We were always doing something, always on the move.</i>

364
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:58,005
<i>We went to a real firework show, and we
even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.</i>

365
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:04,362
<i>We did the test of courage, went to the beach,
went bowling, did some karaoke, and went to the movies.</i>

366
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:08,787
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was going to be enough for Haruhi.</i>

367
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,182
<i>But, what could I do about it?</i>

368
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:12,281
<i>Nothing.</i>

369
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:17,920
<i>So, I just bit my lip and watched as the
last days of our summer vacation went by.</i>

370
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,690
<i>And then, before I knew it, it was August the 30th.</i>

371
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:27,044
That's it. We've done everything on our list.

372
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,655
But, now I wonder if we did enough.

373
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:37,571
Hmm, oh well... Yeah... I guess we did a lot.

374
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:40,982
Unless... does anyone else have anything they wanna do?

375
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:45,921
Oh, okay then.

376
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:50,469
We pretty much did everything we set out to
do this summer, so I guess that's good enough.

377
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:52,317
No, it's not.

378
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,838
You're still not satisfied.

379
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,421
Okay, then. We're done for today!

380
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:04,236
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but
I guess you can all take the day off now.

381
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,822
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday, okay?

382
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:09,568
<i>Wait.</i>

383
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,553
<i>Haruhi, wait.</i>

384
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,788
<i>Don't go.</i>

385
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,657
<i>Wait, come back.</i>

386
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:19,337
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

387
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,638
<i>we're gonna have to re-live the
past two weeks over and over again,</i>

388
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:27,050
<i>maybe for a thousand more times.</i>

389
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,592
<i>But... what should I do?</i>

390
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,437
<i>What should I say?</i>

391
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,327
<i>There must have been a clue
in something Haruhi said, but...</i>

392
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,117
<i>...what was it?</i>

393
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:44,023
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

394
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:47,695
<i>I... I don't know.</i>

395
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:49,735
<i>Wait...</i>

396
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:51,507
<i>Stop...</i>

397
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:53,685
<i>Haruhi...</i>

398
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:57,179
<i>Thank you! Come again!</i>

399
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:08,368
<i>It's August the 31st.</i>

400
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,401
<i>I haven't touched my homework.</i>

401
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:14,397
<i>Whatever... It doesn't matter anymore.</i>

402
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,811
<i>There isn't any point in doing it.</i>

403
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,758
<i>We're just gonna keep re-living
the last couple weeks anyway.</i>

404
00:23:21,622 --> 00:23:24,860
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

405
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:28,044
<i>a different version of me will have to deal with it.</i>
