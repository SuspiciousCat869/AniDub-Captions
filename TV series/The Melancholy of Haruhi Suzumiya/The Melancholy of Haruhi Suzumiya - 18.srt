1
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:03,671
<i>Wrong...</i>

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,039
<i>Wrong.</i>

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:09,747
<i>Wrong!</i>

4
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:13,964
<i>Something's wrong. That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:18,453
<i>The game on TV was between schools from another town.</i>

6
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:23,275
<i>Now I had nothing to do with either school, but
I found myself rooting for the losing team anyway.</i>

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:27,839
<i>And it was right about then, I suddenly
got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

8
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:39,205
Hey Kyon, your phone's ringing.

9
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:41,176
I know; you don't have to tell me.

10
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,213
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

11
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:51,572
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,567
<i>I didn't even have a chance to say anything.</i>

13
00:00:58,697 --> 00:00:59,506
Yeah, what?

14
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:03,880
I forgot to tell you, make sure to
bring your swim trunks and lots of money.

15
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:07,041
Oh, and bring your bike. Definitely bring your bike.

16
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,087
I guess that's it. Over and out!

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,453
<i>That's two for two.</i>

18
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:14,839
<i>That was weird.</i>

19
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,848
<i>It was like I knew what Haruhi
was gonna say before she said it.</i>

20
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:19,606
<i>Yeah... No...</i>

21
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:26,320
<i>Actually, it felt like we'd had that exact same
conversation once before, kinda like déjà vu or something.</i>

22
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,484
<i>Summer's almost over...</i>

23
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:16,796
You're late, Kyon!

24
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:18,733
Where's your motivation, huh?

25
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:19,987
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,252
I'm sorry to keep you guys waiting for me.

27
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,667
No worries, I just got here, too!

28
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,268
Okay, now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go!

29
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,148
Where to?

30
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,540
To the public swimming pool. Where do ya think?

31
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:35,988
<i>That figures... considering the stuff I brought.</i>

32
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,914
We've got lots of summer vacation-y
things to do during our summer break!

33
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:43,227
But we've only so much time because
once it's gone, it's gone for good!

34
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:48,552
So we're gonna do everything we can, while we
can, during our only summer as tenth graders!

35
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,409
And for starters, we're gonna ride the bikes to the pool!

36
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,076
Okay, but did everyone ride their bikes?

37
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,663
No, the only bikes we have today
are the ones you and I brought.

38
00:03:58,973 --> 00:03:59,401
Huh?

39
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,610
All right, Kyon, you can't let Koizumi beat you!

40
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,256
Come on! Full speed ahead!

41
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,936
Why's it takin' so long, you guys?

42
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:14,117
Hurry up and park the bikes already!

43
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:19,370
Seriously, Kyon, we're tryin' to
have fun here, so stop acting tired.

44
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,468
<i>Whose fault is that, huh?!</i>

45
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,113
Aah, can you smell the chlorine?

46
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,314
That really makes it feel like summer!

47
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,599
Come on, let's go for a swim!

48
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,547
You and me are gonna have a race!

49
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:32,416
Miss Suzumiya, wait!

50
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,808
Doesn't that look like fun?

51
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:37,548
Sure does.

52
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,558
In a way, it makes me smile.

53
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,082
It's such a peaceful scene, don't you think?

54
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,608
I mean, look at them.

55
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,765
Seein' Miss Suzumiya enjoy the day in a
normal fashion, it's charming, isn't it?

56
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,123
Well, she called me up and told me what to bring.

57
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:53,335
Then, she demanded I meet her
without telling me what was going on.

58
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,798
There's nothing charming or normal about it.

59
00:04:55,988 --> 00:05:00,175
Well, if you want my opinion, none of
what you said is anything to make a fuss over.

60
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:03,847
I mean, as long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and havin' a good time,

61
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,881
we don't have to worry about
any earth-shattering events, do we?

62
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:08,907
Man, I hope you're right.

63
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:11,860
Something wrong?

64
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,077
Nothing...

65
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:17,455
Just my imagination, I guess.

66
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:19,811
With everything that's happened since we met,

67
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:22,102
you could say I've become slightly paranoid.

68
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,864
Oh! I lost again!

69
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,199
Yuki, one more time! Come on!

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm comin' to get you!

71
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,075
Mikuru! This is delicious!

72
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,169
<i>Geez...</i>

73
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,613
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

74
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,774
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

75
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,736
<i>I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.</i>

76
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:00,756
<i>Geez...</i>

77
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,119
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

78
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,425
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

79
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,294
<i>I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.</i>

80
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,169
<i>Something weird's happening...</i>

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,850
<i>Yeah... That's right.</i>

82
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:21,747
<i>She shows up and says...</i>

83
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,823
<i>"These two guys are my brigade members.</i>

84
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,004
<i>They do what I say,</i>

85
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:27,154
<i>so if you want something, you can ask them!"</i>

86
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,766
It's time for some fun!

87
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,708
Let's go play water soccer!

88
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,312
Yeah, we're coming.

89
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,955
<i>Oh, well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

90
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,140
What... is that?

91
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:45,260
I came up with this schedule of how we're
gonna spend the rest of our summer vacation!

92
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,035
I realized something...

93
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:50,638
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

94
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,205
So, we're gonna start pickin' up the pace!

95
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:55,548
Two weeks to do all that?!

96
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,433
Mikuru, is there anything else you wanna do?

97
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:05,156
I think I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

98
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:06,545
Okay!

99
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,809
Goldfish... scooping... it is!

100
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:11,761
Perfect!

101
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,107
Pardon me, but could I see that for a moment?

102
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,203
Okay, sure...

103
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:17,693
Thank you.

104
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:18,857
Oh, you done with it?

105
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:19,604
Mhm.

106
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:22,118
Okay, then we start the list tomorrow!

107
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:25,345
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

108
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,497
Or a place where we can see fireworks?

109
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,193
I can check around for those.

110
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:31,510
Don't forget about the goldfish scooping!

111
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:32,793
I'll get right on it.

112
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,492
<i>Stuck with the bill again.</i>

113
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,832
Well, that's it for today! See ya!

114
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,353
I'm off, too.

115
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:47,890
I'll see you later.

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,818
Nagato!

117
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,526
Uh... It's nothing important or anything...

118
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:04,701
So how've you been?

119
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,234
Is everything okay?

120
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,653
It is.

121
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,071
That's good to hear.

122
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:10,646
Yes.

123
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:16,112
Uh... Well, guess that's it. Sorry to keep you.

124
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,154
Goodbye!

125
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,051
<i>What was that?</i>

126
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,024
<i>Why'd I want to talk to her?</i>

127
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:32,447
<i>The next morning, I was wakened from my
peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.</i>

128
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,973
<i>She said they'd found a bon festival.</i>

129
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,314
<i>It was happening tonight at a park somewhere.</i>

130
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,140
You're late again, Kyon! Seriously!

131
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,608
What's with you?

132
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,597
Anyway, we're buying yukatas, and you're coming with us!

133
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:55,405
<i>So, we went to a clothing outlet, and Haruhi
picked out yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato.</i>

134
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,354
<i>Then, she marched them straight into the changing rooms.</i>

135
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,231
<i>And... after making us wait about an hour or so,</i>

136
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,248
<i>the three of them finally appeared.</i>

137
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:05,249
What d'ya think?

138
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,865
We look pretty hot, don't we?

139
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:11,330
Yes, the three of you look wonderful in them.

140
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:12,695
Of course we do!

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,488
I picked all of 'em out myself, especially Mikuru's!

142
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:19,477
Just look at you, you look so darn cute in that!

143
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,299
I'm like a fashion genius!

144
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:26,007
<i>Miss Asahina, please spin around. Spin!</i>

145
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,058
Wow!

146
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,852
This is amazing!

147
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,332
Yeah, this place looks super fun!

148
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:34,074
<i>A bon festival, huh?</i>

149
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,782
<i>Yeah... I guess it figures it'd be so...</i>

150
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:38,228
<i>...crowded.</i>

151
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,391
<i>Whoa, there's that weird feeling again.</i>

152
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:50,110
Look, Mikuru! Over there! They've got
goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!

153
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,561
Come on, I bet you're gonna catch a ton!

154
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,639
Do you wanna go scoop some fish, too?

155
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,802
We could have a little contest.

156
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,256
I think I'll pass.

157
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:01,051
How 'bout you, Nagato? Wanna get some food?

158
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,507
What's up, Nagato?

159
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:08,873
Don't tell me you're actually into that stuff.

160
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,127
I got it.

161
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:10,796
No.

162
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,465
That one.

163
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,089
It's yours for 800 yen!

164
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,727
I wish she would've let me buy that for her...

165
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,659
It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.

166
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,523
I caught thirteen!

167
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:28,657
But I only kept one 'cause I
don't have any place to put 'em all.

168
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,539
Wow, that's an amazing haul!

169
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,344
Go ahead and have one, but only one!

170
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,093
Okay, thanks.

171
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,848
Huh? Yuki, what's with the mask?

172
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:40,922
I bought it.

173
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:43,055
Oh... Okay.

174
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,106
Anyway, let's go shoot off some fireworks!

175
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,387
It's the perfect way to end the day!

176
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,640
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

177
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:55,161
<i>And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

178
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,189
<i>But the truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

179
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:02,327
Cool. Tomorrow, we're gonna go catch some bugs.

180
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:06,515
Hey, Haruhi, I don't want to spoil your
fun, but have you finished your homework yet?

181
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,388
You gotta be kidding. That stuff's totally easy.

182
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,562
You can finish it in like three days.

183
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:13,363
<i>Three days?!</i>

184
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,325
You have to get rid of that junk first,

185
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,800
so you can spend the rest of your summer
having fun and not worrying about it!

186
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,770
It's the only way to get the most out of your vacation!

187
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:25,291
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

188
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:29,673
<i>The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.</i>

189
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,885
Anyway, tomorrow we're gonna go catch some bugs!

190
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:36,731
And the prize for whoever catches the most is gonna be...

191
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,208
Yeah, I know.

192
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,284
Whoever catches the most gets
to be brigade leader for a day!

193
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:42,974
<i>Ew.</i>

194
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,708
That sounds like a lot of fun!

195
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:47,094
Are we allowed to catch just any random bug?

196
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:49,092
Oh! Um...

197
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,889
No, only cicadas! Yeah!

198
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:55,711
I'm calling it the SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest!

199
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,981
<i>The next day was beautiful, sunny, and bright.</i>

200
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:04,659
<i>In fact, it was the perfect day for us to
have our SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest.</i>

201
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:09,764
<i>And even though everyone caught bugs the best way
they knew how, the winner of the contest ended up being...</i>

202
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,602
<i>You guessed it, Haruhi.</i>

203
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:15,667
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

204
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:20,028
I mean, if we let 'em go this time, they
might come back and return the favor some day!

205
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,176
<i>What could a cicada do for me, even if it did come back?</i>

206
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,992
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

207
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:33,863
<i>I sorta feel like Pandora, when she opened her box.</i>

208
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,185
Welcome to our store!

209
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,514
<i>We met the next day, even though
we had no idea what was going on.</i>

210
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:45,219
<i>Then, we were forced to wear frog costumes and
hand balloons out in front of the local supermarket.</i>

211
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,514
Awesome job today, guys!

212
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,300
<i>What's with the special treatment?!</i>

213
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,594
You're the best!

214
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,542
And the manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

215
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:57,886
Who cares how grateful he is? What about our pay?

216
00:12:58,405 --> 00:12:59,191
That's it!

217
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:00,865
Huh?

218
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:04,090
I've had my eye on that little guy for a long time now.

219
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:07,907
The manager said we could have it
'cause Mikuru looks so cute in it!

220
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,372
<i>We worked in the sun, sweat pouring down our foreheads...</i>

221
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,143
...for that?!

222
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,888
We'll keep him in the club room as a souvenir.

223
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:18,094
And Mikuru, you can wear him whenever you want.

224
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,363
Just help yourself!

225
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,152
You have my permission!

226
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,328
<i>And later that night, my peace slumber was interrupted...</i>

227
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:33,705
<i>...by a phone call.</i>

228
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:34,267
Huh?

229
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,674
Kyon...

230
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,336
Miss Asahina?

231
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,767
Yes... It's me...

232
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,678
Something... really bad...

233
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:58,902
I don't know... W-W-What do I do...

234
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:00,817
Uh...

235
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:01,616
Hello!

236
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:02,539
It's Koizumi.

237
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,592
What are you doing with Miss
Asahina in the middle of the night?!

238
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,111
We have a situation over here.

239
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,620
Do you think you could come meet us right away?

240
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,964
Abso-freaking-lutely.

241
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,405
Miss Asahina! What happened?

242
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:17,813
What's wrong?

243
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,696
Oh, Kyon... I... I can't...

244
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,168
I can't go back to the future anymore!

245
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:29,231
Huh?

246
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,577
I'll explain it the best I can.

247
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:37,508
We're stuck in a time loop that,
as far as I can tell, has no end.

248
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,846
It's hard to believe you're actually serious
with you sitting there, smiling like that.

249
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,744
I mean, come on, do you have
any idea what you just said? Huh?

250
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:49,855
Of course, I do. Much more than I want to, believe me.

251
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,684
I was having a little chat with Miss Asahina earlier.

252
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,924
<i>Next time, call me! And you stay home!</i>

253
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,993
And that was when the two of us came to the conclusion,

254
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,125
that something seemed a little
off about the current flow of time.

255
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,266
Well, actually, it was Miss Asahina who discovered it.

256
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,428
And thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

257
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:09,922
What suspicions?

258
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,051
That we're stuck in a time loop.

259
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:15,656
We're re-living the same period
of time, over and over again.

260
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,323
I know; you already said that.

261
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:21,988
We're bein' forced to repeat every day
between August the 17th through the 31st.

262
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:26,251
In other words, we're in the middle of
what seems to be an endless summer vacation.

263
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,855
Well, at least it's summer vacation, right?

264
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,750
It's a never-ending, endless summer vacation.

265
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:35,752
In other words, in this world,
the future doesn't exist anymore.

266
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,487
All time stops at September the 1st.

267
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,720
Seriously, who's gonna believe that?

268
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:44,246
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

269
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,325
What about the closed spaces
you were talking about before?

270
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,467
Could it be that we're trapped inside one of those things?

271
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:54,121
Mh-hm. This isn't the same thing.

272
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,282
A specific section of time has been torn away.

273
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:01,295
At exactly midnight on August the 31st, everything resets.

274
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,773
And then time reverts straight back
to the morning of August the 17th.

275
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,173
That's the process.

276
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:08,005
What about our--

277
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:10,080
Wait, what about the whole world's memories?

278
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,969
Their memory is reset.

279
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,752
Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning.

280
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,202
Perfect, it's another problem involving time.

281
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:23,876
Although, I guess I shouldn't be surprised,
especially if there's a time traveler around.

282
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:27,591
Oh, no, Miss Asahina didn't have
anything to do with what's happening.

283
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:30,967
Okay then, what's causing it?

284
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:32,581
Miss Suzumiya is.

285
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,302
Oh, I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.

286
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,572
But somewhere inside her subconscious,

287
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,717
there's a desire to have summer vacation last forever.

288
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:42,871
What the heck?!

289
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,256
You mean she still hasn't had enough fun?

290
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,208
That's what I think anyway.

291
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:52,453
Or it's possible, she feels there's something else
that needs to happen before summer vacation can end.

292
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:56,888
<i>Oh, man... The trouble she gets
us into is always galactic in scale.</i>

293
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,526
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

294
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:02,948
If I knew that, we'd have this problem solved by now.

295
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:06,077
You seem like you're enjoying this an awful lot.

296
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,194
What's up with that?

297
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,222
Please don't take that the wrong way, it's nothing.

298
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:13,496
However, this explains the
feelings of déjà vu I've been having.

299
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,350
And the ones you've been having as well.

300
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,485
And now that I think about it,

301
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:22,607
those feelings were probably the residue of our
memories from all the instances where time was reset.

302
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,377
Are we the only ones?

303
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,234
Or can other people feel this happening, too?

304
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,680
It doesn't seem that way.

305
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,751
But then again, you and I are exceptions to the rule.

306
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,137
But what about Haruhi?

307
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,042
Does she even realize what's been going on around here?

308
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,434
No, I don't think she knows it's happening.

309
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,253
Besides, it would be very bad
for us if she did know about it.

310
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:48,134
However, there's someone who doesn't seem to be
affected by the time loop or these feelings of déjà vu.

311
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:49,561
As a matter of fact,

312
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,118
this person remembers everything that's happened.

313
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,011
Are you gonna tell me who it is or what?

314
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,127
I think you already know who it is.

315
00:17:58,718 --> 00:17:59,783
Well, is that true?

316
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:00,674
It is.

317
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:03,223
You can remember everything?

318
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,219
I can.

319
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:08,427
You wouldn't know how many times we've
been repeating the past two weeks, would you?

320
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:12,567
This would be 15,527 times so far.

321
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:15,528
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-seven?</i>

322
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,701
<i>What do you mean 15,527?</i>

323
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,912
<i>Nagato, what are you saying?</i>

324
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,566
You're being totally serious, aren't you?

325
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:25,463
I am.

326
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:27,051
You've gotta be kidding me!

327
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:30,747
We've been doing the exact same things,
that many times, every single time?

328
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,206
Not necessarily.

329
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:42,645
Throughout 15,527 repetitions, we did not attend a
bon festival the 2,391st time and the 11,054th time.

330
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:48,498
We went to a bon festival but did not
go to a goldfish scooping booth 437 times.

331
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:54,112
We've had part-time jobs 9,052 times
and performed six different types of jobs.

332
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:57,304
In addition to handing out
balloons, we worked as movers...

333
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,795
Yeah... Got it...

334
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:06,770
Bye.

335
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,255
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-seven times...</i>

336
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:15,752
<i>That's what she said.</i>

337
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,072
<i>Times two weeks... That's, uh... about... 595 years!</i>

338
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,884
<i>And she's the only one who
remembers everything we've done.</i>

339
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,714
<i>She's had to repeat those same
things, over and over again.</i>

340
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,375
<i>Nagato...</i>

341
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,809
<i>What's it like to re-live the same things that many times?</i>

342
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,885
<i>The next night, we went stargazing.</i>

343
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:42,696
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's apartment.</i>

344
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,824
<i>And Koizumi brought the telescope.</i>

345
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:48,579
I wonder if they're real.

346
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:50,097
What do you mean?

347
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:50,927
Martians.

348
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:52,487
I kinda hope they aren't.

349
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:55,847
Whenever us humans get around to landing on Mars,

350
00:19:55,872 --> 00:20:01,432
I'm sure the Martians'll pop out from wherever they're
hiding and say, "Welcome to Mars!" or somethin' like that.

351
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,391
Oh... This is boring!

352
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,358
I know! I'm gonna look for UFOs now!

353
00:20:11,318 --> 00:20:13,428
I wish I knew what else she wants to do.

354
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:15,946
That's the big question, isn't it?

355
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,667
If we knew the answer, we'd be
well on our way to solving this thing.

356
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,495
I have an idea we can try if you want.

357
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,988
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

358
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,001
and then whispered, "I love you," right into her ear?

359
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,916
And who's gonna be doing this?!

360
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:35,005
Can you think of anyone better suited to play that role?

361
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,798
I'm supposed to tell her I l-l-lo...

362
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,274
Aw, forget it.

363
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,848
All right then, how 'bout if I do it?

364
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,743
I'm just kidding.

365
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,381
I don't think I could pull that role off anyway.

366
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:53,785
Besides, it would just confuse Miss
Suzumiya, and we wouldn't want that.

367
00:20:56,664 --> 00:21:00,586
<i>So, anyway, the next day, we went to the batting cages.</i>

368
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,078
Hey, Nagato...

369
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,983
You knew about this time loop thing
way before Miss Asahina, didn't you?

370
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:08,299
Yes.

371
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:11,225
Then how come you didn't say anything about it?

372
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,602
My function is to observe only.

373
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:18,569
Understood...

374
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:27,663
<i>We chugged along, doing all
kinds of summer vacation things.</i>

375
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:32,491
<i>More fireworks, goby fishing tournament, the
test of courage, movie-watching, beach-going...</i>

376
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:35,398
<i>Heck. We kept going, and going, and going!</i>

377
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:39,819
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was gonna be enough for Haruhi.</i>

378
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:41,606
<i>But what could I do about it?</i>

379
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,512
<i>Nothing.</i>

380
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:47,135
<i>So, we ended up, like we always did, at August the 30th.</i>

381
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,522
That's it, we've done everything on our list.

382
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,670
Hmm... But now I'm wondering if we really did enough.

383
00:21:56,906 --> 00:22:01,389
Hmm... Oh, well. Yeah, I guess we did a lot.

384
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:05,078
Unless there's something else you guys wanna do?

385
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:10,963
Okay, then...

386
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:15,818
We pretty much did everything we set out to
do this summer, so I guess that's good enough.

387
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:17,826
<i>No, it's not.</i>

388
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,854
<i>You're still not satisfied.</i>

389
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,364
Well, that's it. We're done for today!

390
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:26,981
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but
I guess you can all take the day off now.

391
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:29,895
Kay then, see you guys at the club room on Monday!

392
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:34,566
<i>Wait, Haru...</i>

393
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:36,703
Well, that's it. We're done for today!

394
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:41,291
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but
I guess you can all take the day off now.

395
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:43,387
<i>There's that feeling again...</i>

396
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,187
<i>And it's stronger than all the others.</i>

397
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:47,022
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave.</i>

398
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:48,835
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

399
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:53,524
<i>we'll end up re-living the past two weeks
again and again for a thousand more times!</i>

400
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:55,689
<i>But what should I do?</i>

401
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:59,289
<i>There must've been a clue in something Haruhi said.</i>

402
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:00,903
<i>But what was it?</i>

403
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,540
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

404
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:05,472
<i>I don't know...</i>

405
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:08,022
<i>I can't... remember...</i>

406
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,611
<i>It's August the 31st.</i>

407
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,146
<i>I haven't done my homework.</i>

408
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,286
<i>Whatever... It doesn't matter.</i>

409
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,511
<i>There's no point in doing it.</i>

410
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:26,975
<i>I mean, we're just gonna keep
re-living the last couple of weeks.</i>

411
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,899
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

412
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,979
<i>a different version of me will have to deal with it.</i>
