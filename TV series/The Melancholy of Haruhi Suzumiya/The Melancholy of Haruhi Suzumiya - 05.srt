1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,484
<i>Walking home after school, side by side with a girl.</i>

2
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:09,596
Sure, that sounds like a typical scene
out of some show about teenage adolescence,

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,234
<i>but I'd be lying if I said I never dreamed of doing that.</i>

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,282
<i>And right now, it looks like
I'm making that dream a reality.</i>

5
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,606
<i>Yeah, so why am I not happy about it?</i>

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:21,062
That way.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,662
Did you say something?

8
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:24,237
Um, no. Nothing.

9
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:33,148
<i>Pretty soon, we'll be in front of Nagato's condo.</i>

10
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:07,754
Apparently, Asakura lived here in number 505!

11
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,768
I see.

12
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:10,595
What're you talking' about? See what?

13
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,916
Uh, no, it's nothing.

14
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,690
And by the way, how do you plan on getting in there?

15
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:16,994
You got the code for the door or something?

16
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,323
No, I don't. But I'm sure if we
just wait around long enough...

17
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,566
Well, what're you waiting for?!

18
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:35,586
I'm telling you, it's strange.

19
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,739
Transferring to Canada out of nowhere.

20
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:40,452
And they didn't even tell anybody their new address.

21
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,761
I know, I heard you already.

22
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,041
Well hang on, 'cause it gets even stranger.

23
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,333
Asakura didn't go to the junior high
schools in this city before starting North High.

24
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:49,683
<i>Well, of course she didn't.</i>

25
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:54,138
I snooped around and found out that she came to
our school from a city outside our school zone.

26
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,762
That's totally suspicious!

27
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not like North High's a famous prep school,

28
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,683
it's just a plain old public school you can find anywhere.

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,808
So why would she wanna go to our school?

30
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,459
Dunno.

31
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,708
I can't believe it. She lived really
close to the school, and she lived in a condo.

32
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,916
It's not a monthly deal like an apartment;

33
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,166
this location's nice so it's not cheap.

34
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,625
Did she commute from here to junior high in another city?

35
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,773
I said I don't know.

36
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:19,312
It looks like we have to investigate
how long Asakura's lived here, too.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,291
What're you doing? The place is empty.

38
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:22,359
It's not gonna open.

39
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,663
I really think we're wasting our time here...

40
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,641
Then we're going to the manager's office.

41
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,416
Do you honestly think they're
just gonna hand over the keys?

42
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,916
No, I'm gonna ask the manager how
long Asakura lived here. Come on!

43
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,484
Let's just give up and go home.

44
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,060
Even if we find out, there's
nothing we can really do about it.

45
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:39,835
Move it!

46
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,137
We're both friends of Miss Ryoko Asakura who
lived here and we heard she moved away suddenly.

47
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,444
And we're wondering if you could help us with something.

48
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,666
We need to get a hold of her,

49
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,375
but she didn't leave us her address.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
Did she happen to tell you where she was moving?

51
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:55,750
Also, I was wondering if you could tell us
if you knew how long Miss Asakura's lived here.

52
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,433
<i>Wow. I wasn't really expecting her to be so lucid.</i>

53
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:01,118
Hmm... Huuuh?!

54
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:06,787
We want to know what Miss Ryoko Asakura's new
address is, and we want to know how long she lived here!

55
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:11,041
Ah, that's right! You mean Miss Asakura in number 505.

56
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:16,625
Funny thing about that, I don't recall seeing any
moving van out front, but the place was emptied out.

57
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,291
That really surprised me.

58
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,387
Wow, that's strange. No moving van?

59
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,598
Don't know where she moved to either.

60
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:27,958
I don't know where to forward any of their mail or
packages that might show up. It's all bit troubling.

61
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,714
Do you know how long she lived in number 505?

62
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,433
I'm thinkin' maybe since three years ago?

63
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:38,983
Heh, I remember well, because a pretty young girl
came by with a box of old-fashioned sweets for me.

64
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,329
What about her parents? Did both of them work?

65
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,106
Do you happen to know what her
mother and father did for a living?

66
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,196
Not a clue. Come to think,

67
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,762
I only saw the girl every now and again.

68
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,437
And I never saw her parents, never even said hello to 'em.

69
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,763
The condos here are pretty expensive, aren't they?

70
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:59,754
I doubt that anyone would take out a loan for a place
like this just for their daughter to live all by herself.

71
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,247
They paid cash. They paid for the
whole thing up front in cold, hard cash.

72
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,766
I always thought the family was filthy rich.

73
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,178
<i>Maybe she should be a detective.</i>

74
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:09,701
<i>She sure knows how to get answers.</i>

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,658
At least I wish I coulda said goodbye to her.

76
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,314
It's a shame, you know?

77
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:19,300
By the way, heh, heh, you're quite a
looker, if you don't mind me sayin' so.

78
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:22,518
Thank you very much for all of your time, sir.

79
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,963
Hey, boy.

80
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,083
That one's gonna grow up to be a heck of a catch.

81
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,555
Don't you let her get away now, y'hear?

82
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:39,277
Yuki?

83
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,422
<i>Wow, she actually eats food.</i>

84
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,962
I had no idea you lived in
this building. What a coincidence.

85
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,915
<i>I really doubt it's a coincidence.</i>

86
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,571
Have you heard anything about what happened to Asakura?

87
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,629
You know she transferred out today, right?

88
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,824
I see. Well, if you find anything out, let me know.

89
00:05:58,849 --> 00:05:59,571
You got it?

90
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,540
What happened to your glasses?

91
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,880
<i>Don't look at me. I don't know what to say.</i>

92
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:13,461
Be careful.

93
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,758
<i>Great. What do I have to be careful of now?</i>

94
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,417
Let's go!

95
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:32,153
So, what's next? Where are you planning on going now?

96
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,176
I dunno.

97
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,843
<i>Okay...</i>

98
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,133
Uh, hey. Is it cool if I go home now?

99
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:55,750
You know, Kyon, have you ever realized just how
insignificant your existence on this planet really is?

100
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,390
<i>Now what is she talking about?</i>

101
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:01,016
It happened to me, and I'll never forget it.

102
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:07,689
Back when I was in the sixth grade, my whole family
went out to go watch a baseball game at the stadium.

103
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:12,579
I didn't really care about baseball, but I
was surprised by what I saw when we got there.

104
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,379
Everywhere I looked, I saw people.

105
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:20,488
On the other side of the stadium, the people
looked so small, like little moving grains of rice.

106
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:25,275
It was so crowded, I thought that
everyone in Japan had to be packed in there.

107
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,414
So I turned to my dad and asked him,

108
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,941
"Do you know how many people are here right now?"

109
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,722
He said since the stadium was full, probably 50,000.

110
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:39,215
After the game, the street was filled with
people and I was really shocked to see that, too.

111
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,358
To me, it seemed like there was a ton of people there.

112
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,568
But then, I realized it could only be a
tiny fraction of all the people in Japan.

113
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,294
When I got home, I pulled out my calculator.

114
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:54,189
In Social Studies, I'd learned the population
of Japan was a hundred-some odd million.

115
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,426
So I divided that by 50,000.

116
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,661
The answer was one-two-thousandth.

117
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:00,568
That shocked me even more.

118
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:05,158
I was only one little person in that
big, crowded stadium filled with people.

119
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,016
And, believe me, there were so many people there.

120
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,181
But it was just a handful of the entire population.

121
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:16,378
Up till then, I always thought that I was...
I don't know... kind of a... special person.

122
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,346
It was fun to be with my family.
I had fun with my classmates.

123
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:24,873
And the school that I was going to, it had
just about the most interesting people anywhere.

124
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,820
But that night, I realized it wasn't true.

125
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,487
All the stuff we did during class
that I thought was so fun and cool...

126
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,322
...was probably happening just like that
in classes in other schools all over Japan.

127
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,129
There was nothing special about my school at all.

128
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:48,479
When I realized that, it suddenly felt like the whole
world around me started to fade into a dull, gray void.

129
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,031
Brushing my teeth and going to sleep at night,

130
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,643
waking up and eating breakfast in the morning,

131
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,186
that stuff happened all over the place.

132
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,279
They were everyday things that everybody was doing.

133
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,661
When I thought about it like
that, everything became boring.

134
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,236
If there's really that many people in the world,

135
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,806
then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary.

136
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:12,002
There had to be someone who
was living an interesting life.

137
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,549
There just had to be.

138
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:15,510
But why wasn't I that person?

139
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:20,053
So, that's how I felt till I finished elementary school.

140
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,045
And then I had another realization.

141
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,586
I realized fun things wouldn't
come my way just by waiting for them.

142
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,325
I thought when I got into junior high,
it was time for me to make a change.

143
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,009
I'd let the world know I wasn't a girl
who wasn't happy sitting around waiting,

144
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,306
and I've done my best to become that person.

145
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,224
But in the end, nothing happened.

146
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,651
More time went by, and before I knew it,

147
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:41,868
I was in high school.

148
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,879
I thought that something would change.

149
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,579
<i>The passing train gave me a
moment to think about my response.</i>

150
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,720
<i>Should I voice an opposing view point?</i>

151
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,584
<i>Maybe I should wax philosophical about her dilemma.</i>

152
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:05,750
<i>I see...</i>

153
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,131
<i>I must be getting melancholic if
that's the best I could come up with.</i>

154
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,027
I'm going home.

155
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,272
<i>The truth is, I'd get home faster if I went that way, too.</i>

156
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>But the way Haruhi was walking, well, it was
like her back was telling me not to follow her.</i>

157
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:31,240
<i>I had no other choice but to stand there all by
myself until I couldn't see Haruhi's back anymore.</i>

158
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>I wonder what the hell I'm doing?</i>

159
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:40,769
Hello there.

160
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,469
I was thinkin' that perhaps today I'd
make good on that promise I made you.

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,320
So I've just been hangin'
around out here until you got home.

162
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,603
You're sounding a little bit like
you know where I've been all day.

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,125
Would you mind explaining that to me.

164
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:55,943
If it's possible, do you think you might
have a little time to spare for me right now?

165
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,291
Is it something to do with Suzumiya?

166
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,223
It's somethin' to do with Miss Suzumiya.

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,282
It's pretty amazing that this taxi
showed up just when you needed it.

168
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,377
Yeah. Weird.

169
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:12,664
So the other day, you asked me to show you some
proof that I'm an ESPer. You still wanna see it?

170
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:17,630
That perfect opportunity I was talkin' about's
popped up, so I thought I'd have you join me.

171
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,335
Why do we need to go so far out of town to do this?

172
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,426
We're gonna have to drive a little ways if you
wanna see my abilities as an ESPer. It's timing, really.

173
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,745
A certain place, the right conditions...

174
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:33,333
So now we're heading out towards just such a location and
it meets all the requirements in exactly the right ways.

175
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,067
Do you still think that Haruhi's
some kind of god or something?

176
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,378
Let me ask you this:

177
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:39,501
Do you know what the anthropic principle is?

178
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:40,766
Nope, never heard of it.

179
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,791
Okay then, here it goes.

180
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,766
Basically, this is the theory that the
universe is the way it is right now simply...

181
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,408
because human beings could observe it
and determine that it was the way it is.

182
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,715
So, did you get all that?

183
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,378
I didn't get any of it

184
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:56,875
How about, I observe, therefore the universe is.

185
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,700
Or something along those lines.

186
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,873
In other words, on this particular world,
there are sentient beings that are called "humans."

187
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,990
Now then, by discovering the laws of physics in constants,

188
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:09,775
human beings can observe the fact
that the universe actually exists at all.

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,777
When that happens, the existence
of the universe becomes apparent.

190
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,958
Therefore, we can say if the human beings who observe
the universe hadn't actually evolved as far as they did,

191
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:24,385
then there wouldn't be any observations, and the universe
wouldn't have anyone to acknowledge its existence.

192
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,238
So it wouldn't really matter
if the universe existed or not.

193
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:30,525
The universe is because human beings know it is.

194
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:33,177
Anyway, that's the reasoning from the human perspective.

195
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:34,581
You're kidding, right?

196
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:37,729
I mean, with or without humans,
the universe is still the universe.

197
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,212
Well, that's also correct.

198
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:42,980
Therefore, the anthropic principle isn't
anything more than a speculative theory.

199
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:46,284
However, this theory does bring up an interesting dilemma.

200
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,192
Why was the universe created in such a
way that human beings could survive in it?

201
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,646
It would only take a slight change in the
gravitational constant or particle mass ratio...

202
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,791
for the universe to not allow a
planet like the Earth to exist.

203
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:04,417
Okay, you sound like one of those pamphlets from
some kooky religion that's into science and technology.

204
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:09,341
Actually, I don't really believe that humans
were created by a god or some omnipotent being.

205
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:12,249
With all I've seen, something
like that doesn't make sense.

206
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:14,188
I say that, but I still have doubts.

207
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,201
About what?

208
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:18,558
Sometimes I get the feeling that
we're all just a bunch of clowns...

209
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,397
standing on our tiptoes at the edge of a great abyss.

210
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,898
No, I'm just kidding.

211
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,658
Look, I don't understand a thing you just said.

212
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:31,020
The reason I went into the whole anthropic
principle thing was to draw a comparison.

213
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,352
I haven't even gotten to Miss Suzumiya yet.

214
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:38,110
And that's another thing. Why are you and
Nagato and Miss Asahina all so obsessed with Haruhi?

215
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:41,065
Well, I can't speak for the
others, but I think she's charming.

216
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:43,180
Anyway, let's get back to business.

217
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:46,538
I was wondering if you remember the
stuff I once explained to you about

218
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,683
how the world may have in fact
been created by Miss Suzumiya.

219
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,567
Although it's annoying as hell,
yeah, I do remember you saying that.

220
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,112
She has the power to turn anything
she wishes for into a reality.

221
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,575
Oh, come on, you can't seriously believe that's true.

222
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,433
Miss Suzumiya was positive that aliens existed,

223
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:03,856
and then she wished that there was such a thing.

224
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,619
That's why Yuki Nagato's here.

225
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,666
She wanted to meet people from the
future, so she wished for that, too.

226
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,316
And that's why Mikuru Asahina showed up here.

227
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:17,166
And as for myself, she wished for ESPers to be a reality,
and, lo and behold, here I am at your service, sir.

228
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,816
Like I said, how do you know all this anyway?

229
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:21,924
Well, about three years ago...

230
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,519
I'm a little sick of hearing
about this three years ago crap.

231
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,181
Three years ago, and without any warning,

232
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:30,649
I just knew I had these powers and
I also knew how I should use them.

233
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:35,747
And I wasn't alone. There were other people who
had the same experience as me at the same time.

234
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:39,975
And get this, all of us knew that
Haruhi Suzumiya was the reason for it.

235
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,395
I can't explain why.

236
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,337
It was just something that all of us knew.

237
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,741
All right, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt,

238
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,324
but I really can't see Haruhi doing that kind of stuff.

239
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,836
At first, we couldn't believe it ourselves either.

240
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,028
No one could wrap their heads around the possibility...

241
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:57,127
that, thanks to one girl, the whole
universe changed or maybe it was created.

242
00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:02,512
And on top of all that, it's like there's nothing
here that's special enough to hold her interest.

243
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,205
That's the scary thing about it.

244
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,392
Why scary?

245
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,344
I told you.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,225
If you had the power to create the universe at will,

247
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,290
you'd also have the power to destroy this world.

248
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,944
Then you could rebuild it into whatever you wanted.

249
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,524
If that really happened, it would
mean the end of everything as we know it.

250
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,656
Although if it does happen, and we'd have no
way of knowing it even happened, then again,

251
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,778
maybe something like that has happened before.

252
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:24,704
You never know.

253
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:28,550
Perhaps the universe has been destroyed
and rebuilt lots of times already.

254
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,387
Look, why don't you tell Haruhi what you really are.

255
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,732
I'm sure if she found out that
ESPers were real, she'd be ecstatic.

256
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,246
Then maybe she wouldn't think about changing the world.

257
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:39,333
Well, there's a problem with that.

258
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:44,887
If Miss Suzumiya finds out about us ESPers and then starts
thinkin' our powers are like some common occurrence,

259
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,188
the world would be knee deep in ESPers.

260
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,291
Every law of physics would get
twisted up like a garden hose.

261
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:52,791
The entire universe would fall into chaos.

262
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:56,529
If you guys exist because Haruhi
wished it, why isn't she aware of it?

263
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:58,439
I mean, don't you think that's strange?

264
00:15:58,682 --> 00:15:59,559
Not really.

265
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,550
There's the part of her that wished for
aliens, ESPers, and time travelers to be real,

266
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:07,249
but she's also got a practical side
that thinks those things are impossible.

267
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,078
She's conflicted between the two.

268
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:12,277
Yes, she does and says things that are eccentric,

269
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:17,839
but in reality, Miss Suzumiya's just an ordinary
human with a good sense of what's real and what's not.

270
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:20,781
In junior high, her energy was like a sandstorm,

271
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,608
but in the past few months, it's started to calm down.

272
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,828
I'd prefer it if she stayed calm.

273
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:29,732
But now, we need to face the fact
that she's creating a new tornado.

274
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:30,892
What d'you mean?

275
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,952
Hate to say it, but it's your fault.

276
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,467
What do I have to do with this?

277
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:38,291
What're you talkin' about? You're the one
that gave her the idea to form this strange club.

278
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:41,967
Because of the conversation she had with
you, Haruhi decided that she'd create a club...

279
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:44,259
filled with all sorts of weird people, didn't she?

280
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,639
Therefore, you are responsible for this.

281
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,166
And because of that, a member from each of
the three groups that are interested in what...

282
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:54,022
Haruhi Suzumiya is doing are now
conveniently gathered together in one place.

283
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:55,816
So I'm the scapegoat.

284
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,960
Well, actually, there's more to it than that.

285
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,382
I hate to say this after draggin' you all the
way out here, but if you'd prefer to go back,

286
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,250
it's not too late.

287
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,502
You gotta be kidding me.

288
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,913
All right then, so could you do
me a favor and close your eyes?

289
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:27,724
It'll only take a couple of seconds.

290
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,511
<i>Do you have to hold my hand?</i>

291
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,786
Okay, open 'em.

292
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,060
The gap between dimensions.

293
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,460
Separate from the world we know, completely closed space.

294
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:54,522
And in the middle of this crosswalk
is the wall for this closed space.

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,644
It's about five kilometers wide, and normally
there isn't any physical way of entering this space.

296
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,462
But that's one of the powers I have.

297
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,982
That is, when the conditions are right.

298
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:10,689
If you can picture a dome that's been plopped
down over the city, well, we're standing in it.

299
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:15,785
As we're in here, talking, life goes on
as normal in the world outside the space.

300
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:20,390
And normal folks wandering in here,
well, that doesn't happen too often.

301
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:24,173
Now, closed spaces created completely at random.

302
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,486
Sometimes they pop up every other day.

303
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:29,110
And sometimes you won't see one for a couple of months.

304
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:33,581
One things for sure though, whenever
Miss Suzumiya gets emotionally unstable,

305
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,041
it creates a space like this somewhere.

306
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,775
I can sense when closed space is created,

307
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,227
and I know where to go to find the door to get in.

308
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:44,459
My powers aren't limited to finding
these things and getting into them.

309
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:50,378
You could say that my power somehow reflect upon
the things within Miss Suzumiya's consciousness.

310
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:56,791
So if this closed place is a pimple that appears on
Miss Suzumiya's spirit, we ESPers are the acne medication.

311
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,065
You know, your metaphors are hard to understand.

312
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,884
Yeah, I get that a lot.

313
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,670
But then, you sure are something.

314
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,833
I mean, here you are, seeing all
this, but you don't seem surprised.

315
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,735
I've seen a lot of strange things already.

316
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,275
Well, it looks like it's starting.

317
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,890
Please, take a look behind you.

318
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,320
When Miss Suzumiya's irritation level gets to
a certain point, these giants suddenly appear.

319
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,539
I think it's a form of stress relief for her with those
things acting out on her behalf and destroying stuff.

320
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,401
I mean, she can't go causing
riots or anything in the real world,

321
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:39,295
so she creates a closed space and
she's free to unleash her fury inside it.

322
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,314
Don't you think that's logical?

323
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,847
I mean, that thing shouldn't be
able to support its own weight.

324
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,462
It seems to transcend the laws of physics, doesn't it?

325
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,064
Even if you brought in an army unit in to fire
rockets at it, it still wouldn't stop that thing.

326
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:55,421
So you mean that thing just keeps tearing stuff up?!

327
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:57,270
Not quite. Have a look over there.

328
00:19:58,754 --> 00:19:59,753
Other ESPers.

329
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:05,485
They're just like me, people that hunt down
the giants created and powered by Miss Suzumiya.

330
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,077
Stay here. It's time for me to go help out.

331
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,246
<i>I can't believe this is happening.</i>

332
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:41,574
Sorry to make you wait.

333
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,558
Oh, there's something else I wanna show you.

334
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:44,978
Last thing, I promise.

335
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,712
I don't think anything's gonna top that.

336
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,326
Once us ESPers get rid of the giant,

337
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,050
the bubble of closed space disintegrates,

338
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,972
and it's quite the spectacle.

339
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,343
So, now do you understand?

340
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,521
Uh... no.

341
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,692
We have a name for that giant you saw.

342
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,297
We call them "Shinjin," a man that's made by god.

343
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:21,329
The Shinjin are linked to Miss Suzumiya's metal state
and so are we. Stop me if this starts to get confusing.

344
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:25,607
When a closed space is created, the
Shinjin rise up and take the form of giants.

345
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,070
That's when I get to unleash my supernatural powers.

346
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:31,600
However, I can only use them within
the confines of the closed space.

347
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,678
Right now, sitting in this cab,
I don't have any powers at all.

348
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,941
You're probably wondering why
I've been given these powers, right?

349
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,398
I guess it would've been okay for anybody to have 'em.

350
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:42,450
I just happened to be the one chosen.

351
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,450
And as for the Shinjin, we can't
leave them alone to do what they want.

352
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:52,379
The reason is, that the more stuff the Shinjin
get to destroy, the bigger the closed space becomes.

353
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,250
That space we were just in?

354
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,319
Believe it or not, that was one of the smaller ones.

355
00:21:56,556 --> 00:22:01,042
If we left it alone, it'd keep on growing,
getting bigger and bigger until it covered the world.

356
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:04,119
If that happens, the world ends.

357
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:07,668
The gray void of the closed space
would replace the world we live in now.

358
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,798
But how do you know it would happen like that?

359
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,391
I don't know how I know,

360
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,865
I just know that I know, you know?

361
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:16,302
And the same goes for everyone
else that belongs to the organization.

362
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:20,408
If we don't do something about all this,
the world doesn't stand a chance at all.

363
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:22,780
It's such a bother.

364
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:26,706
So please, keep an eye on Miss Suzumiya's behavior.

365
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,824
Her mental state's been stable for a while, but
it looks like it's starting to get active again.

366
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:33,426
Things like today haven't happened in a long time.

367
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:37,708
Even if I do keep an eye on Haruhi, don't
you think I'm a little out of my league here?

368
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,692
Hey now, don't sell yourself so short.

369
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,554
If it were up to me, I'd let you
handle all the stuff by yourself,

370
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,638
'cause if there's anyone that I trust, it'd be you.

371
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:46,708
But, there's many different opinions among us,

372
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,481
and things are definitely complicated.

373
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:52,102
<i>Koizumi tells me to keep an eye on Haruhi's behavior,</i>

374
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:55,321
<i>and for some reason, Nagato tells me to be careful.</i>

375
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,010
<i>Even though both of them warned me,</i>

376
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:00,813
<i>I really didn't think anything would happen right away.</i>

377
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,981
<i>If I could see into the future
and know that the very next day...</i>

378
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,608
<i>I'd be in the middle of one of the
hairiest situations ever in my life,</i>

379
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,286
<i>I'm sure I wouldn't have been as calm as I was right then.</i>
