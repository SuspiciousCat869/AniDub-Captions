1
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:03,286
We're movin' on to the next scene!

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:07,746
In this one, Yuki, I want you to use
your magic to zap the heck outta Mikuru!

3
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,072
<i>Your answer should be, "No!</i>

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:16,838
<i>There's absolutely no way I'd let
you hurt Miss Asahina with your powers!"</i>

5
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:18,647
<i>Look at her...</i>

6
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:21,990
<i>She's so terrified, she's
turning blue and shaking like crazy!</i>

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,439
Oh, well...

8
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:34,311
I guess we'll have to use CG effects in this scene.

9
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:38,982
Hey, Kyon, don't forget to make a couple
of beams come out of Yuki's wand, okay?

10
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:42,312
<i>How am I supposed to know how
to make a visual effect like that?</i>

11
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:47,167
Okay, Mikuru! I want you to scream,
and then fall down like you're in pain!

12
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,955
We need a scene with pigeons.

13
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:31,749
What?

14
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,712
There's a shrine nearby. We're going there next.

15
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:39,690
I wanna shoot Mikuru walking
heroically as pigeons fly all around her.

16
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,173
It would be so awesome if the pigeons were all white.

17
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,736
But I guess it doesn't matter what color they are.

18
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:47,753
<i>Can't you read Japanese?!</i>

19
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,787
What am I supposed to be shooting?

20
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,329
Kyon! That's the shot! Hurry up, roll the camera!

21
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,267
Don't just sit there, look heroic!

22
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:06,389
Hey! Whaddya think you're doing?!

23
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:14,713
Retreat!

24
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,730
Oh, Mikuru...

25
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,412
You don't eat much, do you?

26
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,114
You'll never get any bigger if you don't eat more.

27
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,146
If your boobs are the only things growing,

28
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:35,196
you'll only appeal to a small
fan-base. You need to get taller.

29
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:36,726
<i>She'll grow up, all right.</i>

30
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:42,328
<i>I dunno how many years it'll take, but Miss Asahina
is gonna grow up to have a face and body so fine,</i>

31
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:45,018
<i>she could be a contender for the Miss Universe pageant.</i>

32
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,416
<i>But I doubt she knows that yet.</i>

33
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:53,281
Hey, Haruhi. What are you gonna do if that
priest decides to file a complaint with our school?

34
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:57,429
Koizumi's wearing his uniform today,
and that's pretty much a dead giveaway.

35
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,626
Aw, don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,628
Besides, jackets like that are common. If
the priest says something, we'll just play dumb.

37
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:08,187
<i>Once we show this movie to
everyone, our cover's gonna be blown.</i>

38
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,862
<i>I mean, I seriously doubt there are that
many waitresses coming out to the shrine,</i>

39
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,832
<i>just so they can run around with the pigeons.</i>

40
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:18,026
Anyway, what next? Where are we shooting?

41
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,421
I'm thinkin' we go back to the park and shoot some more.

42
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,739
I just realized that we didn't get
enough footage for the fight scene.

43
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:29,862
I wanna get Mikuru running for her life
through the forest, with Yuki chasing her!

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,578
Then, we could have Mikuru fall off a cliff!

45
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:36,973
But Koizumi just happens to be walking
by and saves her at the last minute!

46
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,811
<i>What a slap-dash way to come up with a story.</i>

47
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,228
<i>Wait, what if she really does
make Miss Asahina fall off a cliff?</i>

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,502
<i>You should fall off instead!</i>

49
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,336
<i>Why don't you wear her costume and be her stunt double?</i>

50
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:52,182
<i>You're not as busty as Miss Asahina, but still...</i>

51
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:54,168
Hey, what are you thinking about?

52
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:58,344
If you think I'm gonna put on her waitress
outfit, you've got another think comin'!

53
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,004
<i>She's a mind reader?</i>

54
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,546
Is anyone else going to be in
the movie, or just the three of us?

55
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,244
<i>Don't ask stupid questions!</i>

56
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:09,607
You've got a point. Three characters might not be enough.

57
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,564
Thanks for the head's up, Koizumi!

58
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:13,061
I almost missed that one!

59
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:15,073
You just got more screen time!

60
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,448
Oh, wow! Thank you!

61
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:19,443
<i>Serves you right.</i>

62
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:22,174
<i>You go stirring up a hornets'
nest, you get what you deserve.</i>

63
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,436
<i>Notice I didn't say anything.</i>

64
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:29,833
Before the boss can be defeated, the good
guys have to beat up a buncha minions first.

65
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,105
Are minions gonna work, though?

66
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:33,463
Minions are good.

67
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:34,711
I know, right?

68
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,237
<i>Taniguchi and Kunikida, the perfect supporting characters.</i>

69
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,739
<i>Ultimate minions.</i>

70
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:44,218
A lot of bad stuff has to happen to Mikuru in this movie.

71
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,736
After all, the theme of the story
depends on how hard she suffers.

72
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:51,915
She has to overcome horrible odds
before she can have a happy ending.

73
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:59,043
And the more we can make Mikuru suffer in the
movie, the bigger the pay off is gonna be in the end!

74
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,207
<i>What's with that look she just gave me? Does
she really think I'm gonna let this happen to her?</i>

75
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,588
<i>Later, we returned to the park and the woods for more fun.</i>

76
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,865
We're not gonna use the guns in the next scene.

77
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:24,182
I was hoping for something cooler and
flashier, but ours don't shoot smoke or flames.

78
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,385
They're just not realistic enough.

79
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,966
Mikuru, you stand here.

80
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,722
Yuki, you're over here.

81
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:36,923
Don't move from your marks.

82
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,775
I wanna shoot you guys staring each other down, okay?

83
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,728
Grab the reflector board, Koizumi.

84
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,576
And, action!

85
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,909
What the... ?!

86
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,383
<i>Action?</i>

87
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,403
<i>All you did was tell them to stand there.</i>

88
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,709
<i>What kind of action were you expecting out of them anyway?</i>

89
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:07,266
Oh, come on! You call this a battle scene?!

90
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:09,305
<i>What do you expect? They're just standing there.</i>

91
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:14,630
What is your problem?

92
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:18,045
Just because you're cute doesn't mean
you have the right to slack off, you know!

93
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,699
There are lots of other girls who are
just as cute who'd kill for your spot!

94
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:23,812
If you don't get with the program,

95
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:27,262
you're gonna be left in the dust
by someone even younger and cuter!

96
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:28,903
<i>What's she talking about?</i>

97
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:32,776
Do something, Mikuru! At least
try shooting a beam out of your eye!

98
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,848
I can't do that!

99
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,932
That's the whole point of your
left eye being a different color!

100
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,462
I didn't just make it blue for no reason!

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,276
There's incredible power hidden inside that eye.

102
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,004
That's what the beam's all about!

103
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,396
It's the Mikuru Beam, so start firing it!

104
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:49,296
I can't!

105
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:51,214
Get into it! Fire it!

106
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,033
You're hurting...

107
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:53,097
<i>You idiot!</i>

108
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:54,899
Hey! Cut it out!

109
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:56,645
What are you doing?!

110
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:57,916
I said, cut it out!

111
00:07:58,267 --> 00:07:58,659
Let go!

112
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,487
Stop! Calm down...

113
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:09,571
What, are you crazy?! People
can't fire beams from their eyes!

114
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:13,628
Humph. I know that.

115
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:19,870
All I was trying to do was get her to
act like she could really shoot a beam.

116
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:23,105
It's hard to believe she's the
hero when she's not that into it.

117
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,796
You never get it when I'm joking around.

118
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,012
<i>That's because your jokes never turn out to be jokes!</i>

119
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,157
<i>What if Miss Asahina actually does shoot a
beam out of her eye? What happens then, huh?!</i>

120
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,134
<i>You... can't, can you?</i>

121
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,827
If I might make a suggestion,
maybe after we shoot the scene,

122
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,542
we could figure out the CG part.

123
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:46,830
Thank you.

124
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,826
<i>And who's gonna do that?</i>

125
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,865
That's what I was gonna do anyway.

126
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,409
I didn't like that last take. So we're gonna do it again.

127
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,803
When you strike this pose,
you're gonna shout, "Mikuru Beam!"

128
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,087
Uh... Is this right?

129
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,604
No, it's like this.

130
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,797
And you gotta shut your right eye, like this.

131
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,212
Okay, Mikuru, go for it!

132
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:10,111
Mi-Mikuru Beam!

133
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,718
Ugh, you gotta do it louder than that!

134
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,747
Mikuru Beam!

135
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,504
Don't be shy! Louder!

136
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,322
Uh... Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!

137
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:22,087
Project from the diaphragm!

138
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,494
<i>The stares from the families
watching us are starting to hurt.</i>

139
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:28,414
Okay, good! Let's do this for real!

140
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,028
Unleash the beam!

141
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,326
Mi-Mi-Mikuru Beam!

142
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:44,813
Wha?!

143
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,826
What's up, Yuki?

144
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,221
How'd you end up back there? You're off your mark.

145
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait! Stop! Cut!

146
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,557
Miss Nagato!

147
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,339
What are you doing, Yuki?! Stop!

148
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:23,052
Nagato! What are you doing?! Come on, get off her!

149
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,958
Are you all right?

150
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:37,124
Ugh, what do you guys think you're doing?

151
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:39,419
If it's not in the script, then knock it off.

152
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:43,473
Mikuru, what happened to the contact lens?

153
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:45,641
Huh? It's not there?

154
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:49,537
<i>At times like this, you ask the person
who looks like they know what's going on.</i>

155
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,871
Nagato, do you know what happened to
the contact Miss Asahina was wearing?

156
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,739
I do not.

157
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:55,421
<i>Liar.</i>

158
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,642
Maybe it fell out when you two were struggling.

159
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,971
Oh, it's gotta be around here somewhere.

160
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:03,387
<i>You could at least help us look.</i>

161
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,097
It's so light, it could've been blown away by the wind.

162
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,419
That's what I think.

163
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:09,621
What happened?

164
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:10,678
Did it break?

165
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:13,357
That's weird. It must have been cheap.

166
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,154
Huh. Oh, well. It's the photo
club's equipment, so go figure.

167
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,994
Just tape up the back, Koizumi.
That should fix it for now.

168
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:21,818
You got it.

169
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:27,182
If you don't have the contact lens,
then the shots aren't going to match up.

170
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,524
What'll we do now?

171
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:32,702
I've got an idea!

172
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,934
We could have her eye color
change right after she transforms!

173
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,348
Tr-Transform?

174
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:40,932
Of course! It's not realistic if
you're always in the same costume!

175
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,711
You need an alter ego!

176
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,427
There's something unreal about people
who want realism in their fiction.

177
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,966
I think that's a wonderful idea!

178
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:52,543
I'd really like to wear some normal clothes for a change!

179
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,882
That's what we'll do!

180
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,579
When you're in normal mode,
you'll wear the bunny girl outfit!

181
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,435
What?! Wh-Wh-Why?!

182
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,384
Well, because that's the only
other outfit I brought along.

183
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:06,301
Besides, if you wore your normal clothes,
it wouldn't look as cool on the big screen.

184
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,621
Wait! Hold that thought! I just got another idea!

185
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,191
Mikuru's alter ego is a bunny
girl who's got a job at the mall,

186
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,952
getting customers to come in and shop at the stores.

187
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,482
And she only transforms when she senses danger.

188
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,165
That's when she changes into a battling waitress!

189
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,627
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

190
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,117
<i>What about the realism you were talking about before?</i>

191
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:26,621
Come on, let's go!

192
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,940
<i>Your efforts... are appreciated.</i>

193
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,395
Okay, you wanna explain the deal with all the ad-libbing?

194
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:40,823
Here.

195
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,801
So you were the one who took it.

196
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,497
A laser.

197
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,207
<i>Hey, Nagato,</i>

198
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,811
<i>your explanations tend to be a bit short.</i>

199
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:57,951
<i>D'you think you could try maybe talking
for at least, oh I don't know, ten seconds?</i>

200
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:03,190
It's a narrow, spatially coherent
beam of light invisible to the eye.

201
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,845
<i>Got it. A narrow, spatially coherent beam-y thingy...</i>

202
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,274
<i>Sorry, I'm even more confused now.</i>

203
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:10,977
A laser?

204
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:11,526
Yes.

205
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,002
Well, that's unexpected.

206
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:14,589
May I?

207
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,790
There's nothing unusual about this contact lens.

208
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,626
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

209
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:24,091
Would you please show me the palm of your right hand?

210
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:28,690
Sorry, I didn't mean you. I meant Miss Nagato.

211
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:41,269
It broke through my shield.

212
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>You act like it's no big deal! Just looking at it hurts!</i>

213
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,957
It was strong; I had to act fast.

214
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:51,962
Did the laser beam that damaged your
hand come from Miss Asahina's left eye?

215
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,693
Yes.

216
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,494
<i>"Yes?" That's it?!</i>

217
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,534
It will repair itself.

218
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,093
You gotta be kidding!

219
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:06,582
Miss Asahina was just shooting
particle beams out of her eye!

220
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,857
It wasn't a particle beam. Cohesive beam.

221
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:13,373
<i>Laser, mazer, marker-like fop?! Whatever!</i>

222
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:15,350
<i>They're all the same to us normals.</i>

223
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,406
The thing I'm having trouble with is
that she has the ability to fire heat rays.

224
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,474
It's not a heat ray. Photon laser.

225
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,538
<i>Again, we don't need to get all scientific about it!</i>

226
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:31,069
Do you think Miss Asahina's always
had the power to do something like this?

227
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:36,328
No. Currently, Mikuru Asahina is a normal human being.

228
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,534
She is no different from anyone else.

229
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:42,110
Could there be some sort of tiny mechanism inside?

230
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,929
It is a simple cosmetic accessory.

231
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,162
This is amazing.

232
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:51,183
<i>If Nagato hadn't stepped up when she did and
blocked the laser beam Miss Asahina shot at us,</i>

233
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,217
<i>it would've gone right through the camera lens.</i>

234
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,383
<i>Then... it would've gone through my eye,</i>

235
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,944
<i>cook some stuff and then come out the back of my head!</i>

236
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,658
<i>Not a pretty picture.</i>

237
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:02,879
Miss Suzumiya was the one who caused it.

238
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:08,154
She wanted to have a Mikuru Beam in her movie,
so reality changed and provided one for her.

239
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:09,274
Very interesting.

240
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:13,366
Wait a second! Nobody cast a
magic spell on that contact lens!

241
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:16,980
So even if Haruhi wished for it,
how can a killer beam come out of it?

242
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:22,114
That's easy. Miss Suzumiya doesn't
need magic spells or strange technology.

243
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:26,126
All she has to do is believe
something exists, and it will.

244
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,857
Yeah, but she wouldn't really expect
a beam to come shooting out of her eye!

245
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,218
Yes, that's true.

246
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,856
Miss Suzumiya has enough common
sense to know fact from fiction.

247
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:39,750
However, it's also true that the common
sense of this world doesn't really apply to her.

248
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,832
Today's incident is most likely the
result of a phenomenon of some sort.

249
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:44,754
I think that...

250
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:47,024
Uh-oh, she's on her way back now.

251
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,548
We'll have to continue this discussion a little later.

252
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,704
Would you stop complaining?! Geez!

253
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,328
Act like an actress!

254
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,709
To get on the fast track to a Blue Ribbon
award, you can't be so shy about stripping!

255
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,435
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

256
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:08,330
<i>Zoom... in!</i>

257
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:12,167
<i>Confirmation obtained. It's the real Miss Asahina.</i>

258
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,295
What're you doing?!

259
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,073
You're not supposed to be
shooting anything unless I tell you!

260
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:26,336
<i>Yeah, I know... I didn't press the record
button, I was just... focusing the camera.</i>

261
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,540
Okay, okay, everyone! Listen up now!

262
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,024
Let's make this happen!

263
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,745
<i>I shot footage that was supposed to be
"day in the life of Mikuru Asahina" stuff,</i>

264
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,031
<i>but I'm still not sure what kind
of life she's supposed to have.</i>

265
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:55,535
<i>And after making Poor Miss
Asahina run this way and that...</i>

266
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:02,170
I'm not feelin' the whole
mountain-in-the-background thing.

267
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:04,240
We're gonna go into town!

268
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,627
<i>Oh, geez!</i>

269
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:17,996
<i>So... Miss Asahina wore her bunny
girl outfit until the sun went down.</i>

270
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,999
<i>In fact, all she ever did that
day was walk around in that costume.</i>

271
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,612
<i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>

272
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,391
<i>Asking for permission to film
was a foreign concept to Haruhi.</i>

273
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,758
<i>In her mind, she was free to shoot
wherever and whatever she wanted.</i>

274
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:38,548
<i>But then, her notion of what "free" actually
was was similar to the domination of the papacy,</i>

275
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,987
<i>during the age of Pope Innocent III or something.</i>

276
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,298
<i>She doesn't get what "free" means.</i>

277
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,204
Yeah! That's good for today.

278
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:57,680
<i>That was a long day.</i>

279
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,318
<i>But tomorrow's Sunday, so I get to chill out.</i>

280
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,124
Okay! See ya tomorrow!

281
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,832
You know the drill - Same
place, same time, same everything!

282
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:06,857
<i>She said, like it's no big deal.</i>

283
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,146
<i>I hope she gives us time to change our clothes.</i>

284
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,465
What was that? We're on a tight schedule.

285
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,716
We can't take it easy for even a second!

286
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:17,513
You're gonna have plenty of time to
kick back once the arts festival is over.

287
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,739
Consider your calendars booked
until we get this thing finished!

288
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,596
Here.

289
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:24,687
We're gonna do our best to make this movie awesome!

290
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:29,731
Actually, since I'm the one directing it, this
movie's awesomeness is practically guaranteed!

291
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:32,711
Everything else depends on how hard you guys work!

292
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,386
Make sure you're on time tomorrow.

293
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:37,091
If anyone shows up late, I'm gonna bust some heads!

294
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:45,651
Don't worry, I'll take care of telling Miss Asahina, okay?

295
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,360
Now what are you talking about?

296
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,267
The laser, of course!

297
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,770
Beams won't shoot out her eye
if she doesn't change the color.

298
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,138
On second thought,

299
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,712
perhaps we should take further precautions against it.

300
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,453
I'm sure she'll cooperate with us.

301
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,076
After all, beams are dangerous things.

302
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,361
<i>Oh, man...</i>

303
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:15,440
<i>Nagato keeps jumping in and saving my life.</i>

304
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:26,712
You totally lied! What's the deal, Kyon?!

305
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,784
Where's Miss Asahina, huh?!

306
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:31,936
The only reason I came is 'cause
you said she was gonna be here!

307
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:36,347
I don't see her, do you?! I want
my eye candy, bro! Where is she?!

308
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:40,168
Thirty percent of this picture's success
is riding on you and that bunny tail!

309
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:44,063
Yeah, all I'm seeing is Suzumiya's
angry face. It's a scam, man!

310
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,015
What the hell?!

311
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,010
<i>Then stare at Nagato. Just die already.</i>

312
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,410
I kinda think that costume
looks pretty cool on Miss Nagato.

313
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,078
Hey, Kyon!

314
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,048
So what's up with Mikuru?

315
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,586
It looks like Miss Tsuruya's been
tricked into being an extra, too.

316
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,167
What are we supposed to be doing today, huh?

317
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,470
I was told to show up if I wasn't doing anything!

318
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:06,084
Hey, so what's it say on Miss Suzumiya's arm band?

319
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:08,470
Ooh! What's the video camera for?

320
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:11,096
Hey, what's up with Yuki's crazy outfit?

321
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:14,040
Koizumi's looking super hot today! Whoa!

322
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,415
What a spaz.

323
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:16,825
What did you just say?!

324
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,177
Your stomach hurts?!

325
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:22,659
Idiot! Seriously, what are you, still
in junior high school or something?!

326
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,082
You've got 30 seconds to get over here!

327
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,331
Miss Asahina appears to be suffering
from a sudden bout of shut-in syndrome.

328
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,733
Anyway, I'm gonna have to go get her.

329
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,202
Where is that bag?

330
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,378
I think I can understand Miss Asahina's apprehension.

331
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:55,463
It looks like she might actually become a real-life
version of the transforming heroine she plays.

332
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:58,863
The laser beam shooting out of
her eye is a bit much, though.

333
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,683
Anyway, not to worry.

334
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:04,385
It's safe to say we won't have to
deal with any strange beams again.

335
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,988
And why is that?

336
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,652
Miss Nagato gave us a hand with it.

337
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,204
What did you guys do to Miss Asahina?

338
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:16,294
She neutralized the laser beam.

339
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:18,375
I'm not sure how, though.

340
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:24,065
Unlike some of the other TFEI terminals
out there, Miss Nagato isn't very talkative.

341
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,239
Okay... What's a TFEI?

342
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:29,497
Just an acronym my organization assigned to them.

343
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:32,120
Its meaning isn't anything important, though.

344
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,179
But as far as Miss Nagato's concerned,

345
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,563
I have to admit, she's most unusual.

346
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,949
Compared to the other TFEIs, that is.

347
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:49,235
Anyway, it was pretty dark that night.

348
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:53,124
I was on the way home from the store,
and I passed this taxi parked by the curb.

349
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:54,129
Oh yeah?

350
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,258
So, I'm lookin' at it,

351
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,061
and you know that light that
tells you if it's available or not?

352
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,172
I coulda sworn it said "love."

353
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,286
You don't see that every day.

354
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,624
Before I could take a closer
look at the thing, it drove away.

355
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:07,649
So I'm standing there, right?

356
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:11,976
And then, I realized the sign didn't say
"love." Love's what's missing from my life!

357
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,514
Well, you never know. Maybe
the sign really did say "love."

358
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,763
Maybe it was a private taxi.

359
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,895
<i>I never thought we'd have to rely on these two Einsteins.</i>

360
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,180
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

361
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:28,217
Pretending to be sick! You outta be ashamed of yourself!

362
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,930
You're shooting today, period!

363
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:36,031
Hiya, Mikuru! Wow, you're
looking super sexy in that dress!

364
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:37,707
I'm sorry I'm so late!

365
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,749
Oh, that's okay. I don't mind.

366
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,791
Hiya, Miss Suzumiya!

367
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,784
Sorry about yesterday.

368
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,762
I don't know what happened; I just
started firing lasers all over the place.

369
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:50,197
<i>Oh, don't worry, it didn't hit me or anything.</i>

370
00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:59,117
I was bitten.

371
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:00,557
Really? By what?

372
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:01,832
Miss Nagato.

373
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,485
She injected some nanomachines into me.

374
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:07,576
And now, nothing's gonna come out of my eye anymore.

375
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:09,109
Thank goodness.

376
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,929
What did she inject you with?

377
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,660
Nanomachines!

378
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,011
Last night, her and Koizumi came over...

379
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,078
Whatcha whisperin' about, huh?!

380
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,049
Ooh, you're so cute, Mikuru!

381
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,883
I wanna keep you as my pet!

382
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,107
<i>Don't stare. You'll wither her cuteness.</i>

383
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:25,029
I've got our location for today.

384
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:28,890
There's a big lake by Koizumi's
house that's perfect for the next scene!

385
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,991
Come on, everyone! There's a ton of movie left to shoot.
