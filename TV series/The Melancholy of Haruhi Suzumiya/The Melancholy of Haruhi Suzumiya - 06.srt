1
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:05,585
<i>Self-proclaimed humanoid interface created by aliens.</i>

2
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:09,439
<i>Self-proclaimed time traveling girl.</i>

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,852
<i>Self-proclaimed squad of ESPer boys.</i>

4
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:18,252
<i>They've shown me enough proof that I may now safely
remove the words "self-proclaimed" from their titles.</i>

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,456
<i>The three of them, each for their own reasons,
mind you, are currently focused on Haruhi Suzumiya.</i>

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,409
<i>Even if I believe everything I've
seen, I still can't figure out one thing:</i>

7
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,166
<i>Why me?</i>

8
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:36,164
<i>An alien? A girl from the future, and an ESPer boy
all migrated toward Haruhi because, as Koizumi put it,</i>

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,444
<i>that's what she wished for.</i>

10
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,455
<i>What about me?</i>

11
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:44,512
<i>Why have I been dragged feet-first
into all of this weird stuff anyway?</i>

12
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,593
<i>I mean, I'm a 100% ordinary high schooler.</i>

13
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:50,960
<i>No special powers or anything here.</i>

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,168
<i>I mean, who wrote this scenario?</i>

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,749
<i>Was it you, Haruhi?</i>

16
00:00:57,938 --> 00:01:00,893
<i>Yeah, right. It's not like it's my problem anyway.</i>

17
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:03,356
<i>Why do I have to get all worked up about it?</i>

18
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,391
<i>All of this is Haruhi's fault.</i>

19
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:10,336
<i>Seriously, she's the one who should be worried
about all of this weirdness going on, not me.</i>

20
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,910
<i>Nagato, Koizumi, Miss Asahina...</i>

21
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,415
<i>From now on, they should just go speak to her directly,</i>

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,749
<i>and whatever happens after that,
well, that's Haruhi's problem.</i>

23
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:20,128
<i>I've got nothing to do with it.</i>

24
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:23,421
<i>Everyone else can go do whatever
they want as far as I'm concerned.</i>

25
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:24,137
Yo.

26
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:24,964
Hey.

27
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:29,595
Taniguchi, do you think I'm a normal high schooler?

28
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:30,428
Huh?

29
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:36,303
I don't know. Normal high schoolers don't
go around pushing girls down in classrooms,

30
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:37,156
know what I'm sayin'?

31
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:41,592
Especially Yuki Nagato, who, according
to my ranking system, scores about A-.

32
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,317
<i>I shall explain myself.</i>

33
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:47,643
<i>Taniguchi's memory of the events was a
complete fiction; a fantasy, merely a dream.</i>

34
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:52,774
<i>Nagato's the victim of Haruhi, who's
turned the Literary Club into her lair.</i>

35
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:56,757
<i>Upset by this turn of events,
she merely consulted me for advice.</i>

36
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,465
<i>I sympathize with the poor girl, and
agreed to help out as best as I could.</i>

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,969
<i>After Haruhi'd gone, we'd decided to meet in
the classroom so that we could discuss her options.</i>

38
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:08,498
<i>That's when Nagato, an anemic
all her life, suffered a seizure.</i>

39
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:13,407
<i>She toppled over, and as I lunged to prevent
her from falling to the hard, linoleum floor,</i>

40
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,140
<i>you came walking through the door, Taniguchi.</i>

41
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:22,038
<i>Once you find out the truth about something, ten to
one, it's always gonna turn out to be something trivial.</i>

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,063
You liar.

43
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:24,542
Tch..

44
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,320
Even if I was dumb enough to believe that lie,

45
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:32,030
the fact that Nagato, who's famous for being
anti-social, mind you, came to you for advice?

46
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:34,412
Well, that automatically makes you not normal, buddy.

47
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:36,778
I never realized Nagato's that famous.

48
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,162
Also, you happen to be one of Suzumiya's henchman.

49
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:42,079
So if you think that you're just
a normal, male high school student,

50
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,384
then I'm about as normal as a water flea.

51
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:48,803
Hey, Taniguchi, you don't have
any supernatural powers, do you?

52
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:49,562
Huh?

53
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:56,018
I knew it. You've finally become poisoned by
Suzumiya's extreme brand of nuttiness, haven't you?

54
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:59,552
Don't get too close to me, buddy,
or I'll catch the Suzumiya bug.

55
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,084
Why didn't you change outta your gym clothes?

56
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,845
Because it's hot.

57
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,684
Don't worry about it. I'm gonna
change again when we get to the clubroom.

58
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:20,173
Besides, I've got cleaning duty and
it's easier for me to move around in this.

59
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,799
Yeah, well, can't argue with that.

60
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,905
I was thinking, what do you
want Mikuru's next costume to be?

61
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,021
Hm... We've had the bunny girl, the maid...

62
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:27,904
I guess she could...

63
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,816
Wait, what do you mean next?!

64
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:33,750
Kitty cat ears? Or a nurse? Or maybe a dominatrix...

65
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,790
<i>Kitty cat ears... Nurse's outfit... Maybe a dominatrix...</i>

66
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,687
What an idiot.

67
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:40,533
Hey, you're the one who brought it up.

68
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,972
Oh man... I'm so bored...

69
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,287
I see... There it is.

70
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,738
You working on anything important?

71
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:09,258
No, nothing.

72
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,537
Really? Hey, what's this?

73
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,075
<i>I'm screwed!</i>

74
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:16,026
Why does that folder have my name on it, huh?

75
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,474
Come on, let me see, let me see, let me see!

76
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,776
<i>Oh, this? Well, yeah, I warned her.</i>

77
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,000
It's probably nothing to worry about, though.

78
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,350
That sounds like a lie.

79
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,694
Miss Asahina, could you step back a little, please?

80
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:29,590
Please let me look. Can't I see?

81
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:30,771
Let me look!

82
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,244
Come on...

83
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,924
What do you two think you're doing?

84
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,220
So, you're into maid outfits, huh?

85
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,686
What're you talking about?

86
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:44,533
We're gonna change.

87
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,964
Sure, fine with me.

88
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,442
I said we're changing now!

89
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,193
So what?

90
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,678
Get out now!

91
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,401
<i>What's with her?</i>

92
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,603
<i>She never cares if people see her
when she's changing in our homeroom...</i>

93
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:06,012
Well, now my arms and shoulders are cool, but the
rest of this crummy outfit doesn't breathe at all!

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,876
Hello?

95
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,360
So I guess today's the day of the costume party?

96
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,136
Don't make this story more complicated.

97
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,989
Mikuru.

98
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,683
Come here. Have a seat.

99
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,959
They're like a couple of sisters.

100
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:30,183
She just wants to make a maid with braids.

101
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,394
<i>In the end, it was actually a
pretty normal day at the club.</i>

102
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,072
<i>There wasn't really anything we wanted to do.</i>

103
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,512
<i>Actually, we didn't know what we should do.</i>

104
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:45,032
<i>It was like a moratorium on life:</i>

105
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,323
<i>As time flowed by, the life we took for granted,</i>

106
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:49,811
<i>an ordinary life.</i>

107
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:53,948
<i>And despite feeling dissatisfied about
the overwhelming lack of things to do,</i>

108
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:55,870
<i>you keep thinking about the next day.</i>

109
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,568
<i>You keep telling yourself you still got lots of time.</i>

110
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,283
<i>But that was unusual in and of itself.</i>

111
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,416
<i>And it really wasn't a bad thing at all.</i>

112
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:10,274
<i>Almost getting killed by a classmate, or perhaps meeting
a monster tearing up a deserted world with gray skies.</i>

113
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,169
<i>Now, those things don't happen every day.</i>

114
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:16,512
<i>It's true, I wished that days
like this would last forever,</i>

115
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:18,841
<i>and wouldn't you think that way, too?</i>

116
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,254
<i>But there was someone that didn't think so.</i>

117
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,356
<i>And, of course, it was Haruhi Suzumiya.</i>

118
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,586
What d'you think you're doing?

119
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,194
Scissors! I need 'em for art class.

120
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:45,496
Well, okay, I guess, but just
ask for 'em next time, all right?

121
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,308
<i>She knew that she could get away with it.</i>

122
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,481
By the way, do you what makes people have dreams?

123
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,819
There are two kinds of sleep: REM sleep,

124
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:00,404
and then there's non-REM sleep.

125
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,750
The two repeat in intervals throughout the sleep cycle.

126
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:09,601
During REM, when the body's asleep, but the brain
is still somewhat active, that's when we have dreams.

127
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,465
Kyon. Kyon!

128
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,418
The alarm hasn't gone off yet, has it?

129
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:18,616
Wake up!

130
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:20,554
No way.

131
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,467
I'm telling you to wake up!

132
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,591
Do you know where we are right now?

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,745
I thought I woke up,

134
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,900
and then I found myself in this place
with you lying there, passed out next to me.

135
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:45,910
What's going on? And why did we
wake up outside our school like this?

136
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,578
A closed space.

137
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:52,142
I thought I was sleeping in my bed at home,

138
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,087
so how did we end up in this place?

139
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,808
The sky, it's weird.

140
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:57,885
Have you seen Koizumi?

141
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,908
No, why? Is he here?

142
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,905
No, just a hunch I had.

143
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,129
First off, let's get out of the school.

144
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,393
We might be able to find someone somewhere else.

145
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:10,168
You don't seem very surprised by all of this somehow.

146
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,098
Oh, I'm surprised all right.

147
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:14,283
<i>Especially at the fact that you're here.</i>

148
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,299
What is this?

149
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,736
This thing runs all around the perimeter of the school.

150
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,739
Does that mean we can't get out of here?

151
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,748
Well, if you're scared, just go
ahead and grab my arm, why don'tcha?

152
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,861
I'm sure it will help get me in the mood.

153
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:44,481
Jerk.

154
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,669
I can't get a dial tone.

155
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,559
Yeah, that's what I figured.

156
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:01,513
Hey, Kyon, look.

157
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,829
Where are we...?

158
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,147
It's really weird...

159
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:18,665
You thirsty?

160
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,342
No thanks.

161
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,394
What's going on? What is this?

162
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,006
I don't get it at all.

163
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:30,317
Where are we? And why am I here anyway?

164
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,914
And on top of all that, why am I alone with you?

165
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:35,099
How should I know?

166
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,605
I'm gonna look around.

167
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,739
You stay here, got it?

168
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,215
I'll be right back.

169
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,988
<i>Typical Haruhi behavior.</i>

170
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,428
Koizumi, that you?

171
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:58,690
Well, hello there.

172
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,174
Took you long enough to show up.

173
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,231
Although I guess I was sort of expecting
to see you looking a little more normal.

174
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,984
Yeah, that. I need to talk to you about something.

175
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,514
Frankly speaking, this is what
I'd call an emergency situation.

176
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:13,328
Normally, I can get into closed
space without too much trouble,

177
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:16,671
but this time, even with some
extra power from my colleagues,

178
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,223
it was all I could do to show up in this incomplete form,

179
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,582
and I'm not gonna last too long either.

180
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,591
Looks like our ESPer powers are fading.

181
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,285
They could disappear any minute now.

182
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,001
Then, do you know what's going on?

183
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,191
And are Haruhi and I the only ones stuck in here?

184
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:33,673
That's it, the thing we've been afraid of
happening all along is starting to happen right now.

185
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,912
It seems Miss Suzumiya's finally
given up on the real world.

186
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,032
She's decided to create a new one now.

187
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,555
In other words, this is the end of the world.

188
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:47,929
What was that?!

189
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,867
The top brass at the organization
is seriously panicked right now.

190
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:57,056
Nobody knows what will happen to the
real world now that we've lost our deity.

191
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:02,071
If Miss Suzumiya's feeling merciful, we might
get to keep living on this side of the bubble.

192
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:06,051
But it might disappear into nothing the next minute, too.

193
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,006
Wait, now why's this...

194
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:13,117
Who knows? In any case, both you and Miss
Suzumiya have completely disappeared from our world.

195
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:17,201
You two aren't in an ordinary closed space.

196
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,749
It's a new dimension that Miss Suzumiya's created.

197
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:25,082
I dunno. Maybe all the other closed spaces
were practice for the one you're in right now.

198
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:32,279
The space that you're in right now is probably
the world that Miss Suzumiya wishes she was in.

199
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:37,602
I don't really know what she wants, so,
I'm at a loss as to what could happen next.

200
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:40,704
Do you have any idea why I'm the one in here with her?

201
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,209
You honestly have no idea why?

202
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,747
You were chosen by Miss Suzumiya.

203
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:51,579
You were the one and only person from the other
world that Miss Suzumiya really wanted to be with.

204
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,944
I thought you'd have realized that by now.

205
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,401
Looks like I'm almost out of time.

206
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,771
Way things are going, I don't think
we'll be seeing each other again.

207
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:06,000
So you're telling me that's it? I gotta live all
alone here with Haruhi in this dull world of gray?

208
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:07,857
You're the new Adam and Eve.

209
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,526
Go on, procreate and increase the population.

210
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,126
I'll punch you for that.

211
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:15,694
Just joking. It's only a theory,
but I think in a little while,

212
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,430
this place will start looking more familiar.

213
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:21,158
However, it's not going to be
exactly the same as over here.

214
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,600
Well, if I ever get reincarnated on your side,

215
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,783
be sure to say hi for me.

216
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,209
So we can never go back to that side ever again?

217
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,276
Only if Miss Suzumiya wishes it.

218
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,122
Although I hate to say it, the
chances of that are pretty slim.

219
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:37,048
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot; I would've
liked to get to know both of you better.

220
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,655
The whole thing fills me with a bit of regret.

221
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:45,057
Oh! Almost forgot. I've got messages for
you from Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato.

222
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:48,767
Miss Asahina told me to deliver an apology to you.

223
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,121
"I'm sorry, it's all my fault."

224
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:55,424
And Yuki Nagato told me to
tell you, "Turn on the computer."

225
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,514
Goodbye...

226
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,095
<i>What kind of joke is this anyway...?</i>

227
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,852
'Course I can see it.

228
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:40,591
What should I do?

229
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:08,973
That what?

230
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:24,038
Nagato!

231
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,284
What do you want me to do...?

232
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,184
Nagato... Koizumi...

233
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,946
Kyon! Something's here!

234
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:56,526
What is it?! A monster?! It's not an illusion, is it?!

235
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:58,403
Maybe it's an alien?!

236
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:03,817
Or is it some kind of super weapon that a race of
ancient people created that's been awakened in our world?!

237
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,980
What're you doing?!

238
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,394
That thing's not trying to attack us, is it?

239
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,469
What're we running away from it for?

240
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,256
I don't think it's evil or anything.

241
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:21,584
Who knows?

242
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:28,367
Do you know what's happening?

243
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:31,378
This weird world, and that giant...

244
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,399
Don't you wanna go back to the world we used to be in?

245
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,570
We can't stay in a place like this forever.

246
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,995
I mean, if we get hungry, there
aren't any places to eat here.

247
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,325
It's strange, but I have a feeling we'll get by somehow.

248
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:51,872
I'm having fun right now. I wonder why...?

249
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,590
What're you going to do with the SOS Brigade?

250
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:58,347
You created it. Are you just gonna throw it away?

251
00:15:58,372 --> 00:15:59,759
It doesn't matter anymore.

252
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:03,806
I'm having the strangest, most wonderful
experience I've ever dreamed of having!

253
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:06,908
I don't need to search for it
when it's happening right here.

254
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,129
But I wanna go back!

255
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,188
It took something like this to make me realize:

256
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,700
Even though I complain a lot, I
really liked my life up till now.

257
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,329
Kunikida, and that idiot Taniguchi...

258
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,648
Koizumi, Nagato, Miss Asahina...

259
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:26,988
And that Asakura girl who disappeared,
you could put her on the list, too.

260
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:29,111
What're you talking about?

261
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,380
I wanna go back and see all of them again.

262
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,922
I don't know, I feel like I've still got so
many things that I wanna talk to them about.

263
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:41,649
You'll see them again. It's not like this place
is gonna be covered by a big, gloomy shadow forever.

264
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:45,240
Once tomorrow comes around, I'm
positive the sun's gonna shine again.

265
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,155
I know it will, I can tell!

266
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,911
That's not it. I'm not talking about seeing them in here,

267
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,930
I wanna see everybody from the old world in the old world.

268
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,865
I don't understand you...

269
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:09,619
Weren't you sick and tired of
the boring world we were living in?!

270
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:13,551
Didn't you want something really weird
and interesting to happen like I did?!

271
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,686
I used to.

272
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,651
You know something, Haruhi?

273
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:31,046
For the last couple days, I've had all
these strange things happening around me.

274
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,627
You had no way of knowing this, but I guess you
could say the world's been revolving around you.

275
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:37,556
You've been completely unaware of it,

276
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,098
but actually, everything in the world was
getting more and more weird and interesting.

277
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:50,875
Nagato said she was the potential for evolution.

278
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,995
Miss Asahina called her a distortion in space time.

279
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:55,856
And Koizumi treated her like a god.

280
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,154
Then, what about me?

281
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:01,289
What does Haruhi Suzumiya mean to someone like me?

282
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,704
Haruhi is Haruhi, nothing else but Haruhi.

283
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,477
Great, using tautology to dodge the question.

284
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,590
I can't help it, I just don't
have a definite answer for it.

285
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,067
I mean, think about it.

286
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:16,734
If somebody pointed at a classmate of yours and asked
you what that person meant to you, how would you answer?

287
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,012
What would you say?

288
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:19,987
Sorry, I'm dodging the question again.

289
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:22,127
But to me, Haruhi isn't just a classmate,

290
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:24,322
and of course, she's not the potential for evolution,

291
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,618
a time distortion, or a god either.

292
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,267
That's impossible!

293
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,899
Do you know the story of Snow White?

294
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:38,857
What's wrong?

295
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:41,956
I've sorta got a thing for girls with ponytails.

296
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,003
What?

297
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:46,090
I don't remember when it was,
but you had your hair in a ponytail,

298
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,129
and it looked so good on you, it was criminal.

299
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:48,715
Huh?

300
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,223
What're you, an idiot?

301
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,988
What kinda dream was that?!

302
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,274
Sigmund Freud's gotta be laughing at me!

303
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,942
I never had a dream that was so realistic before...

304
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:36,649
Or maybe... Maybe this isn't the old world anymore.

305
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:40,041
Maybe this world is a new one that Haruhi created.

306
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:44,469
And if that's the case, how
would I go about confirming it?

307
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,305
Yo.

308
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:55,446
How you doin'?

309
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,804
I dunno, not so good.

310
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,455
I had a nightmare last night.

311
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,345
Really?

312
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,177
Yeah, I couldn't really get any sleep because of it.

313
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,215
I've never wanted to ditch school so badly like today.

314
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:06,909
Is that so?

315
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:10,724
Haruhi.

316
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:12,904
Yeah, what?

317
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,089
Looks good on you.

318
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,602
I believe I should be thanking you right now.

319
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:41,827
Looks like I get to keep my
part-time job a little while longer.

320
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,193
Well, I don't think we can deny
the distinct possibility that...

321
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:48,146
the world we're in now was
freshly created by her last night.

322
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:51,751
In any case, it is an honor to
see you and Miss Suzumiya again.

323
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,884
Be seeing you after class.

324
00:20:55,425 --> 00:21:00,196
You and Haruhi Suzumiya disappeared from
this world for two hours and 30 minutes.

325
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:04,318
So, tell me, how many more of
your kind are out there anyway?

326
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:05,980
A lot.

327
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:10,283
And, is somebody like Asakura going to
come around and try and kill me again?

328
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,056
Don't worry.

329
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:15,945
I won't let that happen.

330
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:22,954
Kyon, you're back!

331
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,776
I'm so glad to see you again.

332
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,447
I thought... that you'd... never make it back...

333
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:30,467
Miss Asahina...

334
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:32,273
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

335
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,706
If Miss Suzumiya saw this, it'll be like
birds of a feather repeating their mistakes again!

336
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:38,926
I don't have any idea what you're saying.

337
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,422
By the way, Miss Asahina, I believe you've got a star
shaped mole on your chest right about here, am I right?

338
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,103
H-How did you know that...?

339
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:56,776
I-I didn't even know it was
shaped like a star till just now.

340
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,687
W-W-When did you realize it?

341
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,825
And what are you two doing?

342
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,349
Mikuru. I bet you're bored with the maid outfit, so...

343
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,264
I gotcha a new one.

344
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:08,767
What?

345
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:09,958
Stop squirming!

346
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,773
Resistance is futile!

347
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,405
This time it's a nurse's outfit!

348
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,074
Or should I say doctor's aid?

349
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,386
Oh, whatever you call 'em, it's cute!

350
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,801
<i>Now, let me tell you about what happened afterwards.</i>

351
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,400
<i>The SOS Brigade finally submitted
all the necessary paperwork,</i>

352
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:27,122
<i>to register as an extra-curricular
group within the school.</i>

353
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:32,230
<i>I was sure that the name "Spreading Excitement
All Over the World With Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade"...</i>

354
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>...would've been rejected outright.</i>

355
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,729
<i>So we changed it at the last minute to:</i>

356
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,194
<i>"Spreading Cheer to Our Student Body Brigade."</i>

357
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,853
<i>And we still patrol the town for strange phenomena.</i>

358
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:43,747
<i>Today's our second tour of duty.</i>

359
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>By some strange coincidence,
Miss Asahina, Nagato, and Koizumi</i>

360
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,280
<i>all had errands to run,</i>

361
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,800
<i>so I'm waiting for Haruhi by myself.</i>

362
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,491
<i>I made sure to arrive an hour
before we had agreed to meet.</i>

363
00:22:55,714 --> 00:23:00,949
<i>Remember, we had a rule that regardless of whether or not
you were late, the last person to show up gets a penalty.</i>

364
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,256
<i>I'm not quite sure why she's scowling.</i>

365
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:06,367
<i>Perhaps it's a reaction to the low attendance rate today.</i>

366
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,708
<i>Or could it be regret that she's shown up last?</i>

367
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:09,670
<i>I dunno.</i>

368
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,120
<i>But I'll have lots of time to find out...</i>

369
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:14,275
<i>...when she's buying me lunch at the café.</i>

370
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:15,829
<i>And when we sit down,</i>

371
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:18,369
<i>I'd like to talk to her about all sorts of things.</i>

372
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:22,096
<i>About how the SOS Brigade is going to operate from now on,</i>

373
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,312
<i>my wish-list for Miss Asahina's cosplay, etc., etc.</i>

374
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:31,007
<i>But I digress. I already know exactly
what I wanna talk to her about first.</i>

375
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:32,917
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

376
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:39,603
<i>For starters, I'm thinkin' I'd like to talk to her a
little bit about aliens, time travelers, and... ESPers.</i>
