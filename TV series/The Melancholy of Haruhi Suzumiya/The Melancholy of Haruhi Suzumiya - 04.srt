1
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:10,365
You want me to take you to see the nurse?

2
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:16,720
Good morning.

3
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:19,036
I don't think she's feeling too well.

4
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,849
Take care of her, hm!

5
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,918
So why didn't you come by yesterday?

6
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:30,986
Thought you wanted to have a review session or something?

7
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,082
Shut up.

8
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:34,741
I had a review session by myself, okay?

9
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,292
<i>With a little prodding, Haruhi
told me that after school yesterday,</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:42,384
<i>she'd gone back and walked the entire
course we covered on Saturday by herself.</i>

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,937
It's hot and I'm tired.

12
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,956
When do we get to change uniforms?

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,183
I wanna change into my summer uniform now.

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,480
Suzumiya, I know I said this already,

15
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:54,431
but why don't you just quit searching for
these mysteries you're never gonna find, okay?

16
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,908
I mean, why don't you go out and have fun
like a normal high school student for a change?

17
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,753
What kind of fun does a normal high school student have?

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,803
How 'bout you find a nice guy and go walking
around the city looking for strange things?

19
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:07,427
It's a date, so you can kill two birds with one stone.

20
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:09,841
Huh. What do I care about men?

21
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,072
Romantic emotions are nothing but a passing phase.

22
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,341
Just a form of mental illness.

23
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:19,944
Heck, every now then, even I get
into the mood for dumb stuff like that.

24
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,419
I'm a healthy young woman; I've got needs.

25
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,733
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself.

26
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:27,933
But I'm not stupid enough to
get stuck with all of that grief

27
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,786
just because of some momentary urge to get all mushy.

28
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:33,934
Besides, if I went out and really started boy hunting,

29
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,244
what's gonna happen to the SOS Brigade?

30
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,220
I mean, I just created the thing.

31
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,092
You could just change the Brigade into
some sort of random club that has fun,

32
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:43,562
and you'll have a ton of people in it.

33
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:47,717
No way! I made the SOS Brigade
because that stuff's totally boring.

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,298
I mean, I gotta moe character
and a mysterious transfer student,

35
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,218
so why hasn't anything happened yet?!

36
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:57,402
Oh, why can't a couple of weird things happen right now?

37
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,816
Don't go asking for trouble like that.

38
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,884
But then again, it might actually be kinda neat,

39
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,980
if something were to come along and turn
our everyday lives into something more fun.

40
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:14,900
<i>This is a first. I've never seen Haruhi this down.</i>

41
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,345
<i>Isn't her dejected little face cute though?</i>

42
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,469
I wonder if Miss Suzumiya's in love or something?

43
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:21,750
Impossible.

44
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:26,743
<i>Okay, Suzumiya falling in love and, or
something weird popping up to make her happy,</i>

45
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,556
<i>are two things that will
definitely not happen any time soon.</i>

46
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:31,312
<i>Wrong.</i>

47
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,394
<i>Actually, something weird was
quietly lurking just around the corner.</i>

48
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,757
<i>That morning as I talked to Haruhi,</i>

49
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,939
<i>I was actually thinking about something else.</i>

50
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:02,535
And now, without an enemy, Umako
Sagano became tremendously arrogant.

51
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,244
<i>Didn't something like this happen before?</i>

52
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,329
Yo.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,661
<i>It was pretty obvious the handwriting wasn't Nagato's.</i>

54
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:25,129
<i>Besides, she's not really the type to go
around putting messages in a guy's shoe locker.</i>

55
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,475
<i>Could it've been Miss Asahina?</i>

56
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,443
<i>Nah, no way.</i>

57
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,594
<i>She'd set a specific time to meet,</i>

58
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:34,563
<i>and I doubt she'd scribble it
on paper torn out of a memo pad.</i>

59
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:36,835
Oh, it's so hot!

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,693
<i>Haruhi... Impossible.</i>

61
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:42,757
<i>She'd just grab me by the collar and drag me
over to the stairwell just the like last time.</i>

62
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,426
<i>And Koizumi would just say, "Hey, let's talk."</i>

63
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,583
<i>We definitely need an air conditioner.</i>

64
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,220
<i>Clearly it's not a love letter.</i>

65
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,036
<i>All I know is, it's requesting
my presence at a specific location.</i>

66
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:58,218
<i>Wait a sec... maybe Tanaguchi and
Kunikida are playing some kinda joke.</i>

67
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:01,428
<i>Yeah, that's it. That's the most logical possibility.</i>

68
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,729
<i>Although, I'd expect more if those two were involved.</i>

69
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,131
Wait! What the heck's that?!

70
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,609
What? They're just pictures.

71
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,608
They're totally cute shots of Mikuru!

72
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:11,794
Yeah, I see that!

73
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,989
What the hell are you doing with these?!

74
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,675
I'm loading them onto the main page of our website!

75
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,275
Now we'll get tons of email about cool, weird happenings!

76
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,540
Our site'll get tens of thousands of hits!

77
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,963
The counter will roll so high, it'll be nuts!

78
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:26,602
Wonder if the counter even goes that high...?

79
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:27,902
Wait!

80
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,568
Ah! What're you doing, you idiot?!

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,203
I'm putting an end to this.

82
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,853
<i>If Miss Asahina found out that the entire planet
could see pictures of her wearing that maid outfit...</i>

83
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,792
<i>In stunning poses, I might add...</i>

84
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,538
<i>She would pass out on the spot.</i>

85
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:45,558
<i>Haruhi glared at me as I feverishly tried to
explain to her why this was such a bad thing.</i>

86
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,833
<i>In the end, I don't know if she
understood how dangerous it was...</i>

87
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:52,362
<i>to put such personal stuff on the
internet where any creep could access it.</i>

88
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,449
Hmph. Fine, whatever!

89
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>She reluctantly agreed to trash them.</i>

90
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,745
<i>Now, this would've been the time to
delete the photos once and for all,</i>

91
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,958
<i>but it would be a shame to waste 'em...</i>

92
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:07,787
<i>There!</i>

93
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,278
That's it. I'm going home.

94
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,435
Oh, I'm sorry!

95
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,007
Did something happen?

96
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,830
No, everything's a-okay.

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
An evil conspiracy's just been vanquished.

98
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:36,768
<i>Since we had nothing to do, I was playing Othello with
Miss Asahina when Koizumi came in with that smile of his.</i>

99
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,487
Sorry, guys, but I gotta leave early today to go to work.

100
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,435
<i>I wonder what kind of job he's got?</i>

101
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,728
I'm gonna change, so don't wait for me.

102
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,108
<i>Taking advantage of Miss Asahina's request,</i>

103
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:52,540
<i>I bolted from the room.</i>

104
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,619
<i>Seeing her standing there caught
me off guard, to say the least.</i>

105
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:07,819
Why don't you come in?

106
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,001
It was you...

107
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,187
Yes. Are you surprised?

108
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:15,167
What do you want?

109
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:18,029
I wanted to talk to you about something.

110
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,714
Actually, it's a question I had.

111
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:23,485
It's about Miss Suzumiya.

112
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,476
What do you think of her?

113
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:28,106
Oh brother, she's onto Suzumiya as well.

114
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,664
People always say,

115
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:33,909
that it's much better to regret something you
did rather than regret something you didn't do.

116
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,865
What do you think about that?

117
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:41,161
Well, I'm not really sure people always
say that, but I think it means what it means.

118
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:45,920
Well, then, let's pretend if you knew that if you
kept things exactly the same as they are right now,

119
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:47,418
you'd be completely broke.

120
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:51,453
And let's say you that just didn't know
how you could possibly make things any better.

121
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:53,457
I wonder what you'd do about that?

122
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:54,760
I don't understand.

123
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,763
Are you talking about the Japanese Economy?

124
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:00,496
As a start, wouldn't you think about
trying to change something, anything?

125
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:03,428
I mean, nothing is going to
change if you stay the same, right?

126
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,807
Well, yeah, I guess if you're gonna put it that way.

127
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,354
Then you agree with me!

128
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:13,051
But you know, my superiors are extremely
stubborn and lack any vision whatsoever.

129
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:15,382
But you can't have that kind of thinking out in the field.

130
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:18,443
If you just twiddle your thumbs,
things'll go from bad to worse.

131
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:23,490
And if that's the case, wouldn't it be okay to force
change to happen when you know it's all for the best?

132
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:24,899
What's she talking about?

133
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:26,523
Is there a hidden camera in here?

134
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,244
Is Tanaguchi hiding in the
closet, laughing at me right now?

135
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:33,588
I'm getting bored and just fed up watching
something that doesn't seem to be changing at all.

136
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,478
That's why I'm going to kill you
and see how Miss Suzumiya reacts.

137
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,083
<i>What the hell?!</i>

138
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,391
<i>Is she serious?!</i>

139
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,453
<i>Wait, hang on. What just happened?</i>

140
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,038
<i>Why is Asakura coming after me with a knife?</i>

141
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,369
<i>Whoa, wait a minute, what did she just say?</i>

142
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:53,721
<i>"I'm gonna kill you"?</i>

143
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:54,869
<i>Naze... why?</i>

144
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,193
Stop kidding around! You're gonna hurt someone with that!

145
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,661
Even if that's a rubber knife,
you're scaring the hell outta me!

146
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,615
You think it's a... joke?

147
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,800
Huh... You don't wanna die?

148
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,432
You don't want me to kill you?

149
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:10,906
I'm sorry, but I just don't understand the
concept of death regarding organic lifeforms.

150
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,709
Okay, this isn't funny anymore!

151
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:15,583
I don't know why you're doing this,
but please, just put the knife down!

152
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,726
Heh. I can't.

153
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:19,792
Because whether you care about it or not,

154
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,350
I really do want you to die.

155
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:27,811
It's useless.

156
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:31,629
Right now, I have the control over
the flow of the data in this space.

157
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,023
Nothing can enter, nothing can leave.

158
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,285
<i>I have no idea what's going on here.</i>

159
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>If anybody understands, get the
hell over here and explain it to me!</i>

160
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,159
Oh, please, won't you just give up?

161
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:43,718
You're gonna die no matter what, so let me kill you.

162
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:45,995
Just what the hell are you anyway?

163
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,024
Ah-ah...

164
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,855
I already told you it's useless.

165
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,453
Everything in the classroom is now under my control.

166
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,879
<i>Wait, wait, wait! What the hell's going on?!</i>

167
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:06,468
<i>She's gonna kill me to see how Haruhi reacts?</i>

168
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,792
<i>Haruhi, Haruhi! Man, she's popular!</i>

169
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,853
<i>And if that's the case, then
why am I the one that's gotta die?!</i>

170
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:14,127
Silly me, I shoulda done this from the get-go.

171
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,733
<i>I can't move! Wait, that's not fair!</i>

172
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,953
Your death is the perfect way to make.

173
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:23,119
Haruhi Suzumiya take some sort of action, you see?

174
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,721
Finally, I'll be able to observe a huge explosion of data.

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,690
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

176
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:29,978
Tell me about it!

177
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,687
Now you die.

178
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:39,024
Ow, that hurt!

179
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:39,926
Wait...

180
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:42,201
I can move!

181
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:45,807
Nagato?!

182
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,853
There are flaws in your program.

183
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,001
Your data shut down and spatial blockades are faulty.

184
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:59,844
It is how I detected you, why I was allowed inside.

185
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,714
You stopped me? But if I kill this human,

186
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:05,631
Haruhi Suzumiya is bound to do something interesting.

187
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:08,609
It's the only way for us to acquire more information.

188
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,856
You are supposed to be my back-up unit.

189
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,476
You are not permitted to act on your own.

190
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:15,277
You'll obey my orders.

191
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:16,729
What if I said no?

192
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:18,832
Your data link will be terminated.

193
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,802
Would you like to try? In here, I have the upper hand.

194
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,713
This classroom is a space where I control the data.

195
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,769
Commence request for data link termination.

196
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:37,228
<i>It was right about this time
that I was thinking to myself...</i>

197
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,988
<i>Oh, man, these girls really aren't human...</i>

198
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:47,930
Stay behind me.

199
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,626
You cannot defeat me while we're in this space.

200
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,511
Hostile interface, name: "Ryoko Asakura."

201
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:02,827
Terminating data links to organic life form.

202
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,695
I'll stop your functions before that happens.

203
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,697
Hey...!

204
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:12,851
How long will you last if you're
protecting him while you're fighting me?

205
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,349
Nagato!

206
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,451
You need to stay right where you are.

207
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:33,438
I'm fine.

208
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:36,442
<i>Uh, no... you don't look fine at all.</i>

209
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:46,853
With that much damage, I'm afraid you
won't be able to interfere with any other data.

210
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,677
Well, I'll finish it.

211
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:51,137
Now you die.

212
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,361
It's over.

213
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,844
What's over?

214
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,535
Do you mean your life for the last three years?

215
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:07,077
No. Commence termination of data link.

216
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,475
It can't be!

217
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:20,579
You are an advanced interface. That is why it
took so long to hack into this time-space program.

218
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:22,803
But it's over now.

219
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:27,161
You modified your program with
a detonation element, didn't you?

220
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,065
I thought you seemed weak, but that explains it.

221
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:33,810
That's the reason you used all your
attack data when you started to fight.

222
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,593
Oh, this is a shame.

223
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,306
I guess I really was just a back-up interface.

224
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:43,027
I thought this was my big chance to get
something to finally happen around here.

225
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,630
I guess I lost. Aren't you happy you get to keep living?

226
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,368
But please be careful though.

227
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:53,642
The data integration thought entity
has more interfaces that are just like me.

228
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:58,386
Someday, you might meet another
interface that also seeks radical change.

229
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,990
Or perhaps the one pulling
Nagato's strings will change his mind?

230
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:06,593
Till then, enjoy your life with Miss Suzumiya. Goodbye.

231
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,085
Hey, Nagato!

232
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,252
Hang on! I'll get some help.

233
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,630
No. My physical injuries are not critical.

234
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:20,135
This space needs to be corrected
before I do anything else.

235
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,617
The corrupt data must be
removed and the classroom rebuilt.

236
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,286
Are you sure you're really okay?

237
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,505
All processing power is engaged
with manipulating and overwriting data.

238
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,010
This interface will be repaired shortly after.

239
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,249
Repair in progress.

240
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:45,574
What's wrong?

241
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,519
I forgot to recreate the glasses.

242
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,300
Actually, I think you look cuter without those things.

243
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,373
I don't really have a glasses fetish anyway.

244
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,402
What is a glasses fetish?

245
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:00,147
It's nothing! Never mind, just forget it.

246
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:02,089
I see...

247
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:03,954
What is up?

248
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,799
♪ I for-for-forgot my bag. ♪

249
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:12,052
<i>Mom, Dad, if you saw how Nagato
and me are positioned in the frame,</i>

250
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,989
<i>I know you'd think we were getting it on right now.</i>

251
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,367
Okay...

252
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,427
Take your time!

253
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,301
Interesting human.

254
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,717
Oh man, what're we gonna do?

255
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,695
Leave it to me. I'm adept at controlling data.

256
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:28,609
I'll make it so Asakura suddenly transfers.

257
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,805
No, not that!

258
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:31,859
<i>Okay, I need to calm down now.</i>

259
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:35,976
<i>As for the last 10 minutes, I think it's safe
to say I experienced something extraordinary.</i>

260
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:40,422
<i>This isn't a problem about whether or not I
believe that crazy story Nagato told me the other day,</i>

261
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,906
<i>or any of her other delusions.</i>

262
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:46,184
<i>No, what happened just now made me
realize what real danger feels like.</i>

263
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,411
<i>I was five seconds away from dying.</i>

264
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:54,401
<i>There's no longer any doubt in my mind that Nagato is an
alien or is at least involved with aliens in some fashion.</i>

265
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,556
<i>The next day, Ryoko Asakura was
mysteriously absent from class.</i>

266
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,868
Almost overnight it seems.

267
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,140
She transferred out.

268
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,538
Where did she transfer?!

269
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:07,441
Huh?!

270
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,752
Kyon! Hear that?! A mystery!

271
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,682
<i>Filled with boundless energy, Haruhi
had that glimmer in her eye again.</i>

272
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,136
<i>What should I do? Should I tell her the truth?</i>

273
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:21,292
<i>No way. Actually, I don't wanna tell her.</i>

274
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,365
<i>I keep hoping that everything
I saw was just a hallucination.</i>

275
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:26,646
This is too good to be true!

276
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:30,952
First, a mysterious student transfers
in, now, a girl mysteriously transfers out!

277
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,992
We are so investigating this!

278
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,161
<i>Right now, I can't deal with the extra work.</i>

279
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:39,644
<i>I have another matter; A pending
inquiry, if you will, that I'm mulling over.</i>

280
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,110
What's with you?

281
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:42,130
It's nothing.

282
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:45,828
<i>Today's communique was conveniently
housed within an envelope.</i>

283
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,455
<i>I found it in my shoe locker just like the note yesterday.</i>

284
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:52,307
<i>I mean, seriously, is putting notes
in people's shoe locker some new trend?</i>

285
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:55,744
<i>Well, thing is, this time around, it's different.</i>

286
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,733
<i>I have to be careful. I don't wanna waltz in
there just to face another life or death situation.</i>

287
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,864
<i>It doesn't matter, though, 'cause I'm going anyway.</i>

288
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,034
<i>I mean, Miss Asahina wanted to see me in private.</i>

289
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:15,041
<i>Now, I don't have any proof that Miss Asahina actually
sent this letter, but I know in my gut that she did, okay?</i>

290
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:18,108
<i>She's definitely the type that
would send little notes to people,</i>

291
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:23,178
<i>and the image I'm seeing of her scribbling away on
super-cute stationary fits her personality to a T.</i>

292
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:26,688
<i>Besides, it's the clubroom. Nagato's gonna be there.</i>

293
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,640
<i>Well, here goes nothing.</i>

294
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:31,717
Ah, come in!

295
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:34,991
Hi, Kyon.

296
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,692
It's been ages.

297
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,584
<i>She sure looks like Miss Asahina,</i>

298
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,361
<i>but she definitely is not Miss Asahina.</i>

299
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:47,200
Um, are you Miss Asahina's big sister?

300
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:50,708
But it's me, Kyon.

301
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,487
I'm Mikuru Asahina.

302
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:56,830
I'm the me from a future that's a little
further down form the me you know right now.

303
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:58,497
I wanted to see you.

304
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,073
Hey! You don't trust me?!

305
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,090
Okay, this'll prove it.

306
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:07,436
See, I've got it a tiny star-shaped mole right here.

307
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,129
It's not a fake mole, either.

308
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,074
Wanna touch it?

309
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,796
Super-size me!

310
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,036
You believe me now?

311
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,263
Whether I believe her or not, I don't
recall where Miss Asahina keeps her moles.

312
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:20,377
<i>The only time I was able to see that much of her
body was when she was cosplaying as a bunny girl.</i>

313
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:22,564
<i>And that other time when I peeked in as she changed...</i>

314
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,078
<i>Which wasn't my fault!</i>

315
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,143
<i>I never saw any moles because I never
made it a point to go looking for them.</i>

316
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:32,757
Oh? Well, I remember that you were the
one who told me that I had a mole here.

317
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,283
I didn't even know I had one there until you...

318
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,559
I... just... Oh no!

319
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:41,059
This is before we...

320
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:44,831
Oh, what have I done?! I totally screwed up just now.

321
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,953
I'm sorry, Kyon, just forget everything I said, okay?

322
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,327
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

323
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,360
It's all right, really. I believe you, I do.

324
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:57,473
The truth is, with everything that's going on, I'm in the
right frame of mind to believe just about anything today.

325
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:02,066
Wait, if you're standing here, that means there's
two Miss Asahinas in the same time plane, right?

326
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:04,433
Ah. Right.

327
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,994
The past, I mean, the me from the past, the younger me,

328
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:11,908
right now, she's eating lunch in my
old classroom with all her classmates.

329
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:14,203
There's something important I had to tell you,

330
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:18,246
so I pulled some strings and they finally
let me come back to this time plane again.

331
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,593
If you're wondering, I asked
Miss Nagato to step out for a bit.

332
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,025
Wait, Miss Asahina, you know about Nagato?

333
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,392
Sorry, that's classified.

334
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:30,094
Wow, it's been forever since I last said that.

335
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,356
Funny, I heard you say it a couple days ago.

336
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:32,992
Ah...

337
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:40,584
I won't be able to stay here much
longer, so listen, cause this is important.

338
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,107
Do you know the story of Snow White?

339
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,453
Uh, yeah, sure I do.

340
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,431
From now on, if you ever find yourself in danger,

341
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,483
I want you to remember those words.

342
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,532
Can you do that?

343
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:55,441
Okay, the seven dwarves, the wicked
witch, the poison apple, and all that stuff?

344
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,380
That's right. The story about Snow White.

345
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:01,906
Well, if you're talking about serious
danger, I just had some of that yesterday.

346
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,953
That's not the one I'm talking about. It's worse.

347
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:07,999
Let's see... I can't give you any details,

348
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:11,121
but when the time comes, Miss
Suzumiya should be at your side.

349
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:13,085
Huh? You mean me and Haruhi?

350
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,214
What's gonna happen?

351
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:19,986
When it does happen, Miss Suzumiya probably
won't consider the event to be all that dangerous.

352
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:25,250
But it will be. And not just for you and her,
but for all of us, so just keep that in mind.

353
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,832
Oh, come on, can't you give me any more details?

354
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:29,303
Is that classified, too?

355
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:35,498
I am sorry, but I thought that if I at least
gave you a hint... This is the best I can do...

356
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,153
So that's why you're telling me about Snow White?

357
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,376
Yeah...

358
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,679
Okay, I'll try to remember.

359
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:51,175
I'm amazed I could wear something like this.

360
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:53,042
It's out of the question now.

361
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:56,536
Well then, can you tell me what other
kinds of outfits Haruhi made you wear?

362
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,994
That's a secret. It's just too embarrassing.

363
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:02,599
Besides, you'll find out soon enough.

364
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:05,001
Well, I better go...

365
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:11,784
Something else I need to tell you...

366
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:15,438
Don't get too friendly with me, okay...?

367
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,812
Wait, I just wanna know something!

368
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:22,225
Miss Asahina, how old are you right now?

369
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,245
That's classified.

370
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:29,469
<i>That was a smile that would make
anyone who saw it fall in love.</i>

371
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,036
It's been ages.

372
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:39,679
<i>In other words, the high school version of Miss
Asahina is gonna return to her time in the future.</i>

373
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,536
<i>I wonder when that's gonna happen...?</i>

374
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:45,489
<i>And how many years between the one that's
in school with me and the one I just met?</i>

375
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:49,713
<i>From the way she looked just now,
it could be three or even five years.</i>

376
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:52,942
<i>Women change so drastically when
they graduate from high school.</i>

377
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,162
<i>Better get back to the classroom.</i>

378
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,540
<i>Man, I'm really hungry.</i>

379
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:03,411
Hey, you didn't happen to pass someone in the hall
just now that looked a lot like Miss Asahina, did you?

380
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:06,507
The Mikuru Asahina from another time plane,

381
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,789
I met her this morning.

382
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:10,744
I never asked you before, but
can you time travel like her?

383
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,666
Can that data thing time travel, too?

384
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,126
I am unable to.

385
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:17,712
However, time travel is not that difficult to accomplish.

386
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,769
I'd like some tips on how to do it.

387
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:24,272
Language cannot explain the concept,
nor are you able to understand it.

388
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,244
Is that so?

389
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,458
It is so.

390
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,015
Then I guess it's my loss.

391
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,222
Your loss.

392
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,424
Nagato, thanks again for yesterday.

393
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:38,266
Don't thank me. Asakura's abnormal
behavior was my responsibility. I failed.

394
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,401
I really think you look better without glasses.

395
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,905
Where were you?! I'd thought you'd be
back! I was waiting, and didn't even eat lunch!

396
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,971
Could you say that again, but like you're an
old friend who's embarrassed and only acting angry?

397
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:57,292
Stop being an idiot and come with me right now!

398
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,565
I went to the teacher's lounge and asked Okabe.

399
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,107
No one knew that Asakura was
transferring until this morning.

400
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:07,651
Apparently, someone claiming to be her father
called in and said they were moving away! Just like that!

401
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:10,159
You wanna know where they're moving to? Canada!

402
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:12,570
Can you believe that?! Something's fishy here.

403
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:13,319
Ya think?

404
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,551
There's more! I asked for their contact
info in Canada. You know what they told me?

405
00:22:17,576 --> 00:22:19,572
"Sorry, we don't have that information."

406
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,247
At the very least, you tell someone your new address!

407
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:23,858
I'm sure something funny's going on!

408
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:24,619
No, there isn't.

409
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:28,230
I kept up my interrogations
until I got Asakura's old address.

410
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,129
After school, I'm going straight over there.

411
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:32,114
I'll crack this thing wide open!

412
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,090
<i>Still the same. She never listens to anything.</i>

413
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:40,543
<i>And I won't stop her. Hey, Haruhi's the
one who's wasting her time with this, not me.</i>

414
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,046
And you're coming, too.

415
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:42,927
Why me?!

416
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:44,319
Ow!

417
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,520
And you call yourself a member of the SOS Brigade?!
