1
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,576
<i>It was the day after Obon.</i>

2
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:13,204
<i>Smack-dab in the middle of summer.</i>

3
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:15,619
<i>Nothing special. Just an ordinary day.</i>

4
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,634
<i>The game on TV was between schools from another town.</i>

5
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:25,062
<i>I had nothing to do with either school, but
because I tend to sympathize with underdogs,</i>

6
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:27,433
<i>I found myself routing for the losing team.</i>

7
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:31,042
<i>And that's right about the time
my cell phone started ringing.</i>

8
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,061
<i>Haruhi.</i>

9
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:36,650
Hey, you're free, right?

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,759
Good, then meet us at 2:00 in front of the station.

11
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:40,592
But I...!

12
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:44,374
<i>And just like that, she hangs up.</i>

13
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,607
<i>How does she know I'm not doing anything today?</i>

14
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,496
<i>I mean, I could be.</i>

15
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,683
<i>Yeah, I know, I'm not doing anything,</i>

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:52,858
<i>but still...</i>

17
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:00,018
What?

18
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,447
I forgot to tell you something.

19
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,996
Bring your swim trunks. And your bike, too.

20
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,702
Oh, and money! Bring money.

21
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,252
That's it! Over and out!

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,399
Uh. No.

23
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,891
What was that all about?

24
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:19,562
He is not having a good day.

25
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,812
You gotta feel bad for that guy.

26
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:25,328
Oh, that is tragic. He looks like...

27
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:26,822
Oh, well.

28
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,684
Even the fans are quiet.

29
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,844
They're not even booing Suzuki anymore.

30
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:33,937
So, with that, the score is now eight, zero.

31
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:36,672
Kuyamoto's really got their work cut out for 'em.

32
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,995
You're late, Kyon! Penalty!

33
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,796
You have absolutely no motivation whatsoever.

34
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,060
How dare you keep your brigade leader waiting!

35
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,055
You're gettin' a penalty for this!

36
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:27,503
<i>I'm here 15 minutes early.</i>

37
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,290
<i>How come I'm still the last one to arrive?</i>

38
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:34,619
Okay, now that we're all present
and accounted for, we can go.

39
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:38,186
Koizumi, you're gonna have to
give Mikuru a ride over there, okay?

40
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,159
Yuki and me'll hop on the back of Kyon's bike.

41
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:45,728
Do you mind if I ask where we're going today?

42
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,510
To the public pool. Where do you think?

43
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:52,687
We've got lots and lots of summer
vacation-y things to do during our summer break.

44
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:56,680
We've only got so much time, and once
it's gone, it's gone for good, ya know?

45
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:01,791
So we're gonna do everything we can while we can
during our one and only summer as tenth graders.

46
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,468
<i>Once it's gone, it's gone, huh?</i>

47
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:19,321
Can you smell the chlorine? That
really makes it feel like summer.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,099
Let's go!

49
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,130
Hurry up and get in, guys!

50
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,226
The water's warm. It's perfect!

51
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,465
<i>Can't she see the no diving signs?</i>

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,079
<i>I mean, they're everywhere.</i>

53
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,139
It kind of makes me smile, though.

54
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,965
I mean, to see Miss Suzumiya
enjoying herself in a normal way.

55
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,812
It's rather charming, isn't it?

56
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,666
She called me outta the blue,
ran down a list of things to bring,

57
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:51,431
and ordered me to meet her
without telling me what was going on.

58
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,995
Yeah, there's nothing charming or normal about it.

59
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:57,489
Well, as long as Miss Suzumiya's having a good time,

60
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:00,459
we don't have to worry about any earth-shattering events.

61
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:02,589
Man, I hope you're right.

62
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,701
I don't think you need to worry about it.

63
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,508
I mean, there haven't been any
problems since our outing a few weeks ago.

64
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,770
And right now, as far as Miss Suzumiya's concerned,

65
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:16,293
and as far as we're concerned, the world is at peace.

66
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,419
Okay, guys, lunch time!

67
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:27,777
And, surprise, surprise! Mikuru's made us sandwiches!

68
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,138
Whoa.

69
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:31,260
It's delicious.

70
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,705
Thank you very much!

71
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,971
I'm gonna have another piece of fried chicken!

72
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,568
Pour some tea, Mikuru.

73
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:37,603
Okay.

74
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,581
<i>Things do seem peaceful, that's for sure.</i>

75
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:42,432
We're sorry!

76
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,303
Yeah, here I come!

77
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:46,603
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,645
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

79
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,294
Oh, some on, Mikuru! You're supposed to catch it!

80
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,752
<i>This isn't a bad way to spend a summer vacation.</i>

81
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:03,430
Kyon!

82
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:06,208
These two guys are my brigade members.

83
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:09,423
They do what I say, so if you
want somethin', you can ask them.

84
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,516
Okay!

85
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,937
I had a couple ideas about the rest of our vacation.

86
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:18,841
Check it out!

87
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,295
What's that thing?

88
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:24,743
It's a schedule of all the things the
brigade's gonna do before our vacation ends!

89
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,187
The SOS brigade?

90
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,052
You know it! We've only got two more
weeks of vacation left, right, guys?

91
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,197
But it still feels like there's
a lotta things left for us to do.

92
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,295
I say we gotta pick up the pace.

93
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:39,687
So, you made a schedule of things
to do before our vacation ends, huh?

94
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:46,250
Go on a trip, go to the pool, to a Bon festival,
see fireworks, part time job, stargazing...

95
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,580
That's a lotta stuff.

96
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,774
<i>And she expects us to do all this in the next two weeks?</i>

97
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:51,716
<i>Great.</i>

98
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,824
Can you think of anything else you wanna do?

99
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:58,047
I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

100
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,748
Okay! Then goldfish scooping it is.

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,122
We'll start on the list tomorrow.

102
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,933
Does anyone know if there's a Bon
festival happening some place close by?

103
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,777
Or if there's a firework show?

104
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:11,395
<i>Why don't you look this stuff up yourself?</i>

105
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,588
I'll check around and try to find something.

106
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,128
I'll call you if I do, okay?

107
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:18,069
Oh, and don't forget about the goldfish scooping.

108
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,978
It's Mikuru's only request.

109
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,764
Got it!

110
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,087
<i>How come I always get stuck with the check?</i>

111
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,516
Because you were late, that's why!

112
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,669
And don't you make us wait tomorrow!

113
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,110
That's it. See ya!

114
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:37,434
<i>Awesome.</i>

115
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,324
<i>Looks like we're gonna be running around everyday, now.</i>

116
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:50,435
<i>The next morning, I was waken from my
peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.</i>

117
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:58,526
<i>She said they'd found a Bon
festival, and it was happening tonight.</i>

118
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,702
<i>At a park somewhere.</i>

119
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,896
<i>Well, that was fast. And convenient.</i>

120
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:07,204
<i>I was just beginning to appreciate
that fact when Haruhi suddenly said...</i>

121
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,647
We're all gonna go out and buy yukatas!

122
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,094
Yuki doesn't have one and neither does Mikuru.

123
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:15,275
But I know a place that sells 'em cheap, so, let's go!

124
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,837
<i>Haruhi picked out yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato.</i>

125
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,222
<i>Then, headed for the changing rooms.</i>

126
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,485
<i>This was gonna take a while.</i>

127
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:28,747
<i>After about an hour of standing there
and getting strange looks from people,</i>

128
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,206
<i>the girls finally decided to
come out of the changing room.</i>

129
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:33,420
Kyon!

130
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,529
You all look really wonderful in them. I mean it.

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,467
Of course we do! I picked them out myself.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,175
Especially Mikuru's.

133
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,689
Look at you, you're so cute. I'm a genius!

134
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:49,550
I have awesome fashion sense, don't'cha think?

135
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:54,014
<i>Of all the costumes Haruhi has forced her to wear,</i>

136
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:56,090
<i>this had to be the best one yet.</i>

137
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,781
<i>She looks awesome. Yes, she does.</i>

138
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:03,062
I always wondered what it would be like
to wear traditional Japanese clothing.

139
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,185
It's a little tight around the chest, but it's beautiful.

140
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,645
We're ready to go!

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,896
And now it's off to the Bon festival to have some fun!

142
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,716
A Bon festival, huh?

143
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,234
I haven't been to one of these
things in a really long time.

144
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:23,785
Look, Mikuru!

145
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,179
They've got goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!

146
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,826
I bet you're gonna catch a ton!

147
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,690
Don't forget the black demikens are worth 200 points!

148
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:32,478
Do you wanna go scoop some fish, too?

149
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,060
We could have a contest to see how many we can catch.

150
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,435
I think I'll pass.

151
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,942
Besides, I'm more interested in the food around here.

152
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,389
How 'bout you, Nagato? Do you wanna get some food?

153
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,459
Are you actually into that stuff?

154
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:54,945
That.

155
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,406
Hm? It's yours for 800 yen!

156
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,561
Thirteen!

157
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:06,946
I caught a whole bunch, but I only kept one
'cause I don't have any place to keep all of 'em.

158
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,853
I tried, but I couldn't catch a single one of them.

159
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,815
Scooping them up is a lot harder then it looks, huh?

160
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,937
Yeah, well, it's rare for anyone
to catch a lot, let alone one.

161
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,157
If you can figure out the trick, it's easy!

162
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,620
What's with the mask you've got there, Yuki?

163
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:22,733
I bought it.

164
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:25,124
I know, but why that one?

165
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,208
<i>Maybe she felt some kinda connection to it, or something.</i>

166
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,478
<i>Cause she's an alien.</i>

167
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,903
Well, okay then.

168
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,033
Anyway, there's a ton of stuff over there we haven't seen!

169
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,461
You still in fun mode?

170
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,576
Of course! Come on! Hurry up!

171
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,151
Here.

172
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,097
Go ahead and have one, but only one, 'kay?

173
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,065
Oh, okay. Thanks.

174
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,162
Pretty good, huh?

175
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,801
You know it.

176
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,588
Okay, we've seen just about everything there is to see.

177
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:22,078
So now we're gonna go shoot off some fireworks.

178
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,005
Really? Fireworks?

179
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:28,585
We went to all the trouble of dressing up,
so we'll end our day with a firework show.

180
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,415
Why not? There's a booth over there that's selling them.

181
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,037
Let's go down by the river bank.

182
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,805
This is going to be so much fun.

183
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:36,458
Come on! Let's do this!

184
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,667
Kakizaki!

185
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,310
It's pretty.

186
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,725
So, we did the Bon festival, fireworks.

187
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,937
That's two down.

188
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,398
And tomorrow, we're gonna go catch some bugs.

189
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:18,053
Uh, Haruhi, I don't wanna spoil your fun or
anything, but have you finished your summer homework?

190
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,619
<i>I should talk. I haven't even touched mine.</i>

191
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,671
Are you kidding? That stuff's totally easy.

192
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,181
You can finish it all in about three days.

193
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,657
Yeah, I finished doing all of my homework in July.

194
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:33,735
Ya have to get rid of that junk first so you can spend the
rest of your summer having fun and not worrying about it.

195
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,853
That's the only way to really
get the most out of your vacation.

196
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:38,793
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

197
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,728
<i>The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.</i>

198
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:45,330
So anyway, we're gonna go bug catching tomorrow.

199
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:48,221
And the prize for catching the most bugs is gonna be...

200
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,893
The winner gets to be brigade leader for a whole day!

201
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:52,883
<i>No thank you.</i>

202
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,428
That sounds like fun.

203
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,399
But can we catch just any random bug?

204
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,156
Hm... No.

205
00:12:58,449 --> 00:12:59,585
Only cicadas!

206
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,341
That's it! I'm calling it the SOS
Brigade's cicada catching contest!

207
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,771
Whoever catches the most cicadas wins!

208
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:14,917
<i>The next day, I wanted it to rain so
bad, I drove a nail through a teruteru bouzu.</i>

209
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,692
<i>But, despite my efforts, the day was clear and beautiful.</i>

210
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:21,207
<i>It was the warmest day of summer so far,</i>

211
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,603
<i>and all the cicadas were happy because of it.</i>

212
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,040
I wonder if anyone's ever tried eating a cicada...

213
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:27,853
<i>No idea.</i>

214
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:30,077
They could be good fried in tempura.

215
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,283
<i>Bon appetite.</i>

216
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:35,030
I always wondered about food that's deep-fried in tempura.

217
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,101
Maybe the batter they use is
what makes everything taste so good.

218
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:40,185
'Cause then cicadas would taste great!

219
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,777
<i>Apologize to the tempura chefs! Do it!</i>

220
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,812
What's wrong with this picture?

221
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:48,656
High schoolers carrying nets and little plastic boxes?

222
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:52,603
Hello? What're you thinking making us hike
all the way up here carrying all this stuff?

223
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,159
What're you talking about?

224
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,338
If we didn't have the nets and the
bins, we wouldn't be able to catch cicadas.

225
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,315
That's not the point I was trying to make.

226
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,143
Okay. Let's go hunting.

227
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,812
Remember, winner gets to be brigade leader for a day.

228
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,728
Ya ready? Go!

229
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:06,945
<i>Ignored.</i>

230
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,464
She looks determined to win, doesn't she?

231
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,670
And that would be a good thing, don't you think?

232
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,711
Jeez. I haven't done this since elementary school.

233
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:18,816
I know, me too.

234
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:20,547
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

235
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,207
What's that? You catch one?

236
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,721
Yeah, no. That's not a cicada.

237
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:34,021
Oh.

238
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,178
A Hercules beetle?!

239
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,630
Let's tally 'em up!

240
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,228
Mikuru caught one.

241
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:18,596
Yuki caught four.

242
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:20,206
Koizumi caught seven.

243
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,434
Kyon caught nine.

244
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,885
But the one who caught the most is...

245
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,475
<i>Don't say it, we already know.</i>

246
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,433
Me, with 12!

247
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:31,304
I guess I just can't give up being
brigade leader, even for one day.

248
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,874
Sorry about that, you guys.

249
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:36,708
Please tell me that you're not gonna
batter those things up in tempura and fry them.

250
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,480
What? Do you really wanna eat 'em?

251
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,908
No, I don't wanna eat 'em.

252
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:40,992
Just kidding.

253
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,222
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

254
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:47,871
You never know. If we let them go now,
they might return the favor some time.

255
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:52,806
Hurry! Go back to the mountains
and try not to get caught anymore!

256
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:00,592
<i>Wait. No.</i>

257
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,937
<i>You act like you did a good deed,</i>

258
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,541
<i>but all you did was catch 'em and let 'em go. Come on.</i>

259
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:12,299
<i>So, the day after our bug hunt, Haruhi was kind
enough to get us part-time jobs at a local supermarket,</i>

260
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,164
<i>that really needed the help.</i>

261
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:16,493
<i>See, they were having a big sale.</i>

262
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:19,160
Well, don't work too hard, okay?

263
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,662
<i>And our job was to attract customers.</i>

264
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,297
Thank you for coming.

265
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,572
Balloon? No?

266
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:31,691
Here.

267
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:39,175
<i>Can someone please tell me why I have
to wear this unbearably hot costume?</i>

268
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:40,849
<i>Part-time job?</i>

269
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,798
<i>She could've found something a
little more appropriate for summer.</i>

270
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,972
<i>Look at her. All cool and breezy.</i>

271
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:50,837
<i>I swear. If she gets more money then us, I'm gonna riot.</i>

272
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:56,401
Now I know how a snake feels when it sheds its skin.

273
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,818
That's a clever way of putting it.

274
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:00,016
Knock, knock.

275
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:03,037
The manager's super grateful
for all the hard work you did.

276
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,081
Who cares how grateful he is. What about our pay?

277
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,842
This is it.

278
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:10,764
This cool frog costume is our pay.

279
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,563
Can't tell ya how long I've had my eye on him.

280
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:18,193
The manager said we could have it 'cause
he thought Mikuru looked so darn cute in it.

281
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:20,966
We'll keep him in the clubroom as a souvenir of today.

282
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,766
Mikuru, you have my permission to
wear him whenever you want, okay?

283
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:26,210
Isn't it great?

284
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,092
Ribbit.

285
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,380
The pool, the Bon festival,
bug catching, and a part-time job.

286
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:38,294
Next on Haruhi's schedule, stargazing.

287
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,402
Wow, that's what a telescope
from this time frame looks like?

288
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,593
It doesn't seem too different
from the ones in Kepler's time.

289
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,822
Yeah, no. It's pretty different.

290
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,070
Did you buy this just for tonight?

291
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:54,001
Oh, no. Astronomy was sort of a
hobby of mine when I was younger.

292
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,498
All it took was a glimpse of the moons
of Jupiter, and after that, I was hooked.

293
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,011
I've found Mars. Have a look.

294
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,763
I wonder if they're real.

295
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:07,858
What's real?

296
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:09,533
Martians, of course!

297
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:10,908
I kind of hope they aren't.

298
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:15,603
I mean, octopoid-like monsters, wriggling
around, plotting to take over the planet?

299
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,883
Nothing about that sounds appealing to me.

300
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,156
Oh, what do you know.

301
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,903
And who cares what they look like anyway.

302
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:22,166
They might be friendly.

303
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:26,918
For all we know, they could be a reserved race of
beings living in underground caves. Think of that.

304
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,693
Whoever they are, I'm sure they're
just trying not to scare us earthlings.

305
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,395
The martians in your imagination
sound unbelievably boring.

306
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,791
I've had enough of Mars.

307
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,446
Let's look for UFOs.

308
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,151
On a night like tonight,

309
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,082
I bet there's some kinda alien scouting fleet up there.

310
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,439
All right, come on, Mikuru. Help me with this.

311
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:49,734
UFO. UFO...

312
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,953
<i>Our summer vacation continues.</i>

313
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:02,317
<i>And the next thing Haruhi said was...</i>

314
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,386
We're going to the batting cages today!

315
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,352
Why there?

316
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,404
I was watching a high school baseball
game this morning, and then it hit me!

317
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,844
Why should we settle for baseball in some sandlot?

318
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:16,596
What we need to do is turn the SOS
brigade into a national league team!

319
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:22,389
Chuka soba!

320
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:30,322
<i>She sure is something. Where does she get her energy from?</i>

321
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:34,379
<i>I bet she's got special mitochondria packed in her cells.</i>

322
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,475
<i>More than the average person, anyway.</i>

323
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,838
<i>If only she'd use her gifts for good.</i>

324
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:48,554
<i>After that, we kept going.</i>

325
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:51,697
<i>Haruhi was determined to stick to the schedule she made.</i>

326
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:56,124
<i>So we were constantly on the move,
day after day, with no time to hit pause.</i>

327
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,021
<i>We went to a real firework show.</i>

328
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:04,008
<i>The fireworks burst into bloom
in the sky, one after another,</i>

329
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,588
<i>leaving us with a grand feeling in our hearts.</i>

330
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:12,812
<i>And on another day, she made all of us enter
a goby fishing tournament down by the river.</i>

331
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:23,679
Mikuru, your pole!

332
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:25,586
Don't worry, I see it. I'll go get it.

333
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:30,245
<i>And still, another day was the the "test of courage."</i>

334
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,649
<i>It's a summertime must, but I
doubt anyone really does it anymore.</i>

335
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:39,295
<i>Then we went and saw this over-hyped summer blockbuster.</i>

336
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,521
<i>Turned out to be the same old, same old.</i>

337
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:47,443
<i>We went to the beach.</i>

338
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,054
<i>Right in the middle of jellyfish season.</i>

339
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:52,681
<i>Then, bowling.</i>

340
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,947
<i>But, you-know-who made a rule where no
one could leave until everyone got a strike.</i>

341
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:03,812
<i>Then, an excruciating karaoke session
designed to push our vocal cords to the limit.</i>

342
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:12,876
<i>Sure, there were a couple of non-summertime
things that slipped in, but looking back,</i>

343
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,520
<i>I can honestly say we had the time of our lives.</i>

344
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:17,644
<i>The past two weeks were a blast.</i>

345
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:27,224
I declare that on this day, August
30th, we've done everything on our list.

346
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,357
<i>And no one died in the process.</i>

347
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:32,601
But now I wonder if we did enough.

348
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,652
Maybe if we... No, I guess we did do everything.

349
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,417
Unless there's something else you guys wanted to do.

350
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:40,767
No, not really.

351
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,239
I think we've done enough.

352
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,742
I think I'd like to sleep for a while.

353
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,800
How 'bout you?

354
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,660
Oh.

355
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,203
Oh, well. That's cool.

356
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:52,981
We did just about everything we wanted to do this summer.

357
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,524
We wore yukatas, and caught a lotta cicadas.

358
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,097
We went all over the place.

359
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,321
I guess that's about it, huh?

360
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,961
<i>Please don't tell me there's
something else she wants to do.</i>

361
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,671
Okay, we're done for today.

362
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:10,880
I set tomorrow aside, just in case,
but you can just take the day off.

363
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:15,587
I'll see everyone at the clubroom on Monday.

364
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,458
I still haven't done any of my homework.

365
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:45,243
<i>August 31st. The last day of vacation.</i>

366
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:48,995
<i>No matter how hard I tried, I
wasn't gonna finish my homework.</i>

367
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:52,577
<i>Besides, I was still recovering
from all that running around.</i>

368
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:56,455
<i>So, I made a decision to spend
the rest of the day in lounge mode.</i>

369
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:01,634
<i>What the heck?!</i>

370
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,920
<i>Boring.</i>

371
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:09,205
<i>Homework? Yeah, whatever.</i>

372
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:29,573
<i>I guess I'll go to bed now.</i>

373
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:31,387
<i>I got school tomorrow.</i>

374
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,857
<i>Beep.</i>
