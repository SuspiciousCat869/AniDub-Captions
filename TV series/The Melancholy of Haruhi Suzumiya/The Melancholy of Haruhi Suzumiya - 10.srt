1
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,735
Okay, I wanna know what you've got up your sleeve.

2
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:06,901
Nothing. Really, there's nothing.

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,967
I know that the organization
doesn't have anything to do with this,

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:11,746
although, I did report it to them.

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,119
No, we're just going on a little retreat.

6
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,276
A little retreat that you set up.

7
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:18,527
I'm just making sure nothing funny's going on.

8
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,682
Miss Suzumiya was interested because it's
a deserted island that's privately owned.

9
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,012
She said it was a closed circle or something.

10
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:27,046
Okay, what's a closed circle?

11
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:32,369
Like in mysteries, it's a situation where all
contact with the outside world has been cut off.

12
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:34,597
Like a cabin in the mountains during a blizzard,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,395
or someone who can't get back to civilization
because a typhoon destroyed the bridge.

14
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:42,594
Exactly. A person or group of people
get trapped because of their surroundings.

15
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,764
In other words, they get closed in.

16
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:46,971
And how does that tie in to this retreat we're taking?

17
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,670
We're going to a deserted island.

18
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:51,911
It's the perfect close-circle
setting when you think about it.

19
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,699
All we need is a storm to whip up around us
and voila! Much better than a cabin in a blizzard.

20
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:01,291
<i>You might be wondering why I'm chatting with
Koizumi on the deck of a ship in the middle of the ocean.</i>

21
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:06,931
<i>This all started as I was recovering from getting
my final exams back. In other words: Black Monday.</i>

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,675
<i>On that fateful day, the SOS Brigade had a meeting.</i>

23
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,780
Good, everyone's here.

24
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:43,995
Now, today's meeting is super important.

25
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,145
If any of you happened to show up after me,

26
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,566
I was thinking of making that person
"it" whenever we play "Kick the Can" forever.

27
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:54,013
<i>Naturally, I had no idea we were
having an important meeting today.</i>

28
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:59,312
I've decided during the summer break, the
SOS Brigade's going on its very first retreat!

29
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,384
Going on a retreat?

30
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,554
Yep! Retreat.

31
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:03,431
<i>What good is that gonna do any of us?</i>

32
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,288
And Koizumi's already planned our destination.

33
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:10,701
Correct. It just so happens that I have a
distant relative who is incredibly wealthy.

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,414
He has so much money, that he actually bought his
very own deserted island and built his summer house on it.

35
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:18,787
In fact, the construction was
finished on it not too long ago.

36
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,357
Koizumi, get ready to hit the roof!

37
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:30,842
For your distinguished service and dedication to
the brigade, I'm promoting you to the rank of...

38
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:31,943
...Deputy Chief!

39
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,506
I gladly accept.

40
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,284
<i>No, I'm not jealous...</i>

41
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:43,533
We'll have a luxurious three nights
and four days on a deserted island!

42
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:47,228
And I'm sure we're going to find something
very interesting waiting for us there!

43
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:50,587
In fact, I've already figured out
what my role in this adventure is!

44
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:55,570
Now then, let's think about detectives for a minute.

45
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,493
The great detectives in mystery novels always seem

46
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:02,878
to find themselves getting involved in
one incomprehensible situation after another.

47
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:04,863
Why do you think that is?

48
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,665
Because if they didn't, you wouldn't have a story.

49
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,276
That's right. No story.

50
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,282
Their cases are entirely fiction.

51
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,905
They exist only in the surreal world of the story.

52
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:18,294
Although, maybe it's better if we don't get too
wrapped up in a metafictional conversation just yet.

53
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:23,695
I mean, after all, Miss Suzumiya seems pretty
gung-ho about throwing herself into a world like that.

54
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:27,304
<i>Come to think of it, she created
the SOS Brigade to do just that.</i>

55
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:30,771
If you're in search of surreal
happenings like the kind in mystery novels,

56
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:34,173
you need to go someplace that has the
right environment for that kind of thing.

57
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,336
When you think about it,

58
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:39,339
that's how every single one of thegreat
detectives in fiction got involved in their cases.

59
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,525
Yeah, but there's no way we'd
just stumble across a case that easy.

60
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,049
True, nothing ever happens in
reality like it does in stories.

61
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:50,712
However, the island we're heading for right now
is a spot that everyone in the world would think

62
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,954
the perfect place for a gruesome murder mystery.

63
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,990
<i>Everyone in the world, huh?</i>

64
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,210
<i>That's a heck of a world you got there, sport.</i>

65
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:02,992
Look at it this way: Wherever a great detective
goes, a strange case is practically guaranteed to happen.

66
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:08,750
See, it says if all great detectives have a kind of
supernatural power that attracts all their cases to them.

67
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,782
Are you sane?

68
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:12,464
I always act with a reasonable amount of sanity.

69
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:17,263
All that stuff about great detectives, closed
circles and stuff aren't my personal views on the subject.

70
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:20,783
I was merely pointing out the
way Miss Suzumiya was thinking.

71
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:24,189
In other words, well, she wants to be one.

72
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,762
A great detective.

73
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:29,774
This one!

74
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:31,814
So close!

75
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,246
What's close? We're playing old maid.

76
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,919
Hurry! Next one!

77
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:37,516
Too bad.

78
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:39,657
Hey, do you wanna know something?

79
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,114
My big brother Kyon tried to leave me at home.

80
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,706
<i>That's because I didn't intend
to bring you in the first place.</i>

81
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,168
No!

82
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:06,930
Well, we're all happy you're here now.

83
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:07,870
Yay!

84
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:09,842
She won't be any trouble, I promise.

85
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:13,796
<i>Thanks to Miss Asahina's smile, the kid was off the hook.</i>

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,838
How much longer till we get there?

87
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,282
It'll take about six hours by ferry.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,887
Then, an acquaintance will be waiting
to pick us up when we arrive at the port.

89
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:26,945
From there, we'll board a private cruiser
and it'll be another hour on the water.

90
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:31,098
A deserted island with a towering mansion
will be waiting for us at the end of our trip.

91
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:35,537
I've never actually been there, so it'll be
interesting to see what the mansion looks like.

92
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,306
I bet it'll be a really strange building.

93
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,714
Hey, do you know the name of the architect who built it?

94
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:41,585
<i>Why do you care?</i>

95
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,187
Never really thought to ask about that.

96
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:44,900
Yay! I'm out first!

97
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:45,916
Amazing!

98
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:50,721
Come to think of it, I did hear the architect
they commissioned to design it was somewhat famous.

99
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:53,127
<i>Perfect. "Somewhat" famous.</i>

100
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,921
<i>For starters, if the mansion is anything like
what Haruhi's expecting, I'm sure it's totally weird.</i>

101
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:00,118
<i>It'll probably look like something Antoni Gaudi built,</i>

102
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:03,275
<i>after drinking himself stupid and
staying up for three days straight.</i>

103
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:09,046
An island. A mansion. It's the ideal
location for the SOS Brigade's summer retreat.

104
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,213
Woo-hoo! I'm the third to get out!

105
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,972
How 'bout the loser has to buy drinks for everyone else?

106
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,613
I'll take a can of 100% fruit juice, please.

107
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,126
And I want some cola.

108
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,927
And I'll be having the royal milk tea.

109
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,592
<i>Hey, you haven't won yet, buddy.</i>

110
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,466
Yep, deserted islands are all about weird happenings.

111
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,451
<i>I hope nothing happens, I hope nothing happens...</i>

112
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:32,465
I'm not too sure about that. Whether
or not anything weird actually happens...

113
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:36,772
...I'm hoping that this trip will
at least be a fun one for us all.

114
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,291
Hey, Mikuru, Little Sister, let's go up to the deck!

115
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,768
Maybe we'll see a monster squid or something.

116
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,457
Sure!

117
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,638
Squid, squid!

118
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:55,702
<i>If a giant squid shows up, Nagato'll have to deal with it.</i>

119
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,603
<i>Oh brother...</i>

120
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,217
You dork, are you sleeping? Come on, wake up!

121
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,775
Are you just gonna sleep through our entire trip?

122
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,605
I just took a picture of you waking up.

123
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,817
And I took a couple of you sleeping.

124
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:19,526
You were sound asleep, weren't you?

125
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:23,538
<i>Huh? Really? Why would Miss Asahina
wanna take pictures of me sleeping?</i>

126
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,052
<i>Maybe she wants to put a picture of me
in a cute frame, keep it next to her bed,</i>

127
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,565
<i>and every night, just before
she drifts off to sleep, she...</i>

128
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,134
What's with the goofy face?

129
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:32,438
You might wanna stop 'cause you look like a moron.

130
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:37,257
I've temporarily given Mikuru the responsibility
of being the SOS Brigade's photographer!

131
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:42,217
It's important to maintain a record of the
brigade's activities for future generations.

132
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:44,326
But I decide what pictures to take.

133
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:48,879
Why would anybody care what I look like
when I'm sleeping or when I'm waking up?

134
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,536
While you're sleeping, the rest
of us are on an important mission,

135
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:55,360
and I'm gonna use the pictures of you
loafing as a warning to future generations.

136
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:56,526
You got it?

137
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,713
For a lowly member to lie around snoring,

138
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,458
while his leader is awake is against
morals, orders, and the rules of the brigade.

139
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,466
We're movin' out, people!

140
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,549
A mysterious island awaits us!

141
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,436
<i>Mysterious island indeed.</i>

142
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:13,081
<i>It's not Panorama Island or Infant Island, is it?</i>

143
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:15,867
<i>I hope this island doesn't float away or start to swim.</i>

144
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,276
That'd ruin my day.

145
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:18,700
It'll be all right.

146
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,815
It's just your typical desert island.

147
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:24,939
Believe me, you can relax because there
aren't any monsters or mad scientist anywhere.

148
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:27,606
I promise you. In fact, I'll guarantee it.

149
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,419
<i>Guarantee it all you want, I still don't trust you.</i>

150
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:36,563
Mr. Arakawa! It's been a while since I last saw you!

151
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,346
Ms. Mori! Thank you for coming to meet us.

152
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,521
I'm sorry for troubling you both.

153
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,751
Now, I'd like to introduce the two of
you to my incomparable group of friends.

154
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:49,631
The boat we'll be taking is right over here.

155
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,774
It should only take us about a half an
hour or so to reach the master's island.

156
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:56,916
My apologies in advance for any inconvenience.

157
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,926
You're kidding! I don't mind at all!

158
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,658
The more remote it is, the better!

159
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:03,176
Another half hour? Take as long as you need!

160
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,781
A deserted island in the middle of
the ocean's exactly what I'm looking for!

161
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:09,629
Hey, you two should be totally excited about this.

162
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:12,864
This island's got a mansion and a
suspicious-looking butler and maid!

163
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:17,050
What's with you guys? I bet you'd maybe
find two islands like this in Japan, tops.

164
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:17,949
<i>There aren't even two.</i>

165
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,237
Oh, wow, that's so amazing!

166
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,730
I'm really looking forward to this.

167
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:33,324
I wonder if Miss Asahina is trying
to pick up some maidisms from Ms. Mori.

168
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,577
She's looking at her so intensely.

169
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,043
So does the house on the island
have some kind of cool name?

170
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,075
I'm sorry?

171
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,901
"The House of Black Death,"
"Lyra Manor," "Kouketsu Castle"?

172
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,055
The mansion has to have a name like that, right?

173
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,243
No, it doesn't.

174
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,731
Maybe it's got a dungeon full of funky contraptions

175
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,401
where the architect died unnaturally,

176
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,167
or a room where, if you sleep in
it, you die a horrible death, right?

177
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:54,342
No, there isn't.

178
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:55,682
Way to kill the mood.

179
00:10:56,342 --> 00:11:00,092
Hey, does the master of the house wear
a mask 'cause he's horribly disfigured?

180
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:02,536
Or maybe there's three psychotic sister living there.

181
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,134
Or maybe, everyone's disappeared!

182
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,512
No, not at all. At least, not yet, anyway.

183
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,857
But there's a good chance something weird
like that'll happen at some point, right?

184
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,150
There's always a possibility, yes.

185
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:17,398
Wow, I think I see it! Is that the mansion?

186
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,316
Yes, that would be it.

187
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,307
It looks so normal...

188
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,573
Someone's waving at us.

189
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,556
Who's that? He looks too young
to be the master of the house.

190
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,799
He's also been invited to stay a few days.

191
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,614
That's mister Yutaka Tamaru, the master's younger brother.

192
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:36,868
I remember meeting him once before.

193
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,348
Thanks for the heads up. You think you could
let us know about these things ahead of time?

194
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,657
This is the first I've ever heard about any other guests.

195
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:46,221
Welcome!

196
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,322
Ah, welcome, everyone.

197
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,951
On behalf of my colleagues, I would like
to thank you for inviting us to your home.

198
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:21,257
It's truly an honor to be able to stay
in such a grand estate as yours, sir.

199
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:24,094
We appreciate your kindness and generosity.

200
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:28,612
My, oh my. I have to say you're quite
different from what Itsuki's told me.

201
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:32,436
Indeed, I think I was expecting
someone who was more direct.

202
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,509
You were?

203
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:35,627
It's really cool to meet you, Mr. Master!

204
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:38,759
But let's cut to the chase; has anything
strange ever happened in this house?

205
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,374
What about the island? You hear any story from the locals?

206
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,151
Do they have a spooky name for the island?

207
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,511
Are they afraid to come near it?

208
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,329
That's the kind of stuff I'm in to!

209
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:51,558
Sounds like you have quite a hobby there.

210
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,221
Although, I've yet to see anything strange happen here.

211
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,677
Construction on the house was
finished the day before yesterday.

212
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:01,626
And as for the island, I don't
recall anyone saying it was haunted.

213
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,529
After all, it was deserted.

214
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,589
Now, why don't you all come
in and make yourselves at home?

215
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,864
The mansion's western-style, so
feel free to keep your shoes on.

216
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,315
Wow, what a lovely room!

217
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,245
It's Okay.

218
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,571
It's nice we each get to have our
own room instead of having to share.

219
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,903
By the way, the doors do have locks, right?

220
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:22,259
Of course. And they're not automatic
locks, so you won't get stuck in the hall.

221
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:25,371
However, I would appreciate
it if you didn't lose your keys.

222
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,819
If you want, you can stay with me in my room.

223
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,565
Only if you behave, you got that?

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,522
Okay...

225
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,363
It's suspicious because nothing looks suspicious.

226
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,919
And if it looks suspicious to begin with, well, then what?

227
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,212
It'd be suspicious, of course! Geez...

228
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:45,799
<i>In other words, to her, everything, including
things that aren't suspicious, are suspicious.</i>

229
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:48,576
I got it!

230
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:49,256
Got what?

231
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:49,923
The culprit!

232
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,789
What culprit? What're you talking about?

233
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:53,117
Look, nothing's even happened yet.

234
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,384
We just got here, okay?

235
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:56,396
My gut says it's the owner of this house!

236
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,877
Keiichi did it! And the first victim will be...

237
00:13:58,902 --> 00:13:59,938
...Mikuru!

238
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:01,985
<i>Would you stop saying stuff like that?</i>

239
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,053
<i>We're their guests!</i>

240
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,214
<i>Can't you just act like a normal high school student?!</i>

241
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,556
I guess you're right. Maybe we should go swimming.

242
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:16,005
We got the whole ocean to ourselves down there,
so we might as well take advantage of it, right?

243
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,492
Oh, man...

244
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:23,162
Although, I'm sure Haruhi would never seriously wish for
anyone to die, it's scary to hear her go off like that.

245
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:32,020
<i>This moment is the best part about this whole trip.</i>

246
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:35,321
<i>Now this is what having a retreat by the sea's all about.</i>

247
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,869
You know, we all have different ideas of what's fun.

248
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,699
A person should spend their time on
vacation doing the things they like.

249
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:48,482
That's especially true for Miss Suzumiya.

250
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,054
We need to keep her occupied
so that she doesn't get bored.

251
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,158
And we wouldn't want that to happen, now, would we?

252
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,991
Kyon, Koizumi! Come on, stop
sittin' around and get over here!

253
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,870
Heh, heh! I'm coming, too!

254
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,440
Over here! Over here!

255
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,639
<i>Too many beach balls!</i>

256
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,889
That was so much fun today.

257
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,799
Wow, this is so delicious! Who made all this?

258
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:33,210
I'm glad you like it. The butler,
Arakawa, is also the head chef around here.

259
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:35,014
I'd like to personally thank him.

260
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,538
Please call him in when he's done.

261
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,051
Can I have some of that?

262
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,720
Wow, she sure eats a lot.

263
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,079
Would you like something to drink?

264
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:45,512
What's wrong?

265
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:46,951
I don't like bell peppers...

266
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:50,358
If you wanna grow up to be like Miss
Asahina, then you're gonna have to eat them.

267
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:52,589
<i>It's not often we get to eat this good.</i>

268
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,823
Wow! I can't believe this is free!

269
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:02,173
I just wish the school cafeteria had a spread like this!

270
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:03,407
It'd be like heaven!

271
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,680
<i>So after living it up, courtesy
of Mr. Tamaru's hospitality,</i>

272
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,340
<i>we were able to get through the first day
without anything terribly strange happening.</i>

273
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:28,016
<i>Now, if the story ended there, it would've been perfect.</i>

274
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,694
<i>No such luck, though...</i>

275
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:35,315
<i>The next morning, as if on cue, a huge storm rolled in.</i>

276
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:42,688
The master's not what you'd call a morning person,

277
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,502
and he tends to be... difficult when he wakes up.

278
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:51,697
Please excuse his absence at the table in the mornings,
and I do appreciate your understanding in the matter.

279
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:55,799
Great, that's just our luck. A typhoon
hits as we're starting our vacation.

280
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,109
The storm seems to be moving fairly quickly.

281
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,151
Things'll be back to normal in a couple days.

282
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,884
You'll see. It'll disappear as quickly as it appeared.

283
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:06,694
It's strange, though. I don't remember
hearing anything about a typhoon yesterday.

284
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:10,756
<i>Whoes head did this massive storm come creeping out of?</i>

285
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:14,756
Okay, what we've got here is a
deserted island in the middle of a storm.

286
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,429
This is a rare opportunity.

287
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:19,176
We might even experience something weird.

288
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,050
Awesome...

289
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,955
<i>Taking the boats out that day was not an option.</i>

290
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,844
<i>The waves were just too big.</i>

291
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:32,413
<i>Now, thanks to Haruhi's wish, we found ourselves the
unwilling guests trapped on a spooky deserted island.</i>

292
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,776
<i>A closed circle...? No way...</i>

293
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,871
<i>Since we couldn't go outside, we decided to spend the
day in the game room which was in the mansion's basement.</i>

294
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:46,018
Here's my Super Ultra Miracle Eccentric Serve!

295
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,676
Hey, whatcha readin'?

296
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,485
Is it good? Huh?

297
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:05,651
I call... Reach!

298
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,348
Wrong! My hand's wroth 10,000 points.

299
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,937
That is definitely a full hand, Miss Suzumiya.

300
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,557
<i>Good we're not playing for money.</i>

301
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,012
I'm glad to see you're all having a good time here.

302
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,408
If you guys don't mind, can I sit in for a hand?

303
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:19,812
Please.

304
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,933
What's it mean when you pitch in a piece?

305
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:34,181
Please excuse me, everybody. I'm afraid
I have some work that needs to get done.

306
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,350
Enjoy yourselves.

307
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:43,803
<i>Keiichi and Yutaka Tamaru. Mr. Arakawa and Ms. Mori.</i>

308
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,370
<i>They seem normal even though
they're acquaintances of Koizumi's.</i>

309
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:50,692
<i>We'll meet a couple more characters
before something strange can happen.</i>

310
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,256
I call Reach!

311
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,528
Who is the king?

312
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,090
I am the king!

313
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,226
Okay, number 2! You have to turn around,
look back at us, and say, "I love you!"

314
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,914
Who has number 2?

315
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,590
I love you.

316
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,998
No, not like that, Yuki!

317
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,307
You have to say it with more feeling, all right?!

318
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:21,953
I love you.

319
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,720
Go on, Kyon. Show her how to do it.

320
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,718
Why do I have to?

321
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,671
It doesn't matter why. It's the king's orders, okay?!

322
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:28,871
I love...

323
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:29,391
Psyche!

324
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,313
<i>Selfish king...</i>

325
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,334
<i>That's typical Haruhi for you.</i>

326
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:39,944
<i>I thought I'd be able to skip the rest of this
chapter of adolescence, with little more than a laugh.</i>

327
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,006
<i>But that's not how the dealer cut the deck.</i>

328
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:46,166
<i>Now, I don't know who this "dealer" is, or what
kind of deck they were cutting for that matter,</i>

329
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:47,841
<i>but if I knew who this dealer was,</i>

330
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:51,712
<i>I'd make sure they'd never shuffle cards
or cut a deck for the rest of the year.</i>

331
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,604
Hey, Haruhi...

332
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:58,808
What a wimp!

333
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,380
You should expect pillow fights when you're on a retreat!

334
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:03,878
<i>Where does that girl get her energy?</i>

335
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,242
<i>She was up all night.</i>

336
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,443
Pillow fights, huh?

337
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,400
No wonder Miss Suzumiya was going through all the rooms.

338
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:13,086
It looks like she went around and
confiscated all the pillows on the second floor.

339
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:15,534
<i>She's stealing all of the weapons before the battle, huh?</i>

340
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,567
Mr. Arakawa, is there anything wrong?

341
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:25,567
I sent Mori up to Mr. Yutaka's room a while ago.

342
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,276
When she came back down, she told me that he wasn't there.

343
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:29,567
He isn't in the house?

344
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:35,776
His bed hadn't been slept in, and we looked for him in
the usual places, but I'm afraid he's nowhere to be found.

345
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:38,553
Have you gone in Mr. Keiichi's room and checked with him?

346
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,971
Yes. Well, we tried calling the phone in
the master's bedroom, but there was no answer.

347
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,051
What's that? Did you say that Mr. Yutaka's
missing and Mr. Keiichi isn't answering his phone?

348
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,244
If asked to summarize, yes, that is exactly what I said.

349
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,659
We should probably check Mr. Keiichi's room.

350
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:56,503
Mr. Arakawa, do you have a key?

351
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:59,217
The master's chambers are different from the other rooms.

352
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:02,135
Unfortunately, he's the only one with the keys to it.

353
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:06,218
It's a precaution. He brings
work-related documents to the island.

354
00:21:06,452 --> 00:21:08,692
We'd better go up to his room and try knocking.

355
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,384
Come on, Kyon. I've got a bad feeling about this.

356
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,384
Yuki, Mikuru, let's go, guys.

357
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,745
Stay here, Little Sister, we'll be right back.

358
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,596
Mr. Keiichi! Mr. Keiichi!

359
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,155
If you're here, answer us!

360
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,240
No good, it's locked.

361
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:39,669
I don't think we have a choice. We're going to
have to break the door down to get in this room.

362
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,592
We can't waste any more time
talking, he might be in trouble.

363
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,317
All right.

364
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:44,366
Very good, sir.

365
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,934
<i>Breaking doors like this only
happens in the movies, right?</i>

366
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,648
<i>Impossible... You're joking, right...?</i>
