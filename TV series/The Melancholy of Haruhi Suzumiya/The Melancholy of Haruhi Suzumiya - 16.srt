1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,581
<i>Something's wrong... That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

2
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:13,652
<i>I didn't care about the baseball game on TV
because it was between schools from another town.</i>

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,958
<i>But, because I tend to sympathize with
underdogs, I ended up rooting for the losing team.</i>

4
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:22,652
And it was right about then, that I
suddenly got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.

5
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,650
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

6
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,433
I know, you don't have to tell me.

7
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,507
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

8
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,753
Meet us at 2:00 in front of
the station. And don't be late!

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,119
<i>I didn't even have a chance to say anything.</i>

10
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:45,562
Now what?

11
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,840
I forgot to tell you, make sure to
bring your swim trunks and some money, too.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,269
Oh, wait, wait. And your bike. Definitely bring your bike.

13
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,887
That's it. Over and out!

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,403
<i>That was weird.</i>

15
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,528
<i>It was like I knew what Haruhi was
gonna say before she even said anything.</i>

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,500
<i>Hang on... Actually, it felt more like
we'd had the exact same conversation before,</i>

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,135
<i>like déjà vu or something.</i>

18
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:13,848
<i>Summer's almost over...</i>

19
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:49,586
You're late again, Kyon!

20
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,357
Where is your motivation?

21
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,588
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,811
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

23
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,366
No worries. I just got here, too.

24
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:01,022
Now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,192
Where to?

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,741
To the public swimming pool! Where do ya think?

27
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:07,147
<i>That figures... considering the stuff I brought.</i>

28
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,344
We've got lots and lots of summer
vacation-y things to do during our summer break!

29
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,238
But, we've only so much time because
once it's gone, it's gone for good!

30
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:19,924
So we're gonna do everything we can, while
we can during our only summer as tenth graders!

31
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:22,905
And for starters, we're riding the bikes to the pool!

32
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,255
Okay. Did everyone ride their bikes today?

33
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:29,141
No... The only bikes we have to ride
over are the ones you and I brought.

34
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:29,807
Huh?

35
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:35,478
All right, Kyon! You can't let Koizumi beat you!

36
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,470
Come on! Full speed ahead!

37
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,306
<i>No ESP allowed!</i>

38
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:43,113
Come on, guys, hurry up and park your bikes.

39
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,604
Kyon! We're trying to have fun, so stop acting tired!

40
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,170
<i>And whose fault is that?!</i>

41
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,734
Mmm, can you smell the chlorine?

42
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,011
That really makes it feel like summer!

43
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,338
Hurry and get in!

44
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,821
Come on, the water's warm! It's perfect!

45
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,597
<i>Can't she see the "no diving" signs?</i>

46
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,661
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

47
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:07,540
Well, that looks like fun. Don't you think?

48
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,412
I mean, seeing her enjoy the day in a normal fashion.

49
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,539
It's a rather charming sight, isn't it?

50
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,447
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's having a good time here,

51
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:19,221
we don't have to worry about any earth-shattering events.

52
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,773
I hope you're right.

53
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:23,855
What's wrong?

54
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:25,362
Oh, nothing.

55
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,919
It's probably my imagination.

56
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,394
Come on, let's go and have some fun, too.

57
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:55,834
<i>It's so bitter! May I have another?</i>

58
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,280
<i>That's weird. It's like I've seen this before.</i>

59
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:10,853
<i>Nagato... sitting all alone, looking bored...</i>

60
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:11,826
Kyon!

61
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,106
<i>Yeah... And then Haruhi shows up, and she says...</i>

62
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,053
So, these two guys are my brigade members.

63
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,452
They do what I say.

64
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,532
So if you want something, you can ask them!

65
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,977
Time for some fun!

66
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:27,084
Let's play dodge-ball in the pool!

67
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:29,507
We're coming!

68
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,563
<i>Oh, well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

69
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,950
I've been thinking of some fun things we could do!

70
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,028
Check it out!

71
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:41,983
What is that?

72
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:45,527
It's a schedule of how we're gonna
spend the rest of our summer vacation!

73
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,185
I realized something...

74
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,797
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

75
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,009
That fact totally blew me away.

76
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:58,758
We've done a lot of cool things but we've only got so
much time, and there's a bazillion more things left to do!

77
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:01,136
So I say, we gotta pick up the pace!

78
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,415
We've got two weeks to do all that?!

79
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:06,288
Mikuru, is there anything else you wanna do?

80
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,822
Huh?

81
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,737
Um... I think I'd like to try goldfish scooping?

82
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,642
Okay! Goldfish scooping, it is...

83
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:15,701
Could I see the list you made?

84
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:21,926
Okay, thanks.

85
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,305
We'll start the list tomorrow!

86
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,662
Do you guys know if there's a
bon festival happening anywhere?

87
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,363
Or even a firework show?

88
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,797
I could check around for those.
I'll call you if I find one.

89
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,829
Don't forget about goldfish scooping.

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,208
After all, it's Mikuru's only request.

91
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:37,990
Okay, I'll get right on it.

92
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,606
That's it for today! See ya!

93
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,360
I'll be going, too.

94
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,052
Me too. Bye!

95
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,503
Nagato!

96
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,333
Hey, sorry, it's nothing important or anything...

97
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:03,179
So, how have you been? Is everything okay?

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,946
It is.

99
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:06,449
Oh! Good!

100
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:15,412
What was that all about?

101
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:17,589
Why'd I want to talk to her?

102
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:28,493
A bon festival, huh?

103
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,219
<i>Figures it'd be so crowded.</i>

104
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:37,196
<i>That tower... Those vendors...</i>

105
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:41,914
<i>I haven't been to a bon festival in a
while, but it feels like I just went to one.</i>

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,903
Mikuru!

107
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,876
They have goldfish scooping
over there, just like you wanted!

108
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,459
Come on, you're gonna catch a ton!

109
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,577
Okay...

110
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:50,466
Do you wanna go scoop some fish, too?

111
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:51,946
We could have a contest.

112
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,014
Think I'll pass.

113
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,575
How 'bout you, Nagato? You wanna go get some food?

114
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,427
I didn't know you were into this kinda stuff.

115
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,300
I got it!

116
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:03,948
No.

117
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,151
That one.

118
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:07,128
Sure, 800 yen!

119
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,407
I wish she would've let me buy that for her...

120
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,193
It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.

121
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,050
Thirteen fish!

122
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,408
It's like the most unbelievable haul ever!

123
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,474
But, I don't have any place to put 'em all.

124
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:24,074
So I just kept one, and I gave another one to Mikuru!

125
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,982
Go ahead and have one, but only one!

126
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,130
Thanks.

127
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,345
Hey, Yuki, what's up with the mask you got there?

128
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,638
I bought it.

129
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,478
Oh... Okay.

130
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,311
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

131
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,836
<i>I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

132
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,829
<i>Truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

133
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,982
Haruhi, I don't want to spoil your
fun, but did you finish your homework?

134
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,455
Are you kidding?

135
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,151
That stuff's totally easy.

136
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,186
You can finish it in like three days.

137
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:09,334
Three days?!

138
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,395
You have to get rid of that junk first,

139
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,747
so you can spend the rest of your summer
having fun and not worrying about it!

140
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,792
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

141
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:22,523
<i>The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.</i>

142
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,826
You guys! Tomorrow, we're gonna go catch some bugs!

143
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:29,111
And the prize for whoever
catches the most bugs is gonna be...

144
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:32,968
...um... I know! They get to be
brigade leader for a whole day!

145
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:33,769
<i>No thanks!</i>

146
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:35,200
That sounds like a lot of fun!

147
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,385
Can we catch just any random bug?

148
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:40,352
Um... No... Only cicadas!

149
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,632
In fact, I'm calling it the SOS
Brigade's cicada catching contest!

150
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,183
The next day was beautiful, sunny, and bright.

151
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:54,243
<i>In fact, it was the perfect day for us to
have our SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest.</i>

152
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:57,193
That's not a cicada.

153
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,644
I-It's a yanbaru long-armed scarab!

154
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:02,500
<i>Although everyone caught bugs the best way they knew how,</i>

155
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,453
the winner of the contest ended up being...

156
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,115
<i>You guessed it, Haruhi.</i>

157
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:10,858
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

158
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:15,690
You never know, if we let 'em go now,
they might come back and return the favor!

159
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:18,740
<i>What could a cicada do for me, even if it did come back?</i>

160
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,609
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

161
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,923
I sorta feel like Pandora, when she opened her box.

162
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,986
W-welcome to our store!

163
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:40,323
<i>We met the next day, even though we
had absolutely no idea what was going on.</i>

164
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,732
<i>Our confusion continued as we
stood outside the local supermarket,</i>

165
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:46,264
<i>wearing frog costumes and handing out balloons.</i>

166
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,672
It's a living.

167
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,463
I feel like Unit Zero after it got hit by that beam.

168
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:58,210
Hey, guys! Awesome job today!

169
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,280
<i>What's with the special treatment?!</i>

170
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,181
You're the best!

171
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:02,834
The manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

172
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,842
Who cares how grateful he is? What about our pay?

173
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,366
There it is!

174
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,119
Huh?!

175
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:12,429
I've had my eye on this little guy for a long time now.

176
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:14,306
<i>We worked in the sun,</i>

177
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,296
<i>sweat pouring down our foreheads...</i>

178
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:17,040
<i>...for that?!</i>

179
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,473
We'll keep him in the club room as a souvenir.

180
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:23,030
Oh, and Mikuru, you have my
permission to wear him whenever you want.

181
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,347
Help yourself, okay?

182
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:25,476
Sure! Uh...

183
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,395
Yeah? What?

184
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,678
Oh, it's nothing.

185
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:30,410
<i>Don't stare at me.</i>

186
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,518
Come on, Mikuru!

187
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,500
You're the cutest little froggy ever!

188
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,337
Put it back on, you know you want to!

189
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,808
Watch the popsicle, ladies.

190
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,807
<i>Later that night,</i>

191
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,258
<i>my peaceful slumber was interrupted by a phone call.</i>

192
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,213
<i>The number you have dialed is no longer...</i>

193
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:51,115
What the heck?!

194
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,347
Kyon...

195
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,152
Miss Asahina, is that you?

196
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:57,905
Yes... It's me...

197
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,014
Something... really bad...

198
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:05,196
I don't know... Wha...

199
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,185
What's wrong?

200
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,540
Hello, it's Koizumi.

201
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,926
How about you tell me what you're doing
with Miss Asahina in the middle of the night?

202
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:13,855
We have a situation here.

203
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,772
Would it be possible for you to come meet us now?

204
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:26,696
Miss Asahina! Is everything okay? What happened?

205
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:34,004
Oh, Kyon! I-I-I can't go back to the future...!

206
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,707
I'll explain it the best I can.

207
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,583
Currently, we're stuck in a time
loop that seems to be infinite.

208
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,805
It's hard to believe you're serious
with you sitting there, smiling like that.

209
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:48,800
I mean, come on, Koizumi.

210
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,757
Do you have any idea what you just said?

211
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:54,373
Yes, of course, I do. Much
more than I want to, believe me.

212
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:57,781
Earlier, I was having a chat with Miss Asahina.

213
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,983
<i>Next time, you guys are chatting, call me!</i>

214
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:05,051
And then suddenly, we came to the conclusion that there
was something a little off about the current flow of time.

215
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:08,383
But the truth is, Miss Asahina discovered it.

216
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,368
Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

217
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:12,891
What suspicions?

218
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:19,881
We're currently stuck in a time loop, re-living
the same period of time, over and over again.

219
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,309
Yeah, you already said that.

220
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,536
We've been repeating every day
between August the 17th through the 31st.

221
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,693
We're in the middle of what seems
to be an endless summer vacation.

222
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:34,064
Well, at least it's summer vacation anyway...

223
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,773
It's a never-ending, endless summer vacation.

224
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,377
The future doesn't exist in this world anymore.

225
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,216
Time stops at September the 1st.

226
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,488
And who's gonna believe such a thing?

227
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,535
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping that you would believe it.

228
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,336
I think I can try to explain it.

229
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,481
Okay, here it goes...

230
00:13:55,523 --> 00:14:01,547
Because I have to classified information, I used
classified information to get in touch with the future.

231
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:07,764
The thing is, I haven't gotten any
classified information for about a week now.

232
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,565
And that's kind of weird.

233
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:14,584
I was so surprised, I classified information.

234
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,352
I really did.

235
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,324
But it was classified information.

236
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,823
I don't know what to do.

237
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,312
What about those closed spaces
you were talking about before?

238
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:31,049
Maybe we're trapped in one of those.

239
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,800
No, it's not one of those.

240
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:36,044
A section of time has been torn away from time-space.

241
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:40,429
At exactly midnight on August
the 31st, everything will reset.

242
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:44,097
Then time reverts straight back
to the morning of August the 17th.

243
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,627
That's the process.

244
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:47,617
What about our... No, wait.

245
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,378
What about the whole world's memories?

246
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:51,282
Their memories are reset.

247
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,266
Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning.

248
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:57,594
Perfect, another problem involving time.

249
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,043
I guess that figures when there's a time traveler around.

250
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,576
No, Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

251
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,044
Then, what's causing it?

252
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,925
It's Miss Suzumiya.

253
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,876
I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.

254
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:16,967
I think subconsciously, she wants
to have summer vacation last forever.

255
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,926
You're kidding!

256
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:20,173
You're telling me she still hasn't had enough fun?

257
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,980
Yeah, that's what I think.

258
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:28,555
Perhaps she feels there's something else that needs
to happen before our summer vacation can really be over.

259
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,577
You seem like you're kind of enjoying this.

260
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,862
Do you wanna tell me why?

261
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,935
Please don't take that the wrong way, it's just...

262
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:39,819
This explains the feelings of déjà vu I've been having.

263
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,014
But, now that I think about it,

264
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:47,717
those feelings were most likely the residue of my memories
from all the other instances where time had been reset.

265
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,794
So, are we the only ones? Or can
other people feel this happening, too?

266
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,530
It doesn't seem that way.

267
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:56,032
You and I are exceptions to the rule though.

268
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:00,100
The only people who can sense this strangeness

269
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,225
are the ones closest to Miss Suzumiya.

270
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,216
But, what about Haruhi?

271
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:06,792
Does she have any idea about
the stuff that's been going on?

272
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,860
No, I don't think she knows about it.

273
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,765
Besides, it would be very bad for us if she did.

274
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:17,329
But there's someone else who isn't affected by the time
loop, or the feelings of déjà vu we've been experiencing.

275
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,984
This person remembers everything
that's happened since this started.

276
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:25,966
Is that true?

277
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:27,188
It is.

278
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,659
Then... you remember everything?

279
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:30,633
I can.

280
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:34,574
Okay then, how many times has this happened so far?

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,335
This would be 15,521 times so far.

282
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:44,044
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-one times?</i>

283
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:49,796
<i>Wait... What do you mean 15,521 times?</i>

284
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:54,663
And... you're being completely serious?

285
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,750
I am.

286
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,843
So then, you're saying that we've done the exact
same things that many times, every single time?

287
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,523
Not necessarily.

288
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:13,580
Throughout 15,521 repetitions, we did not attend a
bon festival the 2,391st time and the 11,054th time.

289
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,241
We went to a bon festival but did not go to
a goldfish scooping booth exactly 437 times.

290
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:26,518
We obtained part-time jobs 9,048 times,
and performed six different types of jobs.

291
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:30,957
In addition to handing out balloons, we
worked as movers, cashiers, we handed out...

292
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,367
Okay! I got it...

293
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,745
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-one times...</i>

294
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,948
<i>That's what Nagato said.</i>

295
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,267
<i>Okay... So... times two weeks...</i>

296
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:51,887
<i>That's, uh... about... 595 years.</i>

297
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,190
<i>She's the only one of us who
remembers everything we've done.</i>

298
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,925
<i>And she's had to repeat those
same things over and over again.</i>

299
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:00,766
<i>Nagato...</i>

300
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,755
<i>What's it like to re-live the same things that many times?</i>

301
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:12,365
That's gotta be the craziest story ever.

302
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,721
I wonder if they're real.

303
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:16,752
What's real?

304
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:17,966
Martians.

305
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:19,367
I kind of hope they aren't.

306
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:22,352
I can't see anyone on the surface right now,

307
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:25,834
but I bet they're a reserved race of
beings who have to live underground.

308
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:29,250
Whenever us humans are finally able to land on Mars,

309
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,018
I'm sure the Martians'll pop out from wherever
they're hiding, and say something like, "Welcome to Mars!"

310
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:36,190
I don't think they should pop out.

311
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,533
Ugh, this is boring.

312
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,469
I'm gonna look for some UFOs now.

313
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,306
<i>That night, we went stargazing.</i>

314
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:47,712
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's
apartment, since her place had the best view.</i>

315
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,325
<i>Koizumi brought the telescope.</i>

316
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,174
I wish I knew what else she wants to do.

317
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,545
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

318
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,708
If we knew the answer, we could solve this thing.

319
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,132
I have an idea we can try if you want.

320
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:04,309
What if someone were to suddenly
grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

321
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:07,183
and then whispered, "I love you," right into her ear?

322
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,450
And who's gonna be doing the whispering?

323
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,434
Is there anyone who could play that role other than you?

324
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,136
Yeah, no thanks.

325
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:17,534
All right then, how 'bout if I do it?

326
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:21,677
Of course, I'm kidding.

327
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,101
I don't think I could pull that off.

328
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,670
And besides, it would just
confuse Miss Suzumiya in the end.

329
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,284
Hey, Nagato.

330
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:41,890
You knew about this time loop before
Miss Asahina figured it out, didn't you?

331
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:43,615
I did.

332
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:46,600
So then, how come you didn't say anything about it?

333
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,538
My function is to observe.

334
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:54,363
I see...

335
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:59,008
<i>We kept chugging along, doing
all kinds of summer vacation things.</i>

336
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:03,686
<i>We went to a real firework show, and we
even signed up for a goby fishing tournament.</i>

337
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:08,284
<i>We went to the batting cages, we watched some movies,</i>

338
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,904
<i>went to the beach, bowling, karaoke.</i>

339
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,039
<i>Oh yeah, we were always doing something.</i>

340
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,626
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was going to be enough for Haruhi.</i>

341
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
<i>But, what could I do about it?</i>

342
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:20,491
<i>Nothing.</i>

343
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:27,075
<i>So, I just bit my lip and watched as the
last days of summer... vacation went by...</i>

344
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:33,999
<i>And then, before I knew it, August the 30th was here.</i>

345
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:43,475
That's it. We've done everything on our list.

346
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,234
Hey! Don't mess that up!

347
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,691
Hmm... But now I'm wondering if we did enough.

348
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,283
Oh, well. Yeah, I guess we did do a lot of stuff...

349
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,823
Unless there's something else you guys wanna do?

350
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:07,767
Oh! Okay, then.

351
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:11,571
I guess we did pretty much everything
we set out to do, so that's good enough.

352
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,295
No, it's not.

353
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:15,630
You're still not satisfied.

354
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,619
That's it then! We're all done for today.

355
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:24,601
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess
you can go ahead and take the day off now, okay?

356
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,934
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday!

357
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,770
<i>Wait, Haruhi.</i>

358
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:41,154
That's it then! We're all done for today.

359
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:46,340
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess
you can go ahead and take the day off now, okay?

360
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:48,586
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday!

361
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:53,221
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave.</i>

362
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,237
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

363
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:01,486
<i>we'll end up re-living the past two weeks
again and again for a thousand more times!</i>

364
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,074
That's it then! We're all done for today.

365
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:09,201
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess
you can go ahead and take the day off now, okay?

366
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,414
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday!

367
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,584
<i>What should I do?</i>

368
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>What should I say?</i>

369
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:19,284
<i>There must have been a clue in something Haruhi said...</i>

370
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:21,399
<i>But what was it?</i>

371
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,868
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

372
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:26,212
<i>I don't know...</i>

373
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,768
<i>I can't... remember...</i>

374
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:31,327
That's it then! We're all done for today.

375
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:36,434
I set tomorrow aside just in case, but I guess
you can go ahead and take the day off now, okay?

376
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:38,664
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday!

377
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,497
<i>Whatever... It doesn't matter.</i>

378
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,371
<i>It's August the 31st.</i>

379
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,550
<i>And I still haven't touched my homework.</i>

380
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:53,520
<i>Who cares?</i>

381
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,978
<i>There's no point in doing it. I mean, we're
just gonna keep re-living the last couple of weeks.</i>

382
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:04,209
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

383
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:07,233
<i>a different version of me will have to deal with it.</i>
