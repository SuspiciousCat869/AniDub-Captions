1
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:04,890
<i>Well, it's been about a month since we started school,</i>

2
00:00:05,118 --> 00:00:08,070
<i>and I've been enjoying my early
morning hikes about as much as I could.</i>

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,469
<i>Although, I sort of feel like Sisyphus,</i>

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,331
<i>cursed to forever roll that boulder up
the hill, tryin' to make it to the top.</i>

5
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,158
<i>And then something hit me.</i>

6
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,549
<i>Something that felt like an 8.0 earthquake,</i>

7
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:21,393
<i>which brought my normal life to a grinding halt.</i>

8
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,564
<i>No, that's not quite right.</i>

9
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,739
<i>Actually, something was starting to happen.</i>

10
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:31,293
If it doesn't exist, I should just make it myself!

11
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:32,871
Make a club!

12
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,639
And you're gonna help me with it!

13
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:37,567
I've just figured out what we're gonna call ourselves!

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,898
The SOS Brigade!

15
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:43,548
And so begins my never-ending hell,

16
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,257
thanks to the eccentric Haruhi Suzumiya.

17
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:47,987
Good morning!

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,346
Uh... Oh, morning.

19
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,293
I forgot I had class duties today.

20
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,947
I have to get the class log from the teacher's lounge.

21
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,346
I have to hurry! I'll see you in class!

22
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:01,629
<i>Hard to believe a girl like
that's in my class along with...</i>

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,251
Hey, Kyon! Can you think of anything
else we're gonna need right now?

24
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,026
What do you mean?

25
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,805
I wanna get my hands on a mysterious transfer student.

26
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:12,911
What do you think of that?

27
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:16,645
I beg you, please start the
conversation by making the context clear.

28
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:19,102
It's exactly what the SOS Brigade needs.

29
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,627
We need something like a mysterious transfer student.

30
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:23,383
Okay, before you kidnap anyone else,

31
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:24,973
what do you mean by "mysterious"?

32
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,959
Check it out. School started
less than two months ago, right?

33
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:32,510
So I'm thinking that anybody who transfers
into our school right now has to be mysterious!

34
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,391
Am I right?

35
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,054
Maybe the kid's dad got relocated because of work.

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,358
Oh, work with me here. It's not normal!

37
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:40,352
I'd sorta like to know what you consider normal,

38
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:41,820
but I'm almost afraid to ask.

39
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,381
Hmm... I wonder if we'll get anyone like that.

40
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,576
A mysterious transfer student...

41
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:50,384
I guess in other words, you don't really
give a damn about anything I say at all.

42
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:51,815
Whatever...

43
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:28,394
<i>Apparently there's a rumor floating around
school that Haruhi and I are up to something.</i>

44
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:31,713
Level with me. What are you and Suzumiya up to?

45
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,683
You guys wouldn't happen to be
dating or anything, would you?

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,401
Ugh, no, we're not dating.

47
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:39,460
And trust me, I'd also like to
know what we're supposedly up to.

48
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,725
I don't have any idea what I'm doing anymore.

49
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:45,004
Just don't overdo it. You're not in junior high anymore.

50
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:48,896
You guys mess up the school or anything,
you'll get suspended at the very least.

51
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:55,057
<i>At least I can keep Yuki Nagato and Mikuru
Asahina from getting involved in anything too crazy.</i>

52
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,154
<i>Since the SOS Brigade was founded,</i>

53
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:03,254
<i>the once empty room of the former
literary club now has lots of things in it.</i>

54
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,067
<i>Maybe she's planning on living here or something.</i>

55
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,443
You know what? It'd be great to have a computer in here!

56
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,443
We're living in the information age and we
don't even have a computer. I can't forgive them.

57
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:18,231
<i>And who is it you can't forgive?</i>

58
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:20,940
What d'ya say? Let's go get one!

59
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,013
Do you have any idea how we're gonna get one?

60
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,134
You're not gonna rob a computer store, are you?

61
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:28,178
No way! We're gonna hit some place closer.

62
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,259
Hi, everyone!

63
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:36,122
I've come for a computer and all
the accessories that go with it!

64
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,131
Who in here's the president?

65
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,570
I guess that'd be me?

66
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,473
There's only one reason why I would schlep
all the way over here to the computer club.

67
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,115
I'm here for a computer!

68
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,022
I only need one.

69
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,355
Excuse me? You crazy or somethin'?

70
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,415
We only need one, and you guys got a whole bunch in here.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,846
Hang on a sec, who the heck are you anyway?

72
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,395
We are the SOS Brigade, and
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya, the leader!

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,130
And these are my henchmen Number 1 and Number 2!

74
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:05,700
Don't give me any crap. Just hand
over a computer and no one gets hurt.

75
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,042
Why the hell should I?!

76
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,821
I'm not givin' you guys anything!

77
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,298
Okay. Here's how this is gonna go down, boys,

78
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,870
so try to pay attention.

79
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:31,092
What're you doing?!

80
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,120
And! One more shot!

81
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,721
What're you doing?!

82
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,299
Ah-ah-ah!

83
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,676
I have photographic evidence of blatant sexual harassment.

84
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,832
If you don't want any of these pics to show up all
over campus, hand over a computer and be quick about it.

85
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:52,560
This is ludicrous! You forced me to touched her breasts!

86
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,412
I'm innocent I tell ya!

87
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:58,500
Wonder how many people are gonna listen to
your side of the story, you sexual harasser.

88
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,523
What?! Hang on! All the club members here are witnesses!

89
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:04,753
That's right!

90
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,099
Yeah, it wasn't his fault!

91
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:12,199
Then I'll tell everyone at school that
all you geeks ganged up on her and... ed her!

92
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,740
You out of her mind or something?!

93
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, chief?

94
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,737
You gonna hand it over or not?

95
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,110
M-Miss Suzumiya...

96
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:21,676
That's...!

97
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,841
Take whichever one you want.

98
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:35,549
Get up, man!

99
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,009
Get a hold of yourself.

100
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:38,423
It's gonna be okay.

101
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:39,060
We'll figure this out...

102
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:39,976
Don't cry.

103
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,913
It's... like a bad comedy skit or something.

104
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,386
Which one's the latest model?

105
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:49,357
Give me one good reason why I should tell you that!

106
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,220
That one...

107
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:58,746
I almost forgot... I got a list from
the list from the computer store yesterday.

108
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:00,805
It's got all the newest models on it.

109
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:03,403
And, it looks like this computer's not listed.

110
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:08,781
Think I'll take that one!

111
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,927
Wait, that's the machine we
just bought! You can't do this!

112
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,801
Take it, you thief...

113
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,623
<i>Yeah, you got that right...</i>

114
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,818
<i>She is a thief.</i>

115
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:22,191
Hey, Kyon!

116
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,002
Hmm?

117
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,260
Could you get this?

118
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:29,092
<i>And, just like that, Haruhi
procured a state-of-the-art computer.</i>

119
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,563
<i>It was only then she learned that the
literary club wasn't wired for internet use.</i>

120
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,502
<i>So she called the Computer Club over
to run a LAN cable between our rooms.</i>

121
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:41,142
<i>She also had them set us up so that we
could connect using the school's domain.</i>

122
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,522
<i>Can you say "Extortion"?</i>

123
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:44,978
<i>Good.</i>

124
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:49,494
Come on, what d'ya say we go back to the others?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,676
Miss Asahina, I was thinking maybe it's best
you don't get involved with this brigade thing.

126
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,024
I mean, who knows what she'll
end up doing to you if you stay?

127
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,050
No, it's all right I guess.

128
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,393
But you'll stay too, won't you?

129
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:14,712
Uh...

130
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:22,387
I guess the probability of this happening on
this particular time plane's is unavoidable.

131
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:23,347
Huh...?

132
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,758
And I'm worried about why Miss Nagato's here, too...

133
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:28,766
What'd you say?

134
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:29,537
Huh?

135
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:33,026
Oh, nothing. I was just babbling.

136
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:38,276
I might be a little inexperienced, but I
know I'm gonna get along with everyone here.

137
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,790
By the way, you don't have to be so formal.

138
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,554
Please just call me Mikuru if you don't mind.

139
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:47,144
<i>Okay...</i>

140
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:48,938
<i>So what's next...?</i>

141
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:55,082
So, about this website, who're you gonna get to make it?

142
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:56,446
That'd be you.

143
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,706
Beats sitting around being bored all the time.

144
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,254
I have to go out and find some more members now.

145
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,312
Oh, and make sure you finish the
site in the next couple of days.

146
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,986
The club's dead in the water until
we have our site up and running.

147
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,998
I'm building a website, huh?

148
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,759
<i>Despite my griping, I kinda enjoyed making it.</i>

149
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:23,887
<i>The guys from the Computer Club installed all the
software for me, so it wasn't too hard to figure out.</i>

150
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,763
<i>Not a bad way to spend an otherwise boring lunch.</i>

151
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,300
<i>Okay. What am I supposed to put on it?</i>

152
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:35,650
<i>I mean, I still had absolutely no idea
what the SOS Brigade was actually going to do.</i>

153
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:38,445
Hey, Nagato, was there anything
you wanted me to put on this site?

154
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:39,967
No, there's not.

155
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>Not that I should get involved, but...</i>

156
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,294
<i>does this girl even go to class?</i>

157
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,265
Oh crap! I gotta go to class!

158
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:08,300
Take it...

159
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,896
I'll lend this to you...

160
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,260
<i>Okay, I'm still not sold on this whole "Brigade" thing.</i>

161
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,246
<i>So why do I find myself eagerly
commuting to the club room?</i>

162
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:38,498
<i>Why? Is it simply what you call "habit"?</i>

163
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,133
<i>Hey!</i>

164
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,126
<i>These two can't be that bored, can they?</i>

165
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,634
<i>Can't say I'm not bored either, but...</i>

166
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,272
Where's Miss Suzumiya?

167
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,052
Dunno. By the time I managed to get to
our 6th period class, she wasn't there.

168
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:56,775
How much you wanna bet she's out there
right now extorting more gear from somebody?

169
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:00,961
Will I be forced to do something like yesterday?

170
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,852
You'll be fine, trust me.

171
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,567
I'm not gonna let anything like
that happen to you ever again.

172
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,367
You mean you'll protect me?!

173
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,935
Oh, thank you so much!

174
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,742
Guess I'll be counting on you, then!

175
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,641
It's an honor to be counted on.

176
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,056
Ya-hoo!

177
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:16,347
<i>Ya... hoo?</i>

178
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,404
First, take a look at this!

179
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:26,307
"SOS Brigade... an explanation of our general policies..."

180
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,919
And now, for this:

181
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,730
Ta-da-da-da, da-da!

182
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,211
We're gonna pass out flyers wearing these.

183
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,063
Where at?

184
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,182
The main gate.

185
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,700
There's a bunch of students still hanging out on campus.

186
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,297
And what exactly are we wearing?

187
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,926
You're not the one wearing it.

188
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,412
I got this outfit for Mikuru.

189
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,616
Ah! What?

190
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,264
A bunny girl costume.

191
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:49,935
But... how... how am I supposed to...?

192
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,721
Come on! Put it on! Get dressed!

193
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,007
But I don't want to!

194
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:54,930
Shut up and strip! Come on, girl!

195
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,136
Nooo!

196
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,007
Hey, Suzumiya! Stop it!

197
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:01,000
Please, no! No, don't look!

198
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,328
Quit struggling!

199
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,375
But I don't wanna put it on!

200
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,840
Move your arm! Let's go, Mikuru, take it off!

201
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:07,927
Take it off!

202
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:17,232
Noo... don't...

203
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:20,013
Let me take it off myself!

204
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,133
No! Noo!

205
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,688
You can come in now!

206
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,468
<i>She's like an evil overlord.</i>

207
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:31,690
Well? Think we'll get some attention now or what?

208
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,330
Don't think that'll be a problem.

209
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,051
Nagato wasn't into it?

210
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,196
Nah, I could only afford two of 'em.

211
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,851
I got the deluxe set, so they were expensive.

212
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,462
Where'd you buy these things...?

213
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,949
I got 'em online.

214
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:43,977
I see.

215
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:46,201
Well, we'll be going now.

216
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,676
Come on, Mikuru, let's head out.

217
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,856
No, I don't wanna...

218
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,444
Nooo!

219
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,958
Let's go! Yeah!

220
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:57,752
<i>Sorry...</i>

221
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:01,146
<i>Honestly though, that outfit's killing me right now.</i>

222
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,226
<i>My passion's going through the roof here...</i>

223
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,584
Oh brother...

224
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:25,040
<i>It's still warm from their body heat...</i>

225
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,743
<i>"The SOS Brigade: An explanation of our general policies.</i>

226
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:37,055
We, the SOS Brigade, are committed to
seeking out mysteries in this universe.

227
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:40,560
To anyone who has experienced
strange phenomena in the past,

228
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:43,556
anyone who has a mysterious experience recently,

229
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:47,002
or anyone who plans on having a
weird experience in the future.

230
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:50,435
If any of the above applies to you, come see us!

231
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,784
We'll help you find the answers you need, fast!

232
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,726
However, if your mystery is ordinary, we can't help you.

233
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,863
We only accept phenomena and/or
mysteries that freak us out!

234
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,453
"Please keep that in mind."

235
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,336
<i>I think I'm starting to understand
the reason for this brigade's existence.</i>

236
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,369
They piss me off so much!

237
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,294
I mean, what's with those stupid teachers?!

238
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,434
They're always butting in!

239
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,572
So what happened out there? Did you guys get into trouble?

240
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:21,974
Unbelievable! We passed out half our flyers and
teachers came out of nowhere telling us to stop!

241
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,239
Who do they think they are?!

242
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:26,970
<i>If two girls in bunny suits are
passing out flyers in front of the school,</i>

243
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,006
<i>everybody'd come running to check that out.</i>

244
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:32,273
Mikuru starts sobbing, I get yanked into detention,

245
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,649
and Okabe, that handball freak, comes over... Augh!

246
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,074
<i>I'm sure they didn't know what
to keep their eyes focused on.</i>

247
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:42,481
Well, I guess that's it for today.

248
00:14:42,788 --> 00:14:43,746
Dismissed!

249
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,549
How long you gonna cry anyway?!

250
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,837
Let's go! Take it off, come on!

251
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,929
Um, say, Kyon...

252
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:03,227
If I find I'm unable to get married after all this,

253
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,330
would you be willing to marry me...?

254
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:11,671
<i>What should I say?</i>

255
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,390
<i>Miss Asahina, you look like you just found
out you didn't get accepted into college.</i>

256
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:20,673
<i>Or, like someone who's just lost her
job the day after buying her dream house.</i>

257
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:25,239
<i>Wait... Oh man, now you're calling me Kyon, too...</i>

258
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:30,897
<i>By the next day, the name Haruhi
Suzumiya had become infamous.</i>

259
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:33,099
<i>Now everyone at school was talking about her.</i>

260
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:37,943
Hey there, Kyon, hate to say it, but
it looks like you've gone and done it.

261
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:40,822
You've become one of Suzumiya's gang of weirdos, huh?

262
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,871
Oh, shut up.

263
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,926
<i>The sucky thing about being part of all
this is that my name and Miss Asahina's</i>

264
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,909
<i> are now floating around the campus, too.</i>

265
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:49,982
I couldn't believe what I was seeing yesterday.

266
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,953
A couple of bunny girls hanging
out by the school's main gate.

267
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,384
I mean, the girl in red was Mikuru Asahina, wasn't it?

268
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:59,364
Now everybody in school's talking about you guys, Kyon.

269
00:15:59,389 --> 00:15:59,928
Everybody.

270
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:02,547
What exactly is this SOS Brigade?

271
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,927
You're gonna have to ask Suzumiya.

272
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,326
I really don't know. I don't even wanna know.

273
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:11,702
Well, it definitely looks like
you guys are having a lot of fun.

274
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:14,595
But you know, yesterday's stunt was a little overboard.

275
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:18,742
<i>That day Miss Asahina didn't show up to school.</i>

276
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:23,232
Unbelievable. Not a single email after all that publicity!

277
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:27,765
<i>After publicity like that, I don't think
anyone's gonna want anything to do with us.</i>

278
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,408
<i>Have to admit though, that
stunt caught everyone's attention.</i>

279
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,946
Hang on... Where's Mikuru?

280
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,514
Didn't she come to school?

281
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>She might never show up again.</i>

282
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,667
<i>Hope she wasn't too traumatized by all this...</i>

283
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,812
And I even got a new outfit for her to wear today, too.

284
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,245
Why don't you wear it yourself then?

285
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,469
Oh, don't worry, I'm gonna wear it.

286
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,192
It's just not any fun if Mikuru isn't here...

287
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,175
<i>Why don't you have Nagato wear it?</i>

288
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:51,913
<i>I doubt she'd have any complaints.</i>

289
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,881
<i>In fact, I don't think I'd mind seeing her wear it.</i>

290
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,217
Agh!

291
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:01,430
I got the SOS Brigade up and running,
and now we're just sitting around.

292
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:04,122
What is it, everybody holding out on me or something?

293
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,070
Keeping their mysteries to themselves...

294
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:11,496
<i>Okay, Haruhi. Look, ask anybody in this
room and they'd say, "Sure, mysteries? Why not?"</i>

295
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,793
<i>But an ordinary high school like ours
isn't gonna have a bunch of weirdness...</i>

296
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,812
<i>... just stacked in the corner somewhere for you.</i>

297
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:18,449
<i>You know that, right?</i>

298
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,800
<i>I mean, you do realize that, don't you?</i>

299
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,165
<i>You don't have any place to channel all
that adolescent frustration boiling inside you.</i>

300
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,993
<i>Isn't that what's really fueling
all this impulsive behavior?</i>

301
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:32,737
<i>Snap out of it and go find yourself a good-looking
guy and let him walk you home from school.</i>

302
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:35,763
<i>Heck, go see a movie with him on Sunday or something.</i>

303
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,511
<i>Or, why don't you try sports?</i>

304
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,094
<i>Get on one of the teams and
give 'em hell out on the field.</i>

305
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,937
<i>I'm sure you'll make the starting
line up on any varsity team you pick.</i>

306
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,312
I'm going home.

307
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,101
Well, guess I'll head out, too.

308
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,197
Did you read it...?

309
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:58,804
What?

310
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:01,369
Book...

311
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,859
Oh, no I haven't yet.

312
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,820
Do you want me to give it back to you?

313
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,670
That will not be necessary...

314
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:12,277
When Yuki does talk, she has a tendency
to avoid the pitfalls of idle conversation.

315
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:13,804
Please read it today...

316
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,216
As soon as you get home...

317
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,111
All right, I will.

318
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:42,205
Huh! Where're you going now, Kyon?

319
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,092
I'm meeting with someone at the station,
and don't talk with your mouth full.

320
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,592
I'm sorry... Was today the day?

321
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,642
You weren't waiting for me
here last night as well, were you?

322
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,467
Well, why'd you pick this place to meet up?

323
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:08,828
Follow me...

324
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,317
So, uh... Where're your folks?

325
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:33,753
They're not here...

326
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:37,695
Uh... Yeah, I know they're not here right now, but,

327
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,544
did they go somewhere?

328
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,771
Actually, I am the only one who is ever here...

329
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,190
You live by yourself?

330
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:44,958
Yes...

331
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:49,217
So what is it you wanted to see me about?

332
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:54,903
Drink it...

333
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,743
Is it good?

334
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,634
Yeah, thanks.

335
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,943
<i>I'm gonna explode...</i>

336
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:37,900
Okay... You think it's about time you got around to
tell why you wanted me to come all the way out here?

337
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,923
Were you uncomfortable talking to
me at school about it or something?

338
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,431
It's about Haruhi Suzumiya.

339
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:57,071
And, in addition, it is about myself...

340
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,591
That is what I would like to talk about.

341
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:05,740
Okay... You and Suzumiya. So what's up?

342
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:12,072
It is difficult to find the words...

343
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,726
There might be discrepancies in the transmission of data.

344
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:18,676
However, please listen...

345
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:24,822
Haruhi Suzumiya and I are not ordinary human beings...

346
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,914
Yeah, I already sorta figured out
that you two weren't exactly normal.

347
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,344
That's not what I mean...

348
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:36,948
I am not referring to the absence of
universally accepted personality traits.

349
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:42,398
What I mean is literal, in that she and I
are not the same as ordinary human beings.

350
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,512
Human beings such as yourself.

351
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:50,147
I have been created by the data integration
thought entity that supervises this galaxy.

352
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:55,443
I am a humanoid interface designed to
make contact with organic lifeforms like you.

353
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:57,866
Do you understand?

354
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:00,735
Huh...?

355
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,189
To use a common term that is applicable to this situation,

356
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,068
I believe I would be classified as an alien.

357
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,539
An... alien.
