1
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:03,619
<i>It was summer.</i>

2
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:08,492
<i>But with finals looming, my usually chipper
mood was out wandering around Brazil somewhere,</i>

3
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:11,009
<i>and it wasn't coming back any time soon.</i>

4
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:14,864
Hey, Kyon, do you know what today is?

5
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,049
Is it your birthday?

6
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,018
Guess again.

7
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:18,450
Miss Asahina's birthday.

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,391
Wrong!

9
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:21,367
Koizumi or Nagato's birthday?

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,949
I don't even know when those are!

11
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,243
Since we're on the subject, my birthday's on...

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,464
Yeah, whatever!

13
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:30,293
You have absolutely no idea what
an important day today is, do you?

14
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,707
It's just another hot weekday to
me, if you wanna know the truth.

15
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,735
Okay, tell me what today's date is.

16
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,856
It's the seventh of July...

17
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:43,472
Now I get it, you've been talking about
Tanabata this whole time, haven't you?

18
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:45,118
That's what I'm talking about!

19
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:47,977
Today's Tanabata! Come on, you're Japanese!

20
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,994
You have to remember this kinda stuff.

21
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:50,836
My bad.

22
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,542
Every year, I make it a point to
get involved with activities like this.

23
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:58,280
But this year, the SOS Brigade'll
make it the biggest event ever!

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,568
<i>Here we go...</i>

25
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,876
<i>Since the spring, whenever Haruhi
sank her teeth into something,</i>

26
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,357
<i>I'd find myself aimlessly running around.</i>

27
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,105
<i>You could say it'd become my daily routine.</i>

28
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,417
<i>I was getting used to it. And I hated that.</i>

29
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,256
Come in.

30
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:25,709
Hey, guys.

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,018
Oh, hello!

32
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:27,678
Hello!

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,990
How's your day so far?

34
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:32,719
Little crazy, just like every
day since I started high school.

35
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,063
Here.

36
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:35,684
Thanks, I needed that.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,138
Why, you're very welcome.

38
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,577
Wanna try something new?

39
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:41,892
You know, at some point, we're
gonna get bored playing Othello.

40
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,846
Yeah, sorry, but I don't know the rules.

41
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,393
Oh, that's too bad.

42
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,049
You-know-who's come up with another harebrained scheme.

43
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:50,829
This is probably our last chance to relax.

44
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:52,910
Hey-ho!

45
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,432
I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm so late!

46
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:57,191
What's with the weird greeting and that thing?

47
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,780
I found it in the forest!

48
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,830
Then it's considered private property, you bamboo thief.

49
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:06,090
Look, I also made tanzaku, so everyone
has to write their wishes on 'em.

50
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:07,083
Tanzaku?

51
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,238
That's right, today is Tanabata, isn't it?

52
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:11,468
But first, there are conditions!

53
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,952
What conditions? I don't recall
anyone agreeing to anything yet.

54
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:19,455
Hey, Kyon, I bet you don't know who makes
everybody's wishes come true during Tanabata.

55
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,181
Orihime and Hikoboshi?

56
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:23,562
Lucky guess. That's ten points.

57
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,687
But do you know which stars
represent Orihime and Hikoboshi?

58
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:27,450
I don't.

59
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:28,965
It's Vega and Altair.

60
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,533
Correct, sir! That's why you
hang your tanzaku to face them!

61
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:33,774
Eighty-five points!

62
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:36,140
Mind telling us where the other 15 points went?

63
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:37,476
A-hem!

64
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,907
First of all, according to the theory of relativity,

65
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,910
it's not possible to travel
faster than the speed of light.

66
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:48,871
The distance from the Earth to Vega is
25 light-years, and to Altair it's 16.

67
00:02:49,124 --> 00:02:54,591
That means, any information that leaves Earth is going
to take at least that much time to reach those stars!

68
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:57,288
I can't believe you actually researched this stuff.

69
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:01,933
That's why, when you make a wish, it takes
such a long time for the gods to make it come true.

70
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,589
For example, if you wanna have a boyfriend by
this Christmas, he won't show up for you in time.

71
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:08,951
If it takes that long for a wish to go one way,

72
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,685
wouldn't it take 50 or 32 years to make it back?

73
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,930
Yeah, but they're gods, so I'm
sure they have a way to get around it.

74
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,705
Like a half-price summer bargain.

75
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,929
<i>So what happened to the theory of relativity?</i>

76
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:21,783
There's a tanzaku for Vega and one for Altair.

77
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,700
So the trick is to make wishes you'd
want to come true 25 or 16 years from now!

78
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:30,921
<i>How can we know what we'll be
doing 25 or even 16 years from now?</i>

79
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:33,383
<i>What the heck are we supposed to wish for?</i>

80
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,533
She's always coming up with these
irrational activities for us to do.

81
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:41,665
I keep wondering which part of the universe
does she get her idea of "normal" from?

82
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:47,230
Don't be so quick to judge. Despite her actions,
Miss Suzumiya has a firm grasp of what normal is.

83
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:49,042
How can you be so sure about that?

84
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:53,175
Well, for one thing, she wants the world
to be a bit more exciting and unusual,

85
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,384
and she has the power to reshape
the world according to her whims.

86
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,502
Also, the world hasn't lost its rationality yet, has it?

87
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,404
That's how I can be so sure.

88
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,902
Hey, cut out the whispering!

89
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,271
I dunno if she's got the hang of this thing.

90
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,069
I'm afraid mine are a little ordinary.

91
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:17,262
Yeah, that's pathetic.

92
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:17,985
Shut it.

93
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:21,790
That settles it; mine are better than yours.

94
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,373
It's apples and oranges.

95
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,294
Make sure you guys remember the wishes you made today.

96
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:29,290
It's only 16 years till the first batch comes true.

97
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,941
And then we're gonna see who's
wish Hikoboshi grants first!

98
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,523
Sixteen years is a long time, though...

99
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:57,057
<i>After that, Haruhi was strangely
quiet, and dare I say, a bit melancholy.</i>

100
00:04:57,428 --> 00:05:00,718
<i>In a way, the fact she was so
calm was a little... unnerving.</i>

101
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,112
<i>And the quieter she was, the more worried I became.</i>

102
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,089
Would you like me to pour you another cup?

103
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:09,381
Ah. Oh, sure, I'd love one.

104
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:20,615
<i>So cute.</i>

105
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:22,822
<i>Now.</i>

106
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,525
<i>You know I will!</i>

107
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,506
I'm going home...

108
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,736
The last one out should lock the door.

109
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,537
I'll be going, too.

110
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,258
<i>Lucky me, lucky me.</i>

111
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,737
Uh. Hey...

112
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,878
Well, see ya later.

113
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,107
Okay.

114
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:01,095
Thank goodness, I thought they'd never leave us alone.

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,820
Why? Is it something you don't want the others to hear?

116
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,408
Um, yes...

117
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:10,910
There's a... a place I sort of wanna take you to.

118
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,859
Sure, where do you wanna go?

119
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,798
Well, uh...

120
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,054
It's three years ago...

121
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:19,674
<i>Three...</i>

122
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,068
I'm sorry! I know it sounds really strange, but...

123
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,620
Well, will you go?

124
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,853
So, we'd be time traveling, then?

125
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:30,374
Yes, that's right.

126
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,906
I don't have a problem going with you or anything,

127
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:34,701
but why me?

128
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:35,851
What for?

129
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:39,017
I can't say now, but when we get there...

130
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,373
Maybe...

131
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,225
Please don't ask me anything else!

132
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,012
Just say you'll go with me!

133
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,092
Because if you don't go, then I'll...

134
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,202
get in trouble...

135
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:53,162
<i>So cute.</i>

136
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:57,443
Well, uh... Okay, sure, I'll go.

137
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:58,381
Really?!

138
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,401
Thank you!

139
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,581
<i>So cute...</i>

140
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,613
Thank goodness.

141
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,935
<i>Come to think of it, my knowledge of Miss Asahina's
time traveling was based solely upon her word.</i>

142
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:14,194
<i>And the only proof I had was that
I'd met the adult version of her.</i>

143
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:19,733
<i>This was my chance to confirm whether
she was a girl from the future... or not.</i>

144
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,427
Okay, show me the way to your time machine.

145
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,707
We'll leave from here.

146
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,724
From here?

147
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:35,078
Kyon? Sorry.

148
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,375
Oh, you're awake!

149
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:47,542
Ah... I was sort of you'd be waking up soon,

150
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,652
because my legs are getting numb.

151
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,323
Uh, why was I sleeping in your lap?

152
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:05,400
Sorry about that. But I can't let you see
how time travel happens because it's classified.

153
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:08,175
So, uh, are you mad?

154
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:13,746
No, not at all. I mean, if Haruhi tried to do that to me,
I'd probably smack her but since it's you, it's no biggie.

155
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,288
Thank goodness.

156
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:18,018
Are you sure that right now is really three years ago?

157
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,459
July the seventh three years ago.

158
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,069
It's about 9 pm.

159
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,238
You sure about that?

160
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:24,333
Really sure.

161
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:25,795
Yeah...

162
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,211
<i>I know this park...</i>

163
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,122
<i>It's where Nagato told me to meet her that one time.</i>

164
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:35,054
<i>Is this a mecca for weirdos or something?</i>

165
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:40,315
Miss Asahina?

166
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,961
Okay, calm down. Should I...? Should I not...?

167
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,660
Hello, Kyon. It's me.

168
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,813
Miss Asahina!

169
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:05,691
So this was how I looked all asleep and everything.

170
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,787
All she had to do was get you
to come to this point in time.

171
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:17,114
It's going to be my job now
to guide you along from here on.

172
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,936
Okay, but you put her to sleep. How come?

173
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,449
When I was here, I didn't meet the adult version of me.

174
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:25,757
That's why I couldn't let her see me here.

175
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,663
In this time plane, anyway.

176
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,256
If you just follow the railroad
tracks, you'll come to a school.

177
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,458
You're going to have to help
the person you find at the gates.

178
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,310
And, you'll also have to carry
that version of me along with you.

179
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,649
This feels like going on a quest in a game.

180
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,548
After I'm done, do I get something, like a reward?

181
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,193
A reward, huh?

182
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:49,132
Let's see...

183
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:54,241
I'm actually not supposed to give you anything.

184
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:58,325
Although, if you really want to,
you can give that version of me a kiss.

185
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:00,649
But only while she's sleeping, okay?

186
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,314
That's, uh... A little...

187
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,259
<i>Under the circumstances, this goes
completely against my principles.</i>

188
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:08,714
<i>Yeah, well, sort of.</i>

189
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:11,686
That's it. It's time for me to go now.

190
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:15,168
You're going to have to keep
me a secret from her, too, okay?

191
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,208
Promise me.

192
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:18,487
Let's pinky swear.

193
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,070
Now it's official.

194
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:25,540
I'll see you later then, Kyon.

195
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:26,521
Bye-bye.

196
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:35,431
<i>I wonder how much time had passed for the
adult Miss Asahina since the last time I saw her.</i>

197
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,932
<i>I couldn't really tell if she'd
changed that much, if at all.</i>

198
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:42,854
<i>So now I'm starting to wonder,
is this really three years ago?</i>

199
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,124
<i>I need to confirm this somehow.</i>

200
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,715
<i>Maybe I should call information or something.</i>

201
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:50,598
East Junior High...

202
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,045
Hey.

203
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,171
What? Who're you?

204
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:05,801
<i>Okay, now I'm sure I've gone back three years.</i>

205
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,932
<i>That's Haruhi Suzumiya, the seventh grade version.</i>

206
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,283
Are you gonna tell me who you are or what?

207
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,238
Pervert? Kidnapper?

208
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,706
What do you think you're doing over there?

209
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:17,030
Isn't it obvious? Breaking and entering.

210
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:19,508
<i>She's committing a crime, and announcing it.</i>

211
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,809
<i>How am I supposed to react?</i>

212
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,885
I don't know who you are, and I
really don't care, just gimme a hand.

213
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,808
'Cause if you don't, I'll call the cops.

214
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,057
<i>Yup, that's Haruhi, no mistake.</i>

215
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:30,632
This way.

216
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:36,772
<i>Good thing it's dark out. She won't be
able to get a good look at me or Miss Asahina.</i>

217
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,576
<i>Since this Haruhi from three years ago doesn't
remember us, I sort of feel I need to keep it that way.</i>

218
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,444
I got this from the storage room after school and hid it.

219
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:49,851
Pretty smart, huh?

220
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:54,819
I can handle that thing. You go grab the line marker.

221
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,626
Well, whatcha gonna do with this thing?

222
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:02,992
You're gonna draw lines where I tell you.

223
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:03,827
Who, me?

224
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,376
Yeah, that's right, you.

225
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:08,044
I am the supervisor of this project.

226
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,250
Hey, that line's all crooked! What're you doing?!

227
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:17,636
<i>Ordering around a high schooler she just
met without any hesitation is so very Haruhi.</i>

228
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,580
<i>Now, if I had met this girl back
when I was going to junior high,</i>

229
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:24,544
<i>I guarantee I would've thought she was 100% nuts. No joke.</i>

230
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:29,535
<i>So, I ran around and drew white lines on the
ground wherever Haruhi told me to draw them.</i>

231
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:33,170
<i>I remember Taniguchi telling
me about a mysterious message.</i>

232
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,306
<i>Never dreamed I'd be the one who drew it.</i>

233
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:37,945
Yeah, I guess it'll do.

234
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,851
Whatever.

235
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:45,742
So do you think aliens are real, or not?

236
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,089
That's sorta random.

237
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:48,902
Just answer the question.

238
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,391
I guess they are.

239
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,972
And time travelers?

240
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,560
I wouldn't doubt those, either.

241
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:55,054
How about ESPers?

242
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,102
I'm sure they're lurking around every corner.

243
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,342
What about Sliders?

244
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:00,264
I haven't met any of those guys yet.

245
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,810
Is that a North High uniform?

246
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:05,508
Uh-huh.

247
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,115
What's your name anyway?

248
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:08,416
It's John Smith.

249
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,727
You're such a dork.

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,150
Let's just say I wanna remain anonymous.

251
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:15,048
Who's the girl you were carrying?

252
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,277
She's my big sister,

253
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,880
and she has these sudden fits of narcolepsy.

254
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:22,571
She just falls asleep wherever,
so I have to carry her sometimes.

255
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,076
Anyway, what's that thing supposed to be?

256
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,602
What do ya think it looks like? It's a message.

257
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,201
A message for Orihime or Hikoboshi, right?

258
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,977
Okay, how'd you know that?

259
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:38,064
Well, it is Tanabata. And I remembered
someone I know doing something similar once.

260
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,926
Oh, yeah? I'd love to meet someone like that.

261
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,936
Does that person go to North High, too?

262
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:43,651
Sort of.

263
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:46,590
Hm... North High...

264
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,004
I'm done. I'm goin' home now.

265
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,053
See ya!

266
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:58,522
<i>She didn't even thank me for helping her. Typical.</i>

267
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,169
Miss Asahina?

268
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,621
Yes... class...

269
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:09,457
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where am I?! What
happened, and when is it right now?!

270
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,334
Well...

271
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,393
I don't have my TPDD anymore!

272
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,760
I don't have it!

273
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,847
What's wrong? What's a TPDD, anyway?

274
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:29,836
It's classified, but, it's sort of like a time machine...

275
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,191
Where do you think it could've gone?

276
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:36,998
I don't know! I should have it, but I-I lost it!

277
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:40,211
Is there anybody who could come pick us up?

278
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,696
There isn't!

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,222
Okay, so what's gonna happen to us then?

280
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,193
We're stuck.

281
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,236
We're stuck in this time plane three
years in the past with no way of getting home,

282
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,602
and we can't get back to our time!

283
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,407
That sounds pretty serious.

284
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,411
Super serious...

285
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:01,319
<i>For some reason, I wasn't too
concerned about our situation.</i>

286
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,089
<i>That TPDD thing was probably
taken by the adult Miss Asahina.</i>

287
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,707
<i>In fact, that's probably why she was here.</i>

288
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:13,074
<i>To make sure this version of her
actually lost the TPDD thingamajig...</i>

289
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:20,379
Everything's gonna be okay.

290
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,775
Does a Miss Yuki Nagato live here?

291
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,715
I'm not really sure how to say
what I'm about to say, but...

292
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:47,188
What if I told you that I'm an
acquaintance of Haruhi Suzumiya?

293
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:58,324
Howdy.

294
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:01,525
Is it okay if we come in?

295
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:04,863
That's pretty much it.

296
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,306
Now you know who we are and why we're here.

297
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:10,695
Oh, and the you from three
years in the future gave me this.

298
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:19,508
Understood.

299
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:23,639
As for as everything goes, this is the
first time you've met the two of us, right?

300
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes, I have accessed the memory
of the unit in the other time plane,

301
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:31,804
and I have downloaded the data from the
opposite side of the linked-time boundary.

302
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:35,653
The unit that exists three years
from now and I are the same being.

303
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,389
As such, we have access to each other's memories.

304
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,773
Our memories are shared.

305
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:40,702
Really? How?

306
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:41,685
We synched.

307
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,395
Wait, I don't understand.

308
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,781
Why are you wearing a North High uniform?

309
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,155
Have you enrolled already?

310
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,177
Not yet. I am currently in standby mode.

311
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,845
What?

312
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,597
So you're gonna be in standby mode for three years?

313
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:01,597
Yes.

314
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:04,414
That's a really long time to be in standby mode.

315
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:05,863
It is my role.

316
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:11,934
There is more than one way to travel through time.

317
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,525
The TPDD is not the only device that can do it.

318
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,993
It is imperfect.

319
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,902
But, um... How is it imperfect?

320
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:23,248
When an organic life form uses the TPDD,

321
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,984
the movement created by the event causes noise.

322
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,684
We believe it is imperfect and primitive.

323
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:31,557
By "we", you mean that thought entity-thing.

324
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:35,609
So, Miss Nagato, when you travel
through time, you can do it perfectly?

325
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,483
Perfection does not matter.

326
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,272
As long as data can travel unobstructed.

327
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:55,340
D-Do you want us to sleep in here?

328
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:56,802
Us? Together?

329
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,560
Yes.

330
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,243
Me and Miss Asahina...

331
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,092
Yes.

332
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,169
Lie down.

333
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:02,941
Just like that?!

334
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:03,855
Just sleep.

335
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,815
<i>I wouldn't have it any other way, however...</i>

336
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:11,546
I guess we don't have any other choice, do we?

337
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:47,133
No way!

338
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,812
Are you okay? What's that? The TPDD?

339
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:53,967
No, it's not. It's just my radio wave watch.

340
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,561
We're back in our time, thank goodness.

341
00:18:56,796 --> 00:19:00,473
It's just after 9:30, July the seventh, the day we left.

342
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,023
How did you do it?

343
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:08,279
I suspended the flow of data inside this time-space.

344
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:12,102
Then I released it at a pre-determined
point in the time-space continuum.

345
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,228
You mean you actually stopped time?!

346
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:19,572
Miss Nagato's saying she stopped
time in this room for the past 3 years.

347
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,366
And when today came around, she started time up again.

348
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:24,797
That right?

349
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,868
Yes.

350
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:27,526
I can't believe it.

351
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,247
If that's true, then that means...

352
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,934
On the night when I came over, and
you told me you were an alien and stuff,

353
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,526
Miss Asahina and I were asleep in
this room together the whole time?!

354
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,283
Yes.

355
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:43,382
I was always impressed at how amazing you could be,

356
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,999
but I didn't know you are omnipotent.

357
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,310
I am not. This was a special case. Emergency mode.

358
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:53,476
Seldom activated unless necessary.

359
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:55,577
Thank you.

360
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:56,706
You're welcome.

361
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,768
Before we go, could you tell me what this says?

362
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:10,569
"I am right here," is what is says.

363
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:17,758
Hold on a second, are you telling me that this thing
is written in a language used by aliens or something?

364
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,336
<i>Nagato didn't answer me.</i>

365
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,958
I'm sorry, it's just that...

366
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:29,657
I-I don't really know too much.

367
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:33,686
I'm just an assistant. No, an intern.

368
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:36,987
Wait, no, I mean I'm kind of like a trainee.

369
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,002
But even so, you get to stay pretty close to Haruhi.

370
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,452
That's because Miss Suzumiya caught me.

371
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,502
I never expected something like that to happen.

372
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:53,361
I'm just following the orders given by my superiors.

373
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,693
Or, what's another term? The people in charge?

374
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:03,044
I just follow orders, that's why sometimes I
don't understand the things I'm supposed to do.

375
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,084
<i>I wonder if the grown up Miss
Asahina is one of her superiors.</i>

376
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,956
<i>If that's the case, then the adult Miss
Asahina knows how things'll turn out for us.</i>

377
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,921
<i>But for some reason, she didn't tell
this Miss Asahina anything about it.</i>

378
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,995
<i>Oh well, I guess people from the
future have their own way of doing things.</i>

379
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:26,205
<i>Maybe when stuff starts falling into
place, someone will explain everything to her.</i>

380
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:31,131
<i>Of course, the next day was July the 8th.</i>

381
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,435
<i>And even though I knew it was the next day.</i>

382
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:37,865
<i>In reality, it had been three years
and one day since I'd been back to school.</i>

383
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:45,459
What's wrong? You eat a poisonous mushroom or something?

384
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:48,085
No, just thinkin' about some stuff.

385
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:51,383
I remembered something about Tanabata from a while ago.

386
00:21:53,197 --> 00:21:53,793
Really?

387
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:56,776
Hey, Nagato,

388
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:59,202
Miss Asahina's really from the future, right?

389
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,167
Yes.

390
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:04,299
Yeah, well, something about the process of time
travel and how the past and future are linked...

391
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,807
... seems a little off to me.

392
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,912
What do you mean?

393
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:11,241
Miss Asahina told me once that there's no
connection between the past and the future.

394
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:16,649
So, I go back three years, bump into Haruhi, and
tell her some stuff that I didn't think was important.

395
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,824
But there's a chance that what I told her is
the reason she decided on coming to North High,

396
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:23,005
and why she began looking for people...

397
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:25,136
who weren't normal.

398
00:22:27,238 --> 00:22:30,148
So there has to be a link between
the past and the future, right?

399
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,893
Even though it contradicts what Miss Asahina said.

400
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:38,481
A theory that is contradictory in itself cannot
begin to explain the contradictions inherent within it.

401
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:43,018
If that was supposed to be an explanation,
I didn't understand a word of it.

402
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,523
One day, you will.

403
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,536
This is what she means.

404
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:56,191
Using our game as an example, notice
that my King is in check by your Rook.

405
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,843
"This is terrible!

406
00:22:57,922 --> 00:22:59,525
Oh, I think I'll run away."

407
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,480
See that? Can you tell me what was
contradictory about what I just did?

408
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:11,575
Of course, as far as our little group
is concerned, the King isn't so important.

409
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:15,102
To everyone here, the only thing
that really matters is the Queen.

410
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,081
Yeah, whatever.

411
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:19,516
I don't know what's gonna happen
to us next, but whatever it is,

412
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,345
I want it to be something that
doesn't require as much thinking.

413
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,643
I'd love it if things stayed nice and quiet.

414
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,080
But you would prefer it if something happened?

415
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:31,927
Jerk.
