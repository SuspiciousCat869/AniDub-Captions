1
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,012
<i>Something's wrong... That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

2
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,642
<i>I didn't care about the baseball game on TV;</i>

3
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,573
<i>it was between schools from another town.</i>

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,821
<i>But because I tend to sympathize with
underdogs, I ended up rooting for the losing team.</i>

5
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:37,590
<i>And it was right about then, that I
suddenly got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

6
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:43,055
<i>What the heck does she want?</i>

7
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,918
Hey, your phone's ringing, Kyon.

8
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:47,273
Yeah, I know that. You don't have to tell me.

9
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,751
Hey, you're free, right? Good.

10
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,544
Meet us at 2:00 in front of the station.

11
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:56,695
And don't be late!

12
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,032
<i>I didn't even have a chance to say anything.</i>

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,854
Yeah, what?

14
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,071
I forgot to tell you, make sure and
bring your swim trunks and some money, too.

15
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,523
Oh, and your bike. Definitely bring your bike.

16
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,146
That's it. Over and out!

17
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:19,882
<i>Weird... It was like I knew what
Haruhi was gonna say before she said it.</i>

18
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,599
<i>Yeah... No...</i>

19
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:27,451
<i>Actually, it felt like we'd had the
exact same conversation once before.</i>

20
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,539
<i> Kinda like déjà vu or something.</i>

21
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,738
<i>Summer's almost over...</i>

22
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:15,315
You are late, Kyon!

23
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,002
Where's your motivation?

24
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,092
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:22,141
Now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

27
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:22,713
Where?

28
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,136
To the public swimming pool! Where do ya think?

29
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,646
<i>That figures... considering the stuff I brought.</i>

30
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:30,936
We've got lots of summer vacation-y
things to do during our break!

31
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,840
But we've only so much time because
once it's gone, it's gone for good!

32
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:39,023
We'll do everything we can, while we can
during our only summer as tenth graders!

33
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,764
And for starters, we're gonna ride the bikes to the pool!

34
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,165
Did... everyone ride bikes today?

35
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:48,163
No, the only bikes we have to take
are the ones you and I brought with us.

36
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:48,752
Huh?

37
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,591
Kyon, you better not let Koizumi beat you!

38
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,041
Come on! Full speed ahead!

39
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:57,121
Well, here we are. Hurry up and park the bikes!

40
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:00,594
We're trying to have fun, Kyon, so stop acting tired!

41
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,130
And whose fault is that, huh?!

42
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,459
Aah, can you smell the chlorine?

43
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,507
That really makes it feel like summer!

44
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:08,731
<i>Crowded...</i>

45
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,503
Here's the plan, you go dump our stuff
somewhere, and then meet us in the pool.

46
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:16,039
We're gonna have a little race.
Come on, Mikuru, you and me!

47
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,610
Hurry up and get in, guys!

48
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,257
The water's warm! It's perfect!

49
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,111
<i>Can't she see the "no diving" signs? They're everywhere!</i>

50
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:28,427
Doesn't that look like fun?

51
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,563
It's such a peaceful looking scene, isn't it?

52
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:32,507
And in a way, it makes me smile.

53
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:38,800
I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya enjoy the day in a normal
fashion. It's a rather charming sight, don't you think?

54
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,840
She called me, told me what to bring,

55
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,550
and then ordered me to meet her without
telling me anything about what was going on.

56
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,682
That isn't charming or normal.

57
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:50,861
Well, if you ask me, none of that
is anything to make such a fuss over.

58
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:54,031
And as long as Miss Suzumiya's
laughing and having a good time,

59
00:04:54,124 --> 00:04:57,835
we don't have to worry about any
earth-shattering events happening any time soon.

60
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,203
I hope you're right.

61
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:01,922
All right!

62
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:03,717
What?

63
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,574
Nothing. It's just my imagination.

64
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,150
With everything that's happened since we met,

65
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:11,619
you could say I've become a little bit paranoid.

66
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:24,991
Here you go!

67
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:26,840
Oh, thanks for making the tea.

68
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,877
Oh, it's delicious!

69
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:34,109
Come on, let's go swim some more!

70
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,022
<i>Geez...</i>

71
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,633
<i>Now I know why they call it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

72
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,783
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

73
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,605
I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.

74
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:48,916
Huh?

75
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,073
<i>There's that feeling again...</i>

76
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,368
<i>It's like I've seen this happen before,</i>

77
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,940
<i>with Nagato sitting there like that, looking bored.</i>

78
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,408
Kyon!

79
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,548
<i>Yeah... And then Haruhi shows up, and says...</i>

80
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,648
These guys are my brigade members.

81
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:05,703
They do what I say.

82
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,675
So if you want something, ask them!

83
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,259
Time for some fun!

84
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,257
Let's play water soccer!

85
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,720
Uh. Yeah, sure...

86
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,843
<i>Oh, well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

87
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,876
<i>Get ready, Mikuru, surf's up!</i>

88
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:29,678
I've been thinking about some fun things we could do.

89
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,494
What's that thing?

90
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:35,673
I came up with this schedule of how we're
gonna spend the rest of our summer vacation!

91
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,198
I realized something...

92
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:40,535
We've only got two more weeks
of summer vacation left to go!

93
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,684
That fact totally blew me away.

94
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,465
I know we've done a lot of cool things
so far, but we've only so much time,

95
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:49,285
and there's a bazillion more things left for us to do!

96
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:51,275
So, we're gonna pick up the pace!

97
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:52,983
<i>Two weeks to do all that?!</i>

98
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,641
Mikuru, is there anything else you wanna do?

99
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,240
Huh?

100
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:00,275
Uh... I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

101
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,203
Okay!

102
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,397
Goldfish scooping, it is...

103
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,462
Could I see that for a moment?

104
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:11,981
Thank you.

105
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:16,072
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

106
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,094
Oh, I could check around for one.

107
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,571
That'd be awesome.

108
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:21,747
Okay, tomorrow, we start the list.

109
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:23,828
And I guess that's it for today.

110
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,520
Nagato!

111
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,804
Hey, it's nothing important or anything, but...

112
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,007
I was just wondering...

113
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,577
Is everything okay with you?

114
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,227
It is.

115
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,345
Uh... Great, that's good to hear.

116
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,562
Yes.

117
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,384
<i>What the heck?</i>

118
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,418
<i>Why'd I want to talk to her?</i>

119
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:06,829
I guess that's it.

120
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:16,417
<i>The next morning, I was wakened from my
peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.</i>

121
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,026
<i>She said they'd found a bon festival.</i>

122
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,357
We're all gonna go buy yukatas.

123
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,193
I guess Yuki doesn't have one, and neither does Mikuru.

124
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,786
And I don't have one either,

125
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,516
but I know a place that sells
them in sets for really cheap.

126
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:33,489
<i>So, we went to a clothing outlet, and Haruhi
picked out yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato.</i>

127
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:36,136
<i>Then, she marched them straight into the changing rooms.</i>

128
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,621
<i>After about an hour... they emerged.</i>

129
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,240
<i>Whoa! Blinding!</i>

130
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:43,037
The three of you look absolutely wonderful in them.

131
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,348
Well, of course we do!

132
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:47,398
I picked them out myself, especially Mikuru's!

133
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,250
Look at you, you're so cute!

134
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,371
I'm a genius!

135
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,388
Oh? Uh, yeah!

136
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,560
<i>Miss Asahina... Aah!</i>

137
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,230
Wow!

138
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,786
They've got goldfish scooping, just like you wanted!

139
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,573
I bet you're gonna catch a ton!

140
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,498
<i>A bon festival, huh?</i>

141
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,967
<i>It figures that it'd be so crowded...</i>

142
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,847
<i>I haven't been to a bon festival in a while,</i>

143
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,912
<i>but it feels like I just went to one.</i>

144
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,777
<i>That tower... Those vendors...</i>

145
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,423
Do you wanna go scoop some fish?

146
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,939
We could have a little contest.

147
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:26,354
Leave it to the expert!

148
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,245
Mm, I'll pass.

149
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,161
How 'bout you, Nagato? Do you wanna go get some food?

150
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:42,092
Don't tell me you're actually into this stuff.

151
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:44,407
I got it.

152
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:45,578
No.

153
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,224
That one.

154
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,408
It's yours for 800 yen!

155
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,328
<i>I wish she would've let me buy that for her.</i>

156
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,375
<i>It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.</i>

157
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,693
What an unbelievable haul!

158
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,497
I caught thirteen! But, I only kept one 'cause
I don't have any place to put all those fish.

159
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,142
I gave another one to Mikuru!

160
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,529
Go ahead and have one, but only one!

161
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,177
Okay, thanks.

162
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,320
Hey, Yuki, what's up with the mask you got there?

163
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,748
I bought it.

164
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:24,849
Oh... Okay.

165
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,464
Anyway, let's go shoot up fireworks!

166
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:29,590
We'll end the day with a firework show!

167
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:32,335
<i>Do you even understand the
meaning of the word "moderation"?!</i>

168
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:38,292
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

169
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:41,292
<i>And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

170
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,910
<i>But the truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

171
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,626
Tomorrow, we're catchin' bugs.

172
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,072
Hey, Haruhi, I don't want to spoil your fun,

173
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:52,256
but have you finished your homework?

174
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:55,815
Are you kidding? That stuff's easy.
You can finish it in like three days.

175
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,945
<i>Three days?!</i>

176
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,183
You have to get rid of that junk first,
so you can spend the rest of your summer

177
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,165
having fun and not worrying about it!

178
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,741
It's the only way to get the most out of your vacation!

179
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,912
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

180
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:11,102
<i>The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.</i>

181
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:14,398
Kay, listen up! We're gonna go bug-catching tomorrow!

182
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,135
And whoever catches the most bugs is gonna get...

183
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:22,003
Lemme see... I know! They'll get
to be brigade leader for a whole day!

184
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:22,773
<i>No thanks!</i>

185
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,450
That sounds like a lot of fun!

186
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,707
But, can we catch just any random bug?

187
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:30,858
Um... No, wait... Only cicadas!

188
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:35,000
That's it, I'm calling it the SOS
Brigade's cicada catching contest!

189
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,017
<i>The next day was beautiful, sunny, and bright.</i>

190
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:42,754
<i>In fact, it was the perfect day for us to
have our SOS Brigade's cicada catching contest.</i>

191
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,857
<i>And even though everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,</i>

192
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,924
<i>the winner of the contest ended up being...</i>

193
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,677
<i>You guessed it, Haruhi.</i>

194
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:53,540
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

195
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:57,741
I mean, if we let 'em go this time,
they might come back and return the favor!

196
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,733
<i>What could a cicada do for me, even if it did come back?</i>

197
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:08,266
<i>I sorta feel like Pandora, when she opened her box.</i>

198
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:14,158
W-Welcome to our store!

199
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:18,309
<i>We met the next day, even though we
had absolutely no idea what was going on.</i>

200
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:21,456
<i>Our confusion continued as we
stood outside the local supermarket,</i>

201
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,826
<i>wearing frog costumes and handing out balloons.</i>

202
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,522
<i>Hey, it's a living.</i>

203
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:33,221
I feel like I just escaped the Adzam's leader beam.

204
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,297
You guys did an awesome job!

205
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,573
<i>What's with the special treatment?</i>

206
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,117
You guys are the best!

207
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:44,770
The manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

208
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:47,979
Who cares how grateful he is? What about our pay?

209
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:49,862
That's it!

210
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:51,207
Huh?

211
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,284
I've had my eye on this little guy for a long time now.

212
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,660
The manager gave it to us 'cause
Mikuru looks so darn cute in it!

213
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,630
<i>We worked in the sun, sweat pouring down our foreheads...</i>

214
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:01,329
<i>...for that?!</i>

215
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,766
We'll keep him in the club room as a souvenir.

216
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,402
And Mikuru, you can wear him whenever you want.

217
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:07,391
Help yourself!

218
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,330
You have my permission, 'kay?

219
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,288
<i>Later that night...</i>

220
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:21,061
<i>My peaceful slumber was interrupted by a phone call.</i>

221
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:25,540
Kyon...

222
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:27,214
Miss Asahina?

223
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,899
Yes... It's me...

224
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,713
Something... really bad...

225
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:34,507
What's wrong?

226
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:35,864
Hello, it's Koizumi.

227
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,256
What are you doing with Miss Asahina at this hour?!

228
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,012
We have a situation here.

229
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,055
Is it possible for you to come meet us right now?

230
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,538
Miss Asahina! What happened? Are you okay?

231
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,314
It's terrible... I can't...

232
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,754
I can't go back to the future anymore!

233
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,895
I'll try to explain it the best I can.

234
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,201
We're stuck in a time loop that, as
far as I can tell, seems to have no end.

235
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:12,613
It's hard to believe that you're serious
with you standing there, smiling like that.

236
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,022
Come on.

237
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:17,010
Koizumi, do you have any idea what you just said?

238
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:21,004
Of course, I do. Much more than I want to, believe me.

239
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:24,222
In fact, I was having a word with Miss Asahina earlier.

240
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,009
<i>Call me when you have a word with her!</i>

241
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:31,472
It's like this, we came to the conclusion that something
seemed a little off about the current flow of time.

242
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,822
Well, actually, it was Miss Asahina who discovered it.

243
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,523
And thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

244
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,859
What suspicions?

245
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:41,043
That we've become stuck in a time loop.

246
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:44,190
We're re-living the same period
of time, over and over again.

247
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,020
I know; you already said that.

248
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:50,884
We're being forced to repeat every day
between August the 17th through the 31st.

249
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:55,135
In other words, we're in the middle of
what seems to be an endless summer vacation.

250
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:57,561
Well, at least it's summer vacation, right?

251
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,909
It's a never-ending, endless summer vacation.

252
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:05,628
In the world we're in now, the
future doesn't exist anymore.

253
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,887
All time stops at September the 1st.

254
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,848
That's the reason Miss Asahina can't travel to the future.

255
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:13,485
It's only natural.

256
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,953
Look, there's nothing natural about not having a future.

257
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,959
And who's gonna believe such a thing?

258
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,609
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

259
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,991
For what it's worth, I can try to explain it, too.

260
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:30,971
Here goes...

261
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,777
Because I have to classified information,

262
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:38,186
I have to use classified
information to contact the future.

263
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,337
The thing is, for a week now, I haven't gotten any...

264
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:45,894
...classified information.

265
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,889
That's kind of weird.

266
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:53,689
I was so surprised that I... classified information.

267
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,625
I did, but it was classified information.

268
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:02,033
And now, I don't know... what to do...

269
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:06,685
<i>I don't know how to help you, but I'm wondering...</i>

270
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:11,743
<i>Are all the classified information things
you're talking about stuff you can't say on TV?</i>

271
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:15,857
What about those closed spaces
you were talking about before?

272
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:17,527
Do you think it could be one of those?

273
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,188
No, it isn't one of those.

274
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:23,759
What happened is that a specific
section of time has been torn away.

275
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:26,390
At exactly midnight on August the 31st,

276
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,554
everything as we know it, is reset.

277
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,415
Then time loops back on itself,

278
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,729
back to the morning of August the 17th.

279
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,120
That's the process.

280
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,675
Then what about our...

281
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:40,551
Wait, what about the whole world's memories?

282
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,993
Those get reset as well.

283
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,814
Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning.

284
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,699
Perfect, another problem involving time.

285
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:51,944
But I guess that's to be expected
when there's a time traveler around, huh?

286
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,148
Oh, no, Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

287
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,932
Okay then, what's causing it?

288
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,182
It's Miss Suzumiya.

289
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,506
I'm sure she doesn't even realize it though.

290
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,174
But I do think that deep down inside herself,

291
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:08,162
she'd prefer it if summer vacation would last forever.

292
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,292
You're kidding me!

293
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,345
You mean she still hasn't had enough fun?

294
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,625
That's what I think.

295
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:17,167
Perhaps she feels there's something else that
has to happen before our summer vacation can end.

296
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:24,802
<i>Oh, man... The trouble she gets
us into is always galactic in scale.</i>

297
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,368
Right, what do you want me to do about it?

298
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:30,610
If I knew that, we would have this problem solved by now.

299
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,357
You sure seem like you're enjoying this an awful lot,

300
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:34,180
what's up?

301
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,856
Please don't take that the wrong way.

302
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:39,673
But, this explains the feelings
of déjà vu I've been having.

303
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:41,616
And the ones you've been having as well.

304
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,496
And now that I think about it,

305
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,460
those feelings were probably the residue of our
memories from all the instances where time was reset.

306
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:50,646
Are we the only ones?

307
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,852
Or can other people feel this happening, too?

308
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,489
It doesn't seem that way.

309
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,484
But then again, you and I are exceptions to the rule.

310
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:00,398
The only people who can sense this strange thing happening

311
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:02,811
are the ones who are closest to Miss Suzumiya.

312
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,356
But what about Haruhi?

313
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,882
Do you think she has any idea what's been going on?

314
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,842
No, I don't think she knows about it.

315
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:12,045
Besides, it would be very bad for us if she did.

316
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,715
Although...

317
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:17,308
There is someone else who isn't
affected by feelings of déjà vu.

318
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:21,964
As a matter of fact, this person remembers
everything that's happened since this whole thing started.

319
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,025
Stop holding out on me. Who is it?

320
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,072
You already know who it is.

321
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,432
It's Miss Nagato.

322
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,323
The thought entity transcends space and time,

323
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:34,047
and so does she.

324
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:35,954
Is that really true?

325
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,168
It is.

326
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:39,251
Then you can remember everything.

327
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:40,665
I can.

328
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:44,368
So then, do you know how many times
this has happened to us up till now?

329
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,807
This would be 15, 524 times so far.

330
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,487
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-four?</i>

331
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,520
<i>What do you mean 15,524?</i>

332
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:58,024
<i>Nagato... What are you saying?</i>

333
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,405
You're completely serious about that?

334
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:02,628
I am.

335
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:07,995
So what you're telling me is that we've done
the exact same things, every time, that many times?

336
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,235
Not necessarily.

337
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:21,796
Throughout 15,524 repetitions, we did not attend a
bon festival the 2,391st time and the 11,054th time.

338
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:28,467
We went to a bon festival but did not
go to a goldfish scooping booth 437 times.

339
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,350
We obtained part-time jobs...

340
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,033
Okay! I got it...

341
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:38,978
<i>Fifteen thousand five-hundred twenty-fourtimes...</i>

342
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,394
<i>That's what she said.</i>

343
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:46,271
<i>Times two weeks... That's, uh... about... 595 years!</i>

344
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,325
<i>And she's the only one who remembers
everything we did all those times.</i>

345
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,259
<i>She's been repeating them, over and over.</i>

346
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,160
<i>Nagato...</i>

347
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:59,102
<i>What's it like to re-live the same things that many times?</i>

348
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:03,831
<i>That, has gotta be the craziest story ever.</i>

349
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:07,291
<i>The next night, we went stargazing.</i>

350
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,502
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's apartment.</i>

351
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,632
<i>And Koizumi brought the telescope.</i>

352
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:16,018
Oh... I'm bored.

353
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,090
I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

354
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,459
I wish I knew what else she wants to do.

355
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,393
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

356
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,973
I think I just might have an idea though.

357
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,792
What if someone were to grab Miss Suzumiya from behind,

358
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,746
and then whispered, "I love you," right into her ear?

359
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,492
And who's gonna be doing this?!

360
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,382
Who else could play that role, other than you?

361
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,318
Yeah, I knew you were gonna say that.

362
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:52,749
Like hell.

363
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,302
All right, how 'bout if I give it a try?

364
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:00,258
Of course, I'm only kidding.

365
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,798
<i>Anyway, the next day, we went to the batting cages.</i>

366
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,645
Hey, Nagato...

367
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:17,755
You knew about this time loop
thing before Miss Asahina, didn't you?

368
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:18,461
Yes.

369
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,880
So how come you didn't say anything about it?

370
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,019
My function is to observe only.

371
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,408
All right!

372
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:35,849
I win again, losers!

373
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:43,858
Yay!

374
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,675
More time!

375
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,854
I guess that's it. We've done everything on our list.

376
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:55,530
Hmm... But now I'm wondering if we did enough.

377
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,231
Hmm... Oh, well. That's good.

378
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,956
Unless there's something else you guys wanna do?

379
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,687
Oh, okay then.

380
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:13,504
We did everything we set out to do this
summer, so I guess that's good enough.

381
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,315
No, it's not.

382
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:17,467
You're still not satisfied.

383
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:20,023
Okay, guys, we're done for today.

384
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,204
I set tomorrow aside just in case,
but I guess you can take the day off now.

385
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,293
I'll see you all at the club room on Monday!

386
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:31,680
<i>Wait, Haruhi.</i>

387
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,159
<i>There's that feeling again...</i>

388
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:39,685
<i>It's strong, stronger than all the others.</i>

389
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:41,734
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave.</i>

390
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:44,078
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

391
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:49,089
<i>we'll end up re-living the past two weeks
again and again for a thousand more times!</i>

392
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,858
<i>But, what should I do? What should I say?</i>

393
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,963
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

394
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,976
<i>I don't know... I can't... remember...</i>

395
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:12,802
<i>It's August the 31st,</i>

396
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:15,135
<i>and I still haven't touched my homework yet.</i>

397
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,431
<i>Whatever... It doesn't matter anymore.</i>

398
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:23,763
<i>There's no point in doing it. I mean, we're just
gonna keep re-living the last couple of weeks, right?</i>

399
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,768
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

400
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,730
<i>a different version of me will just have to deal with it.</i>
