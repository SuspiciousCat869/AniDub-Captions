1
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:02,670
I know of one.

2
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:04,062
<i>And with that,</i>

3
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,816
<i>Nagato took us to a spot behind her apartment building.</i>

4
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:13,524
Oh, look. They're not afraid of us.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,460
Let's see, where's a black cat?

6
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:24,132
Oh, well, then.

7
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:25,444
<i>This guy's just as good.</i>

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,219
She changed the concept again!

9
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:30,185
He's not exactly a black cat,
but he's better than nothin'!

10
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,071
Okay, Yuki. This is your brand new familiar.

11
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:35,833
I know you'll be good friends.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,676
<i>We started shooting again.</i>

13
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>Looks like it doesn't matter where we shoot anymore.</i>

14
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:50,310
Attack Mikuru with your weird powers!

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,417
Accept your fate.

16
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:57,290
Cut it! That's nice!

17
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:00,290
Wouldn't it be cool if the cat could talk?

18
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:02,752
I mean, he is a witch's cat, after all.

19
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,860
He should make some snide remarks or somethin'.

20
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:05,906
<i>That's absurd!</i>

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,257
I think I'm gonna call you Shamisen.

22
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:11,165
Come on, Shamisen, say something!

23
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:12,882
<i>He's not gonna talk...</i>

24
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,922
<i>Oh, please, cat! Don't talk!</i>

25
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,685
<i>Wait, "Shamisen"?</i>

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,345
We got some good stuff today.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,315
Kyon, you're gonna be responsible for that cat.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,427
Take him home tonight, and teach
him a coupla tricks by tomorrow.

29
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,969
Something simple like, I dunno,
like jumping through a ring of fire!

30
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:33,369
Well, that's a wrap for today, everyone!

31
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:36,277
We're gonna be shootin' the big climax tomorrow!

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,385
The footage looks great, and
everybody's doin' an awesome job!

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,768
Get some rest and we'll hit it hard tomorrow!

34
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:56,420
Good work today.

35
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,753
I'll go buy you some cat food later.

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,830
Or maybe some dried sardines.

37
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,600
Either one's okay with me.

38
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,076
Hey, Nagato, was that you just now?

39
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,269
I was actually talking to the cat.

40
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,585
Well, you asked me a question, didn't cha?

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,995
That's why I answered.

42
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,484
Did I say something wrong? Or
were ya speakin' to someone else?

43
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,187
Japanese Bobtail... Quite the surprise, isn't it?

44
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,964
That's probably the last thing you should be surprised by.

45
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,473
That's amazing!

46
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,118
I never thought I'd see a talking cat.

47
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:36,385
I don't understand why everyone
here is so surprised that I'm talking.

48
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,177
<i>He's a mutant cat... No, a cat monster!</i>

49
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,127
But looking at it from your perspective,

50
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:45,829
I can see how the sounds I'm making
might seem like human speech to you people.

51
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,077
And if that's the case,

52
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:51,766
how can you be sure that the sounds coming out of
me mean the same as the words you think I'm saying?

53
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,493
It might be gibberish, you know?

54
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,552
But the fact that you're answering my
questions is proof you understand what I'm saying.

55
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:02,255
Look, it's possible that these sounds only
happen to seem like answers to your questions.

56
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,969
Just because I reply to you doesn't
mean I know what I'm talkin' about.

57
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,243
So basically what you're saying is
that even if two people are talking,

58
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,643
it doesn't mean they're actually having a conversation.

59
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:12,894
You know, that's true.

60
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:17,425
Even if two people are in a conversation
and believe they understand each other,

61
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,990
there's no guarantee they're truly expressing
the ideas behind the words they're using.

62
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:23,484
He's right.

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,644
People can say one thing and mean another.

64
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,827
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

65
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,738
The cat does bring up a good point though, doesn't he?

66
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:34,177
<i>I'm sorry, but do you think you could stop talking, too?</i>

67
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,389
As it stands right now, the situation is pretty bad.

68
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:44,434
It seems we've underestimated
Miss Suzumiya's abilities yet again.

69
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,270
Sorry, I don't think I understand.

70
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:55,239
There's a chance the reality of the movie might very
well become the new day-to-day reality of this world.

71
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:57,485
If Miss Suzumiya says to herself,

72
00:03:57,534 --> 00:04:00,245
"I'd like to shoot a scene where a giant meteor crashes,"

73
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:01,937
it might actually happen.

74
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:06,744
What are we gonna do?

75
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,923
We have to keep her from using her
imagination from destroying our world.

76
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:15,753
As it is right now, she's unconsciously
confusing what's real with what's not real.

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,225
It's hard to stop her when she's on a roll.

78
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,413
Miss Suzumiya's strange powers...

79
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:23,872
...are being filtered and given life
through the world of the movie she's making.

80
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:26,360
If we want to prevent anything bad from happening,

81
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:29,450
we have to figure out how to make
her accept that it's all fiction.

82
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:33,328
Then, we have to help her turn the story
around into something more reasonable.

83
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:36,618
That's great, but how are we
gonna explain a talking cat to her?

84
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:39,358
I really don't think we should explain anything to her.

85
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:44,354
If we did that, we'd find ourselves in a new reality
where every single cat would suddenly be able to talk.

86
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:47,760
But you see, something like
that isn't possible in our world.

87
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,036
What about the fact that you guys are here?

88
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:51,314
True.

89
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,628
The three of us wouldn't be sitting here with you
if it weren't for Miss Suzumiya and her abilities.

90
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,559
The same goes for the talking cat.

91
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,260
Can't we do something about this?

92
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:04,094
If this were a fantasy world, you wouldn't
need explanations for all the phenomena around us.

93
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:07,235
But if we tell her that talking
cats and Mikuru Beams exist,

94
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,635
then the reality of this world will change.

95
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,653
Do you understand what that means?

96
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,624
The reality of our current world would suddenly change.

97
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,719
It would turn into a place where
supernatural phenomena exist and are the norm.

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,295
So what are we gonna do?

99
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,902
We just have to find a suitable ending to the movie...

100
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:25,268
One that Miss Suzumiya will accept, of course.

101
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,751
Sure, if one exists.

102
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,802
Well, actually, there is one type of ending that can
take any nonsensical plot and turn it into something...

103
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,260
that makes perfect sense to an audience.

104
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,682
Well? What is it?

105
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,127
"It was a dream."

106
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,055
No joke, that was the ending I was talking about.

107
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,237
Do you honestly think Haruhi's gonna believe that?

108
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,588
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

109
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:53,581
But if she believes it's the best way to
end the movie, our problems will be solved.

110
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,433
The trick is to pitch the concept to her,

111
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:00,715
so that she accepts an ending where everything
is explained as a dream, a lie, or a mistake.

112
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,575
<i>You might think that's the best solution.</i>

113
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,822
<i>And even I might be inclined to agree with you on that.</i>

114
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:08,719
<i>But what's Haruhi gonna say?</i>

115
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:23,128
Here's the deal: No talking in the house.

116
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,641
You're a cat, and you're gonna act like a cat, got it?

117
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,336
Not quite sure what "act like a cat" means,
but if that's what you want, I'll do my best.

118
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:31,302
Don't talk!

119
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,081
If you wanna say something, say "meow."

120
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:34,105
Meow.

121
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,277
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

122
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:39,157
"Meow."

123
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,385
There we go.

124
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,713
Okay, I guess I'll see you later then.

125
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,016
Yeah, you got it.

126
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,353
<i>It was just a few days before the festival,</i>

127
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,533
and an atmosphere of utter chaos was
slowly spreading through the school,

128
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,852
as if it were somehow connected to Haruhi's excitement.

129
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,205
Hurry!

130
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,398
We've got to find the legendary crystal, crescent orb!

131
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,499
And, if a couple of people from
another world decided to show up,

132
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,429
I doubt they'd feel out of place here.

133
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,447
Hey, Kyon!

134
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,658
Mikuru wants to tell you something.

135
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:20,017
Go ahead, Mikuru, give it to him!

136
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:21,464
Okay...

137
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:24,077
Um, this is for our...

138
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:25,085
Here!

139
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,250
It's a coupon for the yakisoba cafe
our class is doing for the festival.

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,208
Thank you, I'll definitely come.

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,293
And if you wanna bring some friends along,

142
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:35,820
you can invite them, too.

143
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,637
Guess we'll be seeing you later!

144
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:53,867
Can we talk?

145
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,350
Is everything okay?

146
00:07:55,444 --> 00:08:00,466
It's just... if I say what I'm about to
say, it might sound like I don't trust Koizumi.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,356
But, um... I have to say it anyway.

148
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,232
It's just that... Um...

149
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,441
I don't think the same as him.

150
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:10,261
How do I say it?

151
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:14,987
I've got... a different opinion about things than Koizumi.

152
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:18,953
Are you talking about his theory
that Haruhi's a god or something?

153
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,861
There's no doubt that Miss Suzumiya has
the power to alter the reality of the present.

154
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,816
But I don't think she can change
the actual structure of this world.

155
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,025
The world has always been this way.

156
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:39,469
So what you're saying is that you believe
the complete opposite of what Koizumi told me.

157
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,528
I'm pretty sure Miss Nagato has a different opinion, too.

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,621
Um... I know this might give you a
bad impression of Koizumi as a person.

159
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,784
I'm really sorry, but...

160
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:53,393
It's just that...

161
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,343
You shouldn't believe what he says.

162
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,464
Wait! No! I didn't mean it that way!

163
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,985
Um... I'm sorry!

164
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,907
I'm no good at explaining things,
and I'm not allowed to say much.

165
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:07,844
Oh... But still, I...

166
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,207
I think I understand.

167
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:15,082
You don't think there's any way Haruhi could be a god.

168
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:19,642
Your explanation is way easier to
understand than Koizumi's, that's for sure.

169
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,488
Thank you.

170
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:27,685
Still, I hope you understand that I don't
have anything against Koizumi as a person.

171
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:30,154
I just wanna be clear about that, okay?

172
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:36,511
This is what Mikuru Asahina believes to be true:

173
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:39,355
Haruhi Suzumiya did not create the world.

174
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,844
The world as it currently exists has always been this way.

175
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:47,921
Psychic powers and time travel,
extraterrestrial life forms and supernatural beings,

176
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:50,550
are all tangible elements within reality.

177
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:54,461
Haruhi Suzumiya's purpose is
to unconsciously discover them.

178
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,367
Her ability to do so activated
approximately three years ago.

179
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:03,190
She is able to detect the unusual, but
she can never recognize their existence.

180
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:07,679
That is because there are elements in place
which prevent her from discovering the truth.

181
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:10,420
That would be us.

182
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,120
Haruhi never notices the weird things going on around her.

183
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,969
Do Miss Asahina and Koizumi have different
reasons for keeping her in the dark like that?

184
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:19,783
Yes.

185
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:25,694
Miss Asahina was sent by her superiors to this
time plane to protect the time plane where she is from.

186
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,579
<i>I think she just said something
important, but she's so casual about it.</i>

187
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:35,235
Itsuki Koizumi and Mikuru Asahina will
never agree on their respective interpretations.

188
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,544
To them, any theory which diverges from their own disrupts
the logic of their theory and negates their existence.

189
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:47,052
Hold on! I remember Koizumi telling me he didn't get
his ESPer powers until three years ago, is that true?!

190
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,475
There is no evidence that what Itsuki
Koizumi says is actually the truth.

191
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,827
<i>She's right. There's no proof.</i>

192
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,666
<i>Koizumi's theory is just a convenient explanation
for all the weird stuff that's happened to me.</i>

193
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,970
<i>So who knows if that's the truth.</i>

194
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,290
<i>The same goes for Miss Asahina's theory.</i>

195
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:08,795
<i>There's no guarantee her version
of things is the right one either.</i>

196
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,203
What's your opinion about it?

197
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,206
Who's telling the truth?

198
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:18,694
And what about the stuff you were telling
me before, you know, about auto-evolution?

199
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:24,177
Regardless of which theory I present you with,
there is no way for you to determine its truth.

200
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,080
Why not?!

201
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:35,314
There is no guarantee that what I
have been saying is the truth either.

202
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,286
Not for you, anyway.

203
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:46,675
<i>I don't get it.</i>

204
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:47,921
<i>But who would?!</i>

205
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:52,418
<i>Koizumi and Nagato need to figure out how
to explain this to me, so I can understand.</i>

206
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:59,945
<i>The only person who thought the
shoot was going well was Haruhi.</i>

207
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,369
<i>Of course, this made the gloom on the faces of
Koizumi, Miss Asahina, and myself that much gloomier.</i>

208
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:12,274
<i>At some point during the day, the toy guns
started firing water bullets instead of BBs.</i>

209
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:18,510
<i>Haruhi brought different colored contacts for Miss Asahina
which made her shoot even more dangerous things at me.</i>

210
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:21,116
<i>And each time she did, Nagato bit her.</i>

211
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:25,414
<i>A couple of days after the cheery trees
started to blossom, the petals fell off.</i>

212
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,677
<i>The white pigeons at the shrine
had turned into passenger pigeons,</i>

213
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,181
<i>which had been extinct for a while now.</i>

214
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:34,605
<i>And even the seasons seemed to be completely out of whack.</i>

215
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,427
Hey, Kyon!

216
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:43,968
Your friend's here!

217
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,171
Hi.

218
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,346
It's clear that Miss Suzumiya doesn't care
about certain details like plot or foreshadowing.

219
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:00,825
And I doubt that she's even come up
with a proper ending for the film yet.

220
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:03,685
Who knows, the movie might end unfinished.

221
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,910
That could be a big problem, couldn't it?

222
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:10,566
Only if the reality of this world
suddenly becomes a fictional one.

223
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,375
You know, I've been meaning to tell you something.

224
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:22,958
The organization I belong to and the group Miss
Asahina's with aren't the only ones with theories...

225
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,371
... centered around Miss Suzumiya and her powers.

226
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,099
There are many others.

227
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,844
I'd love to tell you all about the conflicts
and bloody battles going on behind the scenes.

228
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,140
Or at least give you the condensed version.

229
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,798
There's alliance and betrayal,

230
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,652
sabotage and sneak attacks,

231
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:41,129
destruction and slaughter.

232
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,982
Each group locked in a fight
to the death, trying to survive.

233
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:51,451
Of course, none of it has anything
to do with you or Miss Suzumiya.

234
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,650
Don't you worry about that.

235
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:57,592
And I'd prefer it if Miss Suzumiya
never found out about it either.

236
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:01,540
I wouldn't wanna do anything
that would cause her any pain.

237
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,746
If I held her up to my standards, I'd
say Miss Suzumiya has a lovable character.

238
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:11,851
Oh, and so do you, of course.

239
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,237
Is there some reason that
you're telling me all this stuff?

240
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:19,081
There isn't any reason at all; just making an observation.

241
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:22,625
It's not important anyway, and not much fun to discuss.

242
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:26,035
You're right about that. I'm definitely not having fun.

243
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:29,357
There's something else you should
hear that won't be fun either.

244
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:33,209
Have you ever wondered why Miss
Asahina's a part of our little group?

245
00:14:33,677 --> 00:14:36,195
I mean, the real reason why she's with us?

246
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,248
Her role in all this is to entice you over to her side.

247
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:46,444
The only person I know who can get Miss
Suzumiya to listen to them is you, isn't it?

248
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:50,775
You see, that's why it's so
important to get a hold over you.

249
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,824
With her good looks, her childish behavior,

250
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:58,910
and the way she constantly allows herself to be
subjected to Miss Suzumiya's unreasonable demands,

251
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,771
it's all just an elaborate scheme
to get your attention, you know?

252
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,209
Getting tired of your jokes now.

253
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:12,971
Oh, I'm sorry.

254
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:17,211
I guess I don't have the talent to
keep a joke going, even if I started it.

255
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,757
I was kidding, of course.

256
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:21,815
Had you going, though.

257
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,485
The pressure of my class play, along with
Miss Suzumiya's movie, are starting to get to me.

258
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,205
At least, that's my interpretation.

259
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:34,647
And, if closed space were to appear on top
of all that, I think I'd probably pass out.

260
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,388
In fact, that's the reason for
the request I'm about to make.

261
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:39,679
Please help.

262
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:44,650
You have to try to put an end to all the strange
phenomena that's being caused by Miss Suzumiya's movie.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,181
Let me get this straight:

264
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,849
You want me to make sure Haruhi thinks that...

265
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:51,135
... everything she's been putting in
her movie is a product of her imagination,

266
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:52,579
is that right?

267
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,842
Yes, exactly.

268
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:55,890
It'll only work if she believes it.

269
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,107
And it has to happen before we finish shooting the movie.

270
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,416
All of us are counting on you.

271
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,168
What the heck's with that guy?

272
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,834
He just made me responsible for everything!

273
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:21,321
Yeah, but still...

274
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,876
I guess I can't just ignore it.

275
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,012
God, this is so annoying!

276
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,048
<i>A movie's a movie, and reality's reality.</i>

277
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,097
<i>They're two totally different things.</i>

278
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:38,600
<i>It's pretty obvious. So why is
it up to me to convince her of it?</i>

279
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,533
Koizumi said the movie has to be a dream,

280
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,335
but there's gotta be another way.

281
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:57,414
The next day, I cornered Haruhi
and pitched the concept I had in mind.

282
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,892
Then after discussing it, she agreed.

283
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,785
Okay! Cut!

284
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,413
Great job, guys!

285
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:07,271
We're only a couple shots away from finishing this thing.

286
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,537
Everyone's been great, I mean it!

287
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:13,447
Let's meet in the club room first thing
tomorrow morning for a sneak preview!

288
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,792
Oh, Mikuru! Why are you crying?!

289
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,478
Save those tears of yours for when
you get the Palme d'Or and the Oscar!

290
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:24,195
We should all be happy we made this together!

291
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:29,949
<i>The final battle between Mikuru and
Yuki awakens Itsuki Koizumi's powers.</i>

292
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:34,903
And this deus ex machina power that no
one understands knocks Yuki out into space!

293
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:37,348
With that, the curtain lowers on our story.

294
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,106
The end!

295
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,661
Looks like it's finally over.

296
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,486
But now that we're done, it feels
like it ended rather quickly, doesn't it?

297
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,889
You know that old saying, "Time
flies when you're having fun"?

298
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,990
Although in our case, I wonder who was having fun.

299
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:54,557
Beats me.

300
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:59,308
I hope it won't be too much trouble
if I leave the rest for you to handle.

301
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,991
I can't stop thinkin' about that play I'm in.

302
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:07,500
Unlike a movie, if I'm up on stage and I
mess up a line, there are no second takes.

303
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,690
Oh, there's one more thing.

304
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:14,301
My organization's very grateful.

305
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:15,706
They thank you.

306
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,835
And I thank you, too.

307
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,925
Okay! Shout it loud!

308
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,788
Our movie's gonna be a Hollywood blockbuster!

309
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:30,510
We'll win the Golden Bear and a Gold Lion at Cannes!

310
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:33,527
That was great! Now, point to the future!

311
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:34,547
<i>Oh, brother...</i>

312
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,665
Okay...

313
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,106
<i>To tell you the truth, up until the very end,</i>

314
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:44,824
<i>I didn't have a pixel of an idea what kind
of movie Haruhi was actually trying to make.</i>

315
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:49,230
<i>And I bet you already knew this, but there
wasn't enough time to finish the visual effects.</i>

316
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:52,417
<i>Not that I was capable of doing
stuff like that in the first place.</i>

317
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:54,495
<i>And Haruhi didn't like that.</i>

318
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,885
We can't show this picture until all
the effects are done, so it's up to you!

319
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,152
Now figure it out!

320
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,869
But the festival's tomorrow.

321
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,466
I'm running on fumes here!

322
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:05,800
You can make the deadline if you work through the night.

323
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,834
Pull an all-nighter if you have to.

324
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,464
I'm gonna stay too and help you out.

325
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:19,178
<i>When all was said and done,
Haruhi wasn't much help at all.</i>

326
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,309
<i>To be perfectly fair though, I sorta fell asleep, too.</i>

327
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:34,931
Kyon.

328
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,879
Kyon! Come on! Wake up!

329
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,171
So? How did it turn out?

330
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,551
<i>There wasn't any point staying overnight.</i>

331
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,504
<i>The thing still isn't finished.</i>

332
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:50,697
...from the future!

333
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:56,828
Wow!

334
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:01,849
I'm surprised.

335
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:05,749
Considering you did all the
effects last minute, it's pretty good!

336
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:08,180
<i>It wasn't me. Someone else must've done it.</i>

337
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,040
<i>Odds are, Nagato.</i>

338
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,389
<i>Next, Koizumi.</i>

339
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,206
<i>Miss Asahina? Doubt it.</i>

340
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,521
<i>Or, it could've been someone who hasn't shown up yet.</i>

341
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,259
<i>There's a scary thought.</i>

342
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:21,758
Good morning. How'd it turn out?
I hope you didn't stay up too late.

343
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,563
Good morning, everyone.

344
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,168
Good morning, guys!

345
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:27,866
Guess what we have to show you?

346
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,991
Made with blood, sweat, and
tears, it's a full-blown spectacle!

347
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,652
Wow! You finished it!

348
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,338
That's wonderful, really!

349
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:40,184
Now, it's time for us to watch it together!

350
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:44,481
Aw, Mikuru! You were so awesome!

351
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:46,826
I bet you're gonna have a lotta fans from this!

352
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:48,484
They're gonna eat you up!

353
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,478
<i>The arts festival had begun.</i>

354
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:53,475
<i>And there was nothing more for me to do.</i>

355
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,916
<i>All the fears we had of our
reality changing have disappeared.</i>

356
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,879
<i>I knew that for a fact because Shamisen stopped talking.</i>

357
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,346
<i>Oh, yeah... That reminds me.</i>

358
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:07,392
<i>It had been a while since I'd seen all
those guys who were dressed kinda strange.</i>

359
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,859
<i>I don't think they were in any of the
plays the other classes were putting on.</i>

360
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:13,695
<i>Who the heck were they, anyway?</i>

361
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:20,636
<i>The movie ended with a bit of narration by Haruhi.</i>

362
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:24,971
<i>I convinced her it would be cool if she
gave a speech about how the story wasn't real,</i>

363
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:26,795
<i>that it was all supposed to be fun.</i>

364
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:30,754
<i>Those were the magic words that
canceled out everything that happened.</i>

365
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:32,991
It's all made up.

366
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:37,069
Even if it resembles someone,
it's probably just a coincidence.

367
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:43,168
Oh! Except for the commercials. Shop at Ohmori
Electronics and Yamatsuchi's Model Shop for great deals!

368
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,500
Stop by and buy!

369
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,061
Huh? I gotta say it again?

370
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:52,037
This story is a work of fiction. All character
names, organizations, incidents, and any other names...

371
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,950
Hey, Kyon! Why do I have to say all this
stuff anyway? I mean, it's totally obvious!

372
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,501
<i>It might not seem like anything
ever gets under Haruhi's skin,</i>

373
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:05,227
<i>but the truth is, there's one thing that bothers her...</i>

374
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,002
<i>The world's too normal.</i>

375
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:11,429
<i>Now, you're probably wondering what a
person like her would consider "not normal."</i>

376
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,939
<i>The answer is: the supernatural.</i>

377
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:18,583
<i>For example, she'd say, "Why haven't I
seen a ghost yet? What's up with that?"</i>

378
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:21,439
<i>It's something I'm sure is always on her mind.</i>

379
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,240
I've got something really important to tell you.

380
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:26,711
Okay.

381
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:30,802
A while ago, you said you wanted to hang
out with aliens, time travelers, and ESPers.

382
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,264
Are you still into those things?

383
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,335
Yeah, I am.

384
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,918
But why are you bringing that up?

385
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:40,427
Because I know for a fact that aliens, time travelers, and
ESPers are real, and they're even closer than you think.

386
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,004
Really? Closer than I think?

387
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:49,580
Well, the only people I can think of who'd fit
that description would be Yuki, Mikuru, and Koizumi.

388
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,990
I mean, could there be anyone
closer to me than those guys?

389
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,631
Actually...

390
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,509
That's pretty much exactly what I was gonna tell you.

391
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:03,069
What?! Are you crazy or something?

392
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:06,438
Do you honestly think I'd believe
something as convenient as that?

393
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,865
<i>Well, normally, that would be true...</i>

394
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,615
Okay then, fine.

395
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:15,569
Who's who?

396
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,641
You're gonna love this.

397
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,560
Yuki Nagato is an alien.

398
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:21,552
She's with the Data Integration Entity or... something.

399
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,409
Anyway, she's like an agent for this entity thing.

400
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:27,682
Uh... Oh yeah! Humanoid interface,
that's what she said she was.

401
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,626
Really? How 'bout Mikuru?

402
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:35,226
Miss Asahina's a little easier to
explain. Here goes: She's a time traveler.

403
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:38,796
She's from the future and travels
through time, a time traveler.

404
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:40,281
What time is she from?

405
00:23:40,313 --> 00:23:43,426
I don't know, she won't tell me, says it's "classified."

406
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:47,731
Uh-huh. I think I got it.

407
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:48,935
So, you believe me then.

408
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,312
Next, you're probably gonna tell
me Koizumi's the ESPer in the group.

409
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,282
Am I right or am I right?

410
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,303
Yeah! That's exactly what I was gonna say to you next!

411
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:07,886
Don't mess with me!

412
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:13,277
<i>What a nut!</i>

413
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,466
<i>She picks the weirdest things to get all rational about.</i>

414
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,449
<i>Everything would be so much easier
if, for once, she would just believe me!</i>

415
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,536
Hey, thanks! Come again!

416
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,073
<i>But, it's probably for the best.</i>

417
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:36,010
<i>If Haruhi ever found out about all the strange phenomena
happening around her, we'd all be in big trouble.</i>

418
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,336
<i>Oh, brother...</i>
