1
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:05,166
You're... an alien?

2
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:11,571
My mission is to observe Haruhi Suzumiya and report the
information back to the data integration thought entity.

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,917
I've been performing this task daily
since my creation three years ago.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,706
It has been quite peaceful and
there have been no uncertain factors.

5
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:24,909
However, irregularities have appeared
near Haruhi Suzumiya which cannot be ignored.

6
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,341
That would be... you.

7
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,981
To the data integration thought entity,

8
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,547
the third planet in the solar system, this planet,

9
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:04,938
held no special value.

10
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:08,068
However, the current inhabitants
of Earth as it is known...

11
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:12,388
by your kind, developed a cognitive
ability that could be considered intelligence.

12
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:15,506
Consequently, the significance of the planet increased.

13
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,634
There was the possibility that
your kind might provide an answer...

14
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,093
in overcoming the inert evolution
the entity is experiencing.

15
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:27,006
Throughout the universe, it is common for
organic lifeforms to develop a consciousness.

16
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:31,547
Human beings from Earth were the only
creatures whose consciences evolved into intellect.

17
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:35,274
The entity carefully, yet
thoroughly, continued its observations.

18
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:39,746
Three years ago, they noticed an abnormal
flare up of data on the surface of the planet.

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,506
This explosion of information started
from one area of a bow-shaped archipelago,

20
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,998
then quickly enveloped the entire planet
and surged further outward into space.

21
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:51,051
In the center of all this was...

22
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:56,824
For the three years since, multiple investigations
and observations have occurred regarding Haruhi Suzumiya.

23
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,015
However, she remains an enigma.

24
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,194
Regardless, one section of the entity...

25
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:05,964
continues to perform its analysis of Haruhi Suzumiya.

26
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:10,851
The entity believes she will be the key to
human kind's auto-evolution as well as its own.

27
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:16,326
Because the entity is an astro-being, it can
not directly communicate with organic lifeforms.

28
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,694
The entity does not communicate through language,

29
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,961
and your kind has no way of
communicating without language.

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,821
That is why the data integration thought
entity created interfaces such as myself.

31
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:30,062
Through me, it can make contact with the human species.

32
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:36,950
We believe that Haruhi Suzumiya
has the potential for auto-evolution.

33
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,477
She has the power to manipulate the
environmental data around her for her benefit.

34
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,589
That is the reason why I am here,

35
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,354
and the reason why you are here.

36
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,825
Hold it. Just hang on a sec.

37
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,104
I'm totally lost.

38
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:49,939
Trust me...

39
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,838
Okay, first of all, why me?

40
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:54,166
I mean, for starters, let's just say I believe...

41
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,543
all this stuff you're tellin' me about this
data-integrated whatchamahoozit thingy in space.

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,741
But if it's true, why reveal your identity to me?

43
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,396
You have been chosen by Haruhi Suzumiya.

44
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:04,653
Whether she knows it or not,

45
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:10,149
Haruhi Suzumiya has the power to affect her
surroundings by transforming her will into absolute data.

46
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:12,874
There is a reason she chose you rather than someone else.

47
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:13,483
No way.

48
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:14,082
Way.

49
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,686
You and Haruhi Suzumiya have
the possibilities in your hands.

50
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,039
You're serious about all this.

51
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,058
Of course.

52
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,989
<i>Here I am, amazed that the silent
one had finally started talking,</i>

53
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,198
<i>but the stuff that was coming out
of her mouth was completely whacko.</i>

54
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,947
<i>I never imagined she'd be so... out there.</i>

55
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:35,682
You know, you'd really make Haruhi ecstatic if you
went up to her personally and told her all this stuff.

56
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:40,005
Hate to say it, but I'm having a hard time
keeping up with this kinda talk, it's so confusing.

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,842
The data integration thought
entity is under the impression...

58
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:48,601
that if Haruhi Suzumiya is made aware of her worth
and her abilities, it would create a catastrophic event.

59
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:52,386
For now, we must continue our
observations unbeknownst to her.

60
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:56,496
Okay... but I could run out right now and
tell Haruhi everything you just explained to me.

61
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,795
She does not take the information you feed her seriously.

62
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:01,558
<i>That's true.</i>

63
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:06,206
I am not the only interface that the data
integration thought entity has placed upon this planet.

64
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:11,093
Another section of the entity is determined to
use more proactive methods with Haruhi Suzumiya,

65
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,675
in order to observe the fluctuations of data.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,010
You are the key to Haruhi Suzumiya.

67
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:18,456
If there is danger, you are the first target.

68
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,557
<i>I'm outta here...</i>

69
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,447
<i>Humanoid inter... what?</i>

70
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,362
<i>Aliens.</i>

71
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,578
<i>She's always by herself reading this stuff.</i>

72
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,869
<i>Maybe that's where her weird fantasies come from.</i>

73
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,736
<i>I'll bet that when she's in
class she doesn't talk to anybody.</i>

74
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,980
<i>She just stays cooped up in her own little world.</i>

75
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,095
<i>Yuki and Haruhi need to just chill out and
enjoy some plain, old ordinary school life.</i>

76
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,254
I can't believe it! He's finally here!

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,146
Isn't it amazing?! Mysterious transfer student!

78
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,217
It's gotta be!

79
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,957
You haven't even seen him yet,
how do you know he's mysterious?

80
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,564
Like I said, a student who transfers during this strange,

81
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:05,322
in-between time in the middle of school has a
good chance of being a mysterious transfer student!

82
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:08,353
If you don't mind, I wanna know
just who gave you that statistic.

83
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,822
Because if it's true, and you take into
account all the mysterious people in Japan,

84
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,052
then everyone would be considered...

85
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,139
I'm gonna go check him out!

86
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,228
And, you're not listening, are you?

87
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:19,130
<i>After school when I stopped by the club,</i>

88
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:22,433
<i>Miss Asahina had heroically recovered after only one day.</i>

89
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,474
I'm surprised to see you back
here after everything that happened.

90
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,586
Yeah, but after thinking about it,

91
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,802
I realized I still had concerns.

92
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:32,929
I could swear she said that before...

93
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:34,847
What're you concerned about?

94
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,557
Um... It's nothing.

95
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,199
Huh?

96
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,681
You wanna sit in for a game?

97
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,773
So, Nagato, you ever play Othello?

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,464
Sorry to keep you waiting!

99
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,596
Someone transferred into freshman class 9 today,

100
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,832
and he's joining us!

101
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,876
His name is...

102
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,279
Itsuki Koizumi.

103
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,332
How do you do?

104
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,272
This is the SOS Brigade!

105
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,425
I'm Haruhi Suzumiya the Brigade leader,

106
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,515
and these are brigade members numbers one, two, and three!

107
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,492
By the way, you're member number four.

108
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:17,861
Everyone should make him feel right at home!

109
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:20,655
I don't mind joining you guys,

110
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,178
but I was wondering what kind of club this is anyway.

111
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,344
Let me tell you exactly what the SOS Brigade is all about.

112
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:29,157
Attention.

113
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,994
The SOS Brigade's mission is to find aliens,
time travelers, and ESPers and hang out with them!

114
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:42,641
<i>It's as if the whole world has come to a grinding halt.</i>

115
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,301
<i>No, not really.</i>

116
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,933
<i>But I was reminded of Haruhi's
declaration on the first day of school.</i>

117
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:50,648
Oh, I get it.

118
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,757
As expected from Miss Suzumiya.

119
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,275
<i>What did he just get?</i>

120
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,159
All right, I'll join your club, and I
hope to have a good time with all of you.

121
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,545
<i>What? Even after what she just said?</i>

122
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,871
<i>Was he even listening?</i>

123
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,485
Nice to meet you. I'm Itsuki
Koizumi and I just transferred here.

124
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,304
There's still a lot I don't know,
so I hope you'll show me the ropes.

125
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,028
Uh, yeah, um...

126
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,202
That's Kyon!

127
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:13,625
And the cute one is Mikuru!

128
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,073
And the one over there with the glasses is Yuki.

129
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:21,625
Oh my, are you all right?

130
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,520
We've got five members now, and that
means we're an official extracurricular club!

131
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:28,504
I'm fine, really. Thanks.

132
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:33,965
Yay! The time has finally come
for the SOS Brigade to be unveiled!

133
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,197
Brigaders, get ready to do your best and fight as one!

134
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:40,750
<i>Fighting? Unveiled? And now Nagato's become a member...</i>

135
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,157
<i>I mean, are you sure you're okay with that, Nagato?</i>

136
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:46,288
<i>Moving right along, it's now
after school the following day.</i>

137
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:46,780
Noooo!

138
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,296
Come one, hurry up! Take your clothes off!

139
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:55,783
Holy...!

140
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:56,744
Sorry!

141
00:08:57,057 --> 00:09:00,166
When it comes to moe, the maid costume is essential.

142
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,240
You need one in every school-based story.

143
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,346
What kind of school-based story is this?

144
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:07,241
And now... it's time for pictures!

145
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:09,502
But... Don't take a picture!

146
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:10,766
Chin down a bit... Good.

147
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,609
Grab hold of the apron...

148
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,307
Bigger smile... Work it!

149
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,303
Kyon, take over for me, okay?

150
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,887
Mikuru, let's make things a little sexier!

151
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,113
What're you doing?!

152
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,495
<i>There's nothing okay about it.</i>

153
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,897
<i>Yeah, I should talk. I'm the one taking the pictures.</i>

154
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,342
Yuki, gimme your glasses.

155
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,684
Here we go!

156
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,608
<i>And glasses are on.</i>

157
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:37,373
<i>What is she planning to do with these photos anyway?</i>

158
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,833
Yeah, perfect!

159
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,559
A glasses-wearing Lolita maid with great boobs!

160
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:43,132
This is so awesome!

161
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,224
Noo!

162
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:47,936
From now on, Mikuru, whenever you're
in this room, you gotta wear this outfit!

163
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:48,826
No...

164
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,505
Uh! What's going on here?

165
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,270
Oh, right! Now we're talkin'!

166
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,119
Let's all have some fun with Mikuru!

167
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,099
That's enough.

168
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,441
Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass.

169
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,215
I'd be afraid of the consequences.

170
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,399
Please continue though. Don't mind me.

171
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,152
<i>I could use a little help here...</i>

172
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,242
Haven't you had enough? Just cut it out already.

173
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,943
You've gotta be breaking several laws here.

174
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,629
What're you talkin' about?!

175
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,344
Whatever...

176
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,312
I got a lot of photos anyway.

177
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:19,437
Okay, the very first meeting of
the SOS Brigade is about to begin!

178
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,966
We did a lot to come this far this fast.

179
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:26,270
We passed out flyers, we made a website,

180
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:31,108
and now, we see that the SOS Brigade's
fame at this school has sky rocketed!

181
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:32,142
Sure, you could say...

182
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,984
<i>I wonder what part of "traumatizing
Miss Asahina" makes this a big success?</i>

183
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,481
However, we haven't gotten a single
email concerning strange phenomena.

184
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:45,279
Also, not even one student's come by yet
to consult us about anything weird or...

185
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:46,670
<i>Yeah, go figure.</i>

186
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:49,342
<i>I mean, it's not exactly clear
what we're even supposed to be doing.</i>

187
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,058
<i>After all, we just found out
what this club's for yesterday.</i>

188
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:55,410
People like to say stuff like,
"Good things come to those who wait."

189
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,746
But in these times, we cannot sit and wait!

190
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:01,647
We must find those good things even if
we have to dig up every inch of this Earth!

191
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,489
So then, let's go search for them!

192
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:04,203
For what?

193
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,974
The mysteries of this world!

194
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:11,040
<i>And with that, we are now going on a tour
around the city in search of mystery and phenomena.</i>

195
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:14,225
<i>On Saturday, meet at 9 am in front of Kitaguchi Station.</i>

196
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,784
<i>Those who arrive late shall receive the death penalty.</i>

197
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,391
<i>Death penalty...?</i>

198
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:21,176
<i>You know, I really hate to waste a day off...</i>

199
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,671
You're late! Penalty!

200
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:28,357
<i>Haurhi's proposal: Split off into groups of two,</i>

201
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,383
<i>search the city for mysterious phenomena.</i>

202
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,847
<i>If we find any, alert the others via cell phone.</i>

203
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,561
<i>That is all.</i>

204
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,613
I guess we got our groups.

205
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:39,718
<i>It might be a lucky day for me after all.</i>

206
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,561
<i>I mean, if I can go on a date with Miss Asahina,</i>

207
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,883
<i>treating everyone to lunch 'cause
I was late is a small price to pay.</i>

208
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,210
Kyon, are you paying attention?

209
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,509
Would you be serious here? This isn't a date, got it?

210
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,797
Yeah, I hear ya.

211
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,682
Look, this isn't fun and games!
You mess around and I'll kill ya!

212
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:02,774
<i>And with those parting words, Haruhi's team
left to investigate the east side of the station,</i>

213
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:06,113
<i>while Miss Asahina and I were
ordered to search the west side.</i>

214
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,352
<i>However...</i>

215
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:08,714
What should we do?

216
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,476
<i>Beats me.</i>

217
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:17,340
This is the first time I've
ever gone for a walk like this.

218
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:18,825
By like this, you mean...?

219
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,320
Out walking alone with a boy.

220
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:22,741
Oh!

221
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,913
Come on, I can't believe that.

222
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,971
You're telling me that you've never
gone out on a date with anyone before?

223
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:29,965
Never.

224
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:31,599
Hah, you're kidding, right?

225
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,366
I mean, don't you have guys just lining up to ask you out?

226
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,591
Mm. But... I can't do it.

227
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:40,362
You see, I'm not supposed to go out on dates with anyone.

228
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,816
At least not in this...

229
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:47,408
Kyon.

230
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,840
I've gotta favor to ask of you.

231
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,997
<i>After a couple of false starts, Miss Asahina finally
started putting her words into complete sentences,</i>

232
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,193
<i>and began to explain.</i>

233
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,189
You might not believe a word I'm about to say,

234
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:03,501
but the truth is, I'm not actually from this time plane.

235
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,765
I come from the future.

236
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:10,714
I can't tell you from which time
period or time plane I come from, though.

237
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:14,736
Telling anything about the future
to anyone from the past is restricted.

238
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,765
I was told this before I boarded the time machine.

239
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,792
Ah... think of it as being a lot like animation.

240
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,500
The pictures look like they're in motion, right?

241
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:26,748
But it's just a series of still
frames laid out in a sequence.

242
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,229
Time is just like that...

243
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:34,320
Time traveling is moving in a three-dimensional
direction along the various time planes.

244
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,130
I'm from the future. That means on this time plane,

245
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:41,248
I'm sort of like an extra picture in the
middle of one of those flip book animation things.

246
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,849
<i>What is it now?</i>

247
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:48,389
As for me, I'm here because a large
time click happened three years ago.

248
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,982
That's three years ago from
the current time in this plane.

249
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:55,707
We arrived in the past to investigate,
and we were surprised once we got here.

250
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:59,736
No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't
go further back in time from that plane.

251
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,566
The conclusion was that there had to be
a large time gap between the time planes.

252
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,587
It wasn't until recently that
we found the thing that caused it.

253
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,385
That is... recently in the future where I come from.

254
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,044
So what is the reason?

255
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,314
Miss Suzumiya.

256
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,285
<i>Not again.</i>

257
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:19,974
She was at the very center of the time distortion,
and I can't explain any more of this to you,

258
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:22,490
because it's classified information.

259
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:26,155
But we are certain that it was Miss
Suzumiya who closed our access to the past.

260
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,766
It's hard to believe that Haruhi
would be able to do something like that.

261
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,652
Believe me, it's a mystery to us as well.

262
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:36,308
And Miss Suzumiya doesn't realize that
she's the cause of the time quake, either.

263
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:37,640
That's where I come in.

264
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:42,827
I was sent here to see whether or not there'll be
any new time anomalies occurring near Miss Suzumiya.

265
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:45,611
I guess... I'm kind of like a watchdog.

266
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:49,439
I'll understand if you don't
wanna believe what I just told you.

267
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:52,554
No, it's not that, it's just... why are you telling me?

268
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,342
Because you are the one that Miss Suzumiya has chosen.

269
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,211
I can't explain because it's classified information,

270
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:00,316
but you are very important to Miss Suzumiya.

271
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:02,445
There are reasons behind everything she does.

272
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,132
Every time she raises her hand or takes a step.

273
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:06,975
What about Nagato and the new guy?

274
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:10,637
Oh, well, they're in very similar positions to me.

275
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:15,729
I never expected Miss Suzumiya to get us
all together in such a precise manner, though.

276
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,177
So that means you know who or
what both of them really are, right?

277
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,543
That's classified.

278
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,379
Can you tell me what's going to happen to Haruhi?

279
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:24,921
That's classified.

280
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:28,203
Well, if you're from the future,
you already know what happens, right?

281
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,879
That's classified.

282
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,769
Well, then, why don't you just tell Haruhi all this stuff?

283
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,155
That's classified.

284
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,882
I'm sorry, but I'm not authorized
to say anything right now.

285
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,599
You don't have to believe me.

286
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,769
I just wanted you to know about it, that's all.

287
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:49,456
<i>I just heard the same thing a
couple of days ago, didn't I?</i>

288
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:53,188
I'm sorry to dump all this on you like I did.

289
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,372
Don't apologize, I don't mind.

290
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,265
<i>So now we've got an alien and a time traveler.</i>

291
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,943
<i>What's going on here?</i>

292
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:02,568
<i>If there's anybody out there
who believes in all this stuff,</i>

293
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,558
<i>please, call me. We'll trade places.</i>

294
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:07,981
Miss Asahina.

295
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:08,807
Yes?

296
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,722
You mind if we put all this on hold?

297
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:15,574
I mean, is it okay if we just put aside whether I
believe you or not and just get back to it later?

298
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,236
Sure.

299
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,643
Before we do, can I ask you one question?

300
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,097
Yes, what is it?

301
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:23,053
If you wouldn't mind, could you
tell me how old you really are?

302
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:25,848
That's classified.

303
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,455
<i>After that little conversation,</i>

304
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,888
<i>Haruhi called me on my cell, and
we all got together again at noon.</i>

305
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,490
Find anything?

306
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,095
Nothing.

307
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,651
Were you guys really looking?

308
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,766
I hope you weren't just wandering around, Mikuru.

309
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,547
Ah! N-No!

310
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,811
What about you? Did you find anything?

311
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,873
<i>While we ate lunch, Haruhi said she
wanted to split up into groups again.</i>

312
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,287
An unmarked one again.

313
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,636
We'll meet back at the station at four.

314
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,099
Make sure to find something this time, you got that?

315
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:03,158
<i>This time, we split up to search
the north end and the south end.</i>

316
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:05,097
<i>Nagato and me took the south side.</i>

317
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,401
You know what you told me about the other day?

318
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,061
What?

319
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:13,264
Well, suddenly I find myself thinking that
it doesn't really sound so far-fetched anymore.

320
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,121
Oh...

321
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,043
<i>If I have to pass the time with Nagato,</i>

322
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,798
<i>this is about the only place to do it.</i>

323
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,306
Oh brother.

324
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:34,548
What time do you think it is you idiot?!

325
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,716
Sorry, but I actually just woke up.

326
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,561
Huh?!

327
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:39,280
What did you just say to me?!

328
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,632
We were supposed to meet you at four, right?

329
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:44,598
Get your butt back here! You got 30 seconds!

330
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,512
<i>I had my work cut out for me.</i>

331
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:47,449
<i>We had to leave,</i>

332
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:50,363
<i>but getting Nagato to move
when she's reading is impossible.</i>

333
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:53,346
<i>First, I had to get her a library
card so she could check out the book.</i>

334
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:56,371
<i>Meanwhile, I had to ignore
the incessant calls from Haruhi.</i>

335
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,953
Late! Penalty!

336
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:02,276
<i>In the end, we didn't find anything
even remotely close to phenomena.</i>

337
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:05,629
<i>The day's activities were a
waste of both my time and my money.</i>

338
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,042
<i>Before we split up though, Miss Asahina...</i>

339
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,720
I wanted to thank you for listening to my story today.

340
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:14,058
<i>Whispered into my ear, which
felt pretty good if I may say so.</i>

341
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,790
All right, spit it out, what were you doing today?

342
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,347
Wait a minute, what about you?

343
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,715
Were you able to find any of
your mysterious phenomena today?

344
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:26,004
Well, they wouldn't be careless enough
to let you find them in one day, right?

345
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,783
I mean, what did you expect, anyway?

346
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,940
We're gonna need to review your behavior on Monday.

347
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,173
<i>And with that, she stormed off.</i>

348
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,086
<i>You're kidding me...</i>

349
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:44,767
<i>The weekend was over, and I was sweating
from all the humidity this morning.</i>

350
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,375
<i>Oh, the rainy season.</i>

351
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,653
<i>Haruhi walked in right before the final bell rang.</i>

352
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:50,691
Send me some of that breeze.

353
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:51,827
You're on your own there.

354
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,687
Hey, Suzumiya, ever happen to hear the
story about the blue bird of happiness?

355
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:57,621
What about it?

356
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,680
Never mind, it doesn't have to do with anything.

357
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,524
Then don't talk about it.

358
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:07,343
After being showered from behind by
Haruhi's aura of unpleasantness all day,

359
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,244
I fled to the safety of the club room.

360
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,224
Much like a rat running from a brush fire...

361
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,338
There was someone I needed to talk to.

362
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:20,015
Koizumi, don't you also have something you
want to talk to me about regarding Suzumiya?

363
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:21,445
Heh...

364
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:27,321
I get the feeling that the other two have
already talked to you about her, am I right?

365
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,503
Yeah.

366
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,488
Well, how much do you know?

367
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,030
Just that Suzumiya isn't your ordinary person.

368
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,532
Good. That'll make my side of things easier,

369
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,216
because that's definitely the case.

370
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,687
How about you start by telling me who you really are?

371
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,621
Well, as you might've already
guessed, I'm what's called an ESPer.

372
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,853
It's best we call it that for now, okay?

373
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:49,763
To tell you the truth, I wasn't planning
on transferring into this school so suddenly,

374
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,509
but the circumstances have changed.

375
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:56,811
And I have to say that I really didn't expect the
two of them to join up with Haruhi Suzumiya so quickly.

376
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,925
Either way, I'm sure we're going to have
the chance to talk more about all this later.

377
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,968
A picture's worth a thousand words they say,
and I definitely have something to show you.

378
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,576
But for now, I think I'll give you the short version.

379
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:11,725
The organization that I belong to
has other ESPers besides yours truly.

380
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,704
Actually, this school's already been
secretly infiltrated by a bunch of us agents.

381
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,382
And ever since the organization
started up three years ago,

382
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:20,329
we've been watching over Miss Suzumiya.

383
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:21,775
Three years ago.

384
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,611
That's when something very interesting happened.

385
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,567
That is also when the powers
I have now awakened inside me.

386
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,648
How is Haruhi involved in
whatever happened three years ago?

387
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:36,667
You see, the elders in the organization believe
that this world is sort of like a dream that...

388
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,755
a certain entity is showing us.

389
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,814
Because it's all just a dream, it'd be
quite easy for that entity to alter our reality.

390
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:47,438
It could change it, destroy it, even create a new world.

391
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,416
And we're pretty sure that we
found that entity right here.

392
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:52,299
You're saying that's Haruhi?

393
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:56,326
For millennia, people have referred to
such an entity as "god" or something similar.

394
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,891
<i>Well done, Haruhi.</i>

395
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,724
<i>You got people calling you a god now.</i>

396
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,785
Just look at this way for a moment:

397
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:05,915
You got ESPers like me as well as beings
like Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato...

398
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,687
all hangin' around in the same place.

399
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:10,933
You think it's simply coincidence
that we've all come together like this?

400
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:13,935
It's all happening because Miss Suzumiya wished it.

401
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,088
She wished for it three years ago.

402
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:19,899
So are you saying that Haruhi
remodeled the universe three years ago?

403
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,946
Well, it would be more accurate to say
that this world started three years ago.

404
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:26,017
It's better than saying it was remodeled.

405
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,393
Anyway, it's just a theory us ESPers have.

406
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,681
<i>Whatever...</i>

407
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:33,463
And just what do you ESPer guys wanna do with Haruhi?

408
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:38,197
Listen, if this world upsets its god, it'd be
destroyed and recreated in a blink of an eye.

409
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,311
We wanna prevent that from happening.

410
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:43,400
I mean, I kinda like this place. Warts and all, you know?

411
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,016
Why don't you just walk up to
Haruhi and talk to her about it?

412
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:49,803
Well, there are some members in the
organization who think we should do just that,

413
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:53,307
and others think that we should be
more aggressive in stimulating her powers.

414
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:58,423
Either way, most of us think that this is definitely
not something that we can easily get involved with.

415
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:01,974
The bottom line is that she doesn't
yet realize her true potential.

416
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:05,059
If that's the case, the organization feels it'd be best

417
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:08,340
if she never finds out about her
powers and lives happily ever after.

418
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:11,017
You're gonna let sleeping gods lie, huh?

419
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,257
Good way of putting it.

420
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,007
You sure you guys aren't the ones dreaming this world up?

421
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,588
I guess that's also a possibility.

422
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,937
But as of right here right now, we're simply acting on the
worst of worst case scenarios that we can come up with.

423
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,610
I got an idea.

424
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,365
You're telling me you're an ESPer, right?

425
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:29,622
If that's really the case, then show me your power.

426
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:32,308
If you can do that, then I'll
believe everything you've said to me.

427
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,273
For starters, how 'bout you try
heating up this cup of coffee here?

428
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:39,158
While that would be rather
convenient, my powers aren't like that.

429
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:42,534
In fact, most of the time, I don't have any powers at all.

430
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:46,284
It's only when all sorts of conditions
are present that I can actually use them.

431
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:50,709
And like I said before, I believe I'll have
the opportunity to show you in the near future.

432
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,934
I do apologize for speaking for such a long time.

433
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,212
Now, excuse me. I think that's enough for today.

434
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:57,141
See ya tomorrow.

435
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:00,249
Oh, by the way.

436
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:02,386
The biggest mystery is definitely you.

437
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:05,306
I know it's kind of rude, but
I did some checking up on you.

438
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:06,623
I hope you don't mind it.

439
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:10,517
I assure you that you... are an ordinary human.

440
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:12,407
Huh...?

441
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,381
Uh! I'm so sorry about that!

442
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:24,580
<i>Jeez, you don't have to do
everything. Haruhi tells you to do.</i>

443
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:34,724
<i>For some reason, Haruhi never
showed up to the clubroom that day.</i>
