1
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:05,145
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

2
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,045
<i>That's what it felt like anyway.</i>

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,766
<i>The game on TV was between schools from another town.</i>

4
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,945
<i>I had nothing to do with either school, but
because I tend to sympathize with underdogs,</i>

5
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,365
<i>I found myself routing for the losing team.</i>

6
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:21,793
<i>And it was right about then that I
suddenly got the feeling Haruhi was gonna call.</i>

7
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,686
What does she want?

8
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:28,030
Your phone's ringing, Kyon.

9
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,847
I know, I know.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,763
Hey, you're free, right?

11
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:34,902
Good, meet us at 2:00 in front
of the station. Don't be late!

12
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:39,031
<i>I didn't even have the chance to say anything.</i>

13
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:41,518
What?

14
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,487
I forgot to tell you to bring your swim trunks.

15
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:44,794
And some money, too.

16
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:47,185
Oh, wait, and your bike. Definitely bring your bike.

17
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,665
That's it! Over and out!

18
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:50,957
<i>Uh. No.</i>

19
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:53,907
<i>That was weird.</i>

20
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,833
<i>It's like I knew what Haruhi
was gonna say before she said it.</i>

21
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:02,337
<i>Yeah, no. Actually, it felt like we'd
had the exact same conversation before.</i>

22
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,758
<i>Like déjà vu or something.</i>

23
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:08,541
There's the wind-up. It's outta there!

24
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:10,740
Home run! What a shot!

25
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,086
<i>Summer's almost over, isn't it?</i>

26
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,323
You're late, Kyon!

27
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,433
Where's your motivation, huh?

28
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:56,761
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,632
Oh, I just got here too.

30
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,648
Now that we're all present and accounted for, we can go!

31
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:02,330
Where?

32
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:04,473
To the public pool! Where do you think?

33
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,548
Figures, considering what I brought.

34
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,866
We've got lots and lots of summer
vacationy things to do during our break,

35
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,151
But there's only so much time, and
once it's gone, it's gone for good.

36
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:19,206
So we're gonna do everything we can while we can
during our one and only summer as tenth graders.

37
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,194
And for starters, we're gonna ride bikes over to the pool.

38
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,240
So, did everyone ride their bikes today?

39
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:27,775
No. The only bikes we have to
take are the ones you and I brought.

40
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:28,527
Huh?

41
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:33,053
All right, Kyon. Don't let Koizumi beat you over there.

42
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,199
Come on, full speed ahead!

43
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,052
<i>Boost!</i>

44
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,331
Come on, guys. Hurry up and park your bikes already.

45
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,260
We're trying to have fun, Kyon.
Stop acting like you're tired.

46
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,048
<i>And whose fault is that?</i>

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,481
Ah. Can you smell the chlorine?

48
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,569
That really makes it feel like summer.

49
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:04,338
Hurry up and get in! Water's all warm. It's perfect!

50
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,708
<i>Can't she see the no diving signs? They're everywhere.</i>

51
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,492
Doesn't that look like fun?

52
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,984
In a way, it makes me smile.
Such a peaceful scene, isn't it?

53
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:19,715
I mean, seeing Miss Suzumiya enjoy the day in a
normal fashion, rather charming, don't you think?

54
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,859
She called me, told me what to bring, and ordered
me to meet her without telling me what was going on.

55
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:26,240
There's nothing charming or normal about it.

56
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:30,536
Well, if you ask me, none of what you
mentioned is anything to make such a fuss over.

57
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:35,852
As long as Miss Suzumiya's having a good time, we
don't have to worry about any earth-shattering events.

58
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,966
I hope you're right.

59
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,751
Something wrong?

60
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,516
No. It's just my imagination.

61
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:50,384
With everything that's happened since we
met, you could say I've become slightly paranoid.

62
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:02,076
<i>Hot...</i>

63
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,917
<i>Hot. So hot.</i>

64
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:11,903
<i>Jeez. Now I know why they call
it a "public" swimming pool.</i>

65
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,048
<i>Seems like everyone in town's here today.</i>

66
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,415
<i>I wonder why Haruhi chose this place.</i>

67
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:26,947
<i>There's that feeling again.</i>

68
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,219
<i>It's like I've seen this happen once before.</i>

69
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:34,451
<i>With Nagato looking kinda bored like that. Alone.</i>

70
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:36,990
Kyon!

71
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,167
<i>And then Haruhi's supposed to say something like...</i>

72
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,366
These two guys are my brigade members.

73
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,985
And they do what I say.

74
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,988
So if you want somethin', you can ask them.

75
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:51,219
It's time to have some fun!

76
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,247
Let's all go play water soccer!

77
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,649
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:57,452
<i>Oh well. Sometimes déjà vu's happen.</i>

79
00:05:57,677 --> 00:05:59,339
Here is comes, Mikuru!

80
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:00,255
Okay!

81
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:07,272
I have a couple ideas about the rest of our vacation.

82
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,209
Check it out!

83
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:11,228
<i>Two weeks to do all of that?</i>

84
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,551
Is there anything you want to do, Mikuru?

85
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,574
Umm... I'd like to try goldfish scooping.

86
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,387
Okay. Goldfish scooping it is.

87
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,174
Could I see that?

88
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:27,931
Thank you.

89
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:29,449
We'll the list tomorrow.

90
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,794
Does anyone know if there's a
bon festival happening close by?

91
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,062
Or a firework show?

92
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,932
I can check and see if there's anything.

93
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:38,255
Don't forget about goldfish scooping.

94
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,365
It's Mikuru's only request.

95
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:41,507
I'll get right on it.

96
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,867
<i>I always get stuck with the bill.</i>

97
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,492
Well, that's it. See ya!

98
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,537
I'm off, too.

99
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,568
Bye, bye.

100
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:05,718
Nagato!

101
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:12,337
Uhh, it's...

102
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:15,902
I guess it's nothing important. Anyway, how've you been?

103
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,402
Is everything okay?

104
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:18,927
I am fine.

105
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,250
Well, that's good to hear.

106
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,911
Yes.

107
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,111
What the heck? Why did I wanna talk to her?

108
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,297
<i>The next morning, I was waken from my
peaceful slumber by a call from Haruhi.</i>

109
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,297
<i>She said they'd found a bon festival.</i>

110
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,565
<i>It was happening tonight. At a park somewhere.</i>

111
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:52,001
We're all gonna go buy yukatas!

112
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,123
<i>So, we went to a clothing outlet.</i>

113
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:57,407
<i>Haruhi picked out yukatas for Miss Asahina and Nagato.</i>

114
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,695
<i>Then marched them straight into the changing room.</i>

115
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,777
<i>After making us wait about an hour
or so, they all three finally came out.</i>

116
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,764
Whoa.

117
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,407
You look wondering in those.

118
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,012
Of course we do! I picked them out myself.

119
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,863
Especially Mikuru's.

120
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,757
Look at you, you're so cute. I must be a genius.

121
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:16,186
Uh... Uh, yes.

122
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,957
<i>The blushing makes her cuter!</i>

123
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,813
Wow.

124
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,075
<i>A bon festival, huh?</i>

125
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,583
<i>It figures that it'd be so crowded.</i>

126
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,240
<i>I haven't been to a bon festival in a while,</i>

127
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,274
<i>But it feels like I just went to one.</i>

128
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:36,943
<i>That tower.</i>

129
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,411
<i>Those vendors.</i>

130
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:39,921
Look, Mikuru!

131
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,507
They've got goldfish scooping just like you wanted!

132
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,337
You're gonna catch a ton!

133
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,092
Do you wanna go scoop some fish?

134
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,562
We could have a contest.

135
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,785
I think I'll pass.

136
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,939
How 'bout you, Nagato? Wanna get some food?

137
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,706
Don't tell me you're actually into this kinda stuff.

138
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,111
I got it.

139
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:20,865
No.

140
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:23,706
That.

141
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,555
It's yours for 800 yen!

142
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:30,137
<i>I wish she would've let me buy that for her.</i>

143
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,830
<i>It's the least I could do after all she's done for us.</i>

144
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,129
Wow! What an unbelievable haul!

145
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,143
But I only kept one, 'cause I don't have any
place to keep 'em. And I gave one to Mikuru.

146
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,916
Go ahead and have one, but only one.

147
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,223
Okay, thanks.

148
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,428
Hey, Yuki. What's up with the mask, huh?

149
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:03,168
I bought it.

150
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,399
Oh, okay.

151
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,356
Fireworks! That's what we're gonna do next!

152
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,659
We'll go set up some fireworks!

153
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:15,091
<i>Do you even understand the meaning of the word moderation?</i>

154
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,905
<i>It was summer, and summer vacation.</i>

155
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:21,613
<i>And I guess that's why I wanted to forget about it.</i>

156
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,860
<i>But the truth was, I couldn't ignore it any longer.</i>

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,056
Tomorrow, we're gonna catch some bugs.

158
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:32,384
Haruhi, I don't want to spoil your
fun, but have you finished your homework?

159
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,550
Are you kidding? That stuff's totally
easy. You can finish it in like three days.

160
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,599
Three days?!

161
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:41,829
You have to get rid of that junk first so you
can spend the rest of your summer having fun,

162
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,122
And not worrying about it.

163
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,081
That's the only way to really
get the most out of your vacation.

164
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,135
<i>Why does she have to be so smart?</i>

165
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:55,711
The folks upstairs weren't terribly fair
when they were divvying up the stats for us.

166
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:00,513
Listen up! We're gonna go bug catching tomorrow!

167
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,225
And whoever catches the most bugs is gonna
get to be brigade leader for a whole day!

168
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,173
<i>No thanks.</i>

169
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,299
That sounds like fun. But, can we catch just any bugs?

170
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,971
Hm... No. Only cicadas!

171
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,604
That's it! I'm calling it the SOS
Brigade's cicada catching contest!

172
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,085
<i>The next day was beautiful, sunny and bright.</i>

173
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,089
<i>And although everyone caught
bugs the best way they knew how,</i>

174
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:26,457
<i>The winner of the contest ended up being, you guessed it,</i>

175
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:27,648
<i>Haruhi.</i>

176
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:31,257
It's important to follow the spirit
of catch and release with these guys.

177
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:34,747
You never know. If we let 'em go now,
they might return the favor sometime.

178
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:37,637
<i>Now, what could a cicada possibly do for me?</i>

179
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,606
Hurry! Go back to the mountains!

180
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,838
For some reason, I kinda feel
like Pandora opening her box.

181
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,490
W-Welcome to our store!

182
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,707
<i>We met the next day, even though
we had no idea what was going on.</i>

183
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:03,130
<i>Our cluelessness continued as we
were made to wear frog costumes,</i>

184
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,621
<i>And hand balloons out in front of the local supermarket.</i>

185
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,594
<i>Welcome to our part-time job.</i>

186
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,029
Good work, you guys!

187
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:13,812
<i>What's with the special treatment?</i>

188
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:14,995
You're the best.

189
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,406
The manager's super grateful for all the hard work.

190
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:20,174
Who cares how grateful he is. What about our pay?

191
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,043
That's it.

192
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:21,583
Huh?

193
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:24,174
I've had my eye on this for a while.

194
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:27,074
The manager gave it to us
'cause Mikuru looked so cute in it.

195
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:31,177
<i>We were working, sweat pouring
down our foreheads, for that?!</i>

196
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:33,438
We'll keep 'em in the club room as a souvenir.

197
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:36,962
Mikuru, you have my permission
to wear 'em whenever you want.

198
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,328
Isn't he the greatest?

199
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:50,461
<i>Later that night, my peaceful
slumber was interrupted by a phone call.</i>

200
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:53,593
Damn it.

201
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,220
Kyon...

202
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,148
Miss Asahina?

203
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,911
Yes, it's me.

204
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,948
Something really bad... I don't know...

205
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:13,952
Wha...?

206
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,452
Hello. It's Koizumi.

207
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:19,624
Why are you with Miss Asahina in the middle of the night?

208
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,824
We have a situation here.

209
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,446
Do you think you could come meet us right now?

210
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,996
Absolutely. Where?

211
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,238
Miss Asahina! What happened?

212
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,454
Oh... Oh, Kyon. I can't...

213
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:46,270
I can't go back to the future.

214
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,949
I'll explain it the best I can.

215
00:13:57,124 --> 00:14:00,190
Currently, we're stuck in a time
loop that seems to be infinite.

216
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:04,078
It's hard to believe you're
serious with that smile on your face.

217
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:07,467
Come on, Koizumi, do you realize what you just said?

218
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,819
Of course I do. More than I want to, believe me.

219
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:13,810
Earlier, I was having a word with Miss Asahina.

220
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:16,003
<i>Next time, call me when you have a word with her!</i>

221
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:21,010
And that was when we both realized that
something seemed off about our current flow of time.

222
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,615
Actually, Miss Asahina discovered it.

223
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:26,157
Thanks to her, my suspicions were confirmed.

224
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:28,152
What kind of suspicions?

225
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:32,712
That we'd been reliving the same
period of time over and over again.

226
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,273
You already said that.

227
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,512
We've been repeating the days
between August 17th through the 31st.

228
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,986
It's a never-ending, endless summer.

229
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,253
The future doesn't exist in this world anymore.

230
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:46,504
Time stops at September 1st.

231
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:50,061
That's the reason Miss Asahina
can't travel back to the future.

232
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,526
It's only natural.

233
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:54,455
There's nothing natural about not having a future.

234
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,425
Who's gonna believe such a thing?

235
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:59,476
Well, for starters, we were sort
of hoping you would believe it.

236
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,080
I can try to help explain it.

237
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,058
Here goes.

238
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,879
Because I have to classified information,

239
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:11,297
I used classified information
to get in touch with the future.

240
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:17,448
The thing is, I haven't gotten any
classified information for about a week.

241
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:20,608
And I started to think how weird that was.

242
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:22,924
I was so surprised.

243
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:29,267
I classified information, I really did,
but it was classified information, too.

244
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,311
I don't know what to do.

245
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,906
<i>I don't know how to help you, but I'm wondering,</i>

246
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:38,359
<i>Are all the classified things you're
talking about stuff you can't say on TV?</i>

247
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,634
What about those closed spaces
you were talking about before?

248
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,386
Maybe we're trapped in one of those.

249
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,987
It's not one of those.

250
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,578
A specific section of time has been torn away.

251
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:54,817
At exactly midnight on August the 31st, everything resets,

252
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:58,178
And then time reverts straight back
to the morning of August the 17th.

253
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,502
That's the process.

254
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:00,734
What about our...?

255
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,059
Wait, what about the whole world's memories?

256
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:04,651
Their memory is reset.

257
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,107
Everyone's memory starts over from the beginning.

258
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,339
Another problem involving time. Perfect.

259
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,018
I guess that figures when there's a time traveler around.

260
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:13,674
No.

261
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:16,143
Miss Asahina didn't have anything to do with this.

262
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,410
Then what's causing it?

263
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,797
Miss Suzumiya.

264
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,466
Somewhere inside her, there's a desire
to have summer vacation last forever.

265
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,601
I'm sure she doesn't even realize it.

266
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,057
Oh, come on.

267
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,106
You mean she still hasn't had enough fun?

268
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,464
That's what it looks like.

269
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,129
Perhaps she feels like there's something else that
needs to happen before our summer vacation is over.

270
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:41,522
Man, the trouble she gets us
into is always galactic in scale.

271
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,632
All right, what do you want me to do?

272
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:46,682
If I knew that, we'd have this problem solved by now.

273
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,789
<i>You're too close.</i>

274
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,896
You seem like you're enjoying this.

275
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,494
You wanna tell me why?

276
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,161
Please don't take it the wrong way,

277
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,394
But this explains the feelings of déjà vu I've had,

278
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,271
And the ones you've been feeling as well.

279
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:00,646
Now that I think about it,

280
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:05,744
they were most likely the residue of our memories
from every instance where time had been reset.

281
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:09,369
Are we the only ones? Or can other people feel this, too?

282
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,925
I doubt that.

283
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,548
You and I are acceptations to the rule, though.

284
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,755
The only people who can sense this strangeness,

285
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:19,460
Are the ones closest to Miss Suzumiya.

286
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:21,247
What about Haruhi?

287
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,287
Does she even know this stuff is happening?

288
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,327
No, I don't think so.

289
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,276
Besides, it would be very bad for us if she did.

290
00:17:28,818 --> 00:17:32,312
However, there is someone who is
unaffected by the feelings of déjà vu.

291
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,751
As a matter of fact,

292
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,405
This person remembers everything that's happened.

293
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:39,382
Oh, yeah? Who would that person be?

294
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:40,704
You already know.

295
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,400
It's Miss Nagato.

296
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,283
The data integration thought entity
transcends space and time. So does she.

297
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:50,789
Is that true?

298
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:51,604
Yes.

299
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,528
Then, you remember everything?

300
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,401
Yes.

301
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:56,592
Really?

302
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:59,102
So, how many times has this happened to us?

303
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:03,608
This would be 15,498 times?

304
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,252
Fifteen thousand, four-hundred and ninety-eight?

305
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:12,022
What do you mean 15,498? What are you saying, Nagato?

306
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,257
And, you're being completely serious?

307
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,083
Yes.

308
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:20,340
So, you're saying we've done the exact
same things every time that many times?

309
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,985
Not necessarily.

310
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:25,657
Throughout 15,498 repetitions,

311
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,907
We did not attend a bon festival the 2,391st time

312
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,279
And the 11,054th time.

313
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:37,835
We went to the festival but did not
go to a fish scooping booth 437 times.

314
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,473
We obtained part-time jobs
9,025 times and there were six...

315
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,071
Okay. I got it.

316
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:49,802
<i>Fifteen-thousand, four-hundred ninety-eight.</i>

317
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:57,761
<i>That's what she said. Times
two weeks. That's... 594 years.</i>

318
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:01,824
<i>She's the only one who remembers
everything we do all those times.</i>

319
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,468
<i>And she's had to repeat them over and over again.</i>

320
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:06,412
<i>Nagato...</i>

321
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:10,091
<i>I can't even begin to image what it's been like for you.</i>

322
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,736
That's gotta be the craziest story ever.

323
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:22,315
<i>The next night, we went stargazing.</i>

324
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:26,565
<i>We were on the balcony of Nagato's
apartment, since her place had the best view.</i>

325
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,335
<i>Koizumi brought the telescope.</i>

326
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,655
I wonder if they're real.

327
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,468
What's real?

328
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:32,341
Martians.

329
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,642
<i>I kinda hope they aren't.</i>

330
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:36,029
I can't see anyone on the surface.

331
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:40,891
You know, I bet there is a reserved race of beings
living underground. They're probably friendly, too.

332
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,105
<i>Yeah. Dream on.</i>

333
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,901
Whenever us humans finally land on Mars,

334
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:49,314
I'm sure the Martians will pop out from wherever
they're hiding and say, "Welcome to Mars," or something.

335
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,696
It'll get mistaken for an attack.

336
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:55,870
Oh. I'm bored. I'm gonna look for UFOs now.

337
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,393
I wish I knew what else she wanted to do.

338
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,204
Yes, what indeed.

339
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:08,023
If we knew that, we'd be on
our way to solving this problem.

340
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,313
Here's something. Why don't we try this?

341
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:17,439
What if someone were to grab Miss Suzumiya from behind
and then they whisper, "I love you" right into her ear.

342
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,986
And who's going to be doing this?

343
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,416
Who else could play that role other than you?

344
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,944
I'm vetoing that idea!

345
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:31,715
All right. Shall I give it a try?

346
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,934
No, I'm just kidding. That isn't a role I can play.

347
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,151
Besides, it would just confuse Miss Suzumiya.

348
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:53,380
<i>The next day, we swung for
the fences at the batting cages.</i>

349
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:03,887
Hey, Nagato.

350
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,578
You knew about this time loop we're in way
before Miss Asahina figured it out, didn't you?

351
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:09,888
Yes.

352
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,756
So, how come you didn't say anything about it?

353
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,856
My function is to observe.

354
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:22,927
Right.

355
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,479
<i>We kept chugging along, doing
all kinds of summer vacation things.</i>

356
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:30,397
<i>We just kept going and going and doing stuff.</i>

357
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,489
<i>And the whole time, all I could think was
that none of it was going to be enough for Haruhi.</i>

358
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,184
<i>But what could I do about it? Nothing.</i>

359
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:41,118
<i>So, we ended up like we always did at August the 30th.</i>

360
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,776
That's it, we've done everything on our list.

361
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,704
But now I'm wondering if we did enough... if...

362
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,494
No, I guess we did.

363
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:57,229
Hey, is there anything else you want to do?

364
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:01,985
Oh, okay.

365
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:06,147
I guess we did everything we wanted
to do over the summer, so that's enough.

366
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,918
<i>No, it's not. Not by a long shot.</i>

367
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:11,072
<i>You're still not satisfied.</i>

368
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,587
Okay, we're done for today.

369
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:18,046
I set tomorrow aside just in case,
but you can take the day off, I guess.

370
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:20,452
I'll see you guys at the club room on Monday.

371
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,856
<i>No, wait! Haruhi!</i>

372
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:26,048
<i>There's that feeling again.</i>

373
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,596
<i>It's strong... Stronger than all the others.</i>

374
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,347
<i>I can't let Haruhi leave.</i>

375
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,841
<i>If I let her walk out that door,</i>

376
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:39,267
<i>We'll end up reliving the past two weeks
again and again for a thousand more times.</i>

377
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:41,292
<i>But... what should I do?</i>

378
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,369
<i>What should I say?</i>

379
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:47,107
<i>There must've been a clue in something Haruhi said.</i>

380
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:48,655
<i>But what was it?</i>

381
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,516
<i>What's she been saying all this time?</i>

382
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:56,688
<i>I don't know. I can't remember.</i>

383
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:05,713
<i>It's August 31st.</i>

384
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,945
<i>And I still haven't touched my homework yet.</i>

385
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,423
<i>Whatever. Doesn't matter.</i>

386
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:21,396
<i>There's no point doing it. I mean, we're just
gonna keep reliving the last couple of weeks.</i>

387
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,783
<i>Whatever happens next, whether tomorrow comes or not,</i>

388
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,449
<i>A different version of me will have to deal with it.</i>
