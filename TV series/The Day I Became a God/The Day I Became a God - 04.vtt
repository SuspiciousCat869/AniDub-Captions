WEBVTT

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.476
[HIROTO sighs]
Another dead end, huh?

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.977
Someone could at
least leave a design

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.563
in the employee
storage or something.

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:23.607
Still, they can't
go and mindwipe

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.776
the people they've
contracted with.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.861
One would suspect that
they're looking to

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.281
start producing hardware
on a large scale soon.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.826
Everything is ready,
just like you asked for.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.328
It was no minor feat,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.331
but the CEO will be
meeting with Doctor Asama.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:40.874
Good idea, right?

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.417
Now then, let's launch Operation

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.254
Talk to the Co‐Author
of Doctor Korogi's Thesis!

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.505
[RAITA]
You understand that in order to

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.632
secure this appointment,
the CEO had to

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.385
create a new charitable
foundation in his field.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.053
Well, that's what it
takes to get people

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:56.515
to play ball sometimes, right?
He is a shrewd one.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.767
Don't forget about all
she's done for you.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.269
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.064
[CEO 03A] Doctor Asama,
you've known Doctor Korogi

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.816
for quite some time, correct?

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.944
Yes. He and I've been
acquainted for years.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.446
[CEO 03A] And what would you say
if I asked you to describe him?

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.409
Brilliant, nearly to the
point of being insufferable.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.202
Do I also recall
correctly that you were

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.538
the sole co‐author
working with Doctor Korogi

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.332
on his thesis in the field
of computer science?

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.333
Yes.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.751
[CEO 03A] Do you have
any memories you would

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.378
care to share with us
from that time?

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.213
[ASAMA chuckles]
Well that would depend.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.673
Have you read the thesis?

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.009
Yes. I read through
it back when I was

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.678
studying under him
during grad school.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.305
Natural Language Processing:

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.223
Automatically Generated
Corpus Samples

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.225
and High‐Precision
Text Segmentation.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.145
Using the Korogi‐Asama
Model Algorithm.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.272
Yes, that's the one. Pardon.

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:47.357
It seems you know
his work quite well.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.359
The real‐world application
of his theory

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.237
forms the basis for our
company's product line.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.032
It's a work of art.
I can hardly conceive of

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.242
a theory more
beautifully constructed.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.620
Nor can I. It moved me.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.288
Now I've built a
business giving life

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.248
to the technology
he envisioned.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.044
Yes, and it seems quite safe
to call this business a success.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.421
And, with the help of
this new foundation,

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.006
my field now stands to reap the

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.425
benefits of that
success, I suppose.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.636
[CEO 03A]
Let's get back to the subject.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:16.845
In the course of your research,

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.973
do you recall any of the
exchanges between you?

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:23.310
Oh, absolutely. In particular,

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:25.729
he would frequently
philosophize about love.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.356
Really?

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.191
[ASAMA] "We're born
out of an act of love,

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.569
and happiness in our lives is
derived from the love of others.

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.906
So I would like to
quantify it. Love."

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.366
The doctor said that?

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.826
There's been research into
"measures of happiness."

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.329
‐‐But to quantify‐‐
‐‐Of course. It was a lark.

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.040
An idle thought he
never sought to realize.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:45.999
Then why?

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.044
Why fixate on an
unanswerable question?

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.672
[ASAMA]
I can only guess.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.465
Although, if I must,

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.551
perhaps it was for the
sake of a family member.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.388
[HIROTO]
So I was right.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:03.058
Our dear Doctor Korogi
had a family after all.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.069
[ANCHOR 04A] We'll report
more on the investigation...

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.740
[HINA yawns]
Good morning.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.659
Good morning to you,
Hina. Did you sleep well?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:45.660
[HINA]
Mmhmm.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:46.912
[TOKIKO]
Does toast sound good?

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.288
Yup.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.041
[TOKIKO] You take milk and sugar
in your coffee, don't you?

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:51.958
Yup.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.794
...Ms. Tengan?
Any summer plans?

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.921
[KAKO] Oh, I'm constantly
making plans...

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.672
And what be this?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.383
I'm watching 'cause
Kako Tengan is on.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.344
[TOKIKO] Yota's a little bit
obsessed with her.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.970
[HINA]
I know not the name.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.972
[YOTA] She's one of the best
lawyers of our time!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.307
And gorgeous.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.184
And generally brilliant.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.228
And I really wanna meet her.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.313
And wherefore?
Hast thou forgotten

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.273
the brilliant embodiment
of womanly allure

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.900
with whom thou sharest thy days?

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.944
Who? Izanami?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:24.032
Me, fool! Open thy eyes
to the allure of me!

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.993
Or not.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:31.414
[HINA humming]

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.876
[YOTA] You're pretty into that.
So are you a Mahjong fan now?

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.127
I am enthralled!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.964
Yea, it doth tax the mind
and stir the heart.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.132
Indeed, tis a great thrill!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.093
Victory is mine!

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.638
Now rejoice, as yet another
boon I grant to thee.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.392
Yea, for ere long, shalt thou
meet the fair Kako Tengan.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.393
Huh.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.895
[HINA] For in thy name I
prevailed, and in thy name,

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:57.023
I have claimed a seat at
the Libertas final table,

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.191
two days hence.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.986
And there the lady
barrister presideth.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.363
[YOTA]
What craziness did you say?!

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.283
It's true.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.243
My name is right there
on the player list!

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.078
Holy crap, I'm trending!

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.163
Yea, for the champion
of Mahjong Online

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.082
soon takes to the earthly realm.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:14.958
[YOTA gasps]

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.127
[HINA] Never again shall
such an opportunity arise

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.545
to meet the lady Tengan.

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:19.921
Yeah, but see,

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.048
I know nothing at all
about mahjong.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.134
Indeed, and therefore
I shall offer thee

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.219
my knowledge of the game!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.805
Yea, 'tis done.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.057
Isn't there more for me
to learn before then?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.978
Nay, 'twould be to no end,
as fortune doth smile upon thee.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.272
Okay, but it can't hurt
to look up the ru‐‐

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.106
[HINA]
Desist!

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.107
Why should I?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.234
Lies fester online
as worms in filth!

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.986
[YOTA]
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.614
Proceed in thy life as usual.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.077
[HINA gasps]
How could a creature so small

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.288
conceal items of
such great size?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.915
[YOTA] I bet the chests
were on the ground,

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.625
but the monsters hid them.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.210
Using mirrors placed
in the cave beforehand.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.504
What skill!
Yet despite their ingenuity,

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.591
they lack the sense to flee
an unwinnable fight!

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.845
[YOTA]
I'm heading out. Bye.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.181
Wow, someone's got
his game face on.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.142
Whoa. Ashura? You're here.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:18.480
Ashura?! This jerk
has a god name, too?!

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.398
[YOTA] I guess I never
really introduced you, huh.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.734
[HINA] Everybody you know
has a god name!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.152
Why do I gotta be
boring crappy Hina?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.279
So what's the anime nun
still doing here?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:30.659
She's staying with my family
'cause, yeah. So, what's up?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.827
The whole internet's
been tellin' me my boy Yota's

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.205
about to accomplish
some real big things.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.916
Obviously, your friends
came to cheer you on.

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:38.875
Yes. Hi.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:39.876
[YOTA]
Izanami?

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:43.004
Oh my. You two
have grown rather close.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.006
‐‐Um, we are not close!
‐‐Yea, for I uplift him!

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.758
[YOTA]
Anyway, why are you here?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.386
I have some
familiarity with mahjong.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:52.138
That cool? We're with you.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.017
Thanks. Let's go then.
I'm off to win!

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.895
For motives thou
shan't disclose.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.773
[DAICHI] Hmm. Hey, honey,
do you have any idea

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.525
where my good suit's gone?

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.819
Uh‐oh. I might have
made a mistake

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.071
and taken it in
with the dry cleaning.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.785
[ASHURA]
Give 'em hell, bro.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.371
We're gonna be up in
the stands cheering for ya.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.673
[YOTA] So these are the
people I'm up against, huh?

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.971
[DIRECTOR 04A]
Ms. Tengan has arrived.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.599
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Kako Tengan.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.727
It's so good to
have you here today.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.021
[YOTA]
Wow. It's really her!

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.523
Just as the name of the
event would suggest,

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:46.985
the Libertas Cup should
exhibit a free style of play.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.446
So I hope you'll
show me something fresh.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.157
Play a game of mahjong
like I've never seen before.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.867
Not bound by convention.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.452
Ah, and you.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.286
Yes?

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.455
Dear, your bold tactics turned

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.999
the online mahjong
world on its head.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.335
Now that you've made it here,
I can see them in the flesh.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.881
[YOTA]
I have to meet her expectations!

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.425
And win this game I don't know.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.511
[AKIRA] Now I'm ready to show
my novel tactics to the world.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.804
Sounds fun!

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.347
Whaddya think about him?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.557
Can't say from just that.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.767
Fair.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.770
[YOTA] If you drilled a monkey
on the rules for long enough,

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.813
you could make it a mahjong pro.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.316
To me that's nothing
worth wanting.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.485
What I want is to
push to my limits

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.196
and take my skills somewhere
beyond human potential.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.948
What I want is to play
the mahjong of the gods...

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.993
Good, good. He has
done as I instructed.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:40.121
Yota's talkin' the talk,
and he'll walk the walk, too!

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.667
The time has come.
Let the match begin!

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.799
[SARUTAHIKO] It's fair to say
this match will determine

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.551
who's the best young player
in the Mahjong world.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.178
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Eyes on amateur Narukami,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.680
who cut through the internet
prelims to get here.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:01.101
[KAKO] Let's see how his
play holds up in person.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.393
[SARUTAHIKO]
Koganeyama looking to form

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.521
a complete hand straight away.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.396
[HISAHARU]
Riichi!

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.273
[COMMENTATOR 04A] Koganeyama,
pre‐emptive dealer riichi!

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.735
[YOTA] The tile is sideways.
That means something, right?

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.278
A superstition.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.906
[YOTA] Oh, that's right.
It means nothing!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.157
There!

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:16.991
[HISAHARU]
Ron!

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.201
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
An ippatsu riichi!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.120
All simple pinfu with one dora!

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.205
With the ura dora,
that's a dealer haneman!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.541
That cost him 18,000 points!

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.376
[ASHURA] What's up?
Everyone's making noises

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.086
like he did something crazy.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.505
Yeah. Threw away points.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.715
Aye, for a handicap.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.843
[YOTA] I just lost
a buncha point sticks.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.636
I gotta get 'em back!

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.472
[AKIRA]
Pon!

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.808
[COMMENTATOR 04A] Yatagarasu
with a green dragon pung!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.976
There's a red dragon!

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:44.144
[AKIRA]
Pon!

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.396
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Yatagarasu has a ready hand!

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.648
[SARUTAHIKO] There's two
dragon groups revealed.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.733
They'd have to be fools
to move on this.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.194
[YOTA]
It's blank? What's going on?

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.238
'Tis a factory error.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.906
[YOTA]
Well screw it then!

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.242
[AKIRA]
Ron! 16,300!

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:00.702
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Narukami takes the bait!

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.996
A half flush, all pungs,
little three dragons.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.998
A baiman hand!

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.667
[KYOKO] He went bankrupt
after two hands.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.420
So, that's bad?

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.297
He has negative points, so yes.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.091
Narukami doesn't seem
interested in winning.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.802
I find this so intriguing.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.930
He's surely building up
to something here.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.933
[YOTA]
No, I'm out of point sticks!

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.352
I just gotta complete a hand!

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.479
Wait. Hina told me
about an arrangement

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.232
I think I can score with here.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.860
Shouldst thou obtain the
same number in different colors,

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.278
points shall flow!

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.155
Ron! Eat this!

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.992
Okay. Is there a yaku there?

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.244
What does Narukami think he has?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.122
Mixed, double chow!

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.374
What is a double chow?

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.168
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
What is Narukami doing?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.711
[SARUTAHIKO]
Does he not know the rules?

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.214
Why do these people
look like they're about to riot?

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.340
He got a chombo.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.466
[ASHURA gasps]
What's that?

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.967
It's like a foul.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.054
The guy's a rank amateur.
How do we deal with this?

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:02.513
[KAKO]
He's not.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.266
The Libertas Cup is
about freedom in mahjong.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:08.686
It's about an approach to the
game unfettered by convention.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.773
That young man has seen
past the surface of the tiles.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.650
He's turning them
into something new.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.693
Play on. No penalty.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:18.154
But in exchange for
recognizing this hand,

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:22.200
from here on out, Narukami is
forbidden to play existing yaku.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.160
[COMMENTATOR 04A] In a shocking
turn, the tournament organizer

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.496
allows Narukami's
mixed double chow yaku!

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:27.664
It's a valid hand!

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.582
This makes no sense.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:33.670
[HINA chuckles, cackles]

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.589
[YOTA] Nice! I got back
some of the points I lost!

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.634
Just gotta remember
what the next rule was.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.844
Suited tiles in
sequence may be played.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.930
And their number?

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:48.017
Yea, they shall number
as many as thou please!

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.769
[YOTA]
Perfect. That means...

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.062
Ron!

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:54.023
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Narukami with, let's find out!

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.278
[YOTA]
Partial pure straight!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.529
[ALL gasp]

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.115
Why aren't the last
two tiles there?

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.576
[TETSUYA]
Riichi!

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.328
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Hikawa's been biding his time.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.455
Now on the offensive!

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.290
[TETSUYA]
Kan!

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.874
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Concealed east tile kong!

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.211
And the kan dora is east!
He's loaded with dora!

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.045
[TETSUYA]
Tsumo.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.547
[COMMENTATOR 04A] Hikawa wins
straight off the draw

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.341
from the kong! With that,
he is now on top!

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.051
[YOTA] So you get more
dora when you do that,

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.846
which means you get more points.

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.598
[HINA] Gather the tiles of the
east, west, south, and north,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.601
and for thy feat
be blessed! [gasps]

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.270
[YOTA]
I have all of those!

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.939
Not sure how it works,
but I'm doin' it!

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.609
Full compass set!

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.653
That is not a thing.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.198
[COMMENTATOR 04A] And Narukami
flips a dora indicator.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.284
[SARUTAHIKO]
I think he must be confused.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.369
[YOTA]
That's my play! Ron!

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.621
Full compass set, three dora!

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.206
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Narukami with yet another hand

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.042
never before played in mahjong!

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.919
Koganeyama in the dealer
seat for this pivotal hand.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.256
[YOTA] Wow, my hand
is a complete mess.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.466
[gasps]

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:05.053
When the indicator be nine,
the dora returneth to one.

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.764
Thus, without doubt.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.349
[YOTA]
Hey, that's right!

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.516
Ron!

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.645
Narukami showing only
three valid groups.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.356
[SARUTAHIKO] It appears he's
arguing that eight, nine,

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:19.108
and one constitute a valid chow.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.612
[KAKO] The dora wraps around
when the indicator is nine.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:25.656
But to try and form
a chow based on that...

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.747
Aye, the dora augmenteth
thy score by one han.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.791
Yet, what then of its neighbor?

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.919
[YOTA] Obviously it should
give you half the points!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.421
[YOTA]
Ron! Mixed double chow!

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.715
Dora neighbor dora neighbor!

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:43.883
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Not a dora dora.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.010
It's a dora neighbor
dora neighbor!

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.679
[ASHURA] Awesome.
That's two hands in a row!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.556
[KYOKO]
But he's still a ways behind.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.560
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Narukami with a ready hand.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.354
[SARUTAHIKO]
Looks like pure outside groups.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.940
[HINA] If thy hand beareth
a terminal in each group

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:02.443
then it be pure.
And therefore...

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.736
Ron!

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:04.821
Does he have it?

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:08.032
No! His last tile looked
like the one of characters

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:11.327
when his hand was on it,
but it's the two!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.578
Outside‐ish!

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.081
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
There's a non‐terminal group!

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.583
Hell yeah, Yota's
momentum's pickin' up!

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.419
He just broke even!

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.839
[YOTA gasps]

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.882
[HINA] Thou may'st
form thy hand's pair

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.260
using the tile thy
opponent casts off.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:31.556
But neither "chii" nor "pon"
shalt thou then declare.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.890
Poh.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.100
Poh?!

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.184
Poh...?

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.104
So he should have just
revealed a group with that.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.856
He flips just one.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:41.858
No way. Calling for a pair?

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.609
Poh! Poh!

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.571
[COMMENTATOR 04A] Narukami
calling back‐to‐back poh!

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.658
[YOTA]
Ron. Open seven pairs!

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.077
Dora neighbor, dora neighbor!

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.745
Yeah!

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.624
[COMMENTATOR 04A]
Good hands all around.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:15:59.959
They're about to clash.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.043
‐‐Huh?
‐‐[AKIRA] Riichi!

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.338
What's this? Yatagarasu

Koganeyama called on a dora!

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.475
He's up against two
riichi and a dora pung.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.311
So something really
bad's happening?

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:22.148
[YOTA] Whatever's happening,
it seems like it's really bad!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.524
Oh yeah!

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.361

As it is in Uno. So too here!

He's denying them his tiles!
He refuses to draw or discard!

At last.

Something looks off.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.897
He has extra tiles.
That's a chombo, but...

going, aren't they?

Of course!

Except, that'd be an

For right now.

What can we call this other
than a "consecutive riichi"?

No, no comment.

Ms. Tengan, as the
organizer of this event,

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.997
would you care to
offer any comments?

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.999
I would. I have no doubt that

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:30.086
this boy's unorthodox
play upset many viewers.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:34.465
But if you ask me, he has
opened new frontiers in mahjong.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.342
The game has been born again.

Today's match is certain
to go down in history.

And even if it's
in a small way,

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.558
even if the Fourth Libertas Cup
is nothing but a footnote,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.477
then my work will be done.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.145

you do, let me drink.

And then, you can show
me your endless riichi.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.197

Far more than fame alone shall
be the spoils of thy conquest.

A queen's heart
shalt thou plunder.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.210
There's no way I can do that!

Please show me your
endless riichi.

to cross this threshold?

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:17.401
[KAKO] I don't have to play.
I just wanna see you do it.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:21.030
Make it grow. Show me
how big it can get.

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:29.789
I called it "infinite"
but eventually

the last tile is played!

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.833
And like our time
together, it ends.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:36.545
[KAKO] What? Why should it?
You could score big here.

00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:39.840
Most players won't see a yaku of
this caliber in their careers!

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.802
You'd throw away the best
hand you're ever gonna get?

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:45.387
You see, another woman
has taken my heart now,

leaving me in furiten.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.434
Which means...
I can't score now!

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:55.981
But why? How could you
just shoot me down?

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:59.860
Wait. You, shoot down me?

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.570
Hey, you! Apprehend
the shameless tease

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.905

the champ! Good job, Yota!

Where is Izanami?

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.715
Gone home. Why?

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.968
[YOTA] Already? I hoped
she might at least

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.345
stick around and
talk to me first!

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.596
So, did ya get the booty?

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.723
[YOTA]
That loot's too high‐level!

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:31.225
Ah, 'tis a waste.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.728
If thou now abstain,
when wilt thou partake?

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.898
For only 13 days remain.
