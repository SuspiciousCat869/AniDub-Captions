[HIROTO]
The little girl is Hina Sato.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.109
She's Doctor Korogi's
granddaughter.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.153
She has a congenital
neurological condition

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.239
called Logos Syndrome,
but it seems like

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.407
she's fully recovered.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.951
Except that shouldn't
be possible

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.495
according to current
medical science.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.081
Meaning Doctor Korogi's
final research project

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.499
was to save her.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.584
How would he have
pulled that off though?

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.503
I couldn't say.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.879
But his work was about much more

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.965
than computer
science, obviously.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.092
It touched on materials science,

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.595
electrical engineering,
even medicine and linguistics.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.473
And it somehow resulted in
a cure for Logos Syndrome?

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.142
We're still missing
a couple of steps here.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.936
[HIROTO]
After the doctor passed on,

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.272
Hina went to live with
Mister and Missus Narukami,

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.524
two former students of his.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.401
I'm sure he arranged that.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.402
Makes sense.

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.279
What's bizarre is that
nobody's done anything

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.447
to conceal her existence.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.448
The other weird thing is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.410
this Yota Narukami
kid's involvement.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.829
Senior at Mikuriya
Public High School.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.372
Basketball player.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.915
I've dug through
his online history

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:23.292
along with all his connections,

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.670
and everything about him
says "basic teenage boy."

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:28.880
And then suddenly he
comes out of nowhere

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.508
with this PR guy schtick,
saves a ramen restaurant,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.261
and gets a huge chunk
of free airtime.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.221
So, sounds pretty legit?

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.431
No.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:38.557
[HIROTO]
Then he takes out the top

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.559
mahjong players in the country,

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.979
after walking over everybody
in the online prelims.

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.274
And you believe Hina Sato
played a part in this somehow.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.278
I'm gonna keep working on it.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:40.178
[HIROTO humming]

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.268
Wha‐‐ Coincidence?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.812
No. There's a logic to it.

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:51.606
These were all clearly
intentional actions.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.777
But no one could have calculated
these outcomes. No way.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:05.412
[HIROTO]
No! Impossible!

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:07.539
But then, when I factor
in everything we know

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.874
about the professor
and his work,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.418
it's the only answer
that makes any sense!

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.671
There has to be some more
precise information out there!

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.843
[CEO 03A] It seems implausible
on the face of it.

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.596
[RAITA] Agreed. But the doctor
had the knowledge, skills,

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.598
and funding to make it work.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.308
[CEO 03A] If it's true,
this would change

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.312
the current world order,
or rather, upend it entirely.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.480
What was he after?

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.482
Yeah. Good question.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.942
But we do know
the implications of it.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.737
The world is a network of
networks and this technology

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.072
offers a master key to it all.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.075
Total, global
information supremacy.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.996
In other words,
the omniscience of a god.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.631
Okay, found it! There it is!

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.801
[HIROTO'S FATHER] Good job.
Now transfer the money.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.511
Don't screw this up, kid.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.553
Uh‐huh.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.515
[HIROTO]
Transfer complete!

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.474
[HIROTO'S FATHER]
Hey!

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:08.558
[HIROTO'S MOTHER]
It's done.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.436
Give my regards to the
branch manager, please.

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:16.066
[HIROTO'S MOTHER] You did
such a great job today, Hiroto!

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.692
Good boy!

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.070
[HIROTO'S FATHER]
Best son a couple could ask for!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.114
[HIROTO'S FATHER]
I don't care if you want to!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.200
Do you get how fucked
we are if you don't?

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.452
We're already neck deep.
We can't back out!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.620
Please, stop this.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.288
What we're doing
isn't right, Dad!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.082
You've known from the
start what we're doing,

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.667
so why's it a problem now?

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.836
Don't act like your hands
are clean in all this!

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.128
[HIROTO'S MOTHER]
We are your parents.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.548
Do you wanna see us
thrown in jail? Huh?

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.760
[HIROTO gasps]
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

[HIROTO'S MOTHER]
Yes. Yes. Forgive us.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.015
Yes, sir, immediately!

Listen, you little shit!

[HIROTO groaning]

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.567
[HIROTO'S FATHER sighs] Don't
you care what happens to us?

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.111
There are no second chances!

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:04.948
[HIROTO]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.369
[gasps] A nightmare.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.997
Shit. I feel like
I could throw up.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.623
[door opens]

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.710
What'd you run off
for all of a sudden?

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.461
You've reached a conclusion?

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.588
Think so.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.924
Then you're going to
report it directly to the CEO.

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:27.762
[HIROTO]
Sure, whatever. First, takoyaki.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.228
So, how was your day?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.772
It's taken a rather
unpleasant turn.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.983
A chip‐size quantum
computer that's capable of

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.444
operating at standard
temperature and pressure.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.447
It's been in development and
still somehow, nobody knew.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.115
[chuckles] You think
that's crazy,

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.784
what if I told you there was
already one out there?

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.161
Is that true?

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.621
Now here's my proposal!

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.830
[TOP BRASS 03A]
That's not why you're here!

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.373
[CEO 03A]
I'm listening.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.793
We get the quantum computer,
and you let me analyze it.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.004
This might be the
single most important

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.672
technological
breakthrough in history,

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.341
and it's practically
within our grasp!

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.052
Let's go! I can make
this work for you!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.386
Better than anyone!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.347
Let me handle it and the
whole world could be yours!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.766
[CEO 03A]
There will be no analysis.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.601
Your job is to find
Doctor Korogi's

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:18.647
quantum computer
and report back.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.025
Go, young Mister
Suzuki. Do your job.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.986
[HIROTO]
Like hell.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:30.075
Why do you damn suits keep
putting my talent to waste?!

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.912
Why'd you lock me
away in that place?

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:37.374
Why do you throw
all the grunt work at me?

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.541
Screw that!

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.794
If people realized
what I'm capable of,

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.129
they would bow down
and worship me!

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.798
But your heads are
too far up your asses

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.341
to see what's in front of you!

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.217
Easy.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.177
Bite me, lapdog!

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.679
[HIROTO groans]

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.474
I warned you.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.434
You don't talk
that way to the CEO,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.311
do you understand me?

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.024
[HIROTO]
All of you adults are the same.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.694
Making me live my whole
life inside a cage,

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.071
and on a leash
when you let me out.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.407
'Cause you haven't got
the brainpower to keep up.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.242
A bunch of greedy pigs
who can't deal with

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:13.410
a kid being smarter than you!

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.995
You little‐‐

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.665
‐‐That's enough.
‐‐Ma'am.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.583
Our goal for you is
to see your talents

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.128
used for a beneficial purpose.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.505
And I personally want to
keep you off the dark path

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.507
you were on when we first met.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.301
I genuinely wish
for you to do good.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.142
I'm going back
to my workstation.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.977
A wise choice.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.521
[HIROTO]
What is this?

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.065
It's like I'm a
glorified IT guy to them.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.192
I don't believe that's
the sentiment our CEO

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.694
was trying to convey to you.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.363
Dunno what else it would be.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.116
[RAITA] It's hard to
fully express, but...

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.951
Maybe affection?

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.204
Honestly, why do you
talk like such an old man?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.959
Although. I have enjoyed it.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.544
Sniffing him out.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.589
[HIROTO] The quantum computer
is out there somewhere

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.091
in the ocean of information.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.260
Otherwise it's
hardly a computer,

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.512
it's just a fancy calculator.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.727
[HIROTO] He was a genius,
but I've tracked him this far.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.146
There's no way I don't find it.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.701
Diving now. Hiroto Suzuki!

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:53.802
Come on. We've turned
the place into a dump.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.054
An ocean should be
a soup of life.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.348
Not this mess.

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.058
How selfish can sapience be,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.561
that it twists nature like this
to better suit its needs?

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.651
Hey there, buddy.
Did you get lost?

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.152
Where are you goin', huh?

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.904
[dolphin squeaks]

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:16.407
Got it. You're prob'ly gonna
wanna head toward the shallows.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.119
[dolphin squeaks]

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.038
[HIROTO] It's not always
safe down at this depth.

You can run into all

Cool, you're all set now.

It's farther down.
I've still gotta go deeper.

I've definitely
gone in pretty deep.

Hey there.

How did a tiny little thing like
you find yourself way down here?

You're swimming in
some dangerous waters.

you're here, but...

rolled right off of it.

still have to prove myself!

Yes.

And the result is that she's
able to live a healthy life.

Huh? It's not like it's your
fault that it started raining.

hath been gravely amiss

got something wrong?

ended 30 days after we met,

no more of it to be seen.

learned the way of deicide

and thereby slain

so too have I come
to better see myself.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.052
These men are gonna hurt her!

00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.261
[HIKARI]
Me, too.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.555
I don't know how,
but I'm sure that Kyoko's right!

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.765
Yeah, same.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.768
Whoever these creeps are,
it's up to us to hold 'em back!

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.270
[KAKO] Agreed. I don't know
where they came from,

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.606
but I'm damn sure
they're the bad guys.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.316
Ready, guards?

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:12.568
[LOAN SHARK 03A, CRONY 04A]
Hell yeah! We got these jerks!

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.529
Broseph. Grab Hina!

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.740
[YOTA]
You guys.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.034
Okay. Good luck!

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:23.037
[HINA gasps]
Wait. Yota!

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:23.871
[MAN 09A]
Get them!

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.623
[LOAN SHARK 03A]
Halt! You'll not pass!

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.041
En garde!

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.344
[HINA gasps]

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:43.015
Whither goest thou?

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:47.019
As far as I possibly can,
somewhere they won't find you!

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.896
Wherefore?

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:52.400
Please tell me, Yota! Answer!

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.526
[YOTA gasps]

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.945
[HINA]
Why?

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.655
How couldn't I?

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.074
Hina. I'm trying to protect you!

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.117
But why?

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.828
Why wager thy
wellbeing for my sake?

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.496
'Cause I...

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.832
I've had so much
fun this summer.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.209
It's like I've been through a
lifetime's worth of experiences

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.545
in just a month.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:16.048
All of that is
because I met you.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.801
My time with you
has been incredible!

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:21.971
And so I want that time
to go on forever!

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.514
Is that a dumb reason?

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:26.267
Call me a fool or
a buffoon or a blaggard.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.686
I want to hear that right now!

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.312
And when summer ends,

00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:33.190
when fall and winter pass and
we carry on to the new year,

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.359
I still want you
there at my side!

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:38.362
I'm begging you,
Hina. Please, run!

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.865
I know what you want,
but not why.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:44.410
It's because... Because I...

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:53.002
Hina. I wanna protect you
because I love you!

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.757
[YOTA]
With all my heart.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:59.341
You get it now?

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:05.222
[gasps] Really. I never
thought the day would come

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:08.017
when I'd hear that from
somebody besides Grampa.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:09.393
Not just me.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:12.188
Mom and Dad and Sora and
all our friends who came here

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:13.939
to help us put
the movie together.

We all love you!

And we all wanna
help you, so please run!

'Tis of no use.

For wheresoever we may go,
so too might they follow.

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:24.658
Indeed there can be no
place on all the earth

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.160
beyond their grasp.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:27.453
You're wrong.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.163
There has to be somewhere!

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.957
But forsooth,
I am an omniscient god.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.876
My eyes see all things.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.462
And I say to thee,
no such place exists.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:40.007
No! It does. I'm sure!

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:43.511
[gasps] Yota.
Do thine eyes weep?

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.931
We'll find somewhere safe.
Run with me!

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.767
Thanks to thee, Yota.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:53.521
As all things must pass,
so shall my summer with thee.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.940
But this warmth
that fills my heart.

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:59.068
If this alone I may
yet carry with me,

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.237
then I shall be satisfied.
