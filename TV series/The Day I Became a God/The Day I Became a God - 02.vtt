00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.323
[YOTA]
Who is this girl?

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.326
And why am I walking her
back to my house right now?

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.037
[ODIN humming]

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.830
[YOTA]
All right, this is the place.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.041
[HINA] Yea, and indeed
it be as fine a place

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.377
as one might find in
this realm. Kudos to thee.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.631
Well I didn't build it,
but thank you.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.132
Hey, I'm home.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.259
Ah, welcome back, dear!

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.011
Oh my. She's here.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.888
Hello there! What's your name?

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.348
‐‐It's Sato.
‐‐Hi, I'm Sato!

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.974
No, I'm a god!

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.018
Thou shalt address me as Odin.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.646
Odin. And your
first name dear?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:26.647
Hina!

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.898
Well, hi, Hina!

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.316
[HINA]
Be that a smirk?

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:30.150
Huh?

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:31.360
At the surname Sato,

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.819
whose bearers
abound in this land

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.780
as blooms on the wisteria vine?

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.823
Or at "Hina," 'cause it's
the first thing that comes up

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.367
when you search for
baby girl names?!

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.160
I wasn't even smiling, okay?

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:43.455
Now, Yota. Every name is
a gift from parent to child,

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.915
given from a place of love.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.541
Don't laugh at that.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.001
[HINA]
She speaketh true.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.836
Though unto her own
child she would grant

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.047
no lesser title than
"bearer of the sun,"

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.507
still her words be true.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.259
[TOKIKO] Welcome, Hina.
Stay as long as you like.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.012
Aye. Then to the couch I go.

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.141
Are you actually gonna
let her stay here?

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.768
Yes, dear. And?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.813
And why? It's not like she's
some long‐lost relative!

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.564
Yes, it's exactly like that.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.025
[YOTA gasps] Then why
didn't you know her name?

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.403
Mom, is some evil organization
making you do this?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.197
[TOKIKO laughs] Sweetie, come
on, we don't live in a manga.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.491
[YOTA] It actually kinda
feels like we do right now!

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.034
[TOKIKO]
You're so silly.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.953
[YOTA] If Dad says no,
that's it, right?

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.454
Well he won't.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.207
Yeah. I don't mind
putting her up for a while.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.834
You're on board, too?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.752
Are you guys sick?
What's happening?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.004
[DAICHI] She's young,
family, in need of a home.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:33.922
We can't say no.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:37.050
What's wrong with her family?
And how are we even related?

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.885
You need to calm down, Yota.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.430
And don't try to pry
into her business, either.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.098
Entrance exams are coming up,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.892
and getting into college
is a big deal for me!

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:50.188
[HINA chuckles]
My thanks for thy hospitality.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:56.486
[HINA] Ahh! Your mortal kind
sup nightly upon such fare?

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.113
I would have made it
a special occasion

00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.489
if I'd known you'd be here.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.869
Nay, let it suffice, for hunger
is a spice most potent!

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.622
I thought you told me
gods didn't get hungry.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.750
Did Sora's club meet today?

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.918
Oh, that's right.
She should be‐‐

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.756
[SORA]
I'm home! Tired as heck though.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.840
Y'all, someone's here!

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:18.216
And who is this?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.551
Is this, like, cosplay?

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.469
Why is there a cosplayer here?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.888
Her oddness is like to
confound even the gods.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.474
Yeah, but you've got no
room to talk about that.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.518
Hina, this is Sora.
And Sora, meet Hina.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.061
Sora? Like "sky"?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.980
Uh, yeah? Why you mad?

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.106
And her last name?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.192
It's Narukami,
just like the rest of us.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.693
[HINA screams]

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:40.030
Now there's a sky god?
I'm a real god!

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.365
Why's my stupid name so generic?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.034
That's super freaky.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.577
[HINA]
Stop giving them god names!

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.996
They're just people!
Give 'em people names!

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.749
[DAICHI chuckles] Well, it's
something of a family tradition.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.083
Wait, what's your name, sir?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:52.959
[DAICHI]
Daichi Narukami.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.546
[HINA screams] You even rule
over the element of earth!

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.215
And what about you, ma'am?

00:04:58.256 --> 00:04:59.883
Tokiko Narukami!

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:03.220
No, they have dominion
over time, too!

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.639
I'm in a house with the rulers
of the sun, sky, the earth,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.891
and the passage of freaking
time, are you kidding me?

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:08.975
[YOTA]
You're really not though.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:11.228
[SORA] She's literally
creeping me out right now.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.814
Yet I be a god
in name and in fact.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.275
So I charge ye with earning
your names hereafter.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.904
My, what a lively dinner.
This makes me so happy!

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.697
Does it really?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.742
Seconds please!

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.329
[HINA sighs] Yea, the luxuries
of the human realm

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:30.664
do abound in this place.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.874
Well, there's lots of
people worse off than us,

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.292
but is this all new to you?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.294
[HINA]
A good question.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.631
I have no fond memories,
and perhaps those are something

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.133
that people need to
live a happy life.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.468
That's not cool.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.886
Were things tough
with your parents?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:48.139
The relations you speak of.
A god knows nothing of such.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.767
Oh, right. Well, yeah.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.228
We're pretty normal
for the most part.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.188
I'm not sure how long
you're gonna be here.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.815
But you'll settle in quick.

00:05:56.857 --> 00:06:00.861
Cease thy fruitless labors now!

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.613
That college shall be naught
but dust 30 days hence!

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.241
Okay. I can start
a new game for you.

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.118
Really?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.370
A game console!

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.204
First time seeing one?

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.498
And how might one play this?

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.836
Should he who beareth
the appellation of "Hero"

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.838
not be a level higher than one?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.214
Surely there must be warriors

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.216
more suited for
so lofty a title.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.176
High‐level guys might be strong,

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.596
but they're not gonna
get much stronger.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:32.559
And this new guy's
potential... is boundless.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.437
Then the king of this realm doth
demonstrate great foresight!

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.689
[YOTA] And that's exactly
what RPGs are all about.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.524
Watching your characters grow.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.402
[HINA] The appeal of
the game is great indeed!

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.491
[HINA yawns]
Good night.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.620
[gasps] What? Are you trying
to sleep right here?

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.454
Come on!

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.291
Hey, Mom! Is there
somewhere for her to sleep?

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.008
It is so hard to believe
the day has arrived at last.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.843
Either way, she's adorable.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.054
I'm glad she's here with us.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.347
[DAICHI]
Me, too.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.224
So let's do everything
we can to help her.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.739
[YOTA] Izanami and I have been
together since we were little.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.282
She was already my
"childhood friend"

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.618
when we were still
pretty much kids.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.995
Then she lost her
mother to an illness.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.706
After that, she started
walling herself off.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.750
She became more introverted.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.002
Most people couldn't
get a word out of her.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.090
[YOTA]
She and I were still together,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.051
but now it was like she was
always hiding behind me.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.057
[YOTA]
Then we got to middle school.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.851
Which is when the boys
suddenly started noticing her.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.395
[STUDENT 02A]
Please. Would you ask her about

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.729
how she feels about me?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.356
Why can't you just
ask her yourself?

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.943
Come on, you two are close,
I always see you hanging out!

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:06.444
Please, bro!

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.781
Fine, I'll ask her.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:14.786
So yeah. You interested at all?

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.539
[YOTA]
That's a no?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.042
‐‐[YOTA] So yeah.
‐‐[STUDENT 02A groans]

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.463
[YOTA] Yeah. My childhood friend
Izanami turned out to be

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.091
the prettiest girl in school.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.884
And that was also
when I realized

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.721
that my feelings
towards her had changed.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.139
I hadn't thought
of her as a girl,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.558
'cause she was my just
my childhood friend.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.810
But then I suddenly noticed.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:43.314
No. When I think about it,
I had really always liked her.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.109
But I didn't see it till
the other guys did, too.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.653
I'd known my first love
my whole life.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.490
She'd been by my side
all along, and I'd missed it.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.037
[YOTA] I'd been throwing
myself into basketball,

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.247
but I made the
hard choice to quit,

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.374
so I could get closer to her.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.837
So which college are
you trying to get into?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.963
Hachiman U.

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.090
[YOTA gasps]
She's aiming high!

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.426
Oh man, that's so crazy!

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.095
I was totally gonna
shoot for the same one!

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.097
Well if that's how it is,

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.392
maybe we could both study
together during summer break?

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.270
[YOTA]
Yes!

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.022
And yet...

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.982
I really like you, Izanami!

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.109
I'm sorry.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.736
[YOTA]
I was rejected.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.154
Thou piteous thing.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.614
And whose fault
do you think that is?

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.033
Now, pipe down and
compose thyself.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.494
Ere thou asked had
the plan been hatched.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.537
That really doesn't
inspire much faith.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.582
[HINA] If thou knew not, thy
dear sister hath been charged

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.000
to produce a motion
picture in the course of

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.460
the coming summer, aye?

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.378
I didn't, but Sora's
in the film club,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.671
so I guess that makes sense.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.757
We'll contrive to bring Izanami,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:54.052
then we cast her
alongside thee and smooch!

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.179
Be this love story
to thy liking?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.307
Hell no! That'll only
make her shut me down harder!

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.185
Hey, Bro? So like,
help me please?

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.687
Well if it's you asking,
that's fine!

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.189
Really, now?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.233
But hark, the script
is yet ready.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.151
And it is a work
divinely inspired!

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.486
[YOTA sighs]

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.824
[SORA]
And... Action!

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.371
Well I'm here, but why exactly
are you dressed like that?

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.373
There's a giant asteroid
on a collision course

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.332
with Earth right now.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.166
[KYOKO gasps]

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.794
The only way to alter its
trajectory is to bore a shaft

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.463
into it and blow it off course
with a nuclear bomb.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.965
What is this about?

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.717
And they needed a drilling
expert, so they hired me,

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.386
a veteran
oil‐drilling specialist,

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.471
to go into space
and blast that rock!

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.682
I never realized you had
done any oil drilling.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.558
When was this?

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.226
I was a small child
at the time.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.478
Really? You were
a genuine prodigy!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.771
It's time to go.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.274
Oh my. Your father's
also involved in this?

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.776
Yes, he's the supreme
commander of NASA.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.361
Goodness, that's impressive.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:54.904
You're a whole
family of prodigies.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.156
It's time to go.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.365
Where's it time to go?

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.242
[YOTA] I'm about to
board the space shuttle

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.077
so we can intercept
the asteroid.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.036
I don't see it.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.663
Is the space shuttle
somewhere close by?

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.166
It's right there, out of
sight around the corner.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.126
Then it isn't safe
to stand here.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.419
It's time to go.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.296
Why does your dad keep
saying the same thing?

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.256
[YOTA]
I promise I'll be back.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.549
Okay. I need to go h‐‐

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:15.633
So wait for me!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:16.843
It's time to go.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.720
[KYOKO]
Shouldn't your dad be at work?

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:53.922
I've returned.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.381
From the restroom?

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.926
No, from using a nuclear
bomb to blow the asteroid

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.636
off course and save our planet.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:00.887
[KYOKO]
You work quickly.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.806
You're back. Let me
shake your hand, hero.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.811
I would like to go home.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.064
[YOTA]
Mm. That'll be fine.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.649
[KYOKO]
See you tomorrow, then.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.691
[SORA]
Cut!

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.734
That's a failure.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:18.071
[YOTA screams] What would a
success have even looked like?

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:19.405
She takes thee in her arms.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.367
"My hero! Let's go
have some kids!" Nay?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.368
That's ridiculous!

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.286
Yea, and the error is certain.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.704
Thy time in space was truncated

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:28.748
such that thy acclaim
felt unwarranted.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.084
Yeah, I know. All I did
was walk around the corner

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.961
and then walk back over here.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.796
And this costume is a sauna.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.173
[HINA]
But it cost 4,580 yen!

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:38.424
[YOTA]
That's not that much money!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.803
And yet Sora doth appear
satisfied nevertheless.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.888
This could totally
take the prize!

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.931
No it couldn't!

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.850
You plagiarized a terrible movie
and then made it worse somehow!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.352
All that's old is
made new again?

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:50.395
Not okay!

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.690
What a shame.
Back to the drawing board.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.490
What happened to your face?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.242
Wait for me, beautiful.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.285
[KYOKO]
Huh.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.120
Action!

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.414
Final round, fellas! Now fight!

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.624
[KYOKO] Your dad still
has a job, right?

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.460
[YOTA]
Whoosh! Biff!

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:16.337
Blam! Kerplow! Kabam!

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.006
Dis bum's got nothin'!

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.841
Sha‐bam!

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.804
[YOTA]
Izanami! Izanami!

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:25.805
Will there be a rematch?

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:29.058
Ain't no rematch. Izanami!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.892
Yes, what?

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:35.106
Uh... Izanami! I, uh,
don't really know.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.399
[KYOKO]
Can I go home now?

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.234
‐‐Izanam‐‐
‐‐So no, then?

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.529
Yeah. Sorry to keep you so long.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:42.697
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.531
[SORA]
Cut!

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.907
That didn't work.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.743
[GUYS groan]

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.786
Yota, as your dad,
I want you to know how much

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.580
I regret being a part of this.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.373
I didn't write
the thing, blame Hina!

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.333
[ASHURA]
She said it didn't work,

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.751
but what were we going for?

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.627
She'd rush into
his arms, crying:

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.129
"I love you, I love you."

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.881
[ALL]
That doesn't make any sense!

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.717
Verily, for the story was
once again abridged too far.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.344
Yeah, just like last time.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.597
And yet. Sora nevertheless
doth find it to her liking.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.016
OMG y'all, this could
totally take the prize!

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:10.850
[YOTA]
No way!

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.728
You can't show that, I look like
I'm having a mental breakdown!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.937
It would ruin me!

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.357
Then it seems I must
pen yet another script.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.233
My work is in
such demand of late.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.985
That or you're hacking
out all these scripts

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.446
and forcing us to try
and make them work.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.368
[YOTA]
So what am I?

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.744
An artificial man.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:30.620
[YOTA]
What are these?

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.663
Thy inventor did not live
to see thee completed

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.499
and hath left thee
with scissors for hands.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.333
[YOTA]
And this?

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.667
Well scissors for
hands doesn't have

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.295
the kind of impact it used to,
so I thought a beak‐‐

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.757
[YOTA] And why would anybody put
a beak on an artificial man?

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.218
Why would anybody give
him scissors for hands?

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.470
[YOTA] Don't yell at me,
I had nothing to do with it.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.763
The poignant,
heart‐wrenching tale

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.848
of a frightful,
yet gentle misfit.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.226
There's no way
she won't go for that!

00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:54.060
[YOTA]
She won't.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.479
I'm pretty sure I'm just helping
you kill time at this point.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.690
[HINA] After all I've done for
thee, still thou speakest so?

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.734
And indeed, hast thou
not undertaken this

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.111
for thy sister's sake?

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:06.823
O‐M‐freakin' G!

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:08.408
[YOTA] Man, I don't
think I've ever seen her

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.536
with this kind of energy.
I have to do this!

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.162
Wow, creepy.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.290
I wish I had the confidence
to study as little as you do.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.625
[YOTA cries]

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.669
[SORA]
Sometimes you see the hill

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.547
and something inside
compels you to run to the top.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.382
[YOTA]
Please let it end.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.801
Then so too should thy
endeavor to win her heart.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.053
[YOTA] I think it might
be time to cut my losses

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.513
and stop digging
the hole deeper.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.474
And yet, thy sister
is grateful indeed.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.184
[SORA] I'm almost
finished with my video.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.644
"My Brother Will Do
Literally Anything

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.354
to Get His Childhood Friend
to Go Out With Him"

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.022
is literally almost done!

00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:42.567
It's the most humiliating thing
I've ever been a part of

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.193
and if you show
the world I'll die!

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.820
Watermelon is here!

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:47.280
It's still nice and cool!

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.739
Get down here, guys!

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.082
It be not summer if
there be not watermelon!

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.959
And lo, the season
hath also grown ripe

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.253
to put my godly powers
to use for thee.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.172
Can we please let that go?

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.132
Knowest thou the sort
of music that her ear

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.592
most greatly doth please?

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:12.054
Uh‐‐ Hmm. I guess she doesn't
strike me as a J‐pop fan, but...

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.348
Nay, she be a lover
of film, and she findeth

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.184
great pleasure in
their soundtracks.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.060
How would you
know that about her?

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.355
Surely thou hast not forgot
that I am an omniscient deity?

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.191
Uh, yeah, I actually did.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.943
[HINA] Her dream is to be
a music director for movies.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.279
[YOTA] Uh‐‐but I've been friends
with her since we were little

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.739
and she's never mentioned that!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.199
Surely at least thou knowest

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.783
what she hath said
to thee outright,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.744
that she intends to
major in psychology?

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.370
Yeah, but what does
that have to do with

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.830
directing music in the movies?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.041
[HINA] Then her textbooks
over the psychology of sound

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.751
escaped thy gaze?

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.212
Oh, wow. No, I didn't
notice her books at all.

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.713
Nay, for thou art a fool.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.173
Well it's way too late
for me to become

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.591
that much of a movie buff now.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.594
Yea, verily, and therefore
we must create it.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.554
‐‐What?
‐‐A soundtrack.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.140
‐‐What?
‐‐[HINA] Aye.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.141
"Such talent!

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.019
What brilliance we could create
if he would compose for me!"

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.562
And her heart is thine.

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.939
Hey, hold on just a second!

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.315
I have no idea
how to write a song!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.859
[HINA] Truly thou art
the greatest of fools.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.445
Before the knowledge of the
gods 'tis a trivial matter!

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.113
Uh. But isn't songwriting

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.324
less about knowledge
and more about talent?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.700
Nay, an alluring melody

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.702
over a heartbreaking
accompaniment?

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.038
To a god, the mortal
heart is no mystery.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.792
[HINA cackling]

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.462
[YOTA]
Pardon me.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.589
Are we allowed to
try out the instruments?

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.049
[SHOP OWNER 02A]
Certainly.

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.179
Now hear me!

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.151
Um. Hey, hold on a sec.
Is that the song?

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:51.696
My mind grasps it yet
my hands grasp it not.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:52.530
Once more!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.531
No, no, no.

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.157
Even if you did
come up with something,

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:56.993
there's no way I could
play it from memory!

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:58.494
Then where thy
memory faileth thee

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.121
shall thy smartphone succeed!

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:02.456
Hurry up 'cause
this is the take!

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.614
[YOTA]
Hey there! Yeah, it's me.

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:37.992
I know it's been a while,
but didn't you have a piano?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:41.537
I was hoping you might
let me play it. So...

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:42.913
[KYOKO]
This is unexpected.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.541
I can't remember the last time
you came to my house.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:46.542
Yeah, y'know,

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.462
sometimes ya just feel like
playing a piano, right?

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:50.546
[KYOKO]
Do you?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.632
I don't think I've
ever seen you do it.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.884
Please sit.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.011
Thank you very much.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.512
What will you be playing?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.724
Let's see. It's about
all the feelings of summer.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.393
All of the laughter and
the anger and the love,

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:06.687
but it's also
kind of bittersweet.

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.315
Or at least, that's what
I get out of it, anyway.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.025
An original composition?

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.361
Am I gonna witness a miracle?

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.296
[YOTA] Dammit. Even after
all that practice,

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.924
I still can't get it
all to come out right!

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.446
[YOTA]
Huh?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.235
[YOTA]
Amazing.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.196
This is what the song
was meant to sound like!

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:03.512
It's good. Did you write this?

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.765
[YOTA]
What, me? No way.

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.224
How do I say this?

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:10.686
It was... a gift from above.

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.397
So I was right. A miracle.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.231
[gasps]

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.859
[KYOKO] Are you hoping to
start a career in music?

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.652
Oh, no. I'm not.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.196
I'm just hoping
I can pass the test

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:24.658
and get into the same
college as you. And I‐‐

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.785
And you?

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.119
[gasps]

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.874
[YOTA]
Say it! Now is the time!

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:42.092
And I think we should
study more, in the library. Heh.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.344
Good point.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.763
Yes, we certainly should study.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.097
I'll see you there.

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.808
[YOTA]
Cool.

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:53.395
[YOTA groans] Even an actual
miracle wasn't enough.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.439
The wings of the gods
bore thee aloft,

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.400
and yet thy gumption
failed thee.

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.277
Piteous thing,
to be in such a state

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.404
even as a god sits at thy side.

00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:06.075
[YOTA]
Sorry. But thank you.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.327
Izanami told me
it was a good song.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:10.037
I thought so, too.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.540
I'd like to hear it
again someday.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.292
Hey, did Sora have club?

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.169
[TOKIKO] She's at an
upperclassman's house.

00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:18.420
She told me she was heading over

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:20.881
to learn how to
write movie scripts.

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:24.510
Is that right? Well I'm
still kind of worried.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:25.970
[TOKIKO gasps]
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.555
Now I'm even more
worried for her!

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.223
That plate shattering
felt like it might've been

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.474
a bad omen somehow!

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:33.269
That may be so,
for I've felt it. too.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.645
[YOTA gasps]
You did?

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.146
[doorbell rings]

00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:43.612
[YOTA gasps]
Sora!
