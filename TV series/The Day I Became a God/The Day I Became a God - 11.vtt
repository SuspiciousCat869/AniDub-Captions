00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.104
[YOTA]
Lights on, at 6:30 AM.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.399
Physical therapy is
performed 15 minutes later.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.984
Light muscle stimulation.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.029
Apparently the minimum
possible to avoid atrophy.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.324
[HINA groaning]

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.035
[YOTA]
Breakfast is at 7:15.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.038
[STAFF 11A]
Maybe next time.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.503
Here.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.967
[YOTA] Learning time
begins at eight o'clock.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.929
[STAFF 11B] Hina, do you
wanna try it? Hina.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.140
[YOTA]
She looks away, but at what?

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.059
What does she see?

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.894
Something that we can't?

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:07.693
[YOTA] 11:45. Her lunch
is brought to her.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.528
Then a walk at one.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.782
Look up there,
Hina! It's a birdie!

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.870
[YOTA] From three o'clock,
she's free till dinner.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.915
But all she can do
is rest in bed.

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:23.542
Her symptoms are far more severe

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.752
than any of the
other patients here.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.716
Hi, Hina. Want a picture book?

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.680
Okay. How about
your animal cards?

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.185
Then I'll go get them.
Are you ready?

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:43.312
Here we go.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.813
Now, what is this?

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.857
[HINA]
J‐‐

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:47.816
That's right.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:51.153
This one's name begins with
a "juh" sound, remember?

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:56.366
Giraffe.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.577
Yes, that's right, Hina!

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.704
Now, what about this one?

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.289
[YOTA]
When Shiba is with her,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.833
Hina becomes engaged
with the world.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.377
[YOTA]
Dinner is at six o'clock.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.964
Good. Now, here
comes the last bite.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.801
[YOTA] After dinner
comes toilet training.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.346
They bathe her at seven.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.973
Then it's more free time.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:25.062
At nine o'clock,
it's lights out. Bedtime.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.523
Every day,
Hina lives this cycle.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.617
[YOTA]
Hina. Sweet dreams.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.343
[YOTA]
Time to turn in the report.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.932
[YOTA]
I hope that's the whole deal.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.521
Come in.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.857
[YOTA]
I made arrangements with Shiba.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.526
I'm permitted to visit
Hina's room for one hour,

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.154
from five to six PM each day.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:42.073
My cover will only last
two weeks at best.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.284
After that, it's over.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.370
I have to get Hina to
recognize me before then.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.247
Hina? Hey, it's me.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.874
How are you feeling?

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.753
[YOTA]
If she'd just look at me,

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.088
I'm sure she would recognize me.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.841
Hey, I'm over here, Hina.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.427
It's important to look at
someone when they talk to you.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.929
Look up here.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.559
It's okay, Hina, I'm right here.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.604
I know, that was very scary.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.401
Here, this one's for you. Enjoy.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.278
Uh. Thank you.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.033
[YOTA] Hina's case
seems much more severe

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.868
than the other patients'.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.871
[SHIBA] Yes, but in a way,
she's quite fortunate.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.331
Getting to stay here.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.959
[gasps] Wait,
in what way, exactly?

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.336
Many children from all
around the world are burdened

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.964
with severe disabilities,
and unfortunately,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.508
there are very few facilities
with the quality of staff

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.301
and equipment that
our patients enjoy.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.427
I see.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.388
Is that what she told you?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.181
Does Hina think she's fortunate?

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.766
It's an objective fact.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:51.977
Still, we don't know
what she wants,

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.313
and we can't decide what's best
for her until we find out.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.441
Recently, she finally
started looking me in the eye.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.443
Uh‐‐ What?

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.737
Which means Hina
has just now begun

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.073
to recognize me as a person.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.867
When she first arrived here,

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:10.203
she would shut out
any attempt at interaction.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.415
But now, when I start
talking to Hina,

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.542
she looks me directly in the eye

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:18.044
and she listens to
what I have to say.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.422
I can't overstate
how big of a step forward

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.257
that represents for her.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.758
Whatever she went through,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.719
it made her so
terrified of the world

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.179
that she walled
herself off from it.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.974
But since she's come here,
we've gotten her to the point

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.809
where she's willing to
be a part of it again.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.436
Great, but that
doesn't mean this is

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.313
the only place she can do that!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.232
[SHIBA]
Really? Where else would she go?

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:43.612
Well... For example,
my research facility.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.114
[SHIBA] And would Hina have
a caretaker at your facility

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:46.948
who she could trust?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.201
Yes. If nobody else,
there would be me.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.161
I see.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.371
It would be much easier
to believe that if I could

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.249
see her meet your gaze
when you spoke.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.085
Surely you'll agree that's
a reasonable thing to expect.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.464
Yes. Of course.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.882
That only makes sense.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.383
[SHIBA]
Have a good night.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.595
[SHIBA]
This one is Virgo.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:12.057
[YOTA] I can't panic.
I still have plenty of time.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.017
...turned into these stars.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.522
[YOTA] Hina. I brought
a picture book today.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.899
Wanna read it?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.153
'Kay, I'll read it for you.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.489
You just lie there and listen.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.532
From the time the
boy was very little,

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.076
his mother would tell him,

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.746
"You are the child of
Apollo, god of the sun."

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.623
And every time
she told him that,

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:38.750
the boy would feel very proud.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.585
"It's like I'm a sun god."

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.338
That's what the boy would say.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.300
[sighs] But the boy's
friend laughed at him.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.802
He stopped for
a moment and said,

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.137
"There's no way on earth
your father is really

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.472
the god of the sun."

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.807
Remember, Hina?

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.558
"I gotta call you Sun God?"

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.353
Back when we
first met? [chuckles]

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.897
[gasps] Are you having fun?

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.985
I guess we're not there yet.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.787
[YOTA]
And...

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.498
[YOTA] Hina was aware
of me being in the room,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.167
but she would
turn away when I spoke.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.086
That's how things went on.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.466
Is there even
any part of Hina left

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.302
that still
recognizes me? [sighs]

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.764
Or could it be maybe, when they
took that thing out of her,

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.143
all her memories of our time
together came out, too?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.520
You sound awfully
tired. Drink up.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.396
Listen, that‐‐

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.231
Are you aware of what
specifically happened

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.983
before Hina came here?

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.654
[SHIBA] I was informed that some
advanced machine that had been

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.823
implanted in her
head was removed.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:56.036
It seems any memory she had of
you was lost in that process.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.247
Would remembering that time
do anything for her?

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.791
Instead of trying to
bring back those memories,

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.294
shouldn't we be helping
her make new ones?

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.920
[YOTA]
That's wrong.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.215
The memories we shared
are precious to both of us.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.843
[SHIBA] So the two of you
could communicate?

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.220
She would acknowledge
you speaking

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.472
and look you in the eye?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.681
[YOTA]
Yes.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.391
[SHIBA]
Then I have to wonder.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.018
Was that Hina
you were talking to?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.145
[YOTA gasps]

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.564
Have you not thought that
perhaps you were speaking

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.483
to the machine inside her head?

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.359
That it simply
analyzed your words,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.320
and responded through Hina?

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.821
Couldn't that be a possibility?

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:35.325
[gasps] No it's not. I'm sure!

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.410
She was as human as anyone.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:41.372
And she could express happiness,
and anger, frustration.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.666
Every single thing
she felt, she would show!

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.294
[SHIBA] But a machine could
mimic any one of those.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.670
[YOTA gasps]

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.297
So then, could it not be that

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.508
the Hina you knew
was the machine?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.718
And the first time
you met the real Hina

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.346
was when you arrived
at this facility.

00:09:56.387 --> 00:10:00.475
[YOTA]
It's true. How could I know?

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:04.979
The world...
is turning inside out.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.690
If it's the machine
I was talking to,

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.068
then there's nothing
I can do now.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.861
She's gone.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.165
‐‐[phone rings]

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:28.628
[YOTA]
It's Izanami. Hello?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.215
[KYOKO] Hey. Narukami.
What are you doing?

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:35.009
[YOTA]
Yeah, what am I doing?

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.846
I guess I'm just floundering.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.806
I don't know what
to believe anymore,

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.392
so I'm trying to figure it out.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.643
[KYOKO]
That's what I thought.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.602
[YOTA]
Huh...?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.937
[KYOKO]
You always tend to go quiet

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.605
when you're in a spot like that,

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.190
and you haven't
been in touch, so...

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:53.361
[chuckles] Well I guess you've
got me figured out then, huh?

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.530
[KYOKO] I don't know if
it's really my business,

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:58.283
but I just need
to tell you this.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.160
I need to know you know.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.371
[KYOKO]
So I'm gonna say it.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.623
The truth is, I love you.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.542
You and Hina together.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:11.045
What you do for each other.
I love you two so much.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.673
[YOTA]
I‐Izanami.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.009
[KYOKO]
So please, don't feel lost.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.802
There's no need to hesitate.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.762
Believe in yourself.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.102
[YOTA] Hey. The girl
we met this summer.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.730
That was the real Hina, right?

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:29.898
[KYOKO]
Of course.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.942
[YOTA]
Right. Thank you.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.195
Good night, Izanami.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.571
[KYOKO]
Good night.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.036
‐‐[phone rings]
‐‐Uh‐‐ Hello?

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:44.370
[ASHURA]
I heard from Suzuki.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.705
You're bringin' her back, right?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:46.539
[chuckles]

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.125
Are you sure you have time to be
worrying about what I'm doing?

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.501
You've got exams
coming up, don't you?

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.045
[ASHURA]
Right, yeah, I know.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:55.131
It's just... There's something
I really gotta say.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:56.382
Oh yeah?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.760
[ASHURA] I love that
little gremlin to death.

00:11:58.801 --> 00:11:59.802
[gasps]

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.847
I bet. Of course
you would love her.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.515
[ASHURA]
I'm friggin' serious!

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.310
[YOTA]
I know. I believe you.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.020
And that's something
I've always loved about you.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:12.857
[ASHURA chuckles]
You got this, bro. Go get her.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.609
Anyway, back to
the books, right?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.153
[YOTA]
Yeah. Thank you.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.454
[YOTA]
Hello? Sora? It's me.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.956
[SORA]
Bro, what the heck?

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.540
Where'd you go,
what are you doing?

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.084
Spill, right now!

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.211
[YOTA]
Sorry for worrying you.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.046
I need to ask you
a quick question.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.881
[SORA]
Uh, okay?

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:39.592
[YOTA] You think of
Hina as family, right?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.135
[SORA]
Dude, yeah!

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.178
[YOTA]
Thanks.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.430
[SORA] The movie's on hold
till Hina comes back,

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.516
and I'll wait
as long as it takes.

00:12:46.557 --> 00:12:49.769
[YOTA] Right. I'll make
sure we can finish it.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.774
[YOTA]
It has to be true.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.360
The Hina I met
this summer is here.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.362
She's in this facility,

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.198
and I can never let
myself forget that fact.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.409
[YOTA gasps]

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.507
[YOTA]
Everyone, thank you.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.595
[YOTA]
Beyond blocks and picture books,

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.848
I gotta think of
something Hina likes.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.017
That Shiba doesn't know about.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.437
So think. What does Hina like?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.688
‐‐[HINA] Really?!
‐‐[gasps]

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.440
A game console!

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:38.401
Forsooth, the appeal of
the game is great indeed!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.236
[YOTA]
Video games!

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.989
But how am I gonna
get those in here?

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.408
If I leave they may
never let me back in,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.410
and I don't know the address,

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.829
so I can't have
anything delivered.

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.080
[gasps]

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.958
[YOTA]
Of course.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.254
Good thing no one
knows I'm in here,

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.716
since it totally looks like I'm
screwing around on the job.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:05.261
Although, will sending in
a report like this really work?

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.724
[STAFF 11A]
Mister Narukami?

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.642
A bunch of packages showed up.
Where should we put th‐‐

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.394
Yes, they're here!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.361
[SHIBA]
Bringing those things in here.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:22.695
What are you thinking?

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:25.323
Uh... I'm thinking Hina
could play them.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.783
I can't allow it.

00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:28.826
Playing video games
is addictive.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.412
We'd be risking all the
progress she's made thus far.

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.664
[YOTA] She can't spend
too much time with it,

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.958
but an hour a day
won't do her any harm.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.044
Hina used to love
video games before!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.295
Do you mean the machine?

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.506
Not the machine. Her.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.009
It won't hurt her.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.303
Either way, I can't
stay around that long.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.513
[gasps]

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.142
[YOTA] Okay, Hina.
This is a controller.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.228
Do you wanna try holding it?

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.816
Now look up here.

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:02.110
Man, that's a whole
lotta screen, isn't it?

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.736
And if you push up
on the left stick,

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.863
the main character
will move around.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.490
Go on, try it.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.460
[gasps]

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:20.753
Cool?

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.468
[gasps]

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.388
Yeah, you got it! Let's go!

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.807
[YOTA]
You gotta turn!

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.392
Try and tilt the stick sideways.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.768
Right now you're
caught on that rock.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.271
You're not gonna get
anywhere that way.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.441
[gasps] I'm sorry, Hina!

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.234
I'm not upset with‐‐

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.153
[HINA crying]

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:46.320
[gasps]

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.906
[HINA crying]

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:49.991
[SHIBA]
Oh dear.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.076
He can be scary, can't he?

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.371
It's okay. Don't be
afraid, I'm here.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:56.998
Can you please go?

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.209
Of course.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:04.630
[SHIBA] It's okay.
You've got me, and I promise,

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:07.842
I can help you find a way
to be happy in this world.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.430
[SHIBA] I gave birth
to a girl 12 years ago.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.140
I had no one.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.142
And I could tell immediately
when she was born

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.894
that there was something wrong.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.104
I swore to myself that
no matter what happened,

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.232
my daughter and I would have
a happy life together.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.403
[SHIBA]
But we were separated quickly.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:29.405
Her case was unusual.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.866
The doctors were forced
to begin diagnostics

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.285
and treatment right away.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.746
And the treatment seemed
to go on forever.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:40.249
[SHIBA] When my daughter was
finally returned to me...

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.043
[gasps]

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.631
[SHIBA] I learned that the
happy life I'd hoped we could

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.258
share would always
be out of reach.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.971
[SHIBA] Then I visited
a pediatric care facility

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.683
for my training, and it
pulled me out of despair.

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.394
There are many children
around the world with conditions

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:03.231
like the one that
affected my daughter.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:06.692
And when I helped those
children, it helped me, too.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.862
I could feel the hole in
my heart starting to close.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:13.074
I knew then that this
would be my life's work.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.826
By helping these kids
to live happy lives,

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.455
I'm building a better future
for them and for me.

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:24.377
It's okay. I swear
I'll always protect you.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.468
[YOTA]
All right!

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.554
Looks like you started
your first battle!

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.973
It's turn‐based, so you can
take as long as you need

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.641
to use the buttons.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:43.145
Okay, the buttons on the right.

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.231
Oops, that's the item button.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.941
And you used a healing item

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.735
when you were already
at full health!

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:52.822
Uh‐‐ Sorry, didn't
mean to get loud.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.867
Hey, you got a
brand‐new character.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.328
His intro sequence
is pretty awesome!

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:04.834
[YOTA] Oops! Aww man,
you skipped the cutscene!

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.044
Uh‐‐ Sorry, it's fine.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.338
You can jump straight
to the battles.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:13.175
[YOTA] You're crazy good
at dodging monsters!

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:16.387
But at your level, the midboss
is gonna be pretty tough!

00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:21.517
[YOTA]
Oh no! You got steamrolled!

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.730
Hina.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.066
[YOTA]
Is what I'm doing right?

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.485
Is this good for her?

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.904
What will you play
with today, Hina?

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.157
[HINA]
Tars.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.284
[SHIBA]
Then I'll turn off the lights.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.746
[HINA gasps]

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:45.082
See there? Imagine there are
lines between those stars.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.918
It looks like a swan
spreading its wings.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.087
And that's why
they call it Cygnus!

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.589
Tig‐nit!

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.343
Good. And if you connect
Deneb, Altair, and Vega,

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.471
that forms a triangle
called the Summer Triangle.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.847
[HINA]
Tummer tie‐angle!

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.223
[gasps]

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:05.227
[YOTA] I get it. I've been
trying to get Hina to do things,

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.856
but Shiba stays close to her and
lets her do them for herself.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.816
That's how I should
approach this.

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:12.610
If I want to help her,
from now on

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.279
I have to bring Hina
things she'll want to do.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.952
Well I definitely
wouldn't call it good.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.205
But the features are there.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.625
All these cards have pictures of
your friends and family members.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.418
Here's Izanami.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.670
And Ashura.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.837
This one's Sora.

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:33.839
And there's even one of me.

00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:38.135
Now hold on. Look, it's me.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:42.306
[YOTA gasps]
You don't like that one?

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:46.143
Okay. Guess it's fine
if we leave my card out.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.271
[YOTA]
If she remembered our names,

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:51.315
that would be a step forward.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.029
[SHIBA]
It's lights out!

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.239
[YOTA]
I know.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.533
And you intend to keep
playing that game?

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:01.867
[YOTA]
Yes.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.910
It's too bright!

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.912
Then I'll lower the
brightness on the TV.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.664
But still, all that
clicking might‐‐

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:09.834
Right now we're making way more
noise than the controller.

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:14.880
[sighs] If you disturb
Hina's sleep, it's over.

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:16.006
[YOTA]
Right.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:22.012
[YOTA] I just need to
level up her characters for her.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.597
No game overs.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.517
No matter what,
she can keep going.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.939
[gasps] Did you sleep at all?

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.401
[YOTA] I told you.
I can't stay around too long.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:39.071
If it helps Hina, I don't
mind missing some sleep.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.322
[sighs]

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.346
Wanna play, Hina?

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.517
[gasps] Then let's play!

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.981
[YOTA] Awesome! You beat it
with just one attack!

00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:16.025
You're amazing, Hina!

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:23.449
[YOTA] She smiled.
Hina finally smiled for me!

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.160
Onward ho!

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.538
You're the strongest, Hina!
Nothing can stop you now!

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:39.131
[YOTA] This. I wish we could
stay in this moment forever.

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:44.887
[YOTA] If that was my life,
I would be more than happy.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.723
But everyone is waiting for us.

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.558
Let's go home.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.435
That's great! Now forward we go!

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.521
Forward! Forward!

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.607
[YOTA, HINA]
Forward! Forward!

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.484
[SHIBA] I can't believe
he got her to open up to him

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.319
literally overnight.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.905
[SHIBA]
Hm? What is this?

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.784
It's a daily report,
but he never did this!

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.415
‐‐[laptop chimes]
‐‐Huh? A message?

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.128
[YOTA gasps]

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:22.049
[YOTA]
I shouldn't be out of time yet.

00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:24.593
I just need a little more.

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:27.263
I know Hina's
nearly accepted me!

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.890
We're almost there. Please!

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:31.141
[YOTA gasps]

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.435
[gasps]

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.575
Does that mean...
