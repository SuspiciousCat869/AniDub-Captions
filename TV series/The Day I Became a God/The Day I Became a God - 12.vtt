00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.659
Mister Yota Narukami. Follow me.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.453
Huh? Okay.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.831
[SHIBA] Your credentials
are falsified, right?

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.584
You're not a researcher
from a foreign institution.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.169
No, I'm not.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:45.963
Can I‐‐

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.840
I'm going to ask you to
leave the premises immediately.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.883
Please, wait!

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:52.177
[SHIBA] You must understand
that I'm doing you a kindness

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.179
by not calling the police.

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:58.559
Will I be able to
see Hina again?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.102
She's leaving the country.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.062
We're moving to
a facility overseas.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:02.938
[YOTA gasps]

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.148
It's an even better
environment than here.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.360
I'm sorry, but the honest
answer to your question

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.611
would be "no."

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:11.738
Just one day.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.575
Let me have this one day
with Hina, please. Please!

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.409
Get a hold of yourself.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.619
[YOTA] I'm begging.
Not even the whole day.

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.913
A few hours is enough!

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.624
[sighs] Okay.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.711
[gasps] Thank you so much!

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.508
[YOTA]
Hey, Hina.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.636
It looks like we won't be
seeing each other anymore.

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:37.055
I thought we had
a little longer,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.224
but this'll be our last day.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.104
[YOTA] It felt like we
were reconnecting,

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:46.523
but maybe it was just the game.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:51.403
[YOTA] So, you're not gonna
be sad when I'm gone, right?

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.074
Yeah, I know. [chuckles]

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.244
[STAFF 11B]
Okay, Hina, can you tell me

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.580
how much you've got here?

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.416
[YOTA] This is the last chance
I'll get to watch this.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.085
Please answer just once.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.339
Help me believe being here
is really helping you.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:20.766
[YOTA]
Hina.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:27.439
[YOTA] I want to bring
you home, but first,

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.192
I have to know that's
what you want, too.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.820
So please, just nod yes.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.155
Hey, Hina.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:36.448
You wanna leave here?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.866
We can live together again.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:38.992
[SHIBA]
Mm?

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.623
[YOTA] Just like before, the
same way we did last summer.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.542
All our friends and family
will be there with us.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.252
Do you remember that?

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:55.008
But how could you, right?

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.096
[YOTA] It was such a
great time for all of us,

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:02.015
but if this is really
what's best for you, then...

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:12.609
[HINA]
Sora. Sora.

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:15.404
[gasps] That's right!

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.823
You know her. Her name's Sora!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.325
And you know this guy, too!

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.576
You know her name?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.537
This one means the opposite.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.621
Yohi.

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:27.290
You're close! His name is big!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.792
[HINA]
Dai‐hi.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.001
Yeah, Daichi!

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.920
Now, who is she?

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:33.880
Her name means time. Remember?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.341
It starts with a "Toe," right?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.384
And then there's a‐‐

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:38.719
[HINA]
Tokiko.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.928
Yeah, exactly!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.515
And then we've got,
uh... Wait. Where is it?

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.520
Now. Who's this guy?

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.857
[YOTA]
You know. What's up in the sky?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.151
A big, burning star.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.112
Please, stay with me!

00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:57.946
[gasps]

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.741
Sorry! I didn't mean to‐‐[gasps]

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.079
Hina.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:10.917
I...

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.004
Your time's up now.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.798
Already? But we're so close.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.050
I know that I've
almost reached her!

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.681
Please escort this man out.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.067
Hina, please!

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.700
[YOTA]
No.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.244
Hina! Please,
you have to come back!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.496
We can't let you stay here, sir.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.749
[YOTA] No, I'm not leaving here
unless Hina comes with me‐‐

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.420
No way I can go home

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:58.381
when I was so close
to a breakthrough.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.342
[groans]

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.093
You were warned.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.054
[thud]

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.416
[YOTA]
Guys. I'm sorry.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.254
I tried with everything I had.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.548
But it's over.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.509
This place is Hina's home now.

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:48.557
[YOTA]
Hina! I'll miss you. Take care!

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.809
That man's saying
bye‐bye to you, Hina.

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.311
It's polite to say
bye‐bye back to him.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.230
Now let's go.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.441
Have a good life. So long.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:16.251
Not here. He not here!

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:17.711
What is it? Who's not‐‐

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.713
Yo‐ha!

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.881
[gasps]

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:24.134
[HINA]
Yoha! Why Yoha not here?

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.262
Did she say‐‐ That's it.

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.723
She didn't need my card.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:30.932
She had me!

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.934
Why Yoha going away now?

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:36.771
[SHIBA gasps]
Hina, that's not safe!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:37.772
Wait, Hina!

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.107
[HINA]
No!

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.532
Hina...

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.125
[SHIBA gasps]

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.628
Don't go.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.427
Oh. Hina.

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.512
Hina love...

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.973
Hina love Yoha.

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:13.183
Stay!

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.602
[gasps]

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:18.897
I, too, love thee most dearly.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.482
[YOTA]
Hina...

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.568
[YOTA]
That's still her.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.363
Those were her real feelings.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.491
She still cares about me
like I care for her.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.118
Hina never forgot me at all.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.954
She wanted to tell me.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.331
I just couldn't understand!

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.544
Hina!

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.882
[gasps]

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.222
[YOTA]
I'm here.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:56.017
[HINA]
Yoha. Yoha.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.688
Hina don't want Yoha leave!

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.439
I won't leave you behind!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.943
Hina love Yoha!

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.237
I love you, Hina!

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.869
Leave them be.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.121
Are you sure?

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.664
It's Hina's choice.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:21.084
And right now she's telling us
what will make her happy.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.880
Let's go home, okay?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.966
Everyone's waiting.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:37.726
Hey, everyone!

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.853
I rescued our princess,
and we're finally home!

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:44.941
[TOKIKO gasps]
Oh, Hina! Welcome home!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.068
[SORA]
Hina!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.362
[DAICHI]
Welcome back, son.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.614
Um. Things won't be like before.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.450
We knew as soon as you left.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.243
There's no need
to explain anything.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.412
Bro, you like,
totally clutched it!

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.039
You're so cool!

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.252
[YOTA]
In that moment,

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.422
I felt so grateful
for my family.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.342
[YOTA]
And also, for all the friends

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.470
who'd been waiting for us.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:14.721
We're glad you're back.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.724
It's good to
have you home, Hina!

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.350
Hey, you got a haircut!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.728
And it's frustratingly adorable.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.521
Do you still have her outfit?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.608
Uh... She'd look more like
herself if she had that.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.235
And more like the main
character in our movie, duh!

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.112
We definitely need
to get it back.

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:32.155
I agree.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.783
What? That wasn't mean
or shouty or anything!

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.076
[KAKO]
Why would it be?

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.952
You think that's my
only character trait, huh?

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.789
[YOTA] Hina's changed
so much from back then,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.290
but everybody's still
ready to pick up

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.501
right where we
left off last summer.

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.044
In any case,
her habit was nothing

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.213
one of my people
couldn't easily recreate.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.964
Friends in high places!

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.424
That would be wonderful.

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.717
And of course there's
always plenty of

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.219
footage of it for reference.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.138
Bet you'd like your
outfit back, huh, Hina?

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.934
[ASHURA gasps]
You wanna play?

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.185
[HINA babbles]

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.354
All right, then, let's play!

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.815
[YOTA]
Okay, Hina.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.025
So the goal is to throw
the ball through the hoop.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.652
You can shoot it underhand.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.821
Just toss it as hard as you can!

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.662
[YOTA] That's right.
The day I met Hina.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.831
This was the very
first thing we did.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.457
Does that mean...

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.793
Everything we did
together last summer.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.379
Was that the normal
life she hoped for?

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.505
Were we just doing
all the things

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.299
she wished she
could do every day?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.511
Playing basketball.
Eating ramen.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.889
Getting to share her
life with her family.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.850
Just goofing off.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:42.851
And on top of everything,

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:46.187
getting to be the
heroine in a movie.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.022
I see now.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:51.734
In that summer, Hina got to do
everything she had ever wanted.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:56.281
[YOTA] I was going to try and
make myself forget about it.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.284
I'm an idiot. I'm so dumb!

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.203
[SORA]
Bro! Are you okay?

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.289
I am. Everything's fine.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.001
I know you can
do this, Hina. Go on.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.300
That's okay. You just
have to keep trying.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.468
Watch, you can make it for sure!

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.735
[ASHURA]
Yeah, Hina! Nice shot, girl!

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.279
‐‐Oh heck yes!
‐‐Good job, you did it Hina!

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.908
[ASHURA] You're gettin' it!
Wanna try and go for two?

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.619
[HINA babbles]

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.371
[KYOKO]
Hold still for a second.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:49.250
All right. Now to
make sure it fits you!

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.793
Easy.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.382
Okay. Now add the finishing
touch, and... There.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:00.136
Great. Now you're all ready!

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.556
Wow. Other than the pixie cut,

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:06.100
it's like we literally
never even missed a day!

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.728
And that means we're
ready to start filming again!

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.730
[giggles]

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.987
[YOTA] To start off,
let's get the scene where

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.406
Ann walks straight
through the temple, okay?

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.326
Ready... and action!

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:33.878
You ready?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.547
Now walk over to me, Hina.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.423
Do you remember?

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.092
Huh?

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:41.594
Well, this is a movie
we're making,

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.388
and you play the lead.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.598
And I'm your childhood friend.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.058
We play the main characters.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.186
It's our story, and it's
finally almost done!

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.146
[HINA]
Huh...?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:54.774
For the ending, you just
need to walk over to me.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.901
So stand tall and move forward.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.111
Go, Hina!

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.404
[HIKARI]
We know you can do it!

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:00.780
[SORA]
Take as long as you need!

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.657
Everyone believes in you!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.284
Easy. Go slow.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.202
As slow as you need to.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.629
[YOTA]
That's great!

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.756
You're doing so good, Hina!

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.967
[YOTA gasps]
Easy now!

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.443
[SORA]
Cut! That's our take!

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.321
I would be lying if I
told you I could top that.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.572
But who could?

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.574
Great job, Hina,
that was perfect!

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.743
[HINA giggles]

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.169
[YOTA gasps]

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.720
This whole thing
has been like a movie.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.431
From the day we met
right up until now.

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:12.477
[YOTA]
A total rando like me

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.146
meets a girl who
claims to be a god.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.398
She helps him solve
his friends' problems.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.317
They share a perfect summer.

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:21.277
And then they found love.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:25.823
Then trouble comes to them,
but they push through it.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.369
They win, and they're
together in the end.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.870
That's just like us.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.706
We're here now because
we chose to keep fighting.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.708
To win the lives we wanted.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.169
I didn't imagine
all of that, did I?

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.882
[gasps]

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.765
I know what to do now.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.017
I'm gonna go to college
the right way.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.560
I'm gonna make
a real plan so I can

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:58.189
become a brilliant researcher
like your grandfather was.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.942
I want to learn everything
about your illness,

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.861
and then I can use
my skills to help you.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.197
If no one else
has figured it out,

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.574
I'll have to be the first.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.618
If mankind isn't there yet,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.662
I'll be the one to get us there.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:15.623
Because if I can,
then you and I will always

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.667
be able to be together, Hina.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.001
That sound good?

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.587
Hina love Yoha very very much.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.798
[YOTA gasps] When you say that,
it makes me feel like

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.383
I could take on the whole world!

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.717
I'm doin' this!

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.053
[HINA]
Waa!

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.098
[YOTA]
Up until we met last summer,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.476
I'd just been going through
the motions with no real goal.

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.353
But now I have a purpose,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:40.773
and I'm ready to chase it
with everything I've got.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.067
This is something
I've never felt before,

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.944
but you showed me
how to find it.

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:47.989
You taught me what my
life was supposed to be.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.867
You've blessed me
since the day we met.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.743
Maybe you really are a god.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.872
[SORA]
And cut! That's a wrap, y'all!

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.291
Thank you so much
for doing this!

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.334
[ALL cheer]

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.546
And we couldn't have done it
all without you, Hina!

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.673
I'm so hype for the
first screening now!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.843
But we've still got a ton of
work to do before it's ready.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.344
You can do the score, right?

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.846
Sure. Gladly.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.223
Lighting's done,
good work. You can go.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.100
Can I at least stay as long
as everyone else, please?

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.102
[ALL laugh]

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:22.148
[YOTA] Winter break passed,
but the cold held on into March.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.775
[gasps] You're
taking a year off?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.152
It's really not that big a deal.

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.528
You don't get to
get into Hachiman

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.489
and then just not go, okay?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.283
I'd been trying to get in there
for the wrong reasons.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.243
But I have a real
plan this time.

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.621
But Bro, it's Hachiman!

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.331
If you're not gonna go
then trade me your name

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:39.540
and I'll go in your place!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.626
I can even get plastic
surgery if I have to!

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.586
That wouldn't work.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:49.091
[SORA] Cool. So, thanks for
coming to the advance screening.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.761
All right, you got this, Sora!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:52.887
Hear that?

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.223
We've finally finished
our movie, Hina.

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.474
Huh?

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:59.185
You were so excited
when you got the lead,

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.646
and you played your part
all the way to the end.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.981
Now we can watch it together.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.944
'Kay. Lights down!

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:18.704
[YOTA] The planet was
gripped by crisis,

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:22.542
plagued by a massive,
inexplicable natural disaster.

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:26.420
This event came to be
known as "the world's ruin."

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.339
Have you still not been
able to ascertain

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.216
the cause of the world's ruin?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.801
[KYOKO] The mages are
currently endeavoring

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.178
to investigate, Your Majesty.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.138
But we still need more time!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.431
[KAKO]
My king.

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.434
Look upon the System
sustaining our world.

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:44.564
Alas, the power from which it
draws wanes as we speak.

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.941
Its circuits shall fail
one after the next,

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.193
and so shall our world end.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.362
[DAICHI] And this is the
cause of the disasters?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.405
[KAKO]
Indeed.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.865
But with the aid of the
kingdom's spirit summoners,

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.201
this cruel fate
may yet be averted.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.369
[DAICHI]
So be it.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:03.082
[singing]

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.502
[KAKO] The spirits.
Why do they flock to her so?

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.964
[YOTA]
Hm?

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.757
Ann, what's wrong?

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:13.593
Why are you barefoot?

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:14.552
[HINA]
Romi.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.555
In truth, I've been summoned
to the royal capital.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.682
I learned from
the Elder yesterday.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:20.933
[YOTA]
Why, though?

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:24.520
[HINA] I don't know, but they
tell me I'm the only one

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:25.688
who can save our world.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.441
[YOTA] Why right now?
When will you be back?

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:30.359
[KAKO]
Forgive me, young man.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.945
But she shan't lay eyes
on this place again.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.281
You mean she's
going away forever?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.992
But why? Why would it be Ann?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.453
You can't simply decide
she should be the one to go!

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:41.912
She's just a normal little girl!

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.041
So she is, but through
the unseen power within her,

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.667
mankind may yet find salvation.

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:47.793
[YOTA]
You can't!

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:50.671
[KAKO] Upon the morrow,
we shall depart.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:05.519
[YOTA] When I get
the chance, I'll grab Ann.

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:08.981
Then we'll run and
start our own journey.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:12.693
And if the world ends,
it's not on us to save it.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.740
[YOTA]
They're starting the ritual.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.326
The ceremony that
will save humanity.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.244
All of us but Ann.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.206
The world will go on
at the cost of her life.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.417
[YOTA]
And still...

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:33.172
She walks forward toward
the sacrificial altar.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.850
[YOTA]
Ann may not have any talents.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:48.104
But I love her
with all my heart!

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:51.482
And now, I will save her
from this ritual!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.358
[ALL gasp]

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.442
Halt, you fool!

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:54.568
Ann!

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.986
Stop him!

00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:59.824
You can't!

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.283
[YOTA]
Ann!

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:08.499
No. The ritual! The System.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.168
Its failure is upon us now!

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.214
Hey. We're gonna be okay.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.633
Let's go.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:25.266
The world is collapsing
around us all!

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:49.039
So, um... Was that good?

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.083
[ALL cheer]

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.544
Was it? Sora, you amaze me!

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.212
And Hina, you were perfect!

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.048
Yeah, casting you was
really the way to go.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.050
Fantastic directing, as well.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.427
OMG.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:04.054
Man, this'll be such a
great memory for us all!

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.097
[gasps]

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.891
[HINA]
A good question.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.769
I have no fond memories,
and perhaps those are

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.855
something that people
need to live a happy life.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.902
Yeah. Yeah, it will.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.404
We've made so many now.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.115
Isn't that right, Hina?

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:27.661
Sweet dreams, then.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.163
[SORA]
Awesome, we're rolling.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.706
[HINA]
Aye.

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:32.124
[YOTA gasps]
What's this?

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.212
[SORA] The making of.
I added it on after the movie.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.214
'Cause Hina asked me to.

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:42.968
So, when you were becoming
a god, like, what was it like?

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:46.096
In words alone?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:49.058
Our world was born
anew in my sight.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:52.561
Each day shone
like a brilliant star.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:55.272
And so, too, do the
memories of that age shine.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.442
Treasures worth more than
all the world's riches.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.237
And should the world I've
seen come to its end,

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:04.323
even still shall these
memories persist.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.496
I shall cherish them
unto eternity!

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.546
So you were holding
onto us all that time.

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.297
Through everything.

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:25.386
Hina. I'm so glad.

00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:32.434
[YOTA] I can't guess
what the future holds.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:34.103
Let alone know.

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:39.733
[YOTA] The world might be cruel,
even beyond saving,

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:43.237
and the miracles we think
we see may just be illusions.

00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:46.991
[YOTA]
But either way, I'm here.

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:52.788
[YOTA] And I'm going to live
with everything I've got.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.248
With Hina.
