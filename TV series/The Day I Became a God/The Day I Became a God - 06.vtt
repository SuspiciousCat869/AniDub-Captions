[STUDENT 06A]
Fight to the end!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.567
[ASHURA]
This is on me.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.486
I'm sorry for making
you guys carry my weight.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.739
That's not true.
We're facing a strong team.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.324
Yeah, maybe so.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.243
At least we can
go down swinging!

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.536
What's our play?

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.790
[ASHURA]
Go, Yota! This is it! Now fly!

[HINA]
Whither go these many mortals,

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:33.362
shoaling like koi
in their finest robes?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.447
[YOTA] They're off to
the summer festival.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.448
Festival?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.949
Uh, you're interested?

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.451
Didst thou expect otherwise?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.828
With the way you dress,
I kinda did honestly.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.956
Although I be a god,
still I be a maiden as well.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.333
Wouldst thou see me deprived of

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.168
the youthful memories
of summer days?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.379
And this summer will be
the end of all days!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.922
No greater treasure
shall ever be!

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:54.883
Uh, actually, I was gonna finish
up this slice and go study.

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:57.928
Freaking take me!

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.429
Just go with Mom!

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.306
And have the mortals
look upon me with pity

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.808
for my lonesomeness?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.726
Well, maybe Ashura could go?

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:08.438
Such foolery! Of what use
could Ashura be to me?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.691
Bring the average age
down a little bit?

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.526
Age is hardly the issue!

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.696
For verily, a summer festival
demands an entourage!

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.656
Uh, who would that be?

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.991
There's Sora and
Ashura and Izanami

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.911
and Jinguji and Tengan,
and lastly thee!

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:26.289
Uh, not sure Ms. Tengan
wants to see me.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.918
Worry not. She gave her card
to thee, therefore, call her.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.628
She shall join thee.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.927
Uh. Hello!

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.554
Yota Narukami here!

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.305
You know, the mahjong guy?

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.016
So yeah, that's
basically how it is.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.643
Right, that's fair.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.312
An explanation would
have made sense there.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.565
What mania taketh hold of him?

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.568
Wow. Thank you very much!
See you there!

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.281
[YOTA] I did it. She told me
she just had a shoot cancel

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.824
and she's here in town!

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.286
[HINA] Indeed. Now send out
the call and summon the others.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.704
Right.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.834
[TOKIKO] Sora doesn't
wear this yukata anymore.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.128
Would you like to
wear it to the festival?

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.214
I could never.
But for offering, I thank thee.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.132
Why not try it on?

00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:19.634
For this garb must
always adorn me.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.720
Lest I should cease to be a god.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.347
We've talked about this,
you bathe every day.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.100
Well, I can at least give you
a lot of spending money!

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.226
Yay!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.772
[SORA]
I'm ready and stuff.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.649
Sweetie, you look lovely!

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.194
Don't be creepy,
that's your sister.

Good evening, Narukami.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.664
Oh wow! This is why
yukatas exist! Divine!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.917
It's like a miracle is happening
in front of my eyes!

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.043
Or a magic spell!

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.378
Tonight will be
a miraculous night!

Magical Festival!

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:03.094
"Magic," "miracle," maybe pick a
theme and stick with it, buddy.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.097
It feels like it was worth the
trouble when you tell me that.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.098
After everything else,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.226
that gibberish is
what does it for you?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.102
That looks lovely on you, Sora.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.356
Oh my gosh, stop it or
I'm gonna start blushing.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.442
[ASHURA]
'Ey!

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.530
Sorry I'm late! Whoa, damn!

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.616
Sora, Kyoko, you both look
awesome in those yukatas!

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.743
What is wrong with you,
cut it out now!

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.037
[HIKARI] Sorry, everyone!
I was running late!

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.790
Jinguji! I'm glad
you made it out!

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.750
You mean now there's
a third beautiful girl?

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:38.088
Amazing! Marvelous!
And magical! It's a miracle!

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.716
Let's go,
Magical Festival, yeah!

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:45.095
That was uncanny.
Do you two share a brain?

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.889
Well, we have been best friends
for like four years now.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.267
I would have certainly
have guessed longer!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.853
Would that mean we are all here?

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.646
[ASHURA]
Kako Tengan came, too?

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.647
Is that a problem?

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.566
[ASHURA]
No, ma'am! It's an honor, ma'am!

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.818
You've made friends with
some amazing people,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.403
wouldn't you agree?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.155
Who is this and why is
she cosplaying at a festival?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.284
Huh? Who, me?
I'm a god, what of it?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.120
I do not care for your tone
in the least, little girl.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.080
How serendipitous
that thy work finds

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.082
thee hereabouts
and in yukata, too.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.419
Huh? What exactly are you
implying, you little gremlin?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.336
Who is this brat?

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.589
Um. She's a relative
staying with me!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.008
Oh! I wasn't aware of that.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.759
Oh my gosh it is!

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.469
Would it be rude
to take a picture?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.222
Hey guys, I think we're
starting to gather a crowd.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.307
Supes awkward, y'all.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.474
We should get going.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.061
Yeah, I agree.
What do we do first?

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.981
[HINA] Let us partake in the
traditional festival foods!

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:41.985
[YOTA] Okay. Takoyaki,
yakisoba, and okonomiyaki

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.028
would be the big three.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.154
Which do you want?

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.280
I'll have the lot.

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.115
There's no way you
can eat all that.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.450
[HINA]
Which is best, then?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.328
‐‐I mean. I would say...
‐‐[KYOKO] Wait.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.705
There's something
even better than those.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.792
[HINA] Huh. What compels thee
to speak out thusly? Go on!

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.378
They call it... tamasen!

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.630
Tamasen?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.924
It's gotten very
popular out west.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.008
And it's so simple.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.344
A fried egg between
shrimp crackers.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.845
Sound good to you, Hina?

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.514
It stirreth excitement
in Izanami's heart.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.183
Let us try that!

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.103
It's not all that exciting, huh?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.939
It looks a bit plain.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.733
[KAKO] I can hardly imagine
this being very good.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.360
[YOTA]
Well, we bought it.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.702
Tamasen wins!

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.996
Did we just find the
world's best junk food?

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.456
It's just a fried egg
and some sauce

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.749
between snack crackers.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.918
But it's still filling enough
to be a whole meal!

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.295
And I bet, like, little kids
would like it, too!

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:45.465
I hate to say it,
but it's great!

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.717
So it was a hit. Good to know.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.595
Yea, verily,
it be a victual of virtue!

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.721
Well that's great!

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.390
Onward, to the games!

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.730
[YOTA] Whoa, how many of those
have you caught, Izanami?

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:03.191
This is about 20.
I'm warmed up now.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.526
[STALL OWNER 06A gasps]

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.654
[YOTA] Izanami is ridiculously
good at carnival games!

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.990
Narukami. Why don't
you give it a shot?

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.658
I can show you how.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.619
You only need to
dip in the edge.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.246
The goldfish swim
straight up to it

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.289
thinking it's a piece of food.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.709
Then you just sneak the
scoop in under it.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.003
And flip it into the bowl.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.296
Yeah. I think I get it.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.133
[YOTA]
Yes, I got one!

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:28.967
[KYOKO]
Good job.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.803
[YOTA] It was so easy after that
awesome tip you just gave me!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.930
I'm gonna keep it going!

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.516
Wherefore wouldst thou
amass so many fish?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.518
Take me to a better
attraction now!

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.646
‐‐Something fun! No more fish!
‐‐Uh, well, how about...

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.024
It's shooting gallery time!

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.650
[YOTA chuckles]

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.280
[HINA]
Ohh. And it fires like so?

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.907
Ow! Hey don't shoot me with it!

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.117
Then what do I shoot?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.244
[YOTA] These prizes
here on the shelves!

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.830
If you knock one down,
you get to keep it.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.834
[HINA] Right. The penguin atop
the highest shelf shall be mine.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:08.006
[HINA] Hmm. Though the
shots landed cleanly,

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.175
still my prey standeth firm.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.968
Yota. Assist me.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.929
Two blows in tandem shall
surely fell the beast.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.139
Now aim for its head.

00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:16.973
Uh. Sure.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:21.561
In three, two, one. Fire!

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.899
[YOTA] Your plan worked!
That was awesome!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.816
Good job!

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.568
[BOTH]
Yay!

Look at the tire tracks.

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.873
Do you think she's
been abducted?

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:03.708
[YOTA]
No way!

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.669
[ASHURA] A driver's asleep
in there. Let's ask!

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.046
Huh? The one parked over there?

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.715
Tokyo bound, if I recall.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.675
What kind of truck was it?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.677
‐‐I think cold foods.
‐‐[YOTA gasps]

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.138
Crap, she's locked in a fridge.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.307
This could be really bad, Yota.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.349
Yeah.

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.810
Omniscience is her
only real power.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.062
Other than that
she's just a kid.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.981
Okay. I'm gonna call the police!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.232
I'll go grab my bike!

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.026
Ah! Good idea!

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.041
[HINA] Such dreadful cold.
My hands grow numb.

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.876
Thou needst not suffer.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.420
What warmth I have
I'll share with thee.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.637
[gasps] Look up there!

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.227
Huh?

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.107
[truck honks]

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.278
[YOTA] Damn, it didn't work.
He doesn't get it!

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.989
[ASHURA] If this guy gets
away from us, she's screwed!

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.407
[YOTA]
What do we do?

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.827
[ASHURA]
Jump for it, Yota. You have to.

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.162
Huh?!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.039
[ASHURA]
Just like you did back then!

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.541
I can't jump anymore,
so it's gotta be you!

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.585
And you're up against
a truck, too!

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.712
It's time for revenge!

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.426
[ASHURA groaning]

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:48.104
Hey. Guess we both
have free time now.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.939
Don't say things like that.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.026
[ASHURA] Look. The joints in
my left leg are totally shot.

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:57.029
They say I'm off
the court for good.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:20:00.116
[YOTA] I don't believe it.
I'll be there waiting for you.

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.742
[ASHURA]
It's not happening.

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:03.786
You're a born athlete, Ashura.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.996
You're gonna come back
from it even stronger!

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:10.042
[ASHURA chuckles] Damn, dude.
Can you at least wait

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:12.211
till I'm off my
crutches to say that?

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.171
[YOTA]
Sure. I will.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.632
And when my shooting guard
is ready to play again,

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:18.217
I'll be right there.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.637
[ASHURA]
You remember it, right?

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:22.847
The game was already lost,

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.683
but you and I still went
for one good shot!

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.229
[YOTA] Yeah, but we
missed in the end!

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.316
[ASHURA]
You have to jump for it now!

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.693
I thought I was
gonna be grounded

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.153
for the rest of my life,

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:40.030
but when you jumped back then,
you carried me with you!

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.951
So please. One more
time. Lift me up!

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:46.746
I've got it!

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:53.753
[ASHURA]
That's it, Yota. Now fly!

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:57.131
[YOTA] I will fly,
higher than anyone ever has!

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.633
Because we're the ultimate team!

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.928
[ASHURA]
Hell yeah!

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.263
[thumping]

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.557
Please, sir! You have to stop!

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.517
[DRIVER 06B gasps]

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.189
Hina!

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.196
You are a god, you know.
What are you doing?

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:23.282
Ugh. I seek control of
the element of ice!

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.909
[sneezes]

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.077
[YOTA]
So you're okay. I'm glad.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:31.373
Indeed, and you did well
to find me. I thank thee.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.666
[gasps]

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.673
[HINA gasps]

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:46.472
[ASHURA] Yota. You're the
best friend I could have.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.809
It took a long time, but I got
my revenge against the truck!

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.727
Not bad, right?

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:54.855
Oh, hey, you showed up in
a dream I had last night.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:57.149
Cool! Who was I with
and was she hot?

00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:00.444
[YOTA] You and me were
being crazy, like always.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:04.698
Maybe that dream was
a premonition of today.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.368
And I'm glad you're
my best friend, too.

00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:12.790
[HINA, ASHURA gasp]

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:15.084
‐‐Wow, look at that!
‐‐Beautiful!

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.671
‐‐Wow.
‐‐So pretty.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.172
Yeah. Lovely.

00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:24.134
True. They put on a
competent fireworks show.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:28.055
[YOTA] When this incredible
summer ends, what will happen?

00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:30.850
Will autumn come,
the way it does every year?

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:36.647
[YOTA] Or will our future head
off on some new, unknown path?

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:45.781
[YOTA] Surely the world won't
just end all at once. Will it?
