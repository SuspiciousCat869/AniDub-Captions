00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.024
[SHUICHIRO]
Good morning, Hina.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.611
Come, now. Show us
what you can do today.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.575
[SHUICHIRO] You're doing
splendidly, my dear!

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:38.330
[SHUICHIRO] A wonderful job,
Hina. Great work.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.917
My, my, you're truly a prodigy!

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.462
Your progress has
been excellent.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.924
I foresee no further
difficulties for you, Hina.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.718
[HINA]
But, Grampa. What about you?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.556
[SHUICHIRO] Me? Oh, I'm simply
a bit tired, sweetheart.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.267
[coughs]

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.769
I've arranged for
all that's yet to come.

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.438
So the future needn't worry you.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.069
Grampa.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:10.195
[TOKIKO gasps]

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:15.325
[TOKIKO] Is something
the matter, Hina?

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.204
[HINA] I saw Grampa again
while I was sleeping.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.999
So you were dreaming
about your grandfather.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.208
[HINA]
Indeed.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.503
I see. You loved him
a lot, right?

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:28.422
I'm sure you miss him.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.299
I do.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.758
We loved him, too.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.094
Daichi and me both.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.014
He truly was a wonderful person.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.484
[LOAN SHARK 03A]
So you wanna run lines?

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:15.278
[KAKO] Is anybody else thirsty?
Or is it just me?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.407
[HINA]
Hm? Taping even between takes?

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.158
It's for the making‐of doc.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.369
There's a making‐of? Hell, yeah!

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.204
I definitely wanna
be a part of that.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.373
I finally get a chance
to be onscreen!

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:27.624
Right, for sure.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.209
I wanna get the crew on camera.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.086
[CRONY 04A, LOAN SHARK 04A]
Huh? Are we in it, too?

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:33.630
Well obvi, guys!

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.341
So I'm in the movies now?
Goin' straight has its perks.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.051
[KAKO]
Yes. Isn't that nice?

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.219
Yeah.

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.470
It's a big help
having a veteran...

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.597
[HINA]
I see. As the heroine,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.475
perhaps I had best let the
others say their piece first.

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.479
[ALL chattering]

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.313
You okay?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.567
[YOTA]
Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.486
You're so silly.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.991
[YOTA] When this summer
comes to an end,

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.076
what's gonna happen
to all of us?

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.496
[YOTA]
Is the world gonna end?

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:10.500
Despite everything else, I just
can't imagine that happening.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:14.963
But somehow, I'm sure Hina's
gonna be leaving us soon.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.676
[YOTA] And I need to be ready
when that day comes.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.929
'Cause if I'm not,
it'll wreck me.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.434
[YOTA] Hey. I know
Hina's a distant relative

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:30.479
of ours like you said,
but how long is she staying?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.106
Huh? There a reason
you're asking now?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:36.276
Oh. It's nothing, really.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.279
It just kinda feels like
maybe she might disappear.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.447
[BOTH]
Huh...

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:44.326
I see. I hadn't
prepared for this yet.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.494
[TOKIKO]
It's fine, dear.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.746
We knew that this
conversation would be hard,

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:50.040
but Hina and Yota
have gotten close.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.375
So it's only fair
that we fill him in.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.835
You're right, dear.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.754
Huh?

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.090
Hina's not our relative
by blood. That was a lie.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.592
Huh?

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.052
[DAICHI] She's the
granddaughter of someone

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.512
your mom and I knew.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.430
A professor who was
a mentor to us.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.599
Then what happened
to her birth family?

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.601
[DAICHI]
Her mother has passed on.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.145
From what we heard,
her father started over.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.480
He's made a good
life for himself

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:15.816
and had a few kids
with his new wife.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.108
We're not sure
where they are now.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.902
Wait. But then...

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:22.155
Doesn't that mean Hina's father
just walked out on her?

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.200
[DAICHI] That's how she ended up
in the care of our mentor.

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.202
So we can ask him. Can't we?

00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:30.413
[DAICHI] Mm‐mm. This was
the arrangement we had.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:33.041
He wanted to be ready
when his passing came.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.127
He said he'd dress her up
in a way we couldn't miss,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.254
and that when we found her,

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.881
we should try to help her
however we could.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.635
When you called me back
on the day you first met Hina,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.931
you described her clothes to me,
and I knew it was her.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.850
So that's it, huh?

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.310
I never would've imagined. Wow.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.939
Okay. Then tell me, how long
can she stay here with us?

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.566
That is a good question.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.693
You're going to have to
think about that for yourself,

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.028
and of course, ask Hina.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.915
Hark! 'Tis time to game!

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:17.043
And the boss shall fall
at last on this day!

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.086
Huh?

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.174
Yet wherefore dost thou gaze so
pensively upon thy bookshelf?

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:29.014
My parents told me the story of
how you ended up staying here.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.100
So I see.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.354
Prying into the past of a god.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.231
'Tis blasphemous in the utmost.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:42.319
Uh‐‐ But you're a human, 'cause
you've got parents, right?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.155
'Tis no lie.
I am of mortal birth.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.741
Yet verily, I've ascended
to godhood.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.492
The miracles thine
eyes have witnessed

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.620
have surely told thee as much.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.123
[YOTA] True. She's helped me
in ways I can't explain.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.791
What else can I call
the things she's done

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.793
except miracles, but...

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.171
So when did you
become a god, Hina?

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.840
Three hundred and
thirty‐four days ago.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.843
[YOTA] That was when you
started calling yourself a god?

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.804
On that day, my divine
power was made manifest!

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.681
Do you have any idea why
that would've happened?

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:15.143
No. Even I don't know
the source of my power.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.312
And they told me your
father was alive, too.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:21.024
Tread'st thou unabashed
into such turbulent waters?

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.110
My parents had long since
taken leave of me,

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.988
so I came to be in Grampa's
care, and then here.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.366
I think we should
go meet your father.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.867
We could find out
more about you.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.452
We could find out more?

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:33.870
What could there be to know?

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:34.996
Like everything!

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.123
What? About li'l ol' me?

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.084
Your life before you got here!

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.545
I have to know everything.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:43.838
To what end?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.007
That which is done
cannot be changed.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:48.885
[YOTA]
Yeah. That may be.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.929
But people want to
know each other.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.389
Don't they?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.016
And what then of
the pain in my heart?

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.519
Wouldst thou have me seek
the father who cast me off?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.895
[gasps]

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:04.526
[YOTA] That's totally fair.
Sorry, I'm an idiot.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.278
Hey, studying helps
with that, doesn't it?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.280
Thou designest to
seek him without me?

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.699
[YOTA gasps]

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.411
[HINA sighs] As in all things,
my power would aid thee.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.413
Indeed, his whereabouts
are known to me.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.623
Seriously?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.709
What fey mood takes thee?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.503
[YOTA] You've dealt with
everyone's family problems.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.589
And you put so much of
yourself into helping them.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.509
Now I wanna do
something for you, too.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.969
Is that so?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.263
And you surely
won't be dissuaded.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.639
[YOTA]
Mm.

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.267
Fine, then I shall
join in thy endeavor.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.518
Wait, you will?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.188
'Tis by my power alone
this venture might succeed.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.025
I shall accompany thee.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.609
Thank you again.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.822
[HINA]
Be this the ocean?

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.033
Will I at last see it
with mine own two eyes?

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.909
Wait. You mean you haven't?

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.786
Only on TV and the net!

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.913
No kidding. Well.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.582
You wanna go while
we're out there?

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:01.916
[HINA]
Verily!

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.918
It's not a short trip though.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.253
Wonder what's the best route.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.048
[HINA] The answer was known,
ere thou thought to ask.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.841
But it shan't be
a single day's journey,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.509
therefore pack thee a bag.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.388
Got it, sure.
Wait, say that again?

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:18.349
[YOTA]
Hey, Mom? Um...

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.686
Hina and I were gonna take a
trip out to her dad's place.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.146
There's a bus route.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.190
But, it's a long journey.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.067
Like, overnight.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.777
Will that be okay?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.653
Well, you'll need food.

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.781
I'll go make some
bentos for you!

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.949
[YOTA]
Thanks, Mom!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.422
Say. You think this is
what it feels like to elope?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.591
Nay, for what mother
would grant her bentos

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.593
to a union she'd not blessed?

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.427
[YOTA]
Good point.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.888
Whence come these
thoughts of elopement, Yota?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.517
Have my charms at long last
prevailed upon thee? Hmm?

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.685
I mean, it reminds of
a scene like that

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.188
from a movie,
that's all! Ha, ha!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.316
Hark. Though I be a god,
I be yet a maiden.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.318
Toyest thou not with my heart.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.696
Okay. Well we walked off set,

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.573
so our movie's on hold
till we're back.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.952
Indeed, but it doth
approach completion.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.997
[HINA]
Yummy!

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.708
Sweetness be the true
essence of tamagoyaki!

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.002
I noticed Mom's been
adding more and more sugar to it

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.338
every day since you
started staying with us.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.465
Yea, for I have counseled
her thusly on how

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:35.593
tamagoyaki should be
properly made, duh.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.636
Hey, cut that out!

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.763
I like Mom's home cooking
just the way it is!

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.975
Oh! Her curry, too,
shall grow sweeter hereafter.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:43.226
As of yesterday.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.727
[YOTA]
Stop it right now!

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.938
Stop destroying the
flavors of my childhood!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.189
[HINA]
And her mapo tofu.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.066
[YOTA]
You're a monster!

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.575
[HINA]
The bus goes no further.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.370
[YOTA]
Man, there is nothing out here.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.872
I don't think we're
gonna catch a cab.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.957
So guess we're on foot.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.682
[YOTA]
Ugh. This sun is absolutely

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.059
destroying me right now.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:28.313
[HINA] Behold. My garments
shield me from its rays.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.856
So great is my foresight.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.984
[YOTA] Uh. You don't
look very shielded.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.531
[HINA]
We are nigh upon it.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.366
[YOTA] I know it's
too late to turn around,

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.368
but I'm getting kinda nervous.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.746
Aren't you scared about how
it might go with your dad?

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.832
Nay, to me such matters
pose no concern at all.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.501
'Tis he who must confront
the child he abandoned.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.503
How awkward! [laughs]

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.340
Is that really
something to laugh about?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.259
I should be ready if
this whole thing goes awry.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.099
[HINA]
This seems to be the place.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.936
[YOTA] It's huge, and it
looks like it was just built.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.812
[HINA]
Verily, 'tis a home of a caliber

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.814
many families would dream of.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.733
[YOTA]
Here goes nothing.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.193
[doorbell rings]

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.571
[ISUZU]
Yes? Who is it?

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.114
[YOTA]
Um. Hi.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.283
Good afternoon,
my name is Yota Narukami,

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.911
and I'm an acquaintance of an
acquaintance of your husband's.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.329
So please pardon me, ma'am,

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.039
but could I please ask
if he'd please kindly

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.290
give us a moment of his time?

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.459
Oh cease thy pleasing, please.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.170
[TOSHITOKU] Hello? Is there
something I can help you with?

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.338
[YOTA]
It's him!

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.716
I'm freaking out,
but now's the time to man up!

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.802
W‐W‐W‐W‐Well, actually, sir,

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:42.971
I c‐c‐c‐c‐c‐came to
discuss Hina!

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.723
Thy lips flap as fowl.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.351
[TOSHITOKU] I'm sorry.
You know Hina somehow?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.311
Y‐Yes sir, I do!

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.522
[TOSHITOKU] That's unexpected.
Please come in.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.148
Of course, sir, thank you
very much please!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.692
Enough is enough.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.153
Yay!

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.905
[ISUZU] Play out there
for a while, okay?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.950
‐‐Okay! See you later, Mommy!
‐‐We'll be right here!

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.085
[TOSHITOKU]
Apologies for the wait.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.421
Oh no, that's all right, sir,
thank you for your time!

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.589
I'm Yota Narukami.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.552
[TOSHITOKU] Pleased to meet you.
I'm Toshitoku Sato.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.555
[YOTA]
So this is Hina's father, huh?

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:26.639
Just by looking at him,

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.183
he seems pretty much
like any other dad.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.353
[YOTA] Um. There was
something I was hoping

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.897
I could ask you about Hina, sir.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:39.277
Hina. Ah. She surely had
a tough lot in life.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.321
Wait, she "had"?

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:44.741
[YOTA]
What is this? Something is off.

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.367
Here's the tea you asked for.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:49.037
[YOTA]
Uh. Thank you very much.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.793
[YOTA] Just me? But why?
Hina's right here with me.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.128
Wait a minute.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.714
She and I came all
the way here together.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.132
She's still here.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:04.010
She's sitting in
the chair next to mine!

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.305
No way. Tell me it's not true.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.140
It can't be, can it?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.726
Am I the only one
who can see Hina?

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.021
Oh. Your royal milk tea
will be a bit longer.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.647
‐‐Thank you.
‐‐They see her!

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.232
Had there been any doubt?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.319
What, it was like the soundtrack
was about to go "bwah"!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.112
But in real life or whatever!

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.822
What on earth are
you talking about?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.742
Plus, when did you ask for royal
milk tea in the first place?

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.952
When the lady of the house
so graciously asked me

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:30.870
what I wanted to drink.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.080
Just have green tea!

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.582
So, who's the young lady
who came here with you?

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.667
Uh‐‐ Wait, you can't tell?

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.961
It's Hina.
She's your daughter, sir.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:41.506
Hina? That can't be.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.424
Answer me.
Could you really be her?

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.675
[gasps]

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:48.054
[HINA] Aye. Indeed I am
Hina Sato herself. What of it?

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.931
But how is that possible?

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.183
I have become a god.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.061
You what? What do
you mean by "a god"?

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.896
Uh, can we back up
a sec, please?

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.523
‐‐[glass shatters]
‐‐[TOSHITOKU gasps]

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.944
Oh, please, no.
Darling, is that really her?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.529
Isuzu. Stay calm.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.155
Why is she here?

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.365
[YOTA]
This is horrible.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:10.952
I was nervous, but it's going
so much worse than I thought!

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.246
It's okay. It's okay,
don't worry, honey,

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.415
I'm taking care of this.
Both of you, please.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.958
We can talk outside.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.710
Would you mind waiting for me
out by the gate for a minute?

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.171
[YOTA gasps]
Of course.

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:35.852
[HINA] Behold! The ocean that
laps at these sands spanneth

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.479
over 71 and one tenths
percent of the world!

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.314
A vastness beyond knowing!

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.692
[dog barks]

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:45.194
[HINA] Peace to thee, friend.
What is thy name?

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.530
Looks like Munin is excited.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:48.781
You should go play.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.200
[HINA]
Indeed, then thy name be Munin!

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.036
Come along. Let us race!

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:59.500
[HINA giggling] What strange
sort of race is this?

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.378
You came all this way to be
thrown out of our house.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.213
I sincerely apologize
for that ordeal.

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.214
It's fine.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.967
So, what was it you
were hoping to ask me?

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.719
Can we talk about Hina?

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.387
What can you tell me?

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:13.931
I haven't been
a part of her life

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.142
since she was seven years old.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.977
Will that be a problem?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.520
No, sir.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.105
Hina was sick.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.065
She had what's called
Logos Syndrome.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:26.277
It's a hereditary condition
that she carried her whole life.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.654
Never heard of that before.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.239
It attacks the nervous system,

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.285
with cerebral atrophy resulting
in neurogenic muscular atrophy.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.288
As the patient grows,
the muscles waste away.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.415
It's not survivable.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:43.044
When Hina was with me,
she was always at death's door.

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.921
She could barely stand or speak.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.797
[YOTA gasps]
There's no way!

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.966
That's what I thought, too.

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.885
That can't be her.

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.846
The lethality of Logos Syndrome
is a hundred percent.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.431
There is no treatment for it.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.058
[gasps] But she‐‐

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:00.019
[TOSHITOKU] I know.
That girl says she's Hina,

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.563
and she knows enough
about me to find me.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.023
She can't be lying.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.525
So where does that leave us?

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:08.110
If she's better,
should I be happy?

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.071
If she knows her only
father gave up on her

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.491
and started a new family,
should I be mad at myself?

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.620
[TOSHITOKU]
I know this much.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.956
You're the one who decided
to bring her all the way here,

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:22.416
so I certainly have every
right to be mad at you.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.919
Hold on. That's not fair!

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.921
[TOSHITOKU]
Maybe not. You're just a kid,

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.006
and you thought you were
doing the right thing.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.801
How could you realize how cruel
it was to bring Hina back to me

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.262
in good health after
all these years?

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.639
[TOSHITOKU] I don't know
that anybody else could

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.058
truly understand this feeling.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.268
[YOTA]
Are you saying...

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.603
...there's no way Hina can
stay here with your family?

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.940
[exhales] Son, you're way
out of your depth here.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.775
You were watching
how my wife reacted

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:48.859
when she saw her.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:49.986
[gasps]

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:51.904
You don't know what
it does to a family,

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.990
having a child whose
whole life will never be

00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:56.492
more than a drawn‐out,
painful death.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.662
My wife and I have
been through that pain.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.747
So had Hina's mother.

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:04.667
She never stopped blaming
herself for her condition.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.378
She only knew one way
to escape the guilt.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.548
Oh, no.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.886
But I'm still glad we saw you.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:18.389
I'm glad you got to
see her healthy.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.600
I was right to bring her here.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.685
If I'd known she was
with you when you came,

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.563
I would never have let you
into my home at all.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.732
But you're her only father!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.234
How can you be so cruel?

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:33.571
I get that. I can't
make you understand.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.114
You haven't lived through it.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.907
I could tell you
a hundred different ways

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.242
and it wouldn't help.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:40.536
[YOTA] That's an excuse.
You're being selfish!

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.622
Hina's such an amazing kid!

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.373
If you only knew
how she would turn out,

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.708
you'd never have left her!

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.293
Perhaps not.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:50.171
When I knew her, I had no way
to communicate with her.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.714
But now you do!

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.759
She's happy and healthy
and she's right there!

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.347
[TOSHITOKU] And it's
certainly a thing to see.

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:03.559
But no. I did all I could
for her years ago.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.019
I was only treading water,

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:07.188
waiting for things
to fall apart.

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.606
So I gave up.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.358
I left her behind
and tried to build a life

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.235
where I could do more
than grieve for her.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:16.989
Do you understand the choice
I was forced to make?

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.866
[YOTA]
I don't.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:21.035
Nothing you're
telling me makes sense.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:23.788
I don't know why
you won't accept Hina.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:24.872
Well you will.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:27.833
Maybe not right now, but soon.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:30.836
In fact, it could play out
the same way for you.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.088
[gasps]

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.299
[TOSHITOKU] As I said, there's
no treatment for Logos Syndrome,

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:37.134
not now and not then.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.095
I'm a doctor and I
keep up with the journals,

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:42.556
and its prognosis is as
fatal as it was when I left.

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:47.812
[TOSHITOKU] I'm speaking from
experience, so please listen.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.522
Sometimes in life,
you see something that

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:52.483
looks for all the world
like a miracle.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.402
But if you look long enough,

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.113
you'll realize it was
just a trick of the light,

00:19:57.154 --> 00:20:00.449
and the world will go on
turning like it always has.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.413
[YOTA]
Hey, Hina. Did you have fun?

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.874
[HINA] Mm‐hm! A dog is truly
a god's best friend!

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.377
[YOTA] The sun's going down.
We should get moving.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.963
Yea, verily. 'Tis a shame.

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.590
It shall be here
that we part ways.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.551
[YOTA]
That's right. Say goodbye.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.803
[HINA]
Indeed. It is time.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.889
Fare thee well, Munin. Bye, bye!

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:29.353
[YOTA] Is there anything you'd
like to say to your father? No?

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.233
Not at all. My sole
purpose in coming here

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.068
was simply to guide thee.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.738
Right. Let's go.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.573
[YOTA]
I bowed one last time

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:43.159
and bid my farewell
to Hina's father.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.338
[YOTA] In the end,
why did we make this trip?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.591
And had anything
good come out of it?

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.386
[YOTA] Wouldn't he and I
both be better off

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.472
not knowing what
we learned today?

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.891
It would have spared us
all the pain.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:10.561
Life could have just
kept going like normal.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.272
I can't help being
bothered by that.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:15.983
A miracle!

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.611
Though it be on my plate,
the prawn moveth still!

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.863
Right. Enough playing
with your food, okay?

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.866
Yeah but look,
though! [giggling]

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:27.745
[TOSHITOKU] In fact, it could
play out the same way for you.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.581
You'll realize it was
only a trick of the light,

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:34.001
and the world will go on
turning like it always has.

00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.212
[YOTA]
What did he mean by that?

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:39.089
And what's gonna happen to Hina?

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.758
This girl so full of life

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.260
that it's been spilling
over into mine.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.762
Could she really be...

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.472
No way.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.681
What is this?

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.850
Wherefore dost thou
look so pained?

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.602
You're gonna be okay.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.896
Those were all
just excuses, right?

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.649
I cannot shed any light
on words I've not heard,

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.026
but in mere days this
world shall meet its end.

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:02.488
And at that time, every burden
shall be lifted from thy back.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.782
So let only this moment
weigh on thee,

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.326
and seek joy in the
little time that is left.

00:22:07.368 --> 00:22:08.828
[gasps]

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:11.705
Look there! A game,
from times long ago!

00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.249
Let us play it!

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.710
[YOTA] Seriously? Out here
and we're still playing games?

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.420
I think this one might be
older than my parents.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:21.131
Come now and witness the
Wall of Death Technique.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.384
[YOTA] How do you even
know about that?

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.969
How do I, even?

00:23:59.104 --> 00:23:59.980
[ISUZU]
Honey.

00:24:00.022 --> 00:24:01.315
[TOSHITOKU]
Hm?

00:24:01.357 --> 00:24:03.484
We have some more visitors.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.364
[TOSHITOKU]
Yes? May I ask who's there?

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:10.407
[gasps]
