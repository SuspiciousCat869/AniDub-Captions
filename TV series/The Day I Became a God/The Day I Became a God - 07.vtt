WEBVTT

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:23.941
There's good news and bad news!

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.526
Which do you wanna hear first?

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.986
Sounds like someone's been
watching overseas TV.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.112
[HINA]
Answer the question!

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.864
Let's go with the bad.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.407
The end yet approacheth.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.243
Only seven days now remain.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.245
And I'm here
studying like a fool.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.746
So, good news?

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:38.747
The screenplay.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.667
It seems Sora's final
draft is completed.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.546
[YOTA]
Really. She finally did it.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.298
And it's sure to be
an era‐defining

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.175
cinematic masterpiece!

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.761
Thy untoward affections
notwithstanding,

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.013
please do peruse it forthwith.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.524
This is it.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.568
So then, am I the first
person to read it?

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.612
And like, be honest.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.292
[YOTA sighs]

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.920
That sigh felt dramatic.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:53.131
Your script is
seriously awesome!

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:53.965
For the win!

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:54.925
And this setting!

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.885
Did you come up
with it? It's great!

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.513
With your talent, you could
take the movie world by storm!

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.057
Let's keep our
pants on, shall we?

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.060
Although, there is a lot
of fantasy stuff in here.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:06.687
Can we actually shoot this?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.606
Not absent the light
and magic of industry.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.651
Yeah, I literally didn't even
think about how we'd film it.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.612
[YOTA]
Hmm. So what now? Rewrite?

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.322
Nay, no need.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.408
For fate hath granted
ye the perfect player

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.952
for the part of
the film's heroine!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.328
Who do we know
who'd fit a humble,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.123
kindhearted fantasy heroine?

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.958
Oh, you mean Izanami!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.168
Dullard! The perfect
heroine is me!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.003
You can't really
mean that, right?

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:32.838
Why not?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.549
Well, because it's
obviously total nonsense?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.719
[HINA chuckles]
My range shall surprise thee.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.928
Leave it to me!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.179
I'm not buying that at all.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.057
For me nothing is
impossible, thou imbecile!

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.685
[YOTA] Oh, like messing up
a good script, you mean?

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.354
Nay. 'Tis a perfect role for me.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.814
Sound good, Sora?

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.607
Yeah, that would actually
be a big help.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.609
How now? Art thou convinced?

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.528
Well, what's the
minimum crew you can use

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.696
to get the movie done?

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.407
[SORA] We need a director,
a cam‐op, someone on lights,

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.325
someone on sound,
and a producer.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.204
So that's five before we
get to the cast, and like,

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.540
isn't the film club just you?

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.751
How many of your friends
would be willing to help?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.420
Everyone says they've gotta
do their summer homework,

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:16.590
but Jinguji doesn't have any
so maybe she could help out.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.342
'Cept she's prob'ly super
busy with the ramen shop.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:22.763
Heh. These obstacles be
not obstacles to a god.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:23.597
What?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.557
And thy labors in this
final summer on earth

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.476
shall not have been in vain.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.186
Please explain.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.439
[HINA] In our time together
we have formed numerous bonds,

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.150
and our good works
have benefitted many.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.320
Yea, and verily at thy beck,

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.073
they shall surely rush
to thy aid, aid, aid.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.408
Huh?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.536
You mean I'm gonna have to drag
everyone I know into more crap?

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.581
[SORA]
Big bro. Please help me?

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.251
Right, then.
We're doin' this thing.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.961
He's not well.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.546
[YOTA]
Uh...

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.262
[YOTA] I can't believe
they showed up.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.890
Oh my goodness,
look at all these people!

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.767
I get to play host, what fun!

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:09.893
Oh yeah, "what fun."

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.812
Hey, Narukami?

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.481
Did you mean to
invite the, um...

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.025
[YOTA]
Oh, right, the ex‐loan shark.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.861
Yeah, that night was a real
wake‐up call for me.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.155
But I'm on the straight
and narrow from now on.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.949
Tell me what needs
doing and I'll do it.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.950
No complaints.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.077
Bro, you're all like,
cool and popular.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.370
[YOTA chuckles]

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.497
So? What ridiculousness
is it this time?

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.457
Start talkin',
she's a busy lady.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.376
[YOTA]
Be gentle! Uh...

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.045
We're making a movie and
I was hoping you'd help.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.964
Sure, I can play the lead!

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.424
I'm even better
when I actually try.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.718
Yeah. I meant financial help.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.220
This is about money?

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.138
We just need enough
for the costumes!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.975
And food and labor and
equipment and everything!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.268
I'm a high‐powered attorney

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.978
with a packed
appearance schedule,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.271
and you called me to your home

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.231
to beg for scraps to
fund your student film?

00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.024
[YOTA] And of course we
also have an important role

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.317
for you in the movie!

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.863
Ugh. Well then, who am I gonna
be propping up in this show?

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:03.864
Me.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.117
You joke. The little goblin
who calls herself a god?

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:10.203
Surely you don't imagine
you're silver screen material.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.832
If such is thy estimate of my
skill, then I have fooled thee.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.543
Really. Then you should
be good enough to recognize

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:17.878
when you're outclassed,

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.422
and not make a scene when
they give me your role.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.007
Let us have it out!

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.967
Sorry about your film career.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.303
Hey, director! We have a deal!

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.471
Oh. I'm not the director, ma'am.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.056
[KAKO]
Huh? Then who is?

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.725
Uh. Yeah, hi.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.727
Oh, right. From the festival.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.146
Yeah, he's my
big brother and stuff.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.481
[KAKO sighs]
Understood!

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.609
Believe me, dear, once we
get to work you'll soon

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.528
come to recognize the
value of seasoned talent.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.280
‐‐And a good assistant!
‐‐Ma'am!

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:46.740
You look like
a pretty strong guy,

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.617
so we could have
you do the lights.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.951
You're name's...

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.287
I'm Ashura Kokuho!

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:56.458
[YOTA] Hang on. How did we
end up with such a big crew?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.210
It seems like I've made
a bunch of friends,

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.463
and I didn't even
notice it was happening.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.925
[YOTA]
They all really came to help me.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.427
Mom. I'm so happy.

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.887
I wish you could see it!

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.347
You totally can!

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.515
Was there no setup
to that punchline?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:15.268
If the script's done,
you should make a storyboard.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.770
But I totally can't draw.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.438
That's not a problem!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.273
It just needs to give
a sense of the pacing

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.192
and composition you want.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.903
Okay, cool. I'll try it I guess.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.154
Thanks for coming, y'all.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:27.948
I'm glad to be working with you!

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.240
Now, let's do this!

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.450
Let's do this real good!

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.452
Can't say no to a pretty girl.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.829
When you're ready to recast
the lead, I'm right here.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.581
I'll help out any way I can.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:37.582
Me, too.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.292
Oh, yeah!

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.294
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.713
That's as far as we go
without a storyboard.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.006
So let's call it for today.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.175
Hear ye! Let us gather
around the console

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.385
that we might game!

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.261
[YOTA] But all these people
have real lives!

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.389
C'mon. Don't act like
you don't want a chance

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.265
to show Izanami your mad skills!

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.851
At games? What girl
would wanna watch that?

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.436
I think I'd like that.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.521
You would?!

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.522
I'd like that, too.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.191
Wait, you would?! Be gentle.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.527
Thy thirst shan't be indulged.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.826
You've been teleporting
everywhere freely.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:14.577
But it's an enemy stronghold.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.705
Why would they
help you like that?

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.373
If they break you down
into molecules,

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.458
why can't they just not
put you back together?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.210
[YOTA]
I mean, hey,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.379
maybe they didn't think
that far ahead, right?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.505
Then they're morons.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.257
Okay. Guess so.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.800
But still, their witlessness

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.219
doth allow for
exciting gameplay!

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.388
Hey! Storyboards are
ready, everybody!

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.348
Sweet! 'Bout time!

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.518
[YOTA]
This is incredible, Sora!

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.270
It's like I'm reading a manga!

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.312
Blushing.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.398
So, what's this story like?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.234
Basically, there's a clumsy
girl from a small village.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.862
But she possesses a
hidden skill of great power,

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.698
and it may be the only way
to fend off certain doom.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.242
So this is the story of her
and her childhood friend

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.328
going on an epic journey
to save their world.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.413
'Tis a timeless tale,

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.082
and one that's perfectly
suited to me, besides!

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.376
Hina's the heroine,
but who's the childhood friend?

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.210
Me!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.420
No, you're the lighting guy.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.671
[ASHURA sighs]

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.423
Yota? Why not you?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.299
Huh? Me?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.926
Ooh, yeah! That's a great idea!

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.178
Are you kidding me?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.930
Agreed. As the lead pair,
we would work well.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.807
Really, you too?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.561
Well. Guess I'm in.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.855
And the rest of us
can split up the bits.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.106
On to costumes!

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.526
That's me. Do remember
to get a receipt.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.737
[YOTA] I'll guard this
with my life, ma'am.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.043
[HINA] Ohh. 'Tis quite
a fine costume indeed.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.504
You're wearing
what you always wear.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.256
And as always, 'tis plain
to see I'm a heroine.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.217
[YOTA chuckles]

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.220
And... action!

00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:01.476
[gasps] Ann! I heard
the Elder summoned you.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.103
Do you have any idea
what he wants?

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.563
‐‐Nay, sir!
‐‐And stop!

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.608
Wouldst thou usurp Sora's role
and direct from thy mark?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.276
The way you talk
makes even less sense

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.986
in this setting
than in real life.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.488
The heroine
imminently approacheth

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.156
the plane of godhood.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.116
'Tis but natural.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.283
No, 'tis not!

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.120
This is still the "humble
beginnings" part of the plot!

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.746
Such a prima donna.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.915
Director, art thou so concerned?

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.125
It's fine.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.961
No, it so isn't fine!

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.171
Ann. I heard the
Elder summoned you.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.339
Do you know why?

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.550
Nay! But 'tis no matter.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.385
I'm off to practice my singing.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.678
Join me, Romi!

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:37.679
[YOTA]
Of course.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.306
You really do love to sing,
don't you, Ann?

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.272
[inhales]

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:53.319
[singing]

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.364
Stop! It's hideous!

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.783
Aren't you ashamed to
make those sounds in public?

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.202
You got some problem
with my singing, granny?

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.245
Easy now.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.539
Ann's bad singing
is a part of the story.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.457
Well that was
convincingly bad.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.667
Was it on purpose?

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.127
You played the part so well!

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.879
It's like you're
really tone deaf.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.046
Silence thyself!

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.591
Lest thou would incur
a god's wrath!

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.388
But can we get a take that's not
quite so out of tune, maybe?

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.641
Yea, if needs be.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.602
Sora. One more, please?

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.437
Action!

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.734
[singing]

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.830
[footsteps]

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.915
[YOTA]
Hm?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.293
Ann, what's wrong?

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.920
Why are you barefoot?

00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:56.716
[HINA] Romi. In truth, I've been
summoned to the royal capital.

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.177
I learned from
the Elder yesterday.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.178
Why, though?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.805
I don't know, but they tell me

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.891
I'm the only one who
can save our world.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.184
But why right now?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.810
When will you be back?

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.230
My duty will be indefinite.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.232
[YOTA]
Indefinite? You mean...

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.150
[KAKO]
Forgive me, young man.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.986
But she shan't lay eyes
on this place again.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.155
Hey! Now you sound like Hina!

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.825
Cut! Yota, can you, like,
please stop going off‐book?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.786
[YOTA] Sorry, I couldn't
stay in character.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:25.912
[KAKO]
Speaking of!

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.997
Why the hell did you
cast me as an old man?

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.583
Didn't seem to bother you
when you were doing your makeup.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.627
And you, leave the
thee and thou crap to me!

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.212
We sound too much alike!

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.630
I won't.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.132
Now, now, I understand,

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.593
but Hina's been working
hard on her performance.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.221
So can you please find it in
your heart to let her continue?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.724
[KAKO sighs] Fine, but only
because you asked me.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.142
[YOTA]
Thank you and sorry.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.770
[SORA]
All right, take two. Places!

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.147
[SORA]
Now time for the scene where

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.566
Ann messes up at cracking eggs.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.567
Action!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.236
I swear today shall be the day

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.446
I finally complete
my special cake!

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.448
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:06.911
Once more then!

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.372
[YOTA]
That was not acting.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.542
[HINA]
And once more! Once more!

00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:13.793
[gasps]

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:18.673
We can stop.

00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.676
Nay, I shan't move from
here until I've succeeded!

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.970
[YOTA]
Whoa. She's not kidding.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.935
Damnable eggs!
By what right do you‐‐

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:34.731
[YOTA]
It's okay, Ann.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.733
I don't mind if you're clumsy.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.651
I like you the way you are.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.947
[gasps]

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.451
Uh, indeed these be
ill‐suited for baking,

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.618
but fine for scrambling!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.538
For it would hardly do
to let food go to waste!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.874
[YOTA] Well there's a little
bit of shell in there.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:56.627
[HINA] Uh, yea, for to
fortify it with calcium!

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.465
[ASHURA]
Sorry for the wait.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.924
‐‐Aye.
‐‐Thanks.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.426
And take your time, bro.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.136
Wait, what do you mean?

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.849
That boy told me that you
put your life in grave peril

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.186
to save mine, and did not waver
over the choice for a moment.

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.313
[YOTA]
Uh, when was that?

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.231
'Twas just at
the summer festival.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.109
Too recent a memory to have
passed from even thy mind.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.111
Oh, right. That deal.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.697
Yet both our days are
numbered regardless.

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.240
Wherefore, then?

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.452
I don't think that matters.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:33.247
You've done a lot for me,
and for all these people, too.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.957
So of course I'd
want to help you.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.250
[HINA]
Then it was some perceived debt

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.960
that compelled thy actions?

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.630
Well, I do owe you.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.840
But really, it's more
that having you around

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.801
made this summer lots of fun.

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:48.346
I see.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.808
[YOTA gasps]
But either way.

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.977
The world is ending
in a few days, right?

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.188
[HINA] It is indeed,
and shan't tarry for us.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.025
And thou knowest well that
my predictions fail not.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:04.529
That's sad. I wish it wouldn't.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.156
Hey! Where's craft
services, you guys?

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.533
Uh, hi, Dad.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.659
You're perfect!

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.743
[DAICHI]
Hm?

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.246
You have not been
able to ascertain

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.206
the cause of the world's ruin?

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.332
[KYOKO]
The mages are currently

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.085
endeavoring to investigate,
Your Majesty.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.753
But we still need more time!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.173
[KAKO] And yet there be no
more time to give, my king.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:27.718
[DAICHI] Sir Levia. What exactly
are you trying to say?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.847
Something deep in the abyss
beareth down on our world.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:32.140
To gaze upon it would surely

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.392
grant the understanding
thou seek'st.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.227
And cut!

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:38.771
Hey, Sora? The script
says they're supposed to be

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.398
in a temple for this sequence.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.649
So will this work?

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.152
[HINA] 'Tis no matter
before the power of CGI.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.653
Do we know how to do that?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.738
'Tis the digital age
and free production

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.740
software packages abound.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.160
This shall be but
a trifle to me.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:56.038
And so, having composited
the image thusly...

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.623
You have not been
able to ascertain

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.750
the cause of the world's ruin?

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.294
[KYOKO] The mages are
currently endeavoring

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.588
to investigate, Your Majesty.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.131
But we still need more time!

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.299
What temple is that?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.342
They're just floating
up in the sky!

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.636
[HINA]
Then let us try another.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.180
...cause of the world's ruin?

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.389
[KYOKO]
The mages are currently

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.434
endeavoring to investigate,
Your Majesty. But we...

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.144
[YOTA]
Now they're in Shibuya!

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.479
Why would they hold
an important meeting

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.439
in the middle of
a giant crosswalk?

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.691
Be this more to thy liking?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.526
You have not been able

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.611
to ascertain

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.778
the cause of the

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.613
world's ruin?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.531
[YOTA] What, is he leaping
through spacetime now?

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.700
And who even are
all these people?

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.118
My apologies!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.871
These photos date to the
time of Sir Daichi's youth.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.040
How could that be an accident?

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:39.874
[KYOKO]
The mages are...

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.460
[HINA] Lo, this backdrop
comporteth with our setting.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.337
[SORA]
Wow, that looks legit!

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.717
[ASHURA] Hey, guys,
let's call it for today.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.845
Huh. It has gotten
late, hasn't it?

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.430
Thanks for real, y'all.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.682
And let's try and keep up
this pace tomorrow.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.808
[KAKO]
Tomorrow?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.977
How little do you think
my time is worth?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.188
Wouldst thou abandon thy
claim to the leading role

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.940
and cede it to me uncontested?

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.815
Like hell!

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.194
I'll be on set bright and early,
you brat, that role is mine!

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.409
[KYOKO giggles]
I had fun today.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.662
Sorry for interrupting
your test prep.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.622
No, it's fine.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:23.584
And honestly, you always seem to
be having so much fun with Sato.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.378
It's really nice to see that.

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.631
Uh‐‐ Wow. I didn't realize
it looked that way.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.258
I'm a little bit jealous.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.510
Wait. Why would you be jealous?

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.804
Everything is packed, isn't it?

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:37.640
Bye, Narukami. Till tomorrow.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.226
[YOTA]
Uh, mm‐hmm.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:41.644
See you then.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.313
[SORA] We crushed it
today, guys! Good work!

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:45.231
[HIKARI]
Great job team!

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.190
[LOAN SHARK 03A]
See ya tomorrow.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.024
[ASHURA]
Later guys!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.818
[HINA] On the morrow
we meet once again!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:49.944
[CRONY 04A]
Ma'am!

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:54.198
[sighs] 'Twas an enjoyable day,
though taxing indeed!

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.034
There's a part of me
that still wants to study.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.162
Like, is it really okay for me
to be having all this fun?

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.957
Aye, 'tis a sin to live so well.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:05.293
Be you a mortal or a god.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:09.255
Oh? So you do like it here,
and you admit it, too,

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.548
even though you're a god.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.717
Uh‐‐ Speak not such foolishness!

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.051
Thy hovel is naught but a speck

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.095
next to the godly
realm of Asgard!

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:19.098
To compare thy conditioned
air to the hyperborean gales,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.058
'tis like the breath of a baby!

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.560
[YOTA]
What's a "hyperborean"?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:23.811
[HINA]
Thou dunce!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.689
At thy age,
context clues elude thee?

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.695
Aw, come on!

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:35.573
Did this seriously slip
past all of you people?

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.033
What's that?

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.328
[HIROTO]
You confirmed the handwriting

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.705
in the visitor log
was Doctor Korogi's,

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.165
so did nobody notice
that he wasn't

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:46.459
on the security
camera in the lobby?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.377
That seems worth
writing down, doesn't it?

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.254
[RAITA]
Hm. Good point.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.925
Security won't know we're here.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.179
I could go for a hot shower,
so let's make this quick.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.555
[HIROTO]
Isn't it hot enough?

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.557
[RAITA] It's not too hot
for takoyaki, is it?

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:02.933
[HIROTO]
The flames of Hell itself

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.227
wouldn't be too
hot for takoyaki.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.026
[RAITA]
It's miserable in here.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.403
I'm steaming in this suit
like a giant lobster.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:15.237
Hurry this up.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.906
Like I'm enjoying it.

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.616
If we don't find the data now,

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:21.911
that has to mean
Doctor Korogi beat us to it.

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.287
Dammit all!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.122
There's no way to
get to it from here.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.375
Sounds to me like
you're all talk.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.626
You shut your mouth.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.544
I'm not giving up yet.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.178
[RAITA] Why are you so
fixated on this facility?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.805
My data points here.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.223
There's zero doubt
the good doctor

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.225
was involved with this lab.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.559
Betcha some takoyaki.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.228
[RAITA]
That's a pretty cheap bet.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.647
Not for me. [gasps]

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.400
[HIROTO]
Got one!

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.945
You do make an excellent goon.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:56.862
[RAITA]
Excuse me?

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.364
[HIROTO]
What? It's a compliment!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.907
We work well together.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.129
[HIROTO] Research on
natural immune systems?

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.296
This isn't his field.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.758
So why would the lab have
been involved with him?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.429
Interesting stuff, but it has
nothing to do with Korogi.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.805
[groans]

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.057
I think I might have
found something.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:30.563
Oh! You most certainly have!

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.157
So this is the
professor's house, huh?

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.784
[RAITA]
It seems we're too late.

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:47.163
You two! This is an active
worksite, it's not safe!

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.623
Sorry, sir. Could you
please tell us

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.500
when this demolition started?

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.919
[WORKSITE FOREMAN 07A] Hm. Near
the start of the month I think?

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.880
This was the house where
my grandfather lived

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.923
until he passed, sir.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.925
I hadn't been out
here in a while.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.303
I was hoping to get
one last look at it.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.055
I feel for ya,
but the work order's in.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.058
Do you know what happened
with his belongings inside?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.644
They came by just yesterday
and took them away.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.313
Bad timing, bud.

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.606
Thank you!

00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:19.653
[gasps] That's it! Go!

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.405
There might still be time!

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:32.249
Is this it? Hang on!

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.136
[WORKER 07A]
Hey! Who the hell are you?

00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:45.805
Where's the stuff
you got yesterday?

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:46.639
[WORKER 07A]
Huh?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.640
Tell me now!

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.975
They were demolishing a house
and your guys cleaned it out!

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.477
Oh, yeah, we did.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:54.897
But we already put all of
that on the processing line.

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:56.273
Kid, wait!

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:07.493
[RAITA]
Hey. You can't‐‐

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:08.702
Don't!

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.212
[gasps] This is it!

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:21.549
Hey, I found‐‐

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.766
Whew! Wow, that was
really close!

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.311
Damn. I so could've died.

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.897
You would have, if I hadn't
been there to catch you.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:41.694
[HIROTO chuckles] But at least I
finally tracked down his secret.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.487
Right, Professor?
