WEBVTT

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.558
[KYOKO]
Hey, Dad?

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.811
You didn't forget, right?

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.856
You promised me we'd visit
Mom's grave together.

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.650
I'm coming up on a deadline.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.028
Are you shutting yourself
in the house again?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.404
[KYOKO'S DAD]
I'll go next year.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.573
[KYOKO] That's what
you say every year.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.495
I'm going to study.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.765
[KYOKO]
Not quite.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.642
Edge AC is the
diameter of the circle

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.478
circumscribed around
triangle ADC, right?

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.729
Oh, yeah, I missed that.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:26.647
See?

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.609
Sorry about that.
So is this right?

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.027
[KYOKO]
That's it.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.153
[sighs]

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:37.491
Honestly, I feel bad for making
you pull all the weight here.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:40.744
Oh. Excuse me. That sigh
was about something else.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.413
Uh... Too much time studying?

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:46.333
[KYOKO]
No. Studying never bothers me.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.419
But things at home
have been prickly.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.672
[YOTA] Did you get in
a fight with your dad?

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.799
Well no. It's just...

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.051
He never leaves
the house anymore.

00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:58.345
I see. I guess working from home

00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:01.390
isn't that big a deal
for a translator. So then‐‐

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.643
Ever since Mom passed away,
he's hardly gone outside.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.813
He's basically been a shut‐in
for more than ten years now.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.856
Even when I go to visit
her grave every year,

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.900
he never comes with me.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.695
He just promises me
that he will next year.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.154
That must be tough.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.699
Well, it does make things tense.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.076
Hold on. Does that mean
you've been coming here

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.285
to get out of the house?

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:23.370
Yes.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.458
[YOTA] This whole time I thought
you were coming here to see me.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.920
[HINA] So? Is it this matter
that bringeth thy spirits low?

00:03:31.962 --> 00:03:32.921
[YOTA]
Obviously.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:35.924
Doth not the desire to
give her solace stir in thee?

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.093
[YOTA] It's complicated
trying to close the distance

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.596
with the opposite sex.
I understand that now.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.265
Maybe that means I'm growing up.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.142
You're a fool!

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.685
Hast thou forgotten
that all that is shall

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.521
cease to be 12 days hence?
Wouldst thou have her family

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.481
come to their ends
un‐reconciled?

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.775
Obviously I'd like to see them
work things out, but I‐‐

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.485
[HINA]
Then cease thy moping and go!

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.237
And I shall
accompany thee as well!

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.531
Hold on, where are
we going? To do what?

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:00.657
To Izanami's father,

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.368
that he may come out
into the world again.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.121
[doorbell rings]

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.956
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Yes? Izanami residence.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:10.250
Hi, sir. My name
is Yota Narukami.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.586
Your daughter and I have
been friends for a long time.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.464
[KYOKO'S DAD] Oh, hi, Yota.
She's out right now.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.758
No. This is about you.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.468
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Huh? What is it?

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.261
Actually, if it's not
too much trouble,

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:24.806
I was hoping you would
join me for a quick stroll?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.684
[KYOKO'S DAD] I have work.
Some other time maybe.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.686
He's not on
summer vacation, too!

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.855
What man would be enticed
from ten years' seclusion

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:34.065
by the mere offer
of thy company?

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.319
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Yes? Izanami residence.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.446
[YOTA]
Hi, sir. This is Yota Narukami.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.740
Your daughter and I have
been friends for a long time.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.116
[KYOKO'S DAD]
She's out right now.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.452
No. This is about you.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.578
[KYOKO'S DAD]
What is it?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.914
I know a place, where the
girls are extra friendly.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.999
You want in, bro?

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.293
[KYOKO'S DAD]
I have work. No time.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.420
Did thy faculties
take leave of thee?

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.714
Huh? Well you said I
should "entice" him,

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.591
and the guy's been alone for
ten years, so I just thought‐‐

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.343
[HINA] Oh, what, that he
might wanna hit the clubs

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.595
with a frickin' minor?

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.890
You two gonna ogle some girls
barely older than his own kid?

00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.475
[YOTA]
So what do I do then?

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:11.686
[HINA] Hmm. When is the
maiden Izanami's birthday?

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:12.729
The 29th of August.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.356
That should have not
come out so fast.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.024
Wait, that's soon!

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.528
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Yes? Izanami residence.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.655
[YOTA]
Hi, sir. This is Yota Narukami.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.989
Your daughter and I
have been friends for...

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.534
This exchange be
rehearsed enough, surely.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.160
[YOTA] Well I would really
like to get your daughter

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.995
a gift for her birthday.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.498
I hope you can point me
in the right direction.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.083
Can you help me
pick something please?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:33.917
[KYOKO'S DAD sighs]

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.252
Steady onward!

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.045
I wanna make her happy, sir.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:37.879
If you'll help me,

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.798
I think I can give her
something she'll love!

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.050
I think she would
treasure this gift forever!

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.010
I know in the depths
of my heart she would!

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.346
Is it a birthday gift
or engagement ring?

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.889
‐‐[door unlocks]
‐‐[YOTA gasps]

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.142
So it's just gonna
be the two of us?

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.562
[HINA] Nay, I as well.
Odin, wisest and

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.731
most adoreable‐est
of the gods. [giggles]

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.899
Well this is new.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.402
My daughter's the only girl
I've ever seen you with.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.153
It's not like that, sir!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.697
She's just a relative
who's been staying

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.574
with my family
for the summer break.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:09.160
Oh really. Yeah, I guess
it is that time of year.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.581
[YOTA] Sure is! Great day
to be outside, don'tcha think?

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.207
Why not?

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.377
Uh... You're not gonna
change clothes first?

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.505
[KYOKO'S DAD] Well it's not like
I'm going to a meeting, is it?

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.884
Then the troubles that afflict
him have deeply taken root.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.386
Do you have a general idea
of what you're looking for?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.305
I was kinda thinking
we just start browsing

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.390
and you can offer me your input.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.270
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Everything's so different.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.938
'Course, it has been
several years now

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.773
since I've been out here.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.984
Do you really spend
that much time at home?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.277
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Basically the only place I go

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.908
is the convenience store.
What kind of food is this?

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.826
This is a white
curry restaurant.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.038
Huh. What a brave
new world this is!

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.998
There's turmeric
and chili powder.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.708
And charred onions as well!

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.752
How can all that
add up to white?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.420
Just what kind of
culinary alchemy

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.298
could be in effect here?
I must know!

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.639
So it's white because
it has a generous

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.849
helping of cheese in it, huh?

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.684
Truly delicious!

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:18.313
I'm picking up a sort of
exotic air from this restaurant.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.065
This is a Korean
restaurant that's famous

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.566
for its cheese dak galbi.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.859
"Cheese dak galbi"!

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.362
I've heard about
that. I need it!

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.823
[KYOKO'S DAD]
It's like a river of cheese.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.076
Should I really destroy
something this beautiful?

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.285
Uh...

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.746
[KYOKO'S DAD] How are all these
new restaurants so chic?

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.332
Apparently at this one,
they pour melted raclette cheese

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.959
over your food
right at the table.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.168
I'm going!

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:44.172
It's like being
a young girl in the Alps!

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.966
Well I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:49.177
Why are we just running around
eating things covered in cheese?

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.762
Be there an issue?

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.389
What about the present‐‐

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.519
[HINA]
'Twas but pretext, you fool!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.604
For this be thy
true goal, and lo,

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.107
thy mission is already
well‐nigh completed!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.359
[YOTA]
Oh yeah, good point.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.736
A wine would pair
nicely with this.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.239
Pardon me, but may I
order a drink, please?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.449
Ah. Yes, feel free, sir.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.625
[KYOKO'S DAD] It's been some
time since I had such fine wine.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.670
Reminds me of how things were.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.588
She'd be sitting across
the table from me,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.881
right where you are,

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.801
handling the wine much
better than I could manage.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.763
Now, here I am,
about to go through

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.766
this entire bottle by myself.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.601
I think I should be with her.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.477
Heck yeah!

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.105
Hold on. Pray thee tell.

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.858
For whose company
dost thy heart long?

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.403
Obviously...
I want to see my wife.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.158
You can't do that,
sir! Go, Yota!

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.869
Please don't, sir, your daughter
needs you! No matter how hard...

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.871
That's not what I meant, guys!

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.917
[YOTA] Your wife
left you video messages?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:03.918
For just a little while,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.004
they allow me to
be with her again.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.507
The lady Izanami entrusted
some parting words to thee?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.509
Please don't tell
my daughter about that.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.510
What?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.472
Are you saying she hasn't
had a chance to see them?

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:17.766
Wherefore?

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.976
[KYOKO'S DAD] I'm sorry, but
that's strictly a family matter

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.520
and I won't discuss it.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.106
So promise me. Don't tell her.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.906
[HINA] Ahh! Hark, Yota,
for this shop hath figures

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.908
of the monsters
from thy video game!

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.242
And yea, they be
precious in my sight!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.995
I don't think Izanami
would be into those.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.001
Yota. Be there in
thy home any video

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.754
of the lady Izanami
before her passing?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.965
Huh. I think we have some
pictures if that helps.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.009
A static image shall do no good,

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.678
but might there be video of
your two families' travels?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.640
[YOTA]
Hmm. I can ask Mom about it.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.312
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Oh, Kyoko, sweetie.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.648
You are absolutely
covered in sauce!

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.776
Gosh. See? Try to eat carefully!

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:10.777
Now just sit still for...

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.446
[HINA] So this is the mother
of the maiden Izanami.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.408
[YOTA] She was such a kind lady.
A truly wonderful person.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.494
I have seen enough
to devise a sound plan.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.746
Uh, you mind
telling me what it is?

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:25.250
Izanami hath not been told of
her mother's final message.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.584
That a child should
be so deprived

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.837
is more than I'm
willing to abide!

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.714
ou were like this back
when you heard about Jinguji.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.925
It seems like problems
involving people's moms

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.303
set you off somehow.
Did something happen?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.848
I have no parents. I am a god.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.057
Could you drop the
gimmick for a sec‐‐

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.351
Forsooth. This tragedy
hath taken root in

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.938
the house of Izanami and
borne the fruit of strife.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.149
If that's true,
then it would really help

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.776
if she could see the messages
her mom recorded.

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.320
Her and her dad both.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:55.697
But it's still
something they have to

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.740
deal with as a family.
We can't just‐‐

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.701
[HINA]
Aye. Then let us become family.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:00.535
Huh?

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.120
Indeed, for it is known.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.955
The voice which calleth
out from thy phone

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.332
be not reproduced,
but synthesized.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.876
Uh‐‐ Really?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.752
Fool! 'Tis common sense!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.172
Hath their towers the bandwidth
to faithfully reproduce

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.965
the full timbre of the
multitudes of voices

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.426
conversing at any time
upon their networks?

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.428
They bear but the
voice's parameters,

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.139
that thy phone may select
a passable approximation.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.849
If that's how they work,

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.976
then I can sound like
Izanami on the phone!

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.520
Purge thy mind of such thoughts.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.522
Okay fine,
then what are we doing?

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.566
I place a call to
Izanami on thy phone,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.902
whilst disguising
my voice as her mother's.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:34.777
What?

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:39.407
Heh. And verily, my manner
shall be as hers in the utmost.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.410
All right. But what about
the part where that's insane?

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:47.373
[HINA chuckles] Thou need'st but
put thy faith in Odin almighty.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.710
Hey, Izanami. What's up?

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.213
Hi, Narukami. How are you?

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.216
So, uh, has your dad said
anything to you lately?

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:57.258
Uh‐‐like what?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.386
Oh no, never mind!
Welp. Let's study!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.471
[KYOKO]
Hm?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.852
[sighs] I say we
call it for today.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.479
I'm fine with that.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.025
[YOTA]
Izanami.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:14.943
[KYOKO]
Hm?

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.904
[YOTA] Weird question, but if
you could have a conversation

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:21.282
with your mother right now,
would you want to?

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.158
[gasps]

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.701
'Cause see, I've been
getting really into

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.328
magic research lately.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.622
Keep this to yourself, but I
managed to build a cell phone

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.290
that can connect
to the underworld.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.918
And that very phone is
in my hand right now.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.170
You're probably thinking I've
gone crazy, and believe me,

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.006
I get that, but just try
to keep an open mind.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.258
Have you tested it?

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.635
Were you able to talk with
anyone on the other side?

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.346
Of course, yeah!
There was, uh...

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.932
I talked to Natsume
Souseki for a bit.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.016
[KYOKO]
What did he say?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.394
"I am a cat.
As yet I have no name."

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.187
He just dropped that
in a conversation?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.607
Exactly! There musta been some
kinda time weirdness going on

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.694
'cause he was all,
"Yeah, there's an opening."

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:59.988
That sounds like
a miraculous moment.

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:04.200
Uh‐‐ Don't worry about the
details. Just go with it, okay?

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.126
Yes, hello?

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.044
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Hello! Kyoko?

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.629
[KYOKO]
Hm? It's me.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.799
[KYOKO'S MOM] Wonderful.
This is your mother calling.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.968
You sound exactly like her.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.679
[KYOKO'S MOM chuckles]
Almost like I am her.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.807
[KYOKO] Somehow, this really
does feel nostalgic.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.267
[KYOKO'S MOM]
That's great, sweetie!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:32.562
You don't know how happy I am
to talk with you again.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.023
[KYOKO] Hey, Mom.
Where are you right now?

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.608
[KYOKO'S MOM] I'm in the
land of the dead, of course!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.985
[KYOKO]
Are you doing all right?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.028
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Oh, I'm great!

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.779
That Hades guy
took a liking to me,

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.407
and being friends with
a god has its perks.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.534
[KYOKO giggles]
I'm glad to hear it.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:49.370
[YOTA] Was that Izanami
actually laughing?

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:53.833
[KYOKO] Mom. Was it...
Was dying hard on you?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.543
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Nothing is permanent.

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.338
Everything that exists
goes through changes,

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.048
and I knew that
my day was coming.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.217
Having time to prepare
made things much easier.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.053
It was what fate
had in store for me,

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:09.474
and I accepted that.
Now, I'm gonna have to go soon.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.767
[gasps] Go where?

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.685
[KYOKO'S MOM]
To the next life.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.354
Can we talk when you get there?

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.521
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Aww, sweetie.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.607
It's a miracle that
we're talking right now.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:18.900
Please stay with me!

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:21.736
[KYOKO'S MOM] When you miss me,
watch my video messages.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.280
[KYOKO]
Video messages? Hold on!

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.450
[KYOKO'S MOM] Honestly!
I told your father to show you!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.870
I'm sure they just slipped
his mind. Be sure to ask him.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.247
Then you can
watch them together.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.667
Anyway, that's it!
Hades is calling for me.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.629
It's inventory day, and so of
course he's absolutely slammed.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.423
[YOTA] Why would a god of death
have an inventory day?

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.800
Wait. Mom!

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.760
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Well, goodbye, Kyoko!

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.428
[gasps]

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.391
So... How is she?

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.102
She said she left
video messages.

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:57.730
I really need to go home.
Thank you very much!

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.902
Izanami.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.780
This shall surely set
things in motion for them.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:06.948
Uh‐huh.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.379
Is it true?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.757
Dad, did Mom really leave us
video messages? Tell me!

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:28.094
[gasps] How'd you know?
Did Yota say that?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.972
Then it is. Why would you
hide them from me?

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.348
I can't explain it.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.225
Have you watched them already?

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.352
I haven't seen the end.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.396
I just can't bear
to finish them.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.858
I always find myself
re‐watching the same parts

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.068
over and over again.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.238
They're what I've been
holding onto all these years.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.741
And if I ask to watch them,
will you let me?

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.910
Just not all the way through.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:57.790
Hi, Kyoko!

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.459
Happy seventh birthday, sweetie!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.668
They're to me?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.962
[KYOKO'S MOM]
...elementary school, right?

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:06.299
To think my rowdy little girl
is in elementary school now.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.675
Even when you really want to,

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:11.220
it's never okay to
hit the boys, you got it?

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:13.389
Now I have something
to tell you.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.682
I know I hadn't mentioned this,

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:17.727
but I've been studying magic
for quite some time.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:21.272
And I'm looking for a spell
that can make a happy family.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.650
I think I'm almost there,
so hold on a bit longer!

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:29.280
Hi, Kyoko! I hope you have
a happy 13th birthday.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.366
I'm sure you're busy with school
and learning about love,

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:35.786
though I do worry you'll ruffle
the boys' feathers a little bit.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:39.582
That happens sometimes with
rambunctious girls like you.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:43.044
I've kept working on my spell
and I almost have it ready now.

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:45.213
But I'll let you
see it next time.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:50.051
[KYOKO'S MOM] Hi, Kyoko!
Happy 18th birthday, sweetie!

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:51.636
By this point I'm sure
you've grown up

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.346
into a lovely young lady.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.431
What kind of guys
do you like, I wonder?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.101
Maybe you're a sucker
for a pretty face like me!

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:03.064
Listen. My next message
for you will be my last.

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.233
Huh? But why now?

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.527
You just asked why, didn't you?

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:09.987
[giggles] Well, I'll tell you.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.822
Once you finish
watching these messages,

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.324
I need you to destroy them,

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:16.452
and then I'm gonna need you guys
to forget all about me.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.705
You can do that
for me, right, hon?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.334
[KYOKO'S DAD sighs]
That's as far as we can go.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.671
Could that be why?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:31.217
[KYOKO] When I was little,
I was kind of a troublemaker.

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:34.011
But then, ever since Mom died,

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.347
I've kept everything
so bottled up.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.184
So I wonder if watching
her last message

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.686
might help me change that.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.604
Help me open up a little.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.691
Hey, Dad. Let's watch the rest.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.900
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Not yet.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.237
We can't live in the past.
Our lives have to keep going!

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:55.616
We'll do it together.
I'm right here with you.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.326
You won't lose me, too, okay?

00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.494
[KYOKO'S DAD gasps]

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:03.332
We'll be fine, right, Dad?

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.042
Let's watch the rest.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.921
[KYOKO'S DAD]
Okay.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.341
[KYOKO'S MOM]
Your father has always been

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.176
very talented at his work,

00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.971
but everyday life can be
a bit of a struggle for him.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.681
The one thing that
came easily to him

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.808
was loving me with all he had,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.977
and it won't be easy
for him to give that up.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.813
I'm sure he'll be
depressed when I'm gone.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.481
But I want him to be happy.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.192
I hope he'll move on
and meet somebody new.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.903
Please give him
that wish for me.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.573
Of course I realize this is
your father we're talking about,

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.824
and I'm sure he's still going to

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.493
spend plenty of time
moping over me.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.912
Yes, dear, you will.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.205
You, too, Kyoko.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:46.000
Are you in low spirits
now that I'm gone?

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.377
'Cause that's the
last thing I wanted.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.880
And that's why
I'm gonna do this!

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:52.965
My grand magic spell
is finally complete

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.384
and it's time to cast it on you!

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.553
Once it's cast, you can
never be free of it.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.180
It's permanent and unbreakable,

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:02.099
so get your heart ready
to be enchanted, okay?

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.601
Ready? Here we go!

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.477
Not yet!

00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:06.812
Okay. Grand Magic.

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.649
"Go Be Happy!"

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.321
There, the spell has been cast.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.156
Time for you to forget about me.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.742
Carry on and let your
lives move forward.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:22.328
As of this moment,
I am a stranger to you both.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.039
Don't forget to
destroy the video, okay?

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.708
Bye, everybody,
that's all we got!

00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:32.421
So that's it.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:35.716
You know that could never work.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:39.095
You know I'll never be
able to forget about you.

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.346
You can't just wave a wand

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:42.348
and take yourself
out of my memories.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.267
I want you there
more than anything!

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.061
That spell won't work!

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.563
[KYOKO chuckles]

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.400
How can you be laughing?

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.902
It's just so like Mom, right?

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.280
No. It's like that lady.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.657
Kyoko.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.158
This whole time,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.203
I was sure losing her
was the hardest on me.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.289
I believed that I was
the one suffering the most.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:09.959
I was wrong about that.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.795
I never understood
how much you were hurting.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:17.007
Listen, Dad. Let's believe in
the power of Mom's spell.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.009
And if we do, maybe it'll work.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.762
We can live happy lives
like she wanted.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:22.888
We have to try.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.142
She worked so hard for us
on that magic spell.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.352
Don't let her love go to waste.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:32.940
Amazing. Kyoko, when did you
become as strong as you are?

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.360
Just now, when Mom
cast that spell on us.

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:40.281
She wanted us to move on and
be happy, so I have no choice.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.992
Her magic is way too
powerful to fight.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.703
Let it work, Dad.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.038
Don't stay locked up in here.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.832
Go out into the world.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.334
Meet all kinds of new people.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.420
Someone who can love you.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:59.425
That's part of Mom's spell,
so you have to. It's magic.

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:06.682
You think so?
Course you're right.

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:08.726
How could I stand
against the grand magic

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:12.438
your mother spent so many hours
of her life trying to master?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.566
I can't beat her.
There's no way.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:35.938
‐‐[doorbell rings]
‐‐[BOTH] Hm?

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.941
[panting]

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:40.734
Whoa, is everything okay?

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:43.112
I came here to tell you
how much your magic phone

00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:45.072
just helped me and my dad.

00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:47.783
I felt like I needed
to say thank you.

00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:51.328
But I... I wasn't
thinking about how.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.248
My heart zoomed over
and I followed it here.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.083
I don't have to
keep it bottled up.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.459
Because you helped me.

00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.336
No need to thank me! I just‐‐

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.588
But you spent all that time

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:02.715
making the magic
phone for me, right?

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.009
You're the whole reason
I got to talk to my Mom again.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.176
Oh, it was nothing!

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.971
In fact I never meant to
build an afterlife phone, so...

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:11.974
It was way too amazing
to just be an accident.

00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:14.226
So, truly. Thank you.

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:16.270
Well, I'm glad I could help.

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.647
So then, you think there's
anything I could do

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:20.983
to pay you back for
all you've done for me?

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:22.359
[gasps]

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:23.777
[YOTA] Could this be
the moment to tell her

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.946
how I feel about her again?

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.365
Can I make it count this time?

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.617
Izanami?

00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:31.118
Uh‐huh?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.038
[YOTA]
You think we could...

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.625
Surely the romance he nurtures
shall bear fruit hereafter.

00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:42.212
Yet still, my heart stirreth.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.798
What might this
fresh unease portend?

00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:48.928
Sorry. The words just
wouldn't come out.

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.721
Wherefore the heck not?

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.681
It was done. You had it!

00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:54.516
What is wrong with you?

00:23:54.558 --> 00:23:56.894
I guess it felt too much
like cheating to me.

00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:59.146
It's not cheating if it's
divine intervention!

00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:00.898
I'm really sorry.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.483
Though I should expect as much,

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.652
for such is thy nature
for better or for worse.

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:06.487
You sound so relieved.

00:24:07.613 --> 00:24:08.906
To hear my power demeaned

00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:10.950
by thy mortal
tongue as cheating?

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:12.868
Nay, I should reveal
thy hidden proclivities

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.495
to the world to punish thee!

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.540
[YOTA] Please! Anything
but my proclivities!
