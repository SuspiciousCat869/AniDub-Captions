WEBVTT

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.527
[gasps] Hey! You okay, Sora?

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.952
Hey, guys. Sora woke up!

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.371
[DAICHI] Your friend told us
what happened last night.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.541
She said you were running from
a debt collector and you fell.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.292
So how did that happen?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.089
It's because they
came after Jinguji.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.923
Who's that?

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.050
She was my mentor
in the film club,

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:51.635
and she's done a lot for me.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.345
But even so,
you can't put yourself

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:54.388
in harm's way like that.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.973
But she needs help, y'all!

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.141
Her mom is, like,
her only family,

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.477
and stuff is too much right now!

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.855
[HINA]
Thy meaning is obscured by

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.149
thy odd turn of
phrase yet again.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.985
But "she needs help" is clear.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.444
Um. What're you gonna do?

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.071
Knowest thou not
who speaks to thee?

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.156
I mean, like not really?

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.076
Hast thou forgotten the boons
I have granted thee?

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.620
For I'm a god.

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.205
What was it?

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.999
Thou may address us as Odin!

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.793
[YOTA] Her actual name
is Hina Sato though.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.461
Silence, thou wastrel!

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:27.963
What'd I do?

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.131
In my time among you,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.258
I've been called Hina
so much that the name Odin

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.968
had briefly escaped my grasp.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.762
So drop the backstory
and stick with Hina, maybe?

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.306
‐‐Huh?!
‐‐Oh, nothing.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.267
Ahem. Yea, verily,
victory is certain

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.977
if thou givest thy trust!

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.855
Nay, Yota? Hast thou not
witnessed many a miracle

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.189
brought about by my hand,

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.775
such that thou can hardly
conceive that I might fail now?

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:49.735
Not really.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.154
I've worked them in
thy presence, fool!

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.323
Doth thy mind take
leave of thee?

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.283
Or perhaps thy eyes see not?

00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:58.702
We may be able to do
something to help.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.996
Why don't you tell us
the whole story?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.051
Let us recap now.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.429
Sora's mentor has been
running a ramen restaurant

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.389
in place of her mother,
who has fallen ill,

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.141
but sales have
continued to decline.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.226
And furthermore, a creditor
has recently begun

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.979
pressing forcefully to
collect on a debt, right?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.023
And the interest rate is, like,
are you literally kidding me?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.858
[HINA, DAICHI]
Hmm.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.985
So she's dealing with
a shady lender.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.528
Well, you got any ideas?

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.613
Yea, 'tis but a trifle.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.032
We must spread word
of this restaurant.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.535
Don't you think they probably
already tried that though?

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.328
[HINA]
I shall take this on.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.873
For I, too, desire to bring
the art of ramen‐making

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.040
to a higher plane.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.001
You so don't seem like you can.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.795
Tis wrong to judge one
solely by appearance.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.173
Worse, when that one is a god.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.799
And Yota's gonna help out, too.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.593
Wait, what? Explain!

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.012
[HINA] Kitchens can reach
50 degrees or higher.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.889
Wouldst thou have me
endure such heat,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.141
clad as I am in
this godly attire?

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.685
So put on some
cooler attire then!

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.104
My holy garb must
always adorn me,

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.648
till the day I
cease to be a god.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.192
Or till I gotta take a bath.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.943
You do that every day!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.570
And it's not gonna be
fun for me either!

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.615
Well, your father has
to get back to work.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.409
You're free, aren't you, Yota?

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.787
But my college entrance
exams are almost here!

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.039
He says, after a
protracted campaign

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.332
to win the heart of
his childhood friend.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.958
Yeah, I get that, all right?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.253
Y'all, it's fine.
Just let me take care of it.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.131
Alas, 'tis plain to see
the task is beyond thee.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.925
It shall be arduous indeed.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.551
Yota. Will you help?

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.553
After all, you're her
big brother!

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.889
But like, you don't have to.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.811
[YOTA sighs]
Well I have no idea what to do,

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.062
but I'll try to help out.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.023
We've got this,
just leave it to us!

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.611
So by "us," guess you
actually meant just me.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.364
I have made my full
plan known to thee.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.991
Thou need not but carry it out.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.451
And what are these about?

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.119
For that Jinguji
may not recognize

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.247
thy face upon seeing thee.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.584
Yeah, I love brain freeze!

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:39.214
Ah! The cold doth pierce
my holy temple! Ahh!

00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:41.007
[YOTA]
And I'm worried.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.806
Good day. Is the shop open?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.975
[HIKARI]
Yes, sir! Please come in!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.143
And feel free to seat yourself.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:53.979
[gasps]

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.523
[YOTA] Now that I really
look at her, she's gorgeous.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:57.899
No, focus!

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.985
Enter thou first as a customer.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:04.406
Then order their specialty,
and thy work thereby commence.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.034
A bowl of your specialty,
if you would.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.537
Right. One Heavenward Ramen!

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.750
[YOTA] It's lunchtime and
there's nobody in here.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.878
[HIKARI]
Here's your order, sir.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.172
It's all‐natural
and free of additives!

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.841
Thanks for the meal.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:32.058
[YOTA] Huh. Well it
certainly isn't bad.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.476
Uh‐huh.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.773
[YOTA]
I see.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.737
Thank you once more.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.822
I would say the
flavor is adequate.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.074
But even so,
I found nothing here

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.868
that would bring me back
to your restaurant.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.827
Huh?

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.995
Ere we might proceed,

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.915
it is of the essence that thou
first gain the lady's trust.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.166
[YOTA]
I beg your pardon.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.960
Please, take my card.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:03.423
"Ramen restaurant rescue
consultant. Yota Narukami."

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.841
But you look so young!

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.509
I'm 40 years old, miss.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:07.761
I can't believe it!

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:08.678
[YOTA]
I get that a lot.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.556
If there were babyface contests,
you would win for sure!

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.807
There are, and I have.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.309
[HIKARI]
Whoa, for real?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.269
This says "Narukami."

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.605
Are you related to
my friend Sora, too?

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:19.898
She's my niece.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.483
You're Sora's uncle?

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.486
[YOTA] Yes. Trust me.
I'm on your side here.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.323
Now then. With my help, this
restaurant could become a hit.

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.534
So what do you say?
It's one hundred yen a day!

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.370
That's so cheap!

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.082
Although, it kinda sounds too
good to be true, honestly.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.251
Tell me, miss. Can you
answer this question?

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.214
Can she answer this
question? I say, "nay."

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.048
[YOTA]
<i>Shoyu</i> ramen.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.091
<i>Shio</i> ramen.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:46.967
Miso ramen.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.134
<i>Tonkotsu</i> ramen.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.845
All ramen dishes, of course,
but one of them is unique.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:52.138
So, which one is it?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.015
Uh, well no two are the same,

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.810
but in the end they're all
different ways to prepare ramen.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:00.814
Yes, but <i>shoyu</i>, <i>shio</i>, and miso
are named for their seasonings,

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.608
while <i>tonkotsu</i>'s name
derives from the broth.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.735
That's deep!

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.655
In only three days,
I can teach you all I know.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.365
For the low price of
three hundred yen,

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:13.118
we'll put your shop
on top once again!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.496
So then. Will you take
a chance on me, miss?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.459
Yes. I will. Thank you.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.919
[YOTA]
First off. I'm sorry,

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.546
but we have to
drop "Heavenward."

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.756
[HIKARI] What? But it's
my mother's restaurant

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.800
and she picked that
name herself, sir!

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.885
She would be so sad
if we changed it.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:31.970
Couldn't we focus on something‐‐

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.472
Learn to accept defeat!

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.766
To call this restaurant
"Heavenward" is a lie,

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.351
it's utterly earthbound!

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.061
You've fallen from
the height of ambition,

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.272
and if you can't admit it,
you'll be buried!

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.482
[HIKARI]
I... I understand.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.984
Fallen Angel.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.610
Beg your pardon?

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.864
[YOTA] That's the new name of
your restaurant, of course.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.992
[HIKARI]
Fallen Angel?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.326
[YOTA]
Now, you've admitted defeat

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.911
and decided to start fresh.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.456
We're taking the first step
into this shop's future.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.291
So, then, what do we do next?

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.168
Work on our signature dish, sir!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.128
[YOTA] A good guess,
but exactly wrong.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.880
You're never gonna
make it like that again.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.048
Never again?

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:11.259
[YOTA] The "no additives" angle
won't sell anybody anymore.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.094
You're adding depth
and <i>umami</i> to your broth

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.638
by simmering more pork
bones for a longer time.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.098
On the other hand,
you're adding gaminess

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.477
and introducing a much larger
volume of grease along with it.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.729
So you adjust the sauce
to compensate.

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.564
But that increases the
cost of your ingredients

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.316
and your electricity bill.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.943
Can you see the vicious cycle
you've been caught in, ma'am?

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.237
Okay. I do understand
what you're saying.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.074
A restaurant at the top of
its game could afford that.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.742
They'd recoup the cost.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.328
But not a shop
that's bleeding money.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:41.623
The recipe needs to
be thrown out now!

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.542
Make me the simplest thing
that can still be called ramen!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.376
Sir!

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.128
[YOTA]
Don't add! Only subtract!

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.047
No bells or whistles!
The bare bones,

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:50.632
and only as many as you need!

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.550
Use as few ingredients
as possible!

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.095
The flavor profile of your
broth will be flattened out.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.263
But that's why powdered
MSG was invented.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:59.182
<i>Umami</i> in a jar!

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.437
[HIKARI]
It's finished!

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.023
Let's see.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.155
[YOTA]
Ah! It's too good for words.

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.032
Please, taste it. You'll see.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.076
[HIKARI]
Okay.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.577
Wow, it's great!

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.329
It was so much simpler to make,

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.164
but the depth of flavor
is still there!

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.833
That's the first part.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.292
And now we create impact,

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.794
something unique
and eye‐catching,

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.504
so we can get those clicks.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.381
Oh, right! And then
people will come here

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.467
from all over to
see it in person! [gasps]

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.970
But that'll be easier
said than done, huh?

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:40.098
Here's something.
For the final touch,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.269
drip bonito stock in the soup,
right in front of the customer.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.646
Add bonito stock?

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.732
[YOTA] Yes, brew it into the
broth like a fine cup of coffee.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.985
It adds complexity to
the flavor and an element of

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.612
ritualistic splendor to
the dining experience.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.699
That first drop that hits
the bowl is our Fallen Angel.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.952
"The angel has
fallen!" Shout that.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.579
What's the point of
doing that, though?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.789
What? It's for impact!

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.499
Stop thinking, it's about feel!

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.709
Uh. Yes, sir!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.420
[YOTA] Right! Now it's time to
work on the cold noodle recipe.

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.881
If you wanna get customers into
your ramen shop in the summer,

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.424
<i>tsukemen</i> is your secret weapon.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.050
‐‐It's your trump card!
‐‐[HIKARI] Yes, sir!

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.844
So, like, hey, you guys.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.470
‐‐[YOTA gasps] Sora?
‐‐Oh, hi, Sora!

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.930
I wanna help y'all.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.098
[YOTA]
But why?

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.226
'Cause I'd feel bad if I
let you do alla the work.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.436
Please, let me help.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.897
Whatever you need done,
I can do it.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.398
Like, literally for free.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.482
[YOTA squeals]

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.776
Sora. I never dreamed
that I would hear you

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.904
say something so thoughtful!

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.031
I'm so proud of you right now!

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:39.741
There's a new side of you.

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.618
Back to business!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:42.619
Cold noodles!

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.120
Simple dipping sauce!

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.914
Just let the stock do the work.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.498
That's all the
flavor you'll need!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.875
Right!

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.960
Deal with that while
I fix your signage.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.295
[SORA]
Me, too!

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.632
[VOICE 03A]
Wow!

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.467
[YOTA]
Good enough for now at least.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.093
Why's it sexy though?

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.845
[HIKARI]
It's finished.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.430
[ALL]
We give thanks!

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.059
‐‐It's great!
‐‐Wow!

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.769
Whoa, nice.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.104
[ALL]
Thank you for this meal.

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:15.485
[YOTA]
I'm so tired.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:18.780
The ramen and the <i>tsukemen</i>
are sorted out now.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.323
Do I still have more to do?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.618
[HINA chuckles]
But of course.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.703
For the taping has yet to begin.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.830
Wait. As in TV?

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.584
Precisely. Such things
are trivial to a god.

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:32.627
For through human media,

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.421
half‐truths and lies
may be easily spread.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.714
The ramen rescue consultant

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.424
shall spread the good
news in an interview,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.968
and the customers shall
visit the restaurant

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:42.303
from afar in great throngs.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:47.558
I've willed it, and thus
it shall be so. [chuckles]

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.270
‐‐[HINA cackles]
‐‐[YOTA gasps] Creepy!

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.814
[HINA gasps] These lizards
come from the depths,

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.191
and yet stand on
two legs as men do?

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.443
How do they swim without
fins or even webbing?

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.444
Flutter kicks, right?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.281
They expend such energy
on simple locomotion?

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.241
Get thee to land, fools!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.077
Oh. And I shall attend
thy taping tomorrow.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.454
Yea, I must see to
the restaurant's floor.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.373
Oh, you're gonna help clean up?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:11.249
Well thank you!

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.500
No, dingus!

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.877
Could a god be compelled to
embrace something so mundane

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.671
as the cleaning
rituals of morta‐‐

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.382
Hey, Hina! Your bath's ready!

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.800
[HINA]
'Kay!

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.262
Guess that answers that.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.351
Admit your defeat!

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.353
[NARRATOR]
Mister Narukami's 41st birthday

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.813
should be a happy occasion.

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:35.231
But he's spending it here.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.191
His shouts of anger
filling up the tiny space

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.028
of his latest client's
ramen restaurant.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.323
First thing. You have to
get them to admit defeat.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:46.659
Humans have an inclination
to hang on to their pride.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.619
When you're young,
that's a good thing.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.621
But as you grow, you can
get tangled up in it

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:53.583
and dragged under if
you can't admit defeat.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.960
[NARRATOR] And this is more
than a rebranding campaign.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.629
His ideas are also at
work in the kitchen.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.174
[BOTH]
The angel has fallen!

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.051
[CUSTOMERS]
Ooh!

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.303
[INTERVIEWER] So the falling
angel, what's that about?

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:09.182
A fair enough question.
I'm not sure I can answer.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.393
[NARRATOR]
But the impact is undeniable.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:13.936
[CUSTOMER 03A]
Thanks, that was great!

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.981
[INTERVIEWER] And why rename
the restaurant "Fallen Angel"?

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.816
We live in a brave new world.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.152
Drifting through a sea of
information to which anyone

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.863
can add anything at
any time, true or not.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.907
Branding itself is devalued.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:28.701
We've forgotten what success is,
so everything fails.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.287
What brought us to "Fallen
Angel" is desperation.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:33.915
And whatever you think
that means, you're right.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.709
[NARRATOR]
But the impact is undeniable.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:37.919
At the age of 27,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.921
Mister Narukami began
a three‐year stint

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.215
with a foreign apparel company.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:46.094
An experience he says
changed his life completely.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.347
[YOTA] I was still young,
obsessed with staying on‐trend.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.891
You can't hold onto money
with that lifestyle, right?

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.018
But a thousand‐yen bowl
of ramen is as rich as

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.603
any meal money can buy.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:58.898
And a man can live his
whole life in one good suit.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.150
[NARRATOR] And for the
last ten years, he says,

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.153
Mister Narukami has
done exactly that.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.447
Even for outdoor
leisure activities.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.036
What is this? Is this
how you do things here?

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.622
[NARRATOR] But today,
he's got shouting to do.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:19.043
His anger isn't for him.
It's for the future of ramen.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.920
[HIROTO]
Well that was stupid.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:25.216
[sighs] I was out of
the country so long.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.760
Japanese food sounds
really good about now.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.721
[RAITA] And to eat it, you'd
need me to uncuff you, right?

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.559
Honestly, I'm not trying
to pull anything here,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.644
I seriously just want
something to eat!

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.354
Oh! Like <i>takoyaki</i>!

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.064
Enough already.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.276
[HIROTO] I think I've had
about enough of you.

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.944
What's gonna happen
if you won't even grant

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:47.238
a tiny indulgence like this?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.948
You remember when
your financial system

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.033
choked on all
those fake transfers?

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.202
Do you wanna see how
it does in round two?

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.079
Enough.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.415
Oh, boo. I'm just saying,

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.042
get me some <i>takoyaki</i>
and it won't happen.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:05.673
[HIROTO gasping]

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.343
[HIROTO]
Mm‐mm‐mm! Mm!

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.428
It's been so long that

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.513
I burnt off the entire
top layer of skin

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:16.476
on the inside of my mouth
and I don't care. So good!

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.978
The essence of Japanese food!

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.021
You should have some.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.147
No thank you.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.565
That's so wasteful.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.443
It's a local favorite, too.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.447
[AIRA'S MOTHER] Aira!
Where did you go, Aira? Aira!

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.491
Is everything okay here?

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.160
I lost track of
my daughter somehow.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:35.953
Where could she have run off to?

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.497
Goodness. Do you need help?

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.331
[AIRA'S MOTHER gasps]

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.333
Step back and mind
your own business.

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.626
Oh, come on, man,

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.504
this lady's daughter is
lost out there somewhere.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.713
Shouldn't we try and find her

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.257
before some creeper
grabs her off the street?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.634
Fine, but do it quickly.

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.177
Yeah, nice!

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.470
[AIRA'S MOTHER]
Here's a picture.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.972
[HIROTO]
Aww, she's precious!

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.140
Don't you worry, ma'am.

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.601
I'll track her down
in no time at all.

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:16.953
[HIROTO]
Hey, there you are.

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.412
Found her. Come with me!

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:19.789
[AIRA'S MOTHER]
Okay.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.963
[AIRA'S MOTHER]
Aira!

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:29.090
Mommy!

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.216
[AIRA'S MOTHER]
Why did you run off?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.510
Please don't be upset with her.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.428
That's what led her astray.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.639
An advertising drone.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.890
[AIRA'S MOTHER gasps]

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.475
[HIROTO]
I can break it if you like.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.477
Not without my authorization.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.146
[HIROTO] But why? Who cares
about a drone or two?

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:47.275
‐‐Let's go.
‐‐[HIROTO] Aww, already?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.527
Bye‐bye!

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.696
Bye, later!

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.532
[CUSTOMERS chattering]

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.200
[YOTA]
This line is insane.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.369
All has gone exactly to plan.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.037
Just one more thing.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.081
And after that
you can finally rest.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.500
Uh, wait, am I not done?

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.883
Sorry, we're closed
right now! [gasps]

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.511
Looks like you finally
made it work, huh?

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.930
Guess that means you can
pay us back now, yeah?

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:22.977
[gasps] Thirty percent interest
a month is highway robbery!

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:26.731
I have a promissory note
for that robbery.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.650
Full payment, with intere‐‐

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:30.860
Who is this brat?

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:34.238
Odin. Not a brat, but a god.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:38.451
Like I give a damn
what you are.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.912
Playtime is over!
Hold still! Hey!

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.414
Hark! Tag in!

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.874
Now I gotta fight a guy?

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.459
Who the hell's this joker?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.919
It was he who bade me
to pilfer thy contract.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.465
Get ready for an
ass‐beating! [yells]

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.010
Now, turn it
around on him. Do it!

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.637
That's completely insane!

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.597
Brace yourself, bastard!

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.891
[HINA] You need only follow
the numbers on the floor.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.726
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Now, go!

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.815
I can't hit him. You punk!

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:12.568
Number seven, with a
left hook as you go!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:14.987
Holy crap!

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.864
Now right cross on ten!

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.032
And he's vanquished!

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.701
Eight, nine... ten!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.340
Nicely done!

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.967
Ugh! Listen here, you bastard.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.260
Got something to say?

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:43.099
[gasps] Dammit! I'm letting
you live, just once!

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.142
This isn't over!

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.105
Heh. Trifling words
from a trifling man.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.857
But have we actually
resolved the problem?

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:53.025
'Tis done.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.695
For we've possession of
the usurious contract.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.114
[sighs] That's good to hear.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:00.700
So, my part's
finally done, right?

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.870
Wait. Sora? I thought you left.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.748
[HIKARI] I thought so.
You're Sora's brother.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.333
Yep, he is.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.459
Forgive me!

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.878
I lied to you in an
effort to win your trust.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.798
I told you I won
a baby‐face contest at 40.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.509
Frankly, I doubt there
even is such a contest!

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.220
Oh, yeah, I got that
a while ago.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:23.931
I used to be a member
of the film club,

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.267
so I can tell when
somebody's acting.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.352
But it was a lot
of fun, wasn't it?

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:29.895
Yeah. Good eye.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.439
Right? She's so cool!

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.732
[HIKARI]
Either way, our restaurant

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.150
was on a downhill slide,

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.736
and you turned things around
for us in just a week.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.863
You did that,
it wasn't a character!

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.615
Uh, well... Actually,

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:44.368
I've just been doing what
Hina said this entire time.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.662
[HIKARI]
Hina? This little girl?

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.373
Yes. It is as he says!

00:20:49.415 --> 00:20:52.084
No way. Could she be
an actual god?

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.587
Of course not!
That's completely ridiculous!

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.882
Things just keep coincidentally
going her way is all!

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:01.010
[HINA] Do not dismiss my divine
power as mere coincidence!

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:03.053
Ya friggin' dunderhead!

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.972
[YOTA]
Ow!

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.101
[RAITA]
He's here as ordered.

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:10.603
[CEO 03A]
Good work.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.232
It's been some time,
Young Mister Suzuki.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.484
Have you been in good health?

00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:19.695
Oh come on, why not use
my first name already, huh?

00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:21.363
You are my subordinate.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:22.573
Sure, but I've also got

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.617
the second most common
surname in Japan,

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:27.077
and if you were to call out
for a Suzuki in most places,

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.913
there would be a dozen
of 'em right there.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.248
Yes, ergo "Young Mister Suzuki."

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.751
[HIROTO] That makes me
sound like a little kid.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.754
Well, my first name is something
else my parents stuck me with,

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.923
so I'm not exactly attached.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:39.965
Anyway.

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:42.009
You called me all the way
back to Japan,

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.594
so what am I doing here?

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.763
There's something I
need you to track down.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.348
You'll be working with him.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.850
[HIROTO]
Hm? Really? This guy here?

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:52.561
That's correct,
we are now partners.

00:21:52.603 --> 00:21:54.897
I see. And if I won't?

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.274
Your future gets very painful.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.401
Enough, Young Mister Suzuki.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.237
Do not test me.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.658
Fine, I hear you.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.409
Well if I could get one thing.

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:10.162
I would do a much better job
working from home.

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:12.915
[CEO 03A]
Granted. I'll have it prepared.

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:17.670
[HIROTO] Huh. So this is who
they're sending me after?

00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:19.547
What'd you find? Talk.

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:23.092
[HIROTO] Shuichiro Korogi.
Theoretical physicist.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.052
A mind unparalleled
in the fields of

00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:27.555
quantum mechanics
and computer science.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.933
Oh, and he moonlights as a
genius software developer, too!

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:32.518
[RAITA]
That much we know.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.521
We hired you to figure out
what he's hiding.

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:37.314
Have we overestimated you?

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.817
[HIROTO]
Huh? Is that a joke?

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.444
This job'll be a piece of cake.

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.613
Yeah, just watch me.
