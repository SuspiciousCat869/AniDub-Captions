WEBVTT

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.818
[GIRL]
What words could convey it?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.571
It was a world where
all things were new.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:32.241
Each day shone
like a brilliant star.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.244
And so, too, do the
memories of that age shine.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.455
Treasures worth more than
all the world's riches.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.015
Forsooth, we are
an omniscient god!

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.066
‐‐So who‐‐
‐‐[GIRL] Stay thy tongue,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.569
for thy query
is yet known to me.

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.946
"Who standeth before mine eyes?"

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.072
That was basically it.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.533
Yet the answer was given
ere thou thought to ask!

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.660
For I am indeed
an all‐knowing god!

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.705
By the name Odin.

00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:05.292
Yea! As Odin shalt
thou address me!

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:07.461
‐‐Well, are you‐‐
‐‐I am not a lost child!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.838
By my own will have
I come to this place,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.008
and by that same divine will is
my being made known to thee.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.884
Hey, the police are‐‐

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.720
A god need not seek the
aid of civil authorities!

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:19.348
We are not bound by the child
welfare laws of mortals.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.307
‐‐[YOUTA] So what do‐‐
‐‐Yea.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.850
Then hear thee now my will!

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:24.728
I find myself intrigued by
the sporting rituals of thy kind

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.396
and should like to take part.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.649
First in the throwing of
the ball through the hoop.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.442
Thy task is to aid me in this.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.361
So then let's tarry no longer!

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.321
The spark of curiosity
burneth within!

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:36.573
I mean, I guess you can try it.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.825
But after you do,
you gotta go home.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.452
Verily. So be it.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.162
All right, let's go.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:50.003
Huh? Who is this and why is
she dressed like an anime nun?

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.090
Hold thy tongue and be
humble, for I am Odin.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.175
Right, 'cause she's
a turbo‐nerd.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.218
So do you know this kid?

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.969
Oh, no. We only just met.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.304
Then you're lost?

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.973
Well, there's a police box
not too far from here.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.060
Silence! I'm neither
a kid nor lost!

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.105
I am a god, ordained to rule
thy lowly kind from on high!

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.022
What's her deal, man?

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.566
[YOUTA] She says once she
makes a basket, she'll go home.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.443
Couldn't hurt
anything, could it?

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.655
Okay, whatever, go on.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.031
[YOUTA]
Uh‐‐

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.033
You good? 'Cause that
looked like it hurt.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.993
But I'm still expecting
you to get it first try

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.662
with your god powers!

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.247
[ODIN]
So shall it be.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.208
Now look on and be ye humbled.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.508
[ODIN]
I ask you. Um...

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.885
When the ball traverses the
hoop, is some blessing granted?

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.429
[YOUTA, ASHURA gasp]

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.472
You were the one who
asked to take the shot!

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.558
I had assumed you wouldn't
dispose of your time

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.185
in ways so fruitless. [gasps]

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.186
Let's go.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.980
We need to get this kid
to the police now.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.231
Just wait!

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:53.233
We play basketball to
work off all the stress

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.193
from studying for
entrance exams.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.945
[ODIN]
"Entrance exams"?

00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:59.781
Yeah. For college, ya know?

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.283
'Tis no use.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.035
Your efforts, however valiant,
shall amount to naught.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.121
And why's that?

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.583
For in 30 days, your world
shall come to an end.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.381
Okay, this "manic pixie
doom girl" thing's getting old.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.883
Go and bother
someone else with it.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:18.842
Then I shall be off.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.135
[ASHURA]
Great, "be off."

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.512
[ODIN]
Or that is what we would say.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.222
Dost thou believe gods
live in houses?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.807
[ASHURA]
How the hell would I know?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.684
Wait! If she's
actually in trouble,

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.436
then we need to
help her out, don't we?

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:33.482
You have fun with that.
I'm done with this crap.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.192
Don't forget to tell
your girlfriend "hi" for me

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.693
on your big date.

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.320
It's not a date!

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:40.864
[ASHURA]
Peace!

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.409
So then.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.830
[YOUTA] Okay. How do we
get you home to Hades?

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.958
A web of caves near Suwa
opens unto the far shore.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.252
Why would we go there, you fool?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.213
Don't mistake me
for a god of death!

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.881
I am Odin!

00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.466
Right. Odin.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:00.801
Last name is?

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:01.968
Satou.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.053
Miss Satou.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.262
Good to meet ya.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.931
Now let's go.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.974
My name is Odin!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.227
[YOUTA]
Of course. Odin.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.728
As my name was
asked and given,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.522
so shalt thou give thine

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.315
and expect not
therefore to be blessed.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.400
Uh, that's fair.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.986
My name's Youta.
Youta Narukami.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.531
"Narukami"? How is it written?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.075
[YOUTA]
Well, like this.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.954
Why does your stupid
name literally mean

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.831
the "God of the friggin' Sun"?

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.499
And why do I have the name
of a background character?

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:34.042
[YOUTA]
Please calm down, Miss Satou!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.418
I won't calm down!

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.629
I'm trying to prove my godhood,
but your parents are all,

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.549
"Buh let's name him Sun God,"
so I gotta call you "Sun God"

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.677
and you're still calling me
"Satou"! I'm Odin, dammit!

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.136
Sorry about that.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.430
And Odin was the
god of what again?

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.893
Heheh. Odin, god of gods,
to whom all others answer.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.854
Conjurer of magic.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.650
[ODIN]
Bearer of an unquenchable thirst

00:05:58.692 --> 00:05:59.985
for the world's knowledge.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.279
A raven at each hand
and a wolf at each foot

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.698
who yet hold vigil
over the throne.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.491
[YOUTA]
Mm. And where's that?

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.742
Asgard, of course.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.369
So do you know how to
get there by train?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.996
Well, you start off
on the Chuo Line

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.664
‐‐towards Matsumoto, right?
‐‐Okay.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:13.999
I'm handing the gag off to you

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.959
and you're just letting it die,
you big schmuck?!

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.919
You can't take a train to
the realm of the gods!

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.296
Are you getting this?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.548
Why would they want a bunch of
random humans showing up?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.341
They don't need you there
buying overpriced models

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.635
of Yggdrasil or
Valkyrie hug pillows!

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.970
Stay out of Asgard!

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.848
I guess that's fair,
but I can't take you home

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.099
if I don't know where that is.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.059
And to my home no mortal may go.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.853
That could be a problem.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:37.022
I need to get to the library
pretty quick here.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:37.898
And to what end?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.610
I'm meeting someone.
A childhood friend of mine.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.236
A young woman, perchance?

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.614
Wait, it's not like that!
She's a friend and a girl,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.699
but, like, Izanami's
not my girlfriend!

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.618
[ODIN]
Izanami?!

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.660
How are you that loud?

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.412
And how could I not be?

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.789
Is your childhood friend
actually named Izanami?

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.917
Now that you mention it,
it is kind of odd.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.710
Ugh, who cares if it's odd?

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.128
She's named for a god.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.130
Wife of the god Izanagi.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.131
We shall meet.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:04.633
‐‐That's a no.
‐‐But wherefore?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.551
What would I say
about your clothes?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.385
She's gonna ask.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.596
And this is a concern somehow?

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.556
[YOUTA]
Mm...

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.974
I can't keep waiting,

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.477
but I can't just
leave her here either.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.604
[YOUTA] Just please
promise me you'll behave.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.147
[ODIN]
Let there be no doubt.

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.243
[YOUTA]
Who is this girl?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.038
And why is she
dressed like that?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.789
[YOUTA]
Hm?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.541
[ODIN] Indeed, what a convenient
location for a store.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:39.751
[YOUTA]
Do you want something?

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:40.794
[ODIN]
An umbrella!

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.505
An umbrella? What, for the sun?

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.674
[ODIN]
For the rain, thou dotard!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.806
So like, are you
not embarrassed?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:53.723
Absurd.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:57.018
Should I let my holy vestments
be battered by rain?

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.774
[YOUTA]
Whoa. It really is raining!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.359
[ODIN]
Just as I foretold.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.695
[YOUTA] Perfect, there's
a bus. Can you make it?

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:07.988
[ODIN]
Onto the bus?

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.948
No need. Our feet
shall be faster.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.702
Uh. 'Scuze me, but I'm
pretty sure that's not true.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.873
And the bus just left.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.583
Then onward we shall go.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.585

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.713
and I definitely don't think
the world is ending.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.424
But this girl...

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:27.301
She has some kind of
supernatural power!

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.849
Verily, where thou treadst,
mirth doth follow in thy wake,

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.350
and so too shall I follow thee

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.686
and share in thy company
till the end of days.

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:40.565
Yea, the power of a god
is at thy disposal.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.567
What wilt thou wish for?

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:46.279
[YOUTA]
She's offering me her power?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.449
But then, what do I wish for?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.535
I... I wish...

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.205
[YOUTA]
Let me ace the entrance exams

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.832
and get into college
with Izanami!

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.543
By the time classes start,
the world will end!

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.044
[YOUTA]
Whoa. That soon?

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:06.132
Come on, I told you we
had 30 days forever ago!

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.300
Indeed I have bound myself

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.343
to the company of
a fool among fools.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.345
[YOUTA] I've been saying
that same thing all day.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:14.432
[ODIN sighs] But it is plain
to see thy heart longeth

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.434
unceasingly for
the maiden Izanami.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.936
Well, guess there's
no point in hiding it.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.731
Yeah, it's true. Has been
since middle school.

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.191
As I've seen.

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:26.027
But hark, though she looketh
on thee as but a friend,

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.863
through my power might her heart
and yours yet be united.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.740
[YOUTA gasps]
You can really do that?

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.241
And be thee yet a skeptic?

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.744
But what you're describing
is actual mind control!

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:37.246
Hardly. Such is beyond me.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:38.915
And yet, through
my divine insight

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.502
mayst thou learn her tastes
and mold thyself thereto!

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:46.380
[YOUTA] Whatever her power is,
can I stake this on it?

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.469
Understood. I'll do it then.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:55.097
Help me. Tell me how
I can be Izanami's type!

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:00.228
Thy prayer is heard.

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.271
Now, hark.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.023
She's way into baseball.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.984
[YOUTA yells] And I joined
the basketball club?

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.402
How could it be baseball?!

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.488
She's crazy for
high school baseball!

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.491
[YOUTA] I've known her since we
were kids and I had no idea!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.118
[ODIN] A regular at Koshien
for spring and summer both.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.330
[sobs] Not the tournament, too!

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.001
[YOUTA] Most of the time
she barely speaks.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.962
When she's watching
a baseball game,

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.338
does she get up
and cheer out loud?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.714
[ODIN]
Like a woman possessed.

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.633
Like a woman possessed.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.176
But I can't join
the baseball club

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.844
at the end of my senior year!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.221
[ODIN] Then why not
issue a challenge?

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.098
Huh? Challenge who?

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:38.266
The baseball club.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.850
[YOUTA gasps]

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.519
Call the team out

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.146
and send a dinger sailing
toward the heavens.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.607
Hast thou never wondered
how thy beloved would react

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.110
to seeing thee hit
a walk‐off grand slam?

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:50.278
Verily.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.155
Hast thou not thought how
her heart may thus be moved?

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.199
Uh... Why would I have?

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.660
[ODIN] Then I shall approach the
baseball club with thy terms.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:58.494
[YOUTA]
Don't do that,

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.496
I don't know the first
thing about baseball!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.582
I don't even know how
to swing a freaking bat!

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.750
[ODIN]
Nay, let thy heart be at ease.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.837
For after all,
a god smileth on thee.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.637
[YOUTA] This is actually
happening, isn't it?

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.602
[YOUTA]
She did it.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:25.187
But how could she have
pulled all this together?

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.732
Hey. One out and then
you're done, all right?

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.442
[YOUTA]
Uh, right!

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:34.071
[YOUTA] Don't forget
what she told you. Believe!

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.032
Thou must bide the first pitch.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:39.201
The opening fastball
shall pass the zone high.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.412
Ball!

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.581
[YOUTA]
She called it.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.958
So too shalt thou
bide the second.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.337
A curve not hittable by
hands unsure as thine.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:50.379
Strike!

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:51.964
[YOUTA]
That one, too.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.470
[ODIN] The third pitch
shall also elude thee.

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.263
A low one, and inside.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.849
Thy bat may at best
send it afoul.

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.934
Strike!

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.853
[YOUTA]
Three for three!

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.938
The fourth, too, swing not.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.358
For indeed, without a miracle.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.860
His slider shall escape thee.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.654
Strike!

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.697
[YOUTA]
She does know!

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.908
And then verily
shall the fifth pitch,

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:22.953
slow like the long arc of the
sun, meet thy bat without fail!

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.705
Meet thy bat without fail!

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:25.748
[UMPIRE 01A]
Batter out!

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.708
Damn flashback Satou!

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.793
You rang?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.419
That is not what that was!

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:32.755
And the fifth pitch you said
to swing at never happened!

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.090
[ODIN]
Fortune favors thee not.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.633
[YOUTA]
That's not the point, okay?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:39.011
Izanami came and watched me
strike out without swinging.

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.429
Is that pity on her face?

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.556
Disgust? What the hell
did you say to her?

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.058
[ODIN]
I said, in these same words,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.852
"I should surely like to see
what Narukami is capable of,"

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.270
and she came here forthwith.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:51.232
So she knows I'm capable
of failing horribly,

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.150
and she thinks I called out
the baseball club

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.904
so I could fail super hard in
public like some kind of idiot?!

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.280
[ODIN]
Fret not over what's done.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.281
Huh?

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.325
Go forth and confess thy love!

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.036
[YOUTA] Now?! You want me to
confess my love right now?

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.579
[ODIN]
One mustn't spend one's days

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:09.250
bound by a fear of rejection
when but 30 such days remain!

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.710
Now, spring thee forth!

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.795
Ugh. Fine!

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.143
Izanami!

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:28.394
Yes, what?

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.439
Uh‐‐ Oh, well...

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.149
Ever since middle school,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.861
I, um, I always
thought that, um...

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:44.118
I really like you, Izanami!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.828
Please. Let my feelings‐‐

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.329
I'm sorry.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.311
The sun doth retreat.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:11.854
Wilt thou head home?

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.314
Guess I wilt.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.858
You be careful heading
back to your place.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.443
Back to my place?

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.903
Nay, to thine, with thee.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:19.862
[YOUTA]
Whuzzat?

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:21.071
I shall live there.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.406
[YOUTA]
What about Asgard?

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.658
For a mortal even to
attempt such a journey

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.368
would be the height
of foolishness.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.912
[YOUTA] That's fine,
'cause I'm pretty sure

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.623
it doesn't exist
in the first place.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:33.167
But that doesn't mean it's
okay if you decide on your own

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.086
to just move in
like a romcom manga.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.797
My parents aren't
going to take in some

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:40.883
random cosplaying street urchin
who followed me home.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.593
[ODIN]
Then call them and see.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.470
They shall do just that.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.474
[YOUTA]
Hey, Mom? Yeah, it's me.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.976
This is gonna sound dumb,
but this weird little girl

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.187
is saying she wants to
move into our house.

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.105
So can I go ahead and
tell her she's full of it?

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.398
[TOKIKO gasps]

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.316
What's wrong?

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.442
[TOKIKO]
This girl.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.779
How old is she and
how is she dressed?

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.030
[YOUTA]
Let's see.

00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:05.658
Maybe tail end of
elementary school?

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.742
And her clothes kinda have

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.495
a certain magical
quality about them.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:12.039
Someone said "anime nun," and
that fits pretty well I'd say.

00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:15.835
[TOKIKO sighs] Okay.
Please bring her home with you.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:16.836
Do what?

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:19.463
You're not thinking of
letting her stay, right?

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.297
[TOKIKO]
She can stay.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:22.633
[YOUTA]
For real?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.557
Dost thou see?
Is it not as I've said?

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.058
For indeed the eyes of a god

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.978
glimpse all that
is and could be.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.312
[YOUTA]
Just...

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:40.359
[YOUTA]
...who is this girl?
