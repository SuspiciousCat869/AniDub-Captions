WEBVTT

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.433
[KAKO] To me this feels like
a dodge. I don't think they...

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:17.726
[SORA]
Later, y'all!

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.645
Bye, sweetie, you be safe!

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.480
[DAICHI]
Whoa. Time got away from me.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.106
[TOKIKO]
You better hurry, too, dear.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.399
[DAICHI]
Yeah.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.736
Huh. Actually. Me, too.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.535
Well, see ya.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.264
Yo! Better pick up
the pace, bro!

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:24.269
[YOTA panting]
Well we got here just in time.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.854
Yeah, and you might even live!

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.856
[YOTA]
My body's still on vacation.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.859
[ASHURA] Hmm. I mean I get what
you're talking about, but still.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.362
[KYOKO]
Narukami. Kokuho. Good morning.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.279
[ASHURA]
Good morning!

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.073
You're gorgeous
as always, Kyoko!

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.366
Good morning.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.162
[PRINCIPAL 10A]
Welcome back, students.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.205
I hope summer break...

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:47.209
[YOTA] My long and eventful
summer finally came to a close,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.920
and that same day,
the countdown to

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.881
the end of the
world reached zero.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.717
It hadn't felt like
we were on the clock.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.221
We were having too much fun
to bother thinking about it.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.889
Thanks to Hina.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.517
[YOTA]
We tried with everything we had

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.353
to track her down afterwards.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.815
But in the end, we never
found a single lead.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.277
[YOTA]
And then...

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.448
The last day came,
and that world ended.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.788
[HIROTO]
Nice to meet you.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.210
Uh, yeah, nice to
meet you, too.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:31.962
I'm Hiroto Suzuki.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.672
I transferred in as of today.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.132
I'm a year behind you.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.801
Uh, Mom or Dad get a new job?

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.720
[HIROTO] Well they're dead,
so let's hope not.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.472
Oh, man. Then I'm sorry
for mentioning that.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.891
No, you're fine.
I'm not too bothered.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.268
[YOTA]
Cool...

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.729
So, is there something
I can help you with?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.690
I'm okay, but I was thinking
you look a little bit pale.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.818
[YOTA] Huh? I mean, I haven't
been sleeping too well.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.611
And sleep is an
important thing.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.656
[YOTA] But studying to pass
my exams is important, too.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.408
I'm at a critical
time in my life.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.493
Exams are what's critical?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.037
Come on, there are much
bigger things at stake!

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.372
The time is coming.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.040
You'll need that energy.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.751
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's here.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.669
[HIROTO] I know a really
great study method.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.463
Trust me, I'm actually
pretty smart.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.131
Thanks, but I'm good.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:18.133
[HIROTO]
Oh well. Feel free to call me

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.093
if you happen to
change your mind.

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.262
Of course you have
my number already.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.388
[gasps]

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.308
[phone ringing]

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.893
[YOTA]
Whoa. For real?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.603
Yep! 'Cause I'm
an actual genius

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.980
who can do pretty much anything.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.984
[YOTA]
I made a strange new friend.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.653
He walked into our lives
out of nowhere.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.448
From the start, he fit
right in with the three of us.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.617
Especially Izanami,
who finally had someone

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.744
as smart as her to talk to.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.163
We spent lots of time together.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:50.248
[HIROTO] That's right!
He forgets it afterwards,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.251
but yeah, salary is
two yen per century.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.171
Hey, do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.632
[YOTA] No, but I'm pretty sure
it's not anything we would need

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.133
to know for our entrance exams.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.845
Oh, good, 'cause if it is,
I'm never getting into college.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.681
[HIROTO] You two play
basketball, don't you?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.558
Uh‐‐ How could you know that?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.685
Actually, I've never
played before.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.604
Think you could teach me?

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.731
Well, what do you say, Yota?

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.650
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
the change of pace.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.361
Why not? Sound good, Izanami?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.404
Sure, I don't mind watching.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.242
[HIROTO]
Right. What do I do with this?

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.619
C'mon, that's more
basic than the basics!

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:31.122
You throw that ball through that
hoop and then you get points!

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.332
And you do what?

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.376
[ASHURA chuckles]
We defend the hoop from ya!

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.128
Sorry, pal. You're jumpin'
in the deep end.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.880
[YOTA]
Hey, chill, he's new.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.385
He juked me!

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.637
What the hell was that, Yota?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.816
Aw, crap!

00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.651
Basketball seems fun, guys!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.779
That wasn't your first time
playing at all, you hustler!

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.282
This is good.
He can keep us in shape!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:08.827
Okay, dude. Get ready, 'cause
now we're gonna stomp you!

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.540
Aw man, that made me hungry.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.001
Perfect. There's a great
burger joint nearby.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.252
That does sound good.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:20.297
Actually, I was living
overseas for a while,

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.132
so I'm kind of over hamburgers.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.718
So this is a homecoming?
Nice, bro!

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.136
What would you prefer?

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.138
What would you recommend to me?

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.515
Huh. Well there's
always takoyaki.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.561
Takoyaki? I've had some of that.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.272
Maybe someplace you've got
a personal connection to?

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:38.815
A connection?

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.026
Do I have a
connection somewhere?

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.819
[ASHURA]
Hey, what about Jinguji's?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.114
Oh, right, duh.
Do you like ramen?

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.074
[KYOKO]
Perfect.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.367
[HIKARI]
How is everyone?

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.036
Hi! You're a new face!

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.079
Hey! These guys tell me
your shop serves up

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.915
some of the best
noodles in town!

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.875
[HIKARI]
How nice to hear!

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.380
Ah, good lord, this is
like manna from heaven!

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.507
The crown of culinary creation!

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.594
This pork bears the
radiance of the gods.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.388
Wow, you really can
taste the fallen angel.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.933
[HIKARI giggles]
Glad you like it!

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.275
[YOTA]
Life kept going as usual.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:26.196
But still. I kept up
my search for Hina.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.698
Why don't we play a game that
includes all four of us?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.283
Hey now, don't tell
me you're already

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.202
getting bored with
basketball, bro!

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.080
I feel like we're leaving
Izanami on the sidelines.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.706
I really don't mind.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.333
You wanna play
a board game, then?

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.211
I want something that taxes
the mind and stirs the heart.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.421
A game that'll get me
truly enthralled!

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.466
If I knew what game that was,
I would be playing it.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.677
[HIROTO]
Got any ideas, Narukami?

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.512
[YOTA]
Hmm...

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.555
[KYOKO]
Mahjong, maybe?

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.475
Yeah, that could work.
I kind of remember the rules.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.019
Okay, that sounds fine.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.402
Tsumo. Sixteen thousand apiece.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.238
[ASHURA gasps] I didn't even
know it went that high!

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.699
It's a dealer yakuman, so...

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.577
[YOTA] Fall arrived.
My mock exam results

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.497
didn't look promising, and my
chances at getting into my

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.542
first‐choice school seemed slim.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.087
I started cram school in hopes
of making one of my backups.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:55.368
[YOTA]
Hina, where are you?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.792
[YOTA]
And suddenly, it was winter.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.253
[ALL]
Merry Christmas!

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.796
[YOTA] We needed to ease
some of the tension

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.381
before entrance exams,

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.301
so we threw a little party
on Christmas night.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:14.596
‐‐[HIROTO laughs]
‐‐Oh my gosh, are you okay?

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.431
[ASHURA gasps]
Are you kidding me?

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.308
Sorry, pal, but rent's due.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.267
You're getting crushed out here.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:20.894
[YOTA]
It was fun.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.440
But even so,
I felt this emptiness.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.776
Was this how it was going to be?

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:31.821
Were we just gonna keep growing
up and move on with our lives?

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.698
Would those weeks be
just another chapter

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.076
that came and went in time?

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.287
Would our month with Hina
fade from our minds?

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.998
[SORA] Merry Christmas, y'all.
Want some chicken?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.083
Nice. Thank you.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.667
[HIROTO gasps]
Hey, am I finally getting to

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.503
meet the little sister?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.213
They tell me you're
in the film club.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.090
Are you working on
anything right now?

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.717
She's been shooting
her own movie! Right?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:57.472
[HIROTO gasps] I wanna see!
Was anybody in it I'd know?

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:01.726
Well I guess we could watch it
if you want. Should we?

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.272
Let's leave that decision
up to Narukami.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.399
[YOTA]
Not right now.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.319
After all, it's still
not done yet.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.821
[ASHURA]
Good point.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.657
When the movie's finished,
we can all watch together!

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:16.533
That's right.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.992
[SORA]
Mm‐hmm! Bet!

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.537
[ASHURA]
It's settled. Now game on!

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.834
[YOTA]
The new year came.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.087
But for a college‐bound senior
it's just another day

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.382
of studying, studying, studying.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.550
Begin!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.438
Feeling good about it?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.941
Could be better, but I'm
thinking I'll just make it.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.318
That's great! What about you?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.946
All hope is gone.
Think I'm gonna head home.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.198
He's been like this
since yesterday.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.825
Gosh, I am so sorry.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.619
This entrance exam thing
seems pretty stressful.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.622
You won't sound so smug about it
when your turn comes next year.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.456
Get ready.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.958
Oh, I'm not taking any.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.210
Huh? If you don't
plan to take the exams,

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.045
then why would you enroll here?

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.923
Are the entrance exams the only
reason people come here?

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.301
College prep is a
major selling point.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.927
Gonna go straight to work?

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.679
Nah, I have a job already.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.056
[ASHURA] Then what's the point
of spending the money to come?

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.184
Guess you'd call it
life experience.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.519
So what you're saying is,
you're here for the fun?

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.229
[HIROTO]
Yeah. It was nice trying out

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.190
the normal teenage life.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.566
It's a blessing to know you all,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.735
and I'll remember
these days fondly.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.404
Thanks for being with me.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:37.947
I enjoyed basketball.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.699
That ramen was delicious.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.910
And mahjong. What a game!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:45.079
If only we could have all hit up
a summer festival together.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.832
[gasps] And Sora's
movie will be great!

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:54.047
[YOTA] Good. I'm really glad it
was all fun for you as well.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.798
[growls]

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.092
You ass!

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.093
[gasps]

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.721
I've been as on‐the‐nose
as I possibly could!

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.473
How are you this dumb?

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:04.891
I'm going back to California.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.434
Hey, hold on!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.812
Just try and think for a second.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:13.191
Why would I be spending time
talking to someone like you?

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:19.364
Huh. Did I say something
to offend him?

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.323
Like what?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.451
Come to think of it,
how did the two of you meet?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:27.372
Uh... He just walked up
to me in the hall.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.041
[YOTA]
Wait. That's a good point.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.668
We're not in the same grade.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.128
He doesn't plan on
going to college.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.922
He just kinda popped
into our social group

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.757
out of nowhere one day.

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.845
[gasps]

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.138
[KYOKO]
I wonder if he might be...

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.141
That's it. He was recreating it.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.018
The things we did with Hina!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:52.814
[HINA] Um. When the ball
traverses the hoop,

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.190
is some blessing granted?

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.860
Yea, it is like than unto
from on high! I am enthralled!

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:00.530
Yea. It doth tax the mind
and stir the heart.

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.657
But it approach completion.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.868
[YOTA]
He's right. How am I this dumb?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.578
He hath learned of deicide,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.456
and thereby slain
my great protector.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.709
[YOTA]
Please, wait! Stop!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.297
Hiroto Suzuki, it's you.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:19.507
You killed the god inside Hina!

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.885
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.721
Sure took you long enough.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:25.596
Coulda lost me.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.349
What was the point of making
this whole thing a giant riddle?

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.018
I was forbidden by my superiors

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.895
to explain anything
to you directly.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.106
In fact, I was
sticking my neck out

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.775
to get in touch with you at all.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.068
I want you to know.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.030
I made it possible,
but it wasn't my choice.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.325
Humanity's leaders decided
they didn't want a new god.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.411
I'm still the one who lowered
her defenses for them, though.

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:49.537
I wouldn't blame you
if you hate‐‐

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:50.788
[YOTA]
None of that matters to me,

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.082
I wanna know if she's alive!

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:56.836
Hina isn't dead,
but she's much different.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.296
She is not a god.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.881
[gasps]

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.425
Please tell me.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.344
Hina's powers of omniscience.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.720
Where'd she get them?

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.681
[HIROTO]
Can we talk somewhere else?

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.480
[YOTA]
No way.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:19.442
It's sad. Some of us are dealt
a bad hand when we're born.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.694
[HIROTO]
So what next?

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.155
Sorry, "what next"?

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.115
[HIROTO] I did mention
this on the day we met,

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.369
but I'm a genius, so whatever
you wanna do, we can.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:35.208
[gasps] You're saying...
I can go... see Hina?

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.210
We can if that's
what you really want.

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:38.294
Then let's go!

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.380
First you need to realize this.

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.548
She won't be the girl you knew.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.176
That said, are you sure
you want to see her?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.552
I'm positive.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.137
[HIROTO]
You didn't even think about it.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.305
I respect that.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:51.891
But you really should,
'cause this could get painful.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.310
So I'll ask you one more time.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.603
This'll be the one that counts,

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.188
and if you change your
answer to "no" here,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.983
it'll be the last you
see of me. Got that?

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:05.238
Okay. Now, do you
wanna see Hina Sato?

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.865
Yes. I do.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:11.411
Heh. All right,
then go get packed.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.789
And keep in mind, it'll be
a long trip. Be prepared.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.668
Hey, Mom? I'm leaving.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:20.878
And I'll be gone for a while.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.715
Oh! So you've come to this step
on your journey into manhood!

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.509
Take care, sweetheart!

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.350
[RAITA] I didn't expect to be
playing chauffeur to you two.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:37.145
We're not old enough to
get licenses, so yeah.

00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:45.278
Man, we've driven pretty far.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:48.281
Yeah, we're practically going
to the ends of the earth.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.991
That makes it sound like
we're either driving

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.659
into heaven or hell.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.286
You might not be far off.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.829
I don't get it.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:55.913
[HIROTO]
Sorry, but it's something

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.999
you gotta figure
out for yourself.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.262
[HIROTO]
The big white building there.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:13.723
[HIROTO] I already snuck
a whole new persona

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.641
into their records for you.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:19.562
You're a research assistant from
a prominent facility overseas.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.647
You'll be authorized to see her

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.317
and your identity will
hold up for two weeks.

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:25.401
That's all you get.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.153
Then it's really game over.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.907
[HIROTO] You're expected
to make daily reports.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.451
You can put this authentication
key into any terminal

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.661
and use the data I left
on here to fudge your way

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.914
through your
paperwork for the day.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.794
Aren't you coming, too?

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.422
No, my part in all this is over.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.758
As a genius,
I can do most things,

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.051
but there's a big
difference between

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:52.345
"most" and "all," isn't there?

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:55.431
So getting you this far
is all I can do for you.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.767
I see. Thank you.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.854
Plus, more than that,
it's my chance to atone.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:02.688
[YOTA gasps]

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.107
Welp. Time to inform the CEO.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.526
Who's that again?

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.487
[HIROTO] Oh yeah, she's kinda
like my adoptive mother.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.656
Although she's a bit of
a hot mess, honestly.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.617
Sometimes I forget
who's raising who, y'know?

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.036
Really. Well I'm not sure why,

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.872
but I'm glad there's somebody
like that in your life.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.832
Anyway, pass my
thanks on to her.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:25.920
[HIROTO chuckles]
Sure. Till next time, then.

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.004
Take it easy!

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.465
Thank you again for
all of your help, Suzuki!

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.758
It's Hiroto!

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.219
Say "Suzuki" and I'll think
you mean someone else!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.304
Sure. See ya later, Hiroto!

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.931
Best of luck!

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.851
[HIROTO]
Why's it gotta be so cold?

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.436
Well, mission accomplished.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.189
Yeah. I honestly
had fun with this one.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.108
Living an actual teenage life

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.277
with school and
friends and stuff.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.779
[RAITA]
Right. I'm glad to hear that.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.657
So, guess I'll be
heading home now.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.909
You can stay if you
feel the inclination.

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.245
Nah. I'm getting
off these islands

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.289
and back to the
best coast, bay‐bee!

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.582
Roger that.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.041
Hold on. What's this?

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.877
It almost seems like you'll
be sad to see me go!

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.755
Ha. Don't be absurd.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.215
[HIROTO]
Come on, just say it.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.049
[RAITA]
Enough.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.467
[HIROTO]
Not till you admit it!

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.595
We got chemistry
and you know it.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.483
[SHIBA]
Huh?

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:32.445
Uh‐‐ Pardon me,
but I believe you were

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.697
expecting me sometime today?

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:35.781
Oh.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.620
The clinician who came
to see Hina Sato.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.622
I heard. I'm Shiba.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.707
I'm a visiting
researcher here myself.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.250
A pleasure.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.585
[SHIBA]
This way, please.

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:51.047
You look younger than
I would have expected.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:52.715
I get that a lot.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.479
[SHIBA]
This is her room.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.981
And remember, be careful
not to startle her.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:09.857
Got it.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.525
[knocking]

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.070
[SHIBA]
Hina, someone's here to see you.

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.113
‐‐Hina!
‐‐Please keep your voice down!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.866
She gets very distressed
when something startles her.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.743
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.957
Hi, Hina. Are you doing well?

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:37.176
[YOTA] I thought I'd prepared
myself for this. But she's...

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.722
Please use a gentle voice.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.560
Hina, do you recognize me?

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.479
I'm Yota, remember?

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:54.402
I see you got a haircut.
It's so short now.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:56.404
Then you two were
acquainted somehow?

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.279
Yes.

00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:59.782
Her head was shaved bald
when she first arrived.

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.409
[YOTA gasps]
Why?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.495
It was standard prep
for cranial surgery.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.913
She's finally back
to a point where

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.624
you can recognize her
as a girl on sight.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.210
[SHIBA]
Isn't that right, Hina?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.129
You look so cute now.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.631
That must have been
hard for you, Hina.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:16.757
But you got through it.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:19.051
[HINA gasps, screams]

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.803
[SHIBA]
It's okay, I'm here.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.264
There's nothing to be
afraid of, sweetheart.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.308
We'll be all right.
There, there.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:32.189
[YOTA] If I could, I would
like to take her back.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:33.315
[SHIBA]
Directly?

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.400
[YOTA]
Yes.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.198
Credentials verified.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.452
You do have the privilege to
take her out of this facility.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:47.079
[YOTA]
So it worked. Thanks, Hiroto.

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.914
[SHIBA]
However, that's only if

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.125
the patient will
leave willingly.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.755
[SHIBA] As you've witnessed, she
suffers an extreme fear of men.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.548
I can't imagine
what sort of trauma

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.925
she went through
before she got to us.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.552
That's to say nothing
of undergoing

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.512
cranial surgery as a child.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.848
I sincerely believe Hina
would live her best life

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.768
here in the care of
our all‐female staff.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.102
[YOTA]
This is...

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.729
This is wrong!

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.773
They abducted her
off the street.

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.149
They shaved her head.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.901
They cut her skull open!

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:20.321
They hurt her and
made her afraid of me!

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.447
It's...

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.740
It's just too cruel!

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.325
[gasps]

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.826
No, not you, Hina!

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:28.287
That wasn't at you!

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.665
With all due respect, I would
like to end this visit now.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:32.666
[YOTA]
Yes.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.627
I'm sorry, Hina.

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:42.593
This just can't be real life.
It can't be right.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:46.555
[YOTA]
She did nothing to deserve this.

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:49.391
She shouldn't have to
go through this.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.019
It shouldn't be happening.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.481
In fact, could play out
the same way for you.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.110
Is this what he
wanted to tell me?

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:03.322
Is this the same heartbreak
he went through back then?

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.244
[YOTA] I had assumed
Hina and I were family now.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:11.080
I came here determined
to leave with her,

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:15.042
and that resolve is just
crumbling under the weight.

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:18.671
She couldn't see "family"
when she looked at me.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.631
I thought she'd
wanna be with me,

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.883
like I wanna be with her,

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:25.177
but how can I
still believe that?

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.763
Could it be that
giving up on this

00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.849
would be good for us both?

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.810
Was he doing the right thing
by leaving her and moving on?

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:35.229
The people here
can care for her.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:37.356
Isn't that what's best for her?

00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:43.612
I don't know...
what's right anymore.
