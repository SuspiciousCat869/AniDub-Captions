Won't be long before we're
totally undefeatable.

166

Come on, Nina.

167
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,880
Admit it.

168
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm the bomb, aren't I?

169
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,520
Yeah, all right.

170
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,480
I suppose so.

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,160
But just this one time, I'm
admit it, you're the bomb.

172
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,560
Think you better
watch it or that's

173
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,640
gonna go straight to his head.

174
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,440
I know.

175
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,200
That's why he's never
gonna hear it again.

176
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,240
That's mean.

HARLEY: You'll like this, Nina.

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
It's good.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
NINA: Thanks a lot, Harley.

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,440
SHARNID: Hey, I'll
take some too, dude.

182
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
HARLEY: The bomb can
go get his own things.

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,160
SHARNID: The hell?

184
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,720
Hurry up and do it, Mayshie.

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
No.

186
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't think now's
the right time.

187
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,040
What are you saying?

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
If you're not gonna give it
to him now, when will you?

189
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,000
Layfon just left.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,840
What's the deal with
that guy tonight anyway?

191
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
FELLI (VOICEOVER): I
want to feel the world.

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
This world.

193
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,560
And beyond the vast darkness.

SHANTE: I just don't get it.

195

He's your enemy, right?

GORNEO: Of course he
is, but I mean, come on.

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
We couldn't just throw
away a competition.

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,480
SHANTE: But it was the
perfect opportunity.

199
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
You don't know when you'll
get one like that again.

And trust me.

No matter how much time passes,
my anger won't fade a bit.

Really

Mark my words, Layfon Alseif.

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
I'm gonna make you pay for
your crime one way or another.

It's her.

Why are you here?

I'm not obligated to answer
that for either of you.

209
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
Oh yeah?

That's the 17th for you.

The same guys who let a
coward into their ranks.

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
I guess you're a coward too!

213

What do you mean?

You don't even know?

Hmph.

one of those, huh?

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,160

LAYFON: Don't you come in later?

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,840
NINA: I thought I'd
come in a little

226
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,360
early so I could see
Zuellni for a bit,

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,560
but she won't show herself.

Oh.

229
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,600
OK.
‐ Hey.

230
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
When we're finished,
do you think

231
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
you could spare a few minutes?

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,560
Huh?

233
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
I came up with
this great strategy

234
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
for the next competition.

235
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
I'd like to hear what you think.

What is it?

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
Well, to be honest, it's you.

238
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Uh.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,240
You enjoy fighting, don't you?

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
You even look forward to it.

241
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,400
No.

242
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,240
That isn't true at all.

243
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,040
OK.

244
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
Who am I trying to fool?

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Of course it is.

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,240
And I enjoy every
bit of it, Layfon.

247
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm really happy now.

248
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,320
We're winning, and
that's something I've

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,800
dreamed about for a long time.

250
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
There was a municipal challenge.

251
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
It was two years ago.

252
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
At stake was ownership
of a surname line,

253
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,240
which is critical for the
survival of every Regios.

254
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,520
It was a grueling and
dangerous challenge.

255
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,120
We came so close.

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,760
Victory was almost ours.

257
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,800
But in the end, we lost.

258
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
And the other
platoon, I remember

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
they were so happy, cheering
and hugging one another.

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,760
That's when I thought,
that's what I want.

261
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,200
To stand with my team
after we've successfully

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
protected our city.

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,920
To be victorious and share
our happiness together.

264
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,000
Bit by bit, my dream's
finally coming true at last.

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
I feel it.

266
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,760
If we can keep
fighting, we'll win.

267
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,640
Fighting?

268
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,680
That's why you're happy?

269
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,480
NINA: Yeah.

270
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,200
That's where you and I differ.

271
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,120
I've never been
happy about fighting.

272
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,800
Not once.

273
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,320
It doesn't matter
what kind of victory

274
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,160
you achieve either, because
in the world we live in,

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,640
winning has no real
meaning at all.

president's calling you.

Not again.

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,080
Savaris.

329
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
Yes, your majesty.

330
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,000
What can I do for you?

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,680
Now, didn't I tell you
that you were forbidden

332
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
from calling me that here?

333
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,480
Right.

334
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,320
You certainly did.

335
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm sorry about
that, Queen Alsheyra.

336
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,560
Uh, that's something else
I'm not supposed to call you,

337
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,360
isn't it?

338
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,400
I do apologize, Synora.

339
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Jeez.

340
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,920
You're such an idiot.

341
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,040
MAN (ON INTERCOM): They
eighth gate is now on standby.

342
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Please complete Land
Roller inspections ASAP.

343
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,200
The current temperature is 13‐‐

344
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
SHARNID: It was attacked
by Contaminoids?

345
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
NINA: We don't know.

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,120
All we do know is that
it's along our current path

347
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
and has stopped moving.

348
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,600
Unless something
changes, Zuellni

349
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
will reach it in three days.

350
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,720
[YAWN]
OK.

351
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,680
So you go and check it
out and see if it's safe,

352
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,200
and then come back, all right?

353
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,520
Good luck with that one, Nina.

354
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,760
You're coming too, so wake
up and start getting changed,

355
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,680
you slacker.

356
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,080
HARLEY: If we weren't
in such a rush,

358
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,640
I might have had
your new Adamandite

359
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
ready for you to take along.

360
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,280
LAYFON: A new one?

361
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,120
HARLEY: Yeah.

362
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,240
It's more of an anti‐personnel
weapon, and lighter too.

363
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,440
But because of that, you can't
trade out different DITEs.

364
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,880
I need a little more time with
it and it should be ready.

365
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,720
Well, better get back to it.

366
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,560
FELLI: Fon‐Fon.

367
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,240
Huh?

368
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes, Senior Felli?

369
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,840
Ah!

370
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Sorry.

371
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,040
I don't understand why we're
going out with the 5th Platoon.

372
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,800
Oh.

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,760
Well, according to the
student council president,

374
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,480
none of the other platoons
have enough atmosphere suits.

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
That's what he told you?

376
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,480
I think he's full of it.

377
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,280
Huh?

378
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,200
Hmph.

379
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,000
Monkey.

380
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,480
Well, I'm ready
to move out when

381
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,920
you are, oh fearless leader.

382
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Oh, hey.

383
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,520
Sharnid.

384
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
Sorry, but could
you do me a favor

385
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
and ride with Felli instead?

386
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,640
SHARNID: Uh, sure, I guess.

387
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,840
SHANTE: Here's an idea.

388
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,920
GORNEO: What's that?

389
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,000
SHANTE: We could settle it now.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,240
Make it look like an accident.

391
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
GORNEO: It's not that easy.

392
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,760
You saw how powerful
he was, didn't you?

393
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,600
SHANTE: Yeah, but still.

394
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
Couldn't we try to
take him by surprise?

395
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
GORNEO: If you think he
could be defeated like that,

396
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,640
you've got another thing coming.

397
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,840
Remember, he's not some pushover
but a former Heaven's Blade.

398
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,800
SHANTE: Yeah, well, so what?

399
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
Who cares?

400
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,040
I still think you're a
lot stronger than he is.

401
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,400
NINA: And I thought
I finally understood

402
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
things a little better.

403
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
LAYFON: What?

404
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
NINA: But I don't
get you at all.

405
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
LAYFON: That came
out of nowhere.

406
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,920
NINA: So did winning
has no real meaning.

407
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,040
I still can't get over
you telling me that.

408
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,160
LAYFON: I wouldn't give
it too much thought.

409
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,680
I just said what I was thinking.

410
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
That's all.

411
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,320
NINA: But you still
meant it, right?

412
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,040
Winning a competition
means gaining

413
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,840
strength and confidence.

414
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,520
Winning a municipal battle
means gaining a cernium mine.

415
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Something we need to survive.

416
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,440
Do those things have
no meaning either?

417
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,480
LAYFON: Look.
There it is.

418
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,640
Coming up to the west.

419
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
NINA: Are you gonna answer me?

420
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
LAYFON: Let's
discuss this later.

421
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,600
SHARNID: The outer
gate's busted.

422
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,720
Looks like we're gonna
have to enter from the top.

423
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
NINA: Before we do that,
Felli, can you tell

424
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,560
us how things are in there?

425
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,600
FELLI: I'm only
getting fragments,

426
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,760
but I don't sense anything
dangerous right now.

427
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
MAN (ON RADIO): Captain Antalk.

428
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
This is the 5th platoon.

429
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
We've finished our recon
around the east gate.

430
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,120
NINA: How's it look?

431
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
MAN (ON RADIO): The dock
is completely destroyed.

432
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Captain Lueckens and
some of the others

433
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,480
are now trying to enter through
a damaged external section.

434
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
NINA: Layfon.

435
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Can you get in?

436
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,120
LAYFON: Yeah.

437
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,240
Restoration 02.

438
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
FELLI: Will you take me as well?

439
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,680
LAYFON: Sure thing.

440
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Hold on tight.

441
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
NINA: Get ready.

442
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,160
We're going up next.

443
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,000
SHARNID: Roger, boss.

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,920
FELLI: You don't
have to do that.

445
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,000
I can guarantee this
place is safe, Fon‐Fon.

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,720
LAYFON: It's kind
of a habit of mine.

447
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,520
I always like to make
sure for myself, you know?

448
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,320
FELLI: But it's unnecessary.

449
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
If you're going to waste
energy like that, at least

450
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,520
try to be more polite about it.

451
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,560
LAYFON: Sorry, Felli.

452
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,040
NINA: Well?

453
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,440
LAYFON: No bioactivity.

454
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,000
NINA: Air filters?

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,240
FELLI: They're working fine.

456
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,080
As you can see.

457
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
SHARNID: Whoa.

458
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,520
Creepy.

459
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,840
This place is a real ghost town.

460
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,680
LAYFON: I think it's
safe to say this place

461
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,120
was attacked by Contaminoids.

462
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,680
NINA: Yeah.

463
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,320
We should look for survivors.

464
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
LAYFON: Right.

465
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,640
SHARNID: I don't know if we
should get our hopes up, guys.

466
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,240
FELLI: If they sought shelter,
what about that plaza up ahead?

467
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,040
NINA: Yeah.

468
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Let's go.

469
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
FELLI: Oh no.

470
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,440
LAYFON: The monument's
been overrun.

471
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
NINA: This is‐‐

472
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
What's the matter?

473
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,920
FELLI: Do you know
this place, Nina?

474
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,760
NINA: Yes.

475
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
It's Gandoweria.

476
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,760
The city we fought
two years ago.

477
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,560
SHARNID: Yeah.

478
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
You're right.

479
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,120
And they defeated us in that
battle too, didn't they?

480
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,880
So what the hell happened here?

481
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,480
And just how long has it been
since the city was attacked?

482
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,400
SHARNID: Who knows?

483
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Maybe they got hit right
after they beat Zuellni.

484
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
No.

485
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,040
No, this is impossible.

486
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,200
After beating Zuellni,
Gandoweria had plenty

487
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,840
of mines to power itself with.

488
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
And the city's fighting
strength and coordination

I told you.

You can't be right.

You can win a battle or a
mine, but it doesn't matter.

Can I ask you a question?

LAYFON: Of course.

What is it that you
would consider a victory?

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,280
For me, it's just
about surviving.

Both for myself and all
those I want to protect, too.

Victory is when none of us die.

sullied the name of
the Heaven's Blades
