Why's the battle with
Myath been suspended?

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,680
Hey, have you heard that
Glendan's getting closer?

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,800
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
It's the spear‐shelled city,
famous for its military arts.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,080
That must be why
command has us on standby.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,640
Zuellni's just
an academic city.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
If we go up against
Glendan, we're dead meat.

Hey, I wouldn't
worry about it.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,240
There's no way they
can take our mine.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Come on, use your head, Sharnid.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,160
They couldn't go
against the treaty.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,440
Yeah, but treaties
don't mean shit, Harley.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,720
If that's what the city
wants, then there's nothing we

humans can do to stop it.

isn't that the same city

Whether our signal's obstructed

Not a single peep from them.

If we do end up
fighting Glendna,

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,720
then we have no hope of winning.

31

Our one remaining cernium
mine will be taken,

32

and then this whole
city will die.

How is this possible?

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,760
An academic city
battling one that's

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
renowned for its military arts?

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,120
Only the wills of the cities
themselves would know that.

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,680
And right now, those
wills are a mystery.

you still won't let
her rest, Kalian?

it in the sky long ago.

I'm sorry for

me, I'm glad you're here.

I am surprised, though.

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,920
I never thought I'd
see you in Zuellni.

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,440
And I never thought I'd
see you fighting again.

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,400
The doctor said you'd been in
this hospital several times.

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Right before you left
Glendan, you said you were

giving up fighting altogether.

101
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,480
What happened to that?

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
You did it again, huh?

You sacrificed yourself again

I spoke with Nina.

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,400
And she told me enough, Layfon.

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
She said she couldn't
forgive her own weakness,

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
and relying too
much on a comrade.

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,640
It's obvious to me now that the
person she referred to is you,

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
isn't it?

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,000
I know how she feels.

You're still the same.

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,840
You always take on
anything and everything

alone, just like
you used to, Layfon.

122
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,520
So Nina thinks she
relies on me too much?

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,440
It's hard not to when you're
always protecting everyone.

124
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,320
I always wished you'd
rely on me for once,

125
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
instead of the other way around.

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
Wow.

127
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,920
You just met Nina, and she
shared all that with you?

128
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
Yes, but we didn't just meet.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,920
We met when we were in Myath.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Myath?

131
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
Wait, Nina was in Myath?

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,880
You're sure?

133
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
Huh?

134
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,240
Of course.

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm positive.

136
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,920
Place, Leerin, tell
me everything, OK?

137
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
Sure.

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
Well, let's see.

139
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,400
So that regios is
your home city, Gor?

140
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,880
Sure is.

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,800
And that's who we're
gonna fight next, right?

142
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
I doubt it.

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
There's no precedent for
an academic city fighting

144
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
a regular city like Glendan.

145
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I can't say it's
impossible, though.

If we do end up
fighting, whose side

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,200
are you going to be on?

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Someone's here!

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,640

Who is that?

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
What are you doing here?

156
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm on a mission
for her majesty.

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
I spent a whole lot of time
on a rolling bus to get here.

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,680
Just after I arrive,
Glendan shows up.

159
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Go figure.

160
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,120
By that answer, I take it
that you don't know why Glendon

161
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
is approaching Zuellni, either.

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Nope.

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
I don't have a clue.

164
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,280
The only thing I
can assume is either

165
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,200
it's the whimsy of
her majesty, or she's

166
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,000
become unable to
control Glendan's will.

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,080
In any case, I'm still
going to follow my orders

168
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
and capture the
fallen one that's

169
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
somewhere here in Zuellni.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,160
Should be fun.

171
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
So, little brother,
have you heard anything

172
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,320
about fallen ones in the city?

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,520
A military artist named
Dinn Dee was possessed by one.

174
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,160
It was forcibly
removed from him,

175
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
and since that happened he's
basically been a vegetable.

176
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,280
Really?

177
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,000
Also, while searching the
ruined city of Gandoweria,

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,520
Layfon Alseif claims
that he encountered one.

179
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,000
He described it as looking
like a golden goat.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
A golden goat, huh?

181
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,560
I didn't see it myself.

182
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,920
[LAUGHTER]

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,320
I guess that means the
fallen ones can only appear

184
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,880
to those who are truly strong.

185
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,040
Now, you take that back!

186
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,320
Speaking of which, I'm looking
forward to seeing Layfon again.

187
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm hoping I can catch a
glimpse of the strength he had

188
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
when he was a kid in Glendan.

189
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,640
You should have
seen him back then.

190
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,240
When he fought his first
battle as a Heaven's Blade,

191
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
Layfon was something.

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,440
And so young, too.

193
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,080
Thinking back, the only
way to describe that fight

194
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,320
was a whole lot of fun.

195
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Battles are the
only thing I really

196
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
get excited about these days.

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,760
No matter how skilled you
are, you can die at any time.

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,880
That's what makes the whole
thing so invigorating.

199
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,520
I sensed some of that
same attitude in him.

200
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,360
Has he changed
since coming here,

201
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
or is he still the
same old Layfon?

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
All right, I've had
just about enough!

203
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,120
Is this the only thing
you can talk about?

204
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Gorneo, this guy's
a total creep.

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,840
Is this jerk really
related to you?

206
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Yep.

207
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,280
And Gorneo is, indeed, my
weaker younger brother.

208
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,200
I've got to admit, Gorneo,
you working with Layfon

209
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,520
really surprised me.

210
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Poor Gerhard is probably
rolling over in his grave.

211
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Wait just a minute‐‐ you
mean you didn't know?

212
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,840
No one told you your
friend was dead?

213
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,080
Gerhard is dead?

214
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,840
Gorneo?

215
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,480
You're lying!

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm telling you the truth.

217
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,240
I know, because I killed
Gerhard with my own two hands.

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Boy, was he a pitiful sight.

219
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,120
His body had been
possessed by a contaminoid.

220
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,800
Thinking of him still
makes my skin crawl.

221
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
No‐‐ it can't be!

222
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,400
To be honest, I should
thank Layfon for making

223
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,240
him a whole lot easier to kill.

224
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,360
Layfon cutting off one of his
arms made Gerhard much simpler

225
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,600
to defeat, even though
he was possessed.

226
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,560
In the end, his death
served its purpose.

227
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,680
Speaking of which, it
was pretty spectacular.

228
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
You should have seen it.

229
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,720
No.

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,480
You're lying!

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,440
You have to be!

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm not.

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
And the tiny bit of
Gerhard's consciousness

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,720
that remained despised
Layfon until the bitter end.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,240
Come on, Gorneo.

236
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm sorry.

This certainly
doesn't bode very well.

242
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,720
Vanze, Zuellni has
just changed course.

243
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,400
We're directly facing Glendan.

244
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,200
That's great.

245
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,640
What do we do now?

246
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Wait, I know.

247
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Since Glendan's within firing
range of the Kei‐Ra cannon,

248
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,040
should we take a shot at them?

249
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
Use it in a municipal battle?

250
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,560
I never considered it, but
that could be an option.

251
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,920
VANZE: I wasn't being serious.

252
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
I was joking.

253
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Besides, it would
violate the treaty.

254
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,320
It's inexcusable.

255
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
Even so, get it ready.

256
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,080
We'll only use it
for intimidation.

257
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,600
As for violating the treaty,
Glendan will be doing just

258
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
that if it attacks us first.

Yes, sir.

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,800

264
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Yes.

265
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,360
And it's rapidly
approaching Glendan.

266
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
Glendan?

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
Are you kidding?

through on that roaming bus,

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
too.

270
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,120
That must have been waht
caused all that shaking.

271
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,640
It probably won't be
too long before the cities

272
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,600
reach each other.

But we've yet to receive any
communication from Glendan.

idea where Nina is?

I've called her and
your platoon to duty.

277
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360

here to welcome you back home.

But even if not, I'm sure
she'd let you come to Glendan

283
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,200
if you simply asked her to.

284

I just know that she
would forgive you.

go see her together.

292
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,400
The truth of the matter is
that you and all the others

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
mean everything to me.

294

That's the real
reason why I've always

tried to protect everyone.

296
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,400
It wasn't because
it was something

297
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,720
that I felt I had to
do, but because it's

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,560
something I truly wanted to do.

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
There may have been some
other way to do that,

only way I knew how.

Captain Antalk hasn't
arrived here yet.

Well, you see, my good friend
Leerin recently arrived by bus.

she met up with Nina in Myath.

Wait, what do you mean?

317
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,560
I asked for specifics,
but unfortunately I

318
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,080
couldn't make sense of it.

319
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,000
However, apparently just before
Nina vanished from Myath,

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,320
Leerin saw a golden
goat hovering over her.

321
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
That would explain things‐‐

322
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,520
both Nina's disappearance and
her reappearance in the desert.

323
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,280
But that would also mean
something else, then.

324
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,480
That's right.

325
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
It would mean‐‐

326
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,000
Nina is possessed
by the fallen one.

327
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,400
If that's a joke, I
ain't laughing, dude.

328
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,200
No.

329
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,600
It just can't be possible.

330
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,560
That might explain
something else, too‐‐

331
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,000
why Zuellni began moving
again at the exact moment

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
that Nina returned.

333
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,440
But why is it running amok?

334
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Layfon, do you have any inkling
as to why this city is racing

335
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,000
towards Glendan right now?

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,560
I have no idea.

337
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,600
Well‐‐ and this
is only a theory‐‐

338
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,360
but it's what I
believe has happened.

339
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,240
Nina has Zuellni and the
fallen one inside her.

340
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,760
In the beginning the two
achieved equilibrium,

341
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
but for some reason
that balance is broken.

342
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,040
As a result, Zuellni is now
more deeply under the influence

343
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,800
of the fallen one.

344
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
But is forcibly removing
the fallen one from Nina

345
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,400
our only option at this point?

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,600
Because if that is
truly the only choice‐‐

What should I do?

She'll suffer the
same fate as Dinn Dee.

that Leerin is inside Zuellni‐‐

it must be more than just
a simple coincidence.
