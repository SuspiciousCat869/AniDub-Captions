is "Weekly Look‐In"?

You mean you've
never heard of it?

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm currently working on
a potential cover story

179
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
for the magazine, and
it's titled "Who's

work for the magazine.

who just got here.

clarified that I don't

He wasn't wearing a uniform.

aware, Zuellni Academic

City is operated solely by the
students who live within it.

My being president of

276
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,280
essentially means that I'm
in control of this city.

Therefore, I have the

in Zuellni's best interest.

So you're a first year
general education student.

280
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,840
Yet earlier today you
demonstrated skills

281
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
that would make a
senior Military Art

or two about fighting.

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,640
That's certainly not the most
glamorous job to have here.

290

Also, your scholarship
is only at a D ranking.

What you'll earn from
all your hard work

It will also be rather

Huh?

I've bumped your
scholarship to an A ranking.

302
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,920
And I've waived your tuition.

303
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,560
That should make your
transfer a little easier.

304

I don't want to be
in Military Arts.

307
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,320
Over the past two
years, we've lost

308
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,080
sernium mines by being defeated
in the municipal challenges.

309
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,680
And now, there's only one mine
left powering the whole city.

310
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,520
If we lose that
one, Zuellni's dead.

Huh?

312

your strength to fortify

But all I want to pursue in
Zuellni is general studies.

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm sorry.

city has to come first.
