that you were born with a

us there were times

when your nanni discharges
without you even noticing.

that's like wetting the bed.

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,840
as I can hang out with chicks
in bikinis, I'll go, too.

489
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,680
And Layfon, did he also know?

490
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,120
Nah, we never
told him the truth.

491
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,920
We didn't think old
Fon‐Fon could lie to you

492
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,080
and get away with it because
you'd see right through him.

493
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
Layfon didn't know.

494
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
Speaking of
Layfon, where is he?

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,440
Hey, I don't see Kalian
around here either.

496
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,600
After all that commotion,
that's a little weird.

497
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Where are those two?

498
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,880
Now spit it out.

499
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,680
Confess.

500
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,240
In that twisted
little head of yours,

501
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,120
you're already calling
me brother‐in‐law.

502
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Yes, you are, aren't you?

503
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,440
Don't try to deny it.

504
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,760
I told you, I was just
helping her learn how to swim!

505
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,720
That was it!

506
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,520
Ah!

507
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,440
What the hell?

508
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,800
This entire place is reinforced.

509
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,280
Oh, no, Felli!

510
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,120
So you found out, huh?

511
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,240
Wait, I can explain.

512
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,400
I did this all for you.

513
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,280
It was for the best.

514
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
You understand, right?

515
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,320
Come on, Felli.

516
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,440
Oh, can't you just forgive
and forget, please?

517
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,240
Ah!

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Guess not.

519
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,480

ANNOUNCER: Sharpshooter
Sharnid Elipton was previously

522
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
assigned to the 10th platoon.

523
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,520
Its leader, Dinn Dee, has
never forgiven Sharnid

524
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
for his alleged treachery.

525
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Can they ever be friends again?

526
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,560
Next time, "A Tender
Lie" and "Restoration."
