He'd want me to be as
careful as possible.

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,800
And then naturally, he'd
tell me to stay right here

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,520
and get an education
so I could protect

fragment from my spinal cord.

do since the next match is

Vanze's first platoon.

She got really fired
up and said that she

could pull it off without me.

Still, talk
about unlucky, huh?

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,680
I can't believe
Layfon's surgery got

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,560
scheduled on the same day as our
match with the first platoon.

150
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,680
That's enough.

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,320
Even if Layfon got
released early,

152
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
it still wouldn't
make any difference.

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,800
We would have to give
him time to heal up.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,440
Yeah, sure, I know that, but
isn't going into this match

155
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,080
without him really
pushing our luck?

156
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,840
Don't worry.

157

There are ways to
fight without him,

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,480
The thought of going
into it without Layfon

168
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,640
made me feel anxious
and depressed.

169
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
I felt like it was all over.

I've gotten a lot
stronger, Harley.

173

And I can't just keep relying
on Layfon to help the 17th win.

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Ah!

175
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
Oh, Sharnid.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Is he doing OK?

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
DALSIENA: If you're concerned,
then why don't you go see him

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
yourself?

181
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
I don't think
he'll forgive me,

182
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,720
so I guess I'll
hold off on that,

at least for the time being.

Is that all, or is there
something else you wanted?

185
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Yep.

186
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm sure you've heard
the rumors, haven't you?

187
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,480
Our MVP's been injured, so
the 17th's down a member.

You're not actually going to ask
me to take his place, are you?

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
Of course I am, and as
a full‐fledged member,

There is no way I'm ever
going to fight alongside you.

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,120
The bonds the three of us
shared are gone forever.

195
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,360
Don't you know that?

196
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,640
Well, sure.

But that's OK.

And do you know why?

199
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,720
I didn't ask you because I
wanted to do things the way

200
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
we did it in the old days.

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Besides, without Dinn, there's
no way that we even could.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,360
What the 17th needs
is a new fighter,

203
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,320
and I can't think of
anyone better than you,

replacement for Layfon,

205

but as a permanent member.

206
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:58,320
I mean, the bonds the three of
us had may very well be broken,

207
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
but not the promise
we made that day.

That's something I still
haven't given up on.

I know you haven't.

And if I'm right,
neither has he.

ran over here lickety split

sure hold her own.

that they got her.

what's with the long face?

happy, but, well, it's

be much better with you in it.

course it would.

can to make things work out.

that you got hurt because of
her, and she blames herself.

that right now, OK?

Yeah, enough that they just
released me from the hospital.

never let me do it.

Layfon was a big
motivator, wasn't he?

I understand.

356
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,920
It's good that Layfon
inspired you to push yourself

357
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,520
and your platoon to improve.

358
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,760
But you being platoon leader
and using yourself as a decoy

359
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,320
is just reckless.

360

Maybe you should save
your thoughts on that

Thank you for being
so kind as to come here.

Cut to the chase and tell
me what this is all about.

382
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,320
There's something very
wrong with the city.

383
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,720
What do you mean?

384
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
For some reason, Zuellni's
suddenly begun to run amok.

385
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
A probe has detected
contaminoids directly ahead

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,440
of the city's current path.

387
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
But rather than change
course, Zuellni is

388
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,520
heading towards them instead.

389
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,200
Heading towards them, but
why would Zuellni do that?

390
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Why?

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,280
Because of the fallen one, bub.

Haia, you're still here?

Oh, jeez, from the
look on your face,

I can tell you're really
not all that happy about it.

I need you to defeat
the contaminoids.

397

That lie ahead of us.

398
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
Haia brought this
information to my attention

399
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,280
so I want you to do
this task with him.

400
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,520
Are you kidding me?

401
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,360
I wish, but the contaminoids
are only one of two problems

402
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,640
that we're facing right now.

403
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,640
The second problem involves
what befell you the other night.

404
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,240
What if that collapse
you experienced

405
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,600
wasn't just caused
by deterioration?

406
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,400
The fallen ones are city
spirits run amok and bring

407
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
ruin wherever they go.

408

Similar incidents
to that collapse

409

are occurring
throughout the city.

410

Face it, this ain't a
coincidence, all right?

411
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,920
That fallen one is trying
to destroy Zuellni.

412
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,320
No!

413

We need these
men to stay here,

not only to capture
the fallen one,

415
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,600
but also to aid us
against the contaminoids.

416
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,120
Haia, you told me that you have
a specialist in that field?

417

His name is Fellmouse.

423
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,360
His vocal cords are
all shot to hell,

424
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,760
so we can only talk with
the aid of a vocalizer.

It's an honor to meet
you, Layfon Alseif.

Fallmouse here's not
only a genius at neni,

427

but he's also got a
really unique talent.

428
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,320
Believe it or not, this guy
knows the contaminoids' smell.

Wait, their what?

430
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
I have a particular
sense of smell

431
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
when it comes to contaminoids.

432
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,600
However, to detect their scent,
I must be physically outside,

433
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,480
beyond the air filters.

434

Hence the current
condition of my body.

435
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,800
But even that hasn't been
enough to kill this dude.

Trust me, he's
pretty damn tough.

437
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,640
I don't know whether
it's a genetic abnormality,

438
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,600

If my body were
examined, perhaps the day
