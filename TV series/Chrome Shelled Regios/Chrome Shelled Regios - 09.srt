00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
So do you think he
retained his awareness

somehow, the man we're chasing?

171
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,480
Impossible.

172
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
His body's been overtaken
by a mutated Contaminoid,

173
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,560
a parasite that controls him.

174
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,520
He shouldn't retain any kind
of awareness or memory at all.

LINTENS: Then why this?

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
There are also things
such as jealousy,

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
anger, bitterness, resentment,
hatred, and, of course,

This may be more than
just a conscious memory.

It's probably not even
something he's aware of.
