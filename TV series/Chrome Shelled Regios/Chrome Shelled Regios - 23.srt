Yeah, we got him.

Wait.

Something isn't right here.

There's static mixed in

It's like‐‐ there
are two heartbeats.

There's more than one of them?

31
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,360
Did our attack cause the
contaminoid to divide into two?

32

Vanze, listen.

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
It will come back to life.

34
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,800
There will be two of them now.

we're going to need at
least two hours, sir.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
Wouldn't it be better to
dispatch some platoons?

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
Let's kill it
before it wakes up.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm concerned about Glendan.

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
It's too early for
that, commander.

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,080
The leg section elevators
has reached ground level.

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,480
Its door is opening.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Nina Antalk has left the city.

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,360
And now, the primary issue.

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
Currently Zuellni's
completely motionless.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,440
The reason is unknown.

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
And at this rate,
the contaminoid

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
will most certainly revive.

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,680
Then the city will
again be in danger.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,240
Before the Kei‐Ra
cannon fires, I want

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,120
you to retrieve Nina Antalk.

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
She has left the city.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
We need her.

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You see, without her the
city won't be able to move.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,320
What exactly do you plan
to do after we've found her?

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,480
We have to remove
the fallen one.

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,760
It's our only choice.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,000
If we don't, Zuellni will
continue to run amok.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,840
But if it's forcibly removed,
she'll end up just like Dinn.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,400
The city's safety
is our priority.

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,920
It the fallen one
cannot be extracted,

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Zuellni must be driven from
Nina Antalk's body at once.

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,200
You're actually suggesting
we should kill her?

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,680
We estimate you
have about two hours.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,640
Your team must
carry out your duty.

70
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,600
Return Nina to the city.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
But if you exceed
your time, we'll

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,760
have no choice but to
fire the Kei‐Ra cannon

73
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,520
and the contaminoid.

74
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,600
And we will do so whether
you've made it back here or not.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Since we're about
to lose the city,

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,560
you've got no other alternative.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
You're the president, after all.

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,600
We're just the
expendable peons, huh?

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
No, Sharnid!

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Don't!

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Next time.

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
Just when I thought I
had a good look at him,

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,240
the creature split
apart into two beings.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,000
This is exactly what
they wanted, isn't it?

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your majesty, a
message from Delbone.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
Tell me.

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
She wants us to be aware
that someone is plotting

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,760
to infiltrate the inner palace.

89
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,480
At a time like this?

90
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm assuming the seal
has not been broken?

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
No.

92
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,120
The entrance is
blocked by a maze,

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,560
and a covert approach is
thought to be impossible.

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Send Barmeleen at once.

95
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll go first.

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,920
Roger.

98
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,880
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Damn.

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Piece of junk.

101
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,400
Sorry, friend.

102
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,640
Gotta go to Glendan, so I
need to borrow your ride.

103
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,720
But don't worry.

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,320
I promise I'll return
it after I'm finished.

105
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Why me?

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
I can't believe this.

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,040
That stupid queen's
got some nerve.

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,320
Damn.

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
This is disgusting!

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
So you're him?

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,520
The shit head intruder.

112
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
Hey.

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,760
There's no reason to curse.

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Shut up!

115
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Die, you bastard!

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,440
I figured I'd
see you guys here.

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
It's your presence.

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,640
You are a conduit.

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,240
You are what connects
our world to this one.

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,200
The simple fact that you're
here causes many other beings

121
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,560
to become involved.

122
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
It drags them in.

123
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,200
It's difficult to live
in this world, isn't it?

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
All you have to
do is come back.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,720
You're responsible for
my home being destroyed.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,360
You murdered my
dad, and my brother.

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,520
You killed everyone,
and everything.

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,760
You tried to destroy
my entire life.

129
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,400
All the people who I loved.

130
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
You stole them from me.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Do you remember that?

132
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Restoration!

133
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,880
I'll show you what happens to
those who try to take things

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,640
away from Dickserio Muscaine.

135
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,360
You're going to wish
you'd never crossed me!

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,160
What's his deal?

137
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,200
Does this guy think we're done?

138
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
Don't screw with me, buddy.

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Now I'm really pissed off!

140
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm on your side!

141
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,720
I don't care about
sides, you shit head!

142
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Die!

143
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,600
All you bastards can die!

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
That girl sure
has a mouth on her!

145
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,160
It's the Wolfmask Mob.

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Wolfmask Mob?

147
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,400
Intruders at a time like this?

148
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't think
it's a coincidence.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
We're distracted.

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,880
The contaminoid's yours.

151
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,080
Make sure your team puts
an end to that situation.

152
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,360
Meanwhile, six Heaven's
Blades will remain in Glendan.

153
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll retire to the inner palace.

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,280
Have you neglected your math?

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,520
If six stay with you, that
leaves me with less than half.

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
Lintens, you ought
to know that I don't

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,840
like men who are disagreeable.

158
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,080
You know, you don't
have to go with us.

159
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,480
The 17th Platoon was the only
team ordered to mobilize.

160
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,880
Plus, we could all die today.

161
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,760
You don't really
mean that, right?

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,080
Think about it, Dalsiena.

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Have I ever lied to you?

164
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, please, Sharnid.

165
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,320
Lies are the only
thing I hear from you.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
I prefer truth.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,000
When do I finally
get to hear it, huh?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
I've been waiting.

169
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,120
And I'm a member of
the 17th too, OK?

170
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Try not to forget that.

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,000
All right, guys.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,040
I'll head directly
for the contaminoid.

174
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
You two need to spread
out, and do everything

175
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,400
you can to find Nina.

176
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Understood.

177
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
Got it.

178
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
Wait for me.

179
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm coming, too.

180
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
My range won't be that
great, but I should be

181
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,920
able to use my Nen‐I terminal.

182
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
What is that?

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,720
Vanze urgently needs
to speak with you, sir.

184
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm here.

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
What's going on?

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,840
The team just left the city.

187
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,720
That was the 17th Platoon.

188
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,000
They're headed straight
for the contaminoid.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Everything's fine.

190
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
That's all right, then.

192
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,480
There are no changes to the
Kei‐Ra cannon's fire time.

193
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,640
VANZE: Of course.

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,520
Things are going
very well on our end.

195
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,680
You sound a bit tired, sir.

196
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,520
KALIAN: Should personal growth
be cause for celebration?

197
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
Does it even matter?

198
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,480
You all right?

199
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,040
Yes, I'm fine.

200
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Goodbye.

201
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,920
Yes, but why would you go?

202
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,760
We just fired the Kei‐Ra cannon.

203
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,480
There'll be too
much interference.

204
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,440
You won't be able to
use your terminal.

205
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,400
If you go, you'll be in the way.

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,200
You've ordered the
17th Platoon to do this,

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
and I'm a member of that unit.

208
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,720
No.

209
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,440
You've done more than enough.

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,920
You need to get some rest.

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm fine.

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,480
And I'm going.

213
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,640
Felli, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

214
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,600
The order to fire the cannon‐‐

215
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
I can't delay it.

216
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,120
‐Goodbye.
‐No!

217
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,920
Felli!

218
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Deactivate your Nen‐I terminal!

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
Do it now!
Understand?

220
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
Stop it.

221
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Drop your guns.

222
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,680
You've made up your
mind, haven't you?

223
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

224
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
If I don't make it
back here in time,

225
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,400
go ahead and fire the cannon.

226
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,080
It's the only way that
we can protect the city.

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,480
[LAUGHTER]

228
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,400
Dude, come on, man.

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I was such a young girl.

230
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,120
I didn't know
anything back then.

231
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,040
[LAUGHTER]

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,400
He was always there,
right by my side.

233
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,240
Hey.

234
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,360
You burned it.

235
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,760
Listen, mister, I
know what I'm doing!

236
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,840
Sure smells good.

237
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,560
When Layfon came
back from a battle,

238
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,920
his smile was enough for me.

239
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,480
I never tried to learn
about any of his burdens.

240
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,600
How hard they were on him.

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,520
There you are.

242
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,040
You've got to keep
your strength up,

243
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,360
so I brought you
something to eat.

244
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
I saw it!

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,840
What's the situation outside?

246
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,080
Zuellni's legs
aren't moving anymore.

247
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
The city stopped going rogue?

248
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
It's about time,
because if we couldn't

249
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
escape from the contaminoid‐‐

250
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
I think we just
lucked out, guys.

251
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
With circumstances
being what they are,

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,400
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep
unconfirmed info to yourself.

253
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,240
We don't want to give
people the wrong idea.

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,720
I didn't mean to.

256
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,760
But there's no need
for us to worry now.

257
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,640
The 17th Platoon‐‐
they've been sent

258
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,600
out to destroy the contaminoid.

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Layfon's team?

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,560
Oh, how cool!

261
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,640
The 17th Platoon?

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm going!

263
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,480
Wait!

264
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,640
I have to find Layfon!

265
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
No!

266
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
What are you saying?

267
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
He's headed for the contaminoid.

268
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
If you follow, you could die.

269
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,600
You don't understand!

270
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,120
I have to give this to him, now!

271
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Leerin, whatever
that is, I'm sure it's

272
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,000
very important to Layfon.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
I wish I could take
you there myself,

274
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,720
but I just don't have the power.

275
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,560
Listen, this is not
Glendan, understand?

276
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,080
No one here can do that.

277
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,480
No one can take you
close to a contaminoid.

278
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,240
Not here in Zuellni, anyway.

279
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,880
What about Gorneo?

280
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Help me find Gorneo Lueckens.

281
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
Come on!
Bring it!

282
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,320
Take that!

283
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,520
They've been giving you
hell for a while now.

284
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
What gives?

285
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Are you a Heaven's
Blade, or aren't ya?

286
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,880
OK, buddy!

287
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,720
Try this!

288
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,560
Have you killed them yet?

289
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
Look, just give a girl
some time, all right?

290
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,240
Her majesty is sending more
Heaven's Blades to help.

291
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,480
Whatever we do, we
can't let them get away!

292
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,480
Not again.

293
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,240
The regios will finish,
and will of Ricksario

294
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
shall turn to dust.

295
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,520
Even as we speak, Ignatius'
dreams are becoming a reality.

296
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,840
Before the end, Dainsleif, the
emissary from the aurora field,

297
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,920
shall bring all to fruition.

298
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,880
We shall drag
forth the sleeping

299
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,920
child that defies
the will of Ignatius,

300
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,680
and expose its identity.

301
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Do you see the
contaminoid, Dainsleif?

302
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,720
Are you blind to this?

303
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Saya, are you asleep?

304
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,720
Where are you?

305
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
What are you thinking?

306
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
What is your plan?

307
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,080
Are you trying to
protect Leerin?

308
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
What's going on?

309
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Who gave you
permission to be here?

310
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Please forgive
me, your majesty.

311
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
My purpose here is of
the utmost importance.

313
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,000
What is this?

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,720
Why are you here,
and not in Zuellni?

315
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,640
I did as you
asked, your majesty.

316
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,600
I protected Leerin, and
got her safely to the city.

317
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,520
And now I've come for
my Heaven's Blade.

318
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
If I'm to deliver you the fallen
one, I'm going to need it.

319
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
You do know defeat
is unforgivable?

320
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,080
You shouldn't confuse
me with Layfon.

321
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,000
That may be.

322
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,840
But he hasn't been defeated yet.

323
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,640
Be back soon.

324
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,000
Nina!

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
You.

326
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
Stay out of my way.

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,320
You fool.

328
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,880
What are you trying
to make me do, here?

329
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,080

Doing that was a
betrayal to him,

387
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,000
so I forbade myself from
using the Saiharden technique,
