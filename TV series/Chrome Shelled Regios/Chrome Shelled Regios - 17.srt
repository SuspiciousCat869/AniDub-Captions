There's a group of

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Stop it!

169
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,440
Send someone to the
machinery department?

170
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Why?

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
GIRL: Just do it.
Please.

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
Nina's in trouble.

173
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,760
You can look out that
window all you want,

174
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,000
but you can't see Glendan.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,560
It's too far away.

176
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm not stupid.

177
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,560
More to the point, what exactly
are you doing here, Savaris?

178
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
Actually, I'd prefer
it if you didn't

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
say my name out loud, OK?

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh.

181
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm sorry, I‐‐ well, I‐‐

182
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm here on business.

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,560
It's a top secret mission
to another Regios.

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
This will be a long trip.

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
We should make the most of it.

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh.

187
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,120
OK.

188
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,400
Rather than capturing
the fallen one,

189
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,320
the girl will be your priority.

190
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,040
You must keep Leerin safe.

191
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
Yes, but‐‐

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,680
I will not allow a single
hair on her head to be hurt.

193
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,400
Do you understand me?

194
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,760
Or I'll crush you like a bug.

195
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,280
And if she asks something
of you, you must obey.

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,360
No matter what.

197
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,320
You may consider it an order
from the queen herself.

198
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,640
If her orders show
disregard for her life,

199
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,520
should I allow her to
put herself in danger,

200
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,880
or consider intervening?

201
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Obviously you
must keep her safe.

202
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,600
That is your top priority.

203
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
But that doesn't mean you're
allowed to disobey her.

204
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,120
You should be able to do both.

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
You're always
bragging about being

206
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
a Heaven's Blade, aren't you?

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,680
Well, I wouldn't necessarily
refer to what I do as bragging.

208
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,600
Enough, Savaris!

209
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Just do it, all right?

210
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,360
Layfon, listen to me.

211
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
Please forgive Haia's
affront towards you.

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,520
That's just his way.

213
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,120
For as long as I can
remember, he's always had

214
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,320
a particular interest in you.

215
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Interest?

216
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,400
I must admit,
there was a time I

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,240
really wanted to meet you, too.

218
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
But since it appeared
to me you had

219
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,520
no plans to return to Glendan,
I had all but given up hope.

220
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,200
Tell me, what's the queen
going to do with the fallen one?

221
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,360
I do not know.

222
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,080
The Salinbon mercenary
training group was originally

223
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,000
created for the sole purpose
of capturing the fallen ones

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
and bringing them
back to Glendan.

225
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,200
I suppose the royal family
might have some use for them.

226
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Layfon, what are you doing?

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
What's going?

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
Uh, Felli?

229
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Is that you?

230
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,440
My terminal is still
a long way away,

231
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,720
but it'll be there very soon.

232
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
I couldn't wait, so I
borrowed this person's

233
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,400
terminal to make contact.

234
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
That's incredible!

235
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
I've never seen
anything like this.

236
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,720
You attune to do it without
disrupting mine any.

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm sorry, but this is a matter
for this idiot, who is doing

238
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,120
something incredibly stupid.

239
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

240
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,920
Look‐‐ I'm sorry.

241
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,640
It's commendable that you're
beginning with an apology.

242
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,760
We understand the situation.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,200
We've no choice
but to rely on you.

244
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,640
Although I must admit,
I'm certainly appalled

245
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,720
at Zuellni's low level.

246
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
That's not what's going on.

247
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,240
Zuellni is an academic city.

248
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm positive that
this is normal.

249
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,920
That's wonderful.

250
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,720
Tell me, what made you
decide to call us, then?

251
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
I want you to watch.

252
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Watch?

253
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,040
The battle with
the contaminoids?

254
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,800
Yes.

255
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,400
Also, if you can manage
it, I'd like for you

256
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,080
to record footage of it.

257
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,320
Can you do that?

258
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
Shouldn't be a problem.

259
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
I'll do my best.

260
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,120
Thank you, Filli.

261
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,040
Of course, if I only
show you and the others,

262
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,840
and don't show our leader,
I'll get yelled at later, huh?

263
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,320
Nina's gone to see
Zuellni, hasn't she, Felli?

264
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,640
Yes.

265
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,200
Something seems to have
happened to her, huh?

266
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm betting Nina will straighten
things out on that end.

267
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
OK.

268
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
You and the others
should a safe place

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
where you can watch the battle.

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Understood.

271
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,840
Just wait a little bit longer.

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,160
My terminal will be there soon.

273
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,720
Until then, please stand by.

274
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Right.

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,560
Fon Fon, it's here.

276
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,360
We're all ready to record now.

277
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,720
Thank you very much.

278
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,120
It's time.

279
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,440
Looks like they're
about to get started.

280
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,600
That's them!

281
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Contaminoids?

282
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,560
Sir?

283
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,720
Let's get this thing started.

284
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,520
Don't worry about me, OK?

285
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,440
Just make sure you
record the mercenaries.

286
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,920
Focus on them.

287
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
I understand.

288
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
You're not at optimal condition,
so don't do anything reckless.

289
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,400
I'll be fine.

290
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,720
We should attack
at the same time.

291
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
We can't risk letting
them head towards Zuellni.

292
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
Who do you think
you're talking to, bub?

293
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,040
We're the top dogs
on this battlefield,

294
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,160
not inexperienced little
ups that are going to let

295
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,200
others tell us how to bite.

296
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Watch and learn.

297
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,640
Enough bragging, already.

298
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,080
Let's take these bastards down.

299
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,520
All right!

300
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,880
It's huntin' time!

301
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
Restoration 02.

302
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Next one.

303
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,920
Restoration 01.

304
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Fon Fon!

305
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,320
Don't worry.

306
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm OK.

307
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
The wound on my back
opened up a little.

308
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,640
It's no big deal.

309
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,360
There's nothing little
about that at all.

310
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm fine.

311
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm going to be all right.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,000
It's not like my suit
ripped open, or anything.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,680
There's no way I can stop now.

314
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,920
The only time to stop
is when you're dead.

315
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm in great shape.

316
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,080
Trust me.

317
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,920
I feel like I could
cut through the sky!

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,320
Whoa!

319
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,200
Restoration AD!

320
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You know that?

321
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,080
That never gets old.

322
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
Is this a dream?

323
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
This can't be happening.

324
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,240
Forget about me.

325
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Just look over there.

326
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,440
[GUNFIRE]

327
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,760
[SHOUTING]

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,000
These dudes are smooth.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,400
They scatter, and seal off
the contaminoids' movements.

330
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
Their technique is much
more advanced than ours.

331
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,240
And then after the
beasts take the bait,

332
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,720
Haia finishes them off.

333
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,360
Even so, it's nothing
compared to what Layfon can do.

334
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,600
You all right?

335
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,480
Do you see?

336
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,360
That's how you
fight a contaminoid.

337
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
Like them.

338
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,080
My way?

339
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
It's for reckless idiots.

340
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,680
You make one wrong move, you'll
be dead before you realize it.

341
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,520
A single mistake, and you'll
end up in a graveyard.

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,360
Because no one will be able
to take that mistake back.

343
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,760
That's why I wanted you to
see, even if it's not now,

344
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,720
next time.

345
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,120
Or if that's no good,
then the time after that.

346
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,240
From now on, we'll
fight together!

347
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,800
That's some heavy
shit to drop on us.

348
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,520
Still, having you
rely on us for a change

350
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,400
isn't too bad of a feeling.

351
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,040
Siena, this is the 17th Platoon.

352
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,120
Not too bad, huh?

353
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,520
[SHOUTING]

354
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,600
If we don't hurry
up and show Nina

355
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
that battle footage Felli
took, she's going to get

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,680
pretty bent out of shape.

357
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
[LAUGHTER]

358
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,560
Find her?

359
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,520
No luck yet, sir.

360
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
But we'll keep looking.

361
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,320
Well, where the
hell did she go?

362
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,920
And that concludes
von Zahardy's report.

363
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,560
Let me be sure I understand.

364
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
Nina's gone?

365
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,680

[THEME MUSIC]

367
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,600
NARRATOR: On the
journey towards Zuellni,

368
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
Leerin encounters
a city called Maya.

369
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,480
But when Nina goes missing,
Layfon cannot hide his concern,

370
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,840
and Zuellni continues to
stray off course, heading

371
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,560
toward a group of contaminoids.

372
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,040
Next time, Nina Missing!

373
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,560
Zuellni in Crisis.

374
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,400
And restoration.
