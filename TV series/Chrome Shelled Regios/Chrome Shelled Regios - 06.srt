00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Hey, uh.

171
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,600
Are you busy?

172
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Well, um, no.

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm not since training's
been canceled.

174
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Why?

175
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
It's Kalian.

176
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,280
He says that he has
something that he wants

177
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,320
to discuss with you in private.

178
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,880
Your brother wants to see me?

179
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,160
Yes, but I don't have
a clue what it's about.

180
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,000
All he told me that
it was very important.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
As for me, I'm cooking
dinner tonight,

182
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
so I have to go shopping now.

183
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
Will you come with me?

184
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Need some help?

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,880
Felli?

186
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,680
FELLI: No, thanks.

187
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm OK.

188
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm cooking, so just stay there.

189
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
OK.

190
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Can I help?

191
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
Didn't I tell you to stay put?

192
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120
You have cooked before, right?

193
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,040
Of course I have.

194
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Don't be stupid.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,120
Sure.

196
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
If you say so.

197
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Argh.

198
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,360
What is it?

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Well, it's just, most cooks
peel the potatoes first.

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,480
That makes them a
whole lot easier

201
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
to cut and to cook later.

202
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,160
Is cooking a hobby of yours?

203
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,240
No, not really.

204
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
You see, back at the
orphanage in Glendan,

205
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,000
it was just something that
everyone did together.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,640
You cooked with
boys and girls?

207
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
Tell me what that was like.

208
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,280
Well, we did learn
how to peel potatoes.

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
It's delicious.

210
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
Well done, Layfon.

211
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Thank you, but honestly,
this was very simple.

212
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
Simple or not, I
am grateful for it.

213
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,080
This is the first home cooked
meal I've eaten in a while.

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Oh, really?

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Why is that?

[GROAN]

217
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
It appears that
you're still in pain

218
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,920
from your recent wounds.

219
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm fine.

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
That's good.

221
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
I apologize for being late, but
I had to meet up with the chief

222
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
of the municipal police.

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,720
The police chief?

224
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Yes.

225
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
We were discussing some thefts.

226
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
We've even delayed some
roaming buses that the police

227
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
suspect are involved.

228
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,840
Oh, that reminds me.

229
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,480
I almost forgot to mention it.

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,320
One of your friends has applied
to work for the police force.

231
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,400
Naruki Gelni, I believe it is.

232
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,800
MIFI: Are you sure you didn't
leave it in a room somewhere?

233
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,040
No.

234
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
I had it while I
was waiting for him.

235
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,120
I just checked
the lost and found.

236
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,400
It hasn't been turned in.

237
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Hey.

238
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Is it OK if I try talking
to Layfie about this?

239
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
You, Nari?

240
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
But why?

241
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Well, let's just say
that I've got something

242
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,400
else to discuss with him.

243
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,320
I'd like you to
take a look at this.

244
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
That last attack
convinced me that we

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,040
must take a much more
proactive approach when it

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,560
comes to defending this city.

247
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,400
And as a part of that effort,
we launched an unmanned probe.

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,600
It sent back that image from
approximately 500 kilmils ahead

249
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
of our current path.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Your thoughts?

251
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,000
I think you've got a good
reason to be concerned.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
But why?

253
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
What is that thing?

254
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,680
Well, it's Contaminoid.

255
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,520
An elder.

256
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,760
Harley.

257
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
So that's the reason why
I was confirming my Kei

258
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,280
output earlier, am I right?

259
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,680
You're quite the
perceptive one.

260
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,080
And no, I'm not being sarcastic.

261
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,560
It's an honest compliment.

262
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,840
Kalian.

263
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,680
You're planning on using
him again, aren't you?

264
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,200
Until recently, Zuellni's been
peaceful, but for some reason,

265
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,920
it now continually seeks to
encounter the Contaminoids.

266
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,880
I don't know why this is, but
the one thing that I do know

267
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
is that the only way
for our city to survive

268
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
is to rely on him.

269

I came here to see you tonight.

322
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,200
The truth is, I'm trying to
get a job with the police

323
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,680
and I was hoping you
could help me out.

But why?

326
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,080
Well, you see, there's
this certain case,

327
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,200
and the chief, when he was
interviewing me for the job,

328
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
he found out we knew each other.

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,280
He said if you could
help him with it,

330
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,000
it might improve my
chances to get hired.

busy schedule,

335
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
and with all your
platoon duties,

336
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
and your job on top of that.

If you decline, I'll understand,
but I'm hoping you'll say yes.

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Um, what happens if I say no?

339
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,800
Would that screw things
up on the force for you?

340
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
They wouldn't reject your
application or anything, right?

341
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,080

I mean, I don't think so.

I know it's a lot to ask.

It's just that I really wanna
become a police officer.

Of course not.

Well, not really.

399
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,480
I have to clean up the
machinery department.

400
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,240
But if someone on the
force could possibly

401
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,000
pull some strings, I might be.

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OK, then.

I'll call your boss personally
to make sure it happens.

You head out with Naruki.

Good luck.

as a caravan selling

408

However, they're thieves
after Zuellni's data.

409

And you're sure that
they're criminals?

410
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,680
What kind of proof do you have?

411
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,400
Well, we have an eyewitness.

412

But what we need
is hard evidence

That's why we delayed
their bus' departure.

Oh.

You mean you actually
spoke with him?

419
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,840
I had a meeting with him
last night about something

420

we're both working on.

I agreed.

I pressured you,

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,560
and I did it in a
really underhanded way

430
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,400
so you couldn't refuse.

I'm glad to help
you out, Naruki.

happen to those guys?

They'll be labeled as

and exiled.

By selling those chips, we

It's a letter to Layfon.

500
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,360
(LAUGHING) No,
you can't read it.

501
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,560
I understand how
you feel, though.

502
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,600
Hey, Zuellni?

503
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
I promise I'll get stronger.

504
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,120
LAYFON: The locker room?

505
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,880
Yep.

506
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,800
I was going to give
it to you last night,

507
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,120
but you never showed
up for work, so.

508
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,880
Oh.

509
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm sorry about that.

510
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,640
I had to work on‐‐

511
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,200
It's OK.

512
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,840
Don't even worry
about it, all right?

513
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,640
Uh.

514

515
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,760
Are you busy?

516
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,360
You're not?

517
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,400
Then can you come to the
training hall right now?

MAN (VOICEOVER): Nina,
hoping to approach

520
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,840
Layfon's strength uses he Kei
to its limit and collapses.

521
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,760
Meanwhile, Layfon
leaves Nina with what

522
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,240
could be taken as his last
will and testament as he
