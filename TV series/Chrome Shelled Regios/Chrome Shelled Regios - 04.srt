happens is that they

respond to every bit of it,

to handle, right?

out their emotional responses.

make any expressions at all.

student morale.

171
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,800
I can assure you that's the
only reason I'm here today.

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Ugh.

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,240
I'll be right back
with your order, sir.

174
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
Let me know if you
want anything else.

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
Not another kick, Felli.

176
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,640
They hurt.

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Hey, I'm going to go home now.

178
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
Wait.

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
There she is.

180
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
She's coming out.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
What do you two
think you're doing?

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Ahh!

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Fine.

184
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Here.

185
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Ow.

186
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
Hey, Felli.
I'm‐‐

187
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,840
You're sorry.

188
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
I know.

189
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
From now, I highly
advise that you

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,680
not associate with shady
characters such as this one.

191
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,480
Shady?

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
Come on.

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
That's a little harsh.

194
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,280
No.

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
It's not.

196
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,240
Being forced to use this is.

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,160
Sorry but I have to go.

198
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,920
Uh.

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,440
Senior Felli.

200
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,120
No, Fon‐Fon.

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,560
I said don't call me that.

202
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,880
Um.

203
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,480
I meant Felli.

204
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,280
Yes.

205
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,200
What is it?

206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
What made you decide to
get a job all of a sudden?

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,320
Actually, it wasn't
all of a sudden.

208
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
I'd been considering
it for quite some time.

209
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
Since I was a child, my
parents and those around me

210
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
have always thought that
being a Nen‐I operator

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,840
is the one and only path for me.

212
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,200
I don't agree with that at all.

213
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
People should be allowed
to make up their own minds

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,240
and decide their
futures for themselves.

215
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,520
And that's exactly why
came to Zuellni, so that I

216
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,000
could discover my own path.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,680
However, it's just like
you said about yourself

218
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
the other day, Fon‐Fon.

219
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,040
What?

220
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
I can relate.

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
What you told me
was I don't think

222
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
I should stay this way either.

special we got last time.

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Wasn't it so delicious?

226
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
Mhm.

227
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Maybe we could
get a dessert too.

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,880
OK.

229
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,840
What do you think, honey?

230
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,640
Do you really like it?

231
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,880
Hot fresh baked bread, folks.

232
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Get a free sample.

233
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
MAYSHEN: I think
I'll have to pass.

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,600
NARUKI: Me too.

235
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,120
It sounds a little
creepy if you ask me.

236
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,880
Come on.

237
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,120
Don't be like that.

238
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,760
I can't do this job
alone, you guys.

Oh, Felli.

Didn't see you there.

244
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,920
I'll take that job.

Whatever it may be.

I'll gladly do it.

the research facility

248
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,000
of the Alchemy Department.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280
But 30 years ago, a
big accident happened

250
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,840
here during an experiment.

251
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,360
People were injured
and even killed.

252
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,080
So this place was locked up.

253
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
The powers that be
never tore this building

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
down for some reason.

255
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
And it's said that the
spirits of the victims

256
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
still roam these very halls.

257
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,920
Now, I, investigative
journalist Miffi Rotten,

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,600
will explore these legends in
an article for "Weekly Look‐In."

259
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Oh, and I hope you
guys don't mind,

260
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
but I can't afford to
pay you for your help.

261
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,360
I can't tell if she's angry.

262
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,120
You should have told
her it was a nonpaying

263
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,080
job from the beginning.

264
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,280
Hey.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,000
She's the one who
volunteered to come with us.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
Remember?

267
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
FELLI: I understand.

268
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Oh thanks.

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Well, that's one problem solved.

270
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,040
Here's one that's not.

271
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,000
Isn't this building
supposed to be off limits?

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Look.

273
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,360
Don't be such a
stick in the mud.

274
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Besides, something like that
can't hold a journalist back.

275
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
Maybe.

276
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,840
But it can hold back a cop.

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,200
And since I want
to become one, I

278
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,120
think I'd better get going now.

we might get hungry.

So I made sandwiches.

I put in a work request
to the municipal police

a few days ago.

Do you mind telling me
what you're doing here?

Why are you here?

What was that thing?

342

It's only a guess.

343
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,000
But 30 years ago,
there was an attempt

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,440
to create an artificial life
form, one that was designed

345
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
to fight off the
contaminoids, based

346
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,080
right here in this building.

347
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,640
It was called the
Guardian Project.

348
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,760
The Guardian Project?

349
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,520
These Guardians
are protectoids

350
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,280
turned out to be failures.

351
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,200
So the project was halted,
and this place was shut down.

352
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Are you saying that creature
was one of those things?

All I do know is Kalian is about
to have this place demolished.

355
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
I've inspected it before, but
he wanted me to double check

356
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,360
that nothing was left behind.

not here during my last visit.

Did you come here alone?

No.
