Seems her Kei artery is shot.

169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Well, will she get better?

170
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
The procedure I just performed
should strengthen the Kei flow,

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,320
but she won't be able
to move for a while.

172
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
Now, I'm sorry, but I have
other patients to attend to.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
Look.
Don't worry.

174
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,400
Once we're finished
with your friend,

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
I promise she'll be good as new.

176
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,000
Right.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,760
Thank you very much.

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
Well, I suppose things
could be a lot worse.

179
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,560
I swear, she's always
been like this.

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,000
Once she sets her
mind on something,

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,760
it's like she gets
tunnel vision.

182
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,080
Ah!

183
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,240
Um, you think we should
cover her up with a sheet?

184
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
LAYFON: Well, the doctor
didn't say anything,

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
so maybe we shouldn't.

186
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,400
You perverts.

187
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Ah!

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
Where'd you come from?

189
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
You got it wrong.

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
We weren't looking.

191
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,600
Only a pervert would
say something like that.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
As for why I'm here, these
are the results that the probe

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,800
brought that this morning.

194
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Zuellni isn't
changing its path.

195
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,720
At the rate we're traveling,
we'll reach that Contaminoid's

196
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,040
location by tomorrow.

197
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,800
Oh crap.

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
That's not good.

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
I better get going now.

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
I have to finish the Adamandite.

201
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
My brother has an
assignment for you.

202
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,280
He wants you to go
out this evening.

203
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,200
I understand, Felli.

204
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,000
OK.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
See you later!

206
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,600
Will Layfie be OK out
there all buy himself?

207
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
With the platoon
leader in the hospital,

208
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
there'll be lots of
things he'll need, right?

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,920
Then we'll just have to
take care of him, won't we?

210
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,360
Layfie won't be able to do
this all alone, you know.

211
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,280
Mm.

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Huh?

213
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Mm.

214
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,240
NINA: Where am I?

215
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,600
LAYFON: Well, you're
already awake, huh?

216
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,160
Typical.

217
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Layfon?

218
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,640
Guess I must've collapsed
from fatigue, didn't I?

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah.

220
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
You used too much
Augmenting Kei.

221
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
Have you been here
watching me this whole time?

222
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,640
Uh, well, no.

223
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,880
I screwed up, huh?

224
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,720
No way.

225
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,840
I don't look at it
like that at all.

226
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,320
Why don't you?

227
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,040
Getting that close
to death teaches

228
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
us something about ourselves.

229
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,000
Something we wouldn't
have known otherwise.

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,120
It's a journey we
have to go on alone.

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,920
Yeah, but look
where mine ended.

232
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
What a joke.

233
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,640
At first, All I could think
of was the 17th platoon.

234
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
I just wanted to be
strong enough to win.

235
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,240
But then I got a little greedy,
'cause you're so strong.

236
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,640
When I first saw your
power, it terrified me.

237
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,840
I thought, is he even human?

238
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,080
I realized that you
were, of course, and one

239
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,520
whose strength could
finally put our unit on top.

240
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,880
And you did that.

241
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,800
In fact, you did it so well that
I became convinced our platoon

242
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,320
was stronger than the others.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,840
But then we were defeated,
and I tried to tell

244
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,360
myself it was a good thing.

245
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,840
Because I was wrong,
and that event

246
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,880
showed me the error of my ways.

247
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,360
But if that's true,
what can I do?

248
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
How can I win?

249
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Nina.

250
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Were you aware of the
disruption in your Kei Soku?

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,040
When that type of
disruption happens,

252
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
your body's telling you you're
wasting too much energy.

253
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, it's your
entire life force.

254
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,120
It's the foundation of your Kei
and the source of your power.

255
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,440
And ideally, we should
live our lives by it.

256
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,720
The Kei Soku?

257
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,520
Mhm.

258
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,680
You need to realize that
you're not in this alone,

259
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,400
and how important
you are to us all.

260
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
When it comes to
fighting, I know full

261
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,480
well how to get into a
battle all by myself,

262
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,280
but when it comes to leading
a team, I'm worthless.

263
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,160
The whole crew needs you now.

264
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,560
Whether or not we become the
most powerful platoon we can be

265
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,000
depends on you, Nina.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
So lead us.

267
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,640
Don't give up.

268
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,360
Don't toss us aside.

269
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,320
Layfon.

270
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,280
You idiot.

271
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,600
That's the last thing
I would ever do.

272
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
FELLI (VOICEOVER): Those
sounded like last words to me.

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
LAYFON: So I guess
you were listening.

274
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,720
FELLI (VOICEOVER): I used
my Nen‐I to eavesdrop.

275
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,520
Those weren't my last words.

276
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,840
FELLI (VOICEOVER):
Given the situation,

277
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,600
it wouldn't be
unusual if they were.

278
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't know.

279
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,400
FELLI (VOICEOVER): I do.

280
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Well.

281
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
I don't plan to lose.

282
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
FELLI (VOICEOVER): How is it?

283
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,800
LAYFON: It's a male.

284
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Probably a fourth
or fifth stager.

285
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,880
You can tell by how much
the legs have atrophied.

286
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,480
Typically, Contaminoids cast
off their legs every time they

287
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,400
molt. Anyway, now's my chance.

288
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,040
I better make my move
while he's sleeping.

289
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
[SHATTER]

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
He's molting.

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
They're hungry after
they've molted.

292
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
[ROARING]

293
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,840
Felli.

294
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,520
He waited 'til the last
possible moment to molt.

295
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
When a food source was near.

296
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,520
FELLI (VOICEOVER): Wait.

297
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,400
What are you saying?

298
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,920
LAYFON: We've got to hurry.

299
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,520
We don't have much time.

300
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,480
This is a first term elder.

301
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
We're in big trouble.

302
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,880
We'll be lucky if we can
defeat this thing before it

303
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,840
destroys half the city.

304
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,000
Restoration 02.

305
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,040
Yo.

306
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,800
Hey.

307
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,720
Feeling good?

308
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,640
You know, that's not
really a smart question

309
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,200
to ask a sick person.

310
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,280
Abso‐freaking‐lutely not.

311
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Still, I never figured you the
type to collapse from fatigue.

312
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
You gave everybody
a bit of a scare

313
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,640
there, Miss Platoon Leader.

314
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,440
Sorry.

315
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I feel pretty bad about that.

316
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Aw, come on.

317
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,920
Don't be so hard on yourself.

318
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,320
Nobody expects you to apologize.

319
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Anyway that's not the issue.

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,160
I dropped by to talk about
something else, actually.

321
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,600
What exactly would that be?

322
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Sharnid, stop!

323
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,480
What's going on?

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,800
I know what I'm doing here.

325
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,760
I think it's about time
our friend Harley filled

326
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
us in on his little plan.

327
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,640
So what do you say, bud?

328
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,520
Everybody's got secrets.

329
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,720
But certain things,
