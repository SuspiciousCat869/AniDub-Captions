What a great addition
to the platoon.

126

didn't he try to move when

for my brother's deception.

in the 17th platoon, Layfon.

They were both just
schemes devised

by my brother, the
student council president,

155

to get you to join the platoon.

slightly longer than my right.

minute addition,

this uniform shouldn't fit
so perfectly, but it does.

I was wondering
why it fit so well.

my question, huh?

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,320
It was all an act, wasn't it?

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Do you know much about
Nen‐I operators, Layfon?

170
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,360
We have the ability
to manipulate objects

171
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,520
through telekinesis
and extract information

172
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,480
through psychometric touch.

173
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
We can also see and sense
that which can't be seen,

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,000
and whenever we project
our Nen‐I outwards,

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,360
we can speak with
others telepathically.

176
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,800
Nen‐I isn't the kind of thing
you can just pick up and learn.

177
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,120
It's more like something
you have to be born with.

178
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,760
Isn't that right?

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
That's correct, and I just
so happened to be born with

180
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,520
an abnormally large
quantity of Nen‐I.

181
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,440
My brother wanted to take
advantage of this for Zuellni,

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,880
so I was forcibly
transferred into the Military

183
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,520
Arts department, just like you.

184
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
I truly despise my brother.

185
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,720
He'll do whatever it
takes to win, no matter

186
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,440
how underhanded that may be.

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,560
So just continue to keep
your strength a secret, OK?

Yeah, well, that's
kind of a long story.

My parents were totally against
the idea of me coming here,

Zuellni was the only school
that offered me a scholarship

217
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,920
and I thought that it
was better than nothing.

It's hard work, but
it does pay well,

As a safety precaution,
we must request

that all spectators
remain seated

330
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,920
behind the protective
barriers at all times.

331
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,440
NINA: Since we're attacking,
there are only two ways to win.

332
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
Wipe out the enemy
platoon or take down

333
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,680
the flag behind their lines.

334
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,640
LAYFON: And how can the
defending team win this?

335
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,120
NINA: They can either protect
the flag until time runs out,

336
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
or they can take down the
opposing force's leader.

337
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,120
In this match,
that leader is me.

338
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,800
Since I'm their primary target,
I'm gonna act as a decoy

339
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,080
and lure them away.

340
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
They'll be one fearless move.

get to that flag.

351
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,480
Layfon could use
a little backup.

352
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,880
That's easier said than done.

353
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,560
That new student's
responses are pretty pathetic.

354
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
And his Kei channeling
is rather poor too.

KARIAN (ON PHONE): Zuellni
always gets students

359
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,200
who are young and immature.

360
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Perhaps the importance of
this match hasn't sunk in

361
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,560
and he thinks it's
just child's play.

362
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,400
MAN (ON SPEAKER): He needs
to look at it more like it's

363
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,560
a matter of life and death.

364
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,040
I tried to impart how
important his skills were

365
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,760
for this city's survival,
but for some reason,

366
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,840
our new student is still
lacking in motivation.

367
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,880
Seems he's not the only one.

368
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,240
Your sister is as well.

369
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,680
Those two are uninspired.

370
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,280
And Sharnid's undisciplined.

371
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
The whole platoon's a mess.

372
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,760
You should reassign Nina
Antalk to another platoon

373
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,520
so she has a chance to succeed.

374
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,720
KARIAN (ON PHONE):
offered, but she

375
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,480
refused, so let's see
how she and her platoon

376
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,520
do in this match.

They might surprise you.

379
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,240
I doubt it.

380

Knowing this bunch, I think
the only thing they're

381
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,560
gonna achieve is failure.

382
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
Sometimes the fear
of failure is all

383

the motivation that one needs.

Why aren't you helping Layfon?

387
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,360
He's too close to
his sparring partner,

388
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,160
so I can't get a clear shot.
