This is it, our world.

333
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:41,473
Ah!

334
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,873
This one's all mine, fellas.

335
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:13,913
There's so many
of them, I don't

336
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,313
know which one to shoot first.

337
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:16,313
FELLI: Sharnid.

338
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,313
Felli?

339
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:20,313
FELLI: Layfon's coming.

340
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:21,313
Wait, what?

341
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:32,793
It's him.

342
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,233
Restoration.

343
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,473
01.

344
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:38,233
Ah!

345
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,033
That's Zuellni.

346
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,313
I'm back.

347
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:03,113
Ah!

348
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,073
It can't be.

349
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:39,873
Nina?

350
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,993
Layfon!

351
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,953
Nina!

352
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:50,153
Layfon!

353
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:50,953
Nina!

354
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:54,953
Layfon.

355
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:12,393
I've just confirmed
that it's true.

356
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:14,393
Nina Antalk has returned.

357
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:17,873
Really?

358
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,313
She did it.

359
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,833
She brought him back.

360
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:38,273
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

361
00:23:59,913 --> 00:24:01,753
ANNOUNCER: Nina has finally
come back to Zuellni,

362
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,993
but she's unable to tell
her fellow comrades about

363
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:05,513
the fallen one inside her.

364
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,673
Then, just before the upcoming
battle between Zuellni

365
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,913
and Mayeth, Felli is
suddenly kidnapped,

366
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,473
next time "The Night Before
the Intermunicipal Battle"

367
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:15,033
and restoration.
