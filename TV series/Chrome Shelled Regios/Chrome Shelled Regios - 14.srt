You don't want to overdo it.

At the rate you were

Besides, we're just about done.

Subdue its host, and capturing
a fallen one is easy.

254
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,440
And making things even
easier is that it picked

this guy, for some reason.

Baldy here may have some

the skills to back 'em up with.

And that's why he
can't make full use

of the fallen one's gifts.

really none of your business,

Look, don't get me wrong‐‐
what he did wasn't right,

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,840
but he's also a fellow

I will not have you

I refuse.

You let him go, now.

You wouldn't last a second.

I wouldn't get so
cocky if I were you.

Jeez, you really

the floor with you,

295

Yes?

301
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,480
You've been in contact with
Kalian the whole time, right?

302
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,840
I want to speak to him.

00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,880
I hear you.

304
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,200
Did you know things
would turn out like this?

305
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,920
Haia failed to mention the
specifics on just how he was

306
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,080
going to capture the fallen.

307
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,440
But even so, that doesn't mean
he can simply take Dinn away,

308
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,200
so we must come up
with a solution.

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,040
Do you have any suggestions?

310
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Here's one.

311
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,520
Is there not some
way to separate

312
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,880
the fallen one from Dinn?

313
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
Why did that thing choose
him, in the first place?

314
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Do any of us even have a clue?

315
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,440
FELLI: I have an idea.

316
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
Huh?

317
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
The fallen ones
may select the host

318
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,600
they possess based on the
strength of their sentiment.

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,000
Because the fallen ones are
out of control city spirits,

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,760
that sentiment may be the
desire to protect a city.

321
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,680
Does that remind you of anyone?

322
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,160
So this fallen one feels
the same way as Dinn?

323
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,320
We do, too, so why possess him?

324
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,000
Perhaps it's because
Dinn's sentiment

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
had reached its zenith.

326
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
Think about how
he must have felt

327
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,600
when he was defeated by Layfon.

328
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,680
His sense of responsibility,
his dedication to protecting

329
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
the city was crushed.

330
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,280
It was at that moment when
his sentiment was at its peak.

331
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,480
This fallen one and Dinn
have a great deal in common,

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,360
don't they?

333
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Seems both of them
are bitter at the loss

334
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
of their sense of purpose.

335
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,280
You're right.

336
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,760
But at this point,
how in the hell

337
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,040
are we supposed
to separate them?

338
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,520
We've only one choice.

339
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
Somehow we have to break
Dinn's spirit once again.

340
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,320
SHARNID: We can arrange that.

341
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,480
Just leave it to us, OK?

342
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,800
Wait, you two?

343
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
But‐‐ can you do it?

344
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Somebody has to, right?

345
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
Why don't you use
a proper blade, bub?

346
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,880
That's supposed to be
your specialty, isn't it?

347
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,920
Let's just call
it a trade‐off.

348
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
You're a total idiot.

349
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
You've got weapons and
techniques available,

350
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
but you mock the art of battle
by refusing to use them.

351
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,360
It's a choice I've made, Haia.

352
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,400
It's all part of
following my convictions.

353
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,640
Someone who fights for no
one's benefit but their own

354
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,560
wouldn't understand, so why
am I even wasting my time?

355
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,840
I've had enough of your crap.

356
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,760
Aw, dammit.

357
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
Where could they have taken him?

358
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600

Hey there.

372
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,040
Dinn‐‐ Dinn, it's OK.

373
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,440
It's over now.

374
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Look, the 10th Platoon‐‐

375
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,520
there's no need for it anymore.

376
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
There are other people who have
the same commitment to Zuellni

377
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,320
that we do.

378
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,760
We can leave it to
them, and in that way

379
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,800
the promise we made
still won't be broken.

380
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
OK?

381
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,360
You've done
everything you could.

382
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,000
The 10th Platoon is finished.

I had so much love for you.

387

But like our platoon,
it's gone, too.

more about Layfon's past.
