Keep me apprised.

175

There's a limit to how
much we can rely on one man.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,480
We have to assemble
our platoons,

177
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,640
and tell everyone the truth.

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,280
That's going to cause a panic.

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,360
I don't think so.

00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560

Exactly what I've
been told to do.

That's easier said than done.

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,360
An electronic spirit‐‐

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,160
I get it.

262
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
If that's what was
stolen, then this

263
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,000
is all starting to make sense.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,360
The reason why this
city's on edge.

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,680
Why its legs have
stopped moving.

266
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
Maybe it's time to
do whatever I want.

267
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,680
What's with the mask?

You can.

This bird is‐‐ an

That's right.

Well, I guess the

Blade couldn't handle it alone.

292
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
Even if that is the

293
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,320
unable to beat him yourself.

294

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,640

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
It's painful, isn't it?

297
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,640
Yeah, it is.

Thanks to your tranquilizer gun.

299
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,160
You didn't leave me with
much of a choice, Layofn.

300
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,520
You hurt your
shoulder by fighting,

301
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,800
and you're still recovering
from your back operation‐‐

302
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,320
so I couldn't allow you
to do anything physical.

303
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
Up till now you've
told me to fight.

304
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,520
Now you're telling me not to?

305
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,040
That's because in the
past it's been necessary.

306
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,200
More contaminoids
are only hours away,

307
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
and until then you must rest.

308
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,520
Look, there's no way I
can do that right now.

309
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
Why not?

310
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
Because laying around
here doing nothing

311
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,840
would be unforgivable,
you bastard!

312
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
And why is that?

313
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,720
Who is it that
wouldn't forgive you?

314
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
What do you mean?

315
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,280
You're staying.

316
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,320
And you do know what I mean,
and who I'm talking about.

317
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,600
You're not considering
this city's condition,

318
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,920
nor are you concerned
about the contaminoids,

319
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,360
or that you must be well rested
for the battle against them.

320
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
No!

321
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
That's not true.

322
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,160
There's only one thing on
your mind right now, Layfon.

323
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,440
Instead of Zuellni, it's
Nina Antalk, isn't it?

324
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I can't let you squander your
power on personal matters.

325
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,920
I can only let you
use it for our city.

326
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,560
Zuellni's survival is critical.

327
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,240
More than Nina's ever could be.

328
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,480
He must rest, even if I
have to force him to do so.

329
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
You are all intelligent
and mature man and women,

330
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,440
and I'm sure you've
heard that our city

331
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,680
is facing a grave danger.

332
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,120
In a few hours, Zuellni will
be surrounded by contaminoids.

333
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,840
However, it is far too
soon to abandon hope.

334
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,640
Our platoon class
military artists

335
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,400
have already been apprised
of our current situation.

336
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,840
They do not consider it
to be one of despair.

337
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,160
Rather, they have pledged to
face this difficulty head on!

338
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,200
They are courageously putting
their lives on the line.

339
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Not just for Zuellni, but also
for each and every one of you

340
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
who calls it home.

341
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,200
So, will you see them off with
looks of anguish on your faces?

342
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,320
I've heard it said before
that great orators never

343
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,120
die pretty deaths, Kalian.

344
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,480
You're just too good.

345
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Or will it be with
expressions of faith

346
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,840
that they will save our city?

347
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,240
[APPLAUSE]

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Felli?

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,560
Kalian and the
doctors have told

350
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,800
me that I'm forbidden from using
Nen‐I until I'm fully rested.

351
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,480
Sounds familiar.

352
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,000
But if you need me to do it,
I can send out Nen‐I for you

353
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,160
without using my terminal.

354
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,400
And if you wish, I can even
count the number of scales

355
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,560
on each contaminoid out there.

356
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,040
If you want me to do
this, I'll be happy to.

357
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,000
What shall I do?

358
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,400
Absolutely nothing at all.

359
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
But Fon Fon‐‐

360
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,640
[THEME MUSIC]

361
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,560
NARRATOR: Leerin and
Nina have finally

362
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
met in the academic city Maya.

363
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,920
As a result of the contaminoids,
the fallen one inside Nina

364
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,360
once again manifests.

365
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,280
Meanwhile in Zuellni,
a Kae‐Ra blast

366
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,320
is prepared to stop
the contaminoids.

367
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,920
Next time, A Guided Encounter.

368
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,680
And restoration.
