You should be watching.

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,160
Help Layfon?

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,240
But he disgraced Gerhard, my
senior back home in Glendan.

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,520
Yes, I know that.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,360
But please‐‐ you're the only
hope I have of reaching him,

Gorneo.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm an outsider here in Zuellni.

No one else would risk
their life to help

me get this blade to him.

I'm begging you!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Cut the crap!

Shante!

Why should Gor have
to risk his life

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,760
to help Layfon, of all people?

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,080
You've got a hell of
a lot of nerve, lady.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,720
Shante‐‐ look, even if I
agreed to, it would be no use.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,240
Since coming as
Zuellni, Layfon's only

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
used double edged blades.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
Double edged?

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,200
No single edged blades at all?

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,240
That's right.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,080
That idiot!

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,560
Layfon‐‐ why does he always
have to act like this?

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,600
Out of regret, he
stopped doing what

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
he practiced so hard to learn.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Why does he do that?

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,480
He only ever thinks
about other people.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,640
It's our fault that
Layfon did the things

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
he did back in Glendan.

32

If you're going to hate
somebody, hate us instead!

happens to me, but‐‐

me get this sword to Layfon!

Gorneo?

This isn't personal.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,480
I have nothing against you.

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,680
I just want the
power you possess.

How do you plan to take that?

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Well, hurting you a
little should do the trick.

I just want the power

The true form of the
fallen one inside you.

From what I've heard,
you gotta get a little

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,160
rough to make one come out.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,280
If that's what it takes
to obtain its power,

one all to herself.

What's the point of keeping
all that power locked up?

Gor, why are we
doing this for Layfon?

You've always told me how
much you hated that guy.

118

I still do.

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,680
But he's the only one who
could possibly save Zuellni,

120
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,640
and if we don't help him, it
could very well be destroyed.

Better that than us
having to help that jerk.

I can't let that happen.

Why not?

Do you remember what you
asked me before, Shante?

125

About which side I
would take if Zuellni

126
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
and Glendan ever fought?

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Yeah.

128
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
I'd side with Zuellni.

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,600
And that's because that's
where you are, Shante.

Huh?

So that's why I'm doing this.

To help Layfon.

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
You understand?

Layfon's not in the
direction of the contaminoids.

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,480
Well, I've got to admit,
that was kind of fun.

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,000
But without your Heaven's Blade,
you just can't cut it anymore.

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,760
Besides, my real target
is the contaminoids‐‐

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
so what say we end this?

Yeah.

147
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
Somehow.

148
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,200
FELLI: Don't worry.

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Gorneo's on his way.

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,880
He'll be there soon.

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240

will be arriving shortly.

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,840
I have to give you a
DITE from my father.

Your father?

159
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,240
That's the real reason
I came to Zuellni.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,880
To give you the Saiharden
blade he prepared for you.

161
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Leerin‐‐ thank you,
but I can't accept it.

162
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
LEERIN: Why not?

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,760
My father already forgave
you a long time ago.

164
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,400
Telling you that was the other
reason I came to Zuellni.

165
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,920
I always planned on
giving you the DITE,

166
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,400
but with all that's
happened, I regret

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
not giving it to you sooner.

168

That's why I came all this way.

No one truly lives
alone, Fon Fon.

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Inevitably we all fight for
and alongside someone else.

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
Doing so makes our
hearts intertwine,

174
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,640
letting us grow stronger.

Don't get discouraged.

got to get back up again.

VANZE: Since that

it has a speed advantage.

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,280
Dainsleif is Ignatius'
emissary, and it

327
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,720
was delivered from
the zero realm

328
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,080
to destroy the
world of the regios.

329
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,560
Dickserio?

330
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,760
But as long as we're still
fighting in this world,

331
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,040
those guys will never
truly be defeated.

332
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,120
And that means that this
was only the beginning.

333
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,880
See ya.

334
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,280
Look!

335
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
Glendan's moving away.

336
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,240
LINTENS: I'm taking
the Heaven's Blade.

337
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,760
You have no complains?

338
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
No.

339
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
And what of Savalis?

340
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,040
He's disappeared,
leaving only his weapon.

341
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,000
But he'll be back soon.

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,920
We also recovered Leerin.

343
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,720
Oh.

344
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,000
You did, huh?

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Thanks a lot, Lintens.

346
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,320
Do you have anything
to relay to her?

347
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,920
Uh‐‐ no.

348
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,440
Not especially.

349
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,840
I see.

350
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,240
Goodbye.

351
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm happy she's OK, Fon Fon.

352
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,080
Huh?

353
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,200
It's too bad Leerin
probably won't see you again.

354
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,320
Alive, at least.

355
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,240
What?

356
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,000
After seeing how lovey dovey
you got with her back there,

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,800
I'm going to kill you, Fon Fon!

358

[SCREAMING]

359
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,760
Your majesty, why go to such
lengths to protect this girl?

360
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,680
If things had
been different, she

361
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,920
could have been my daughter.

362
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,560
It seems that the
winds of fate went

363
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,480
awry in this particular case.

364
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,160
She was born to the woman
my fiance ran away with.

365
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,560
Ah.
To the house of Utenol.

366
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,760
I wanted Leerin and to live
the life of a normal girl,

367
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,480
if possible.

368
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,920
But as destiny would have it,
she chose this path on her own.

369
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,200
The same way Layfon did.

370
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,560
You saw that
contaminoid, didn't you?

371
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,520
It was not of this world.

372
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,280
She holds the key
to fighting them.

373
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,880
Curiously enough, it's
tucked away in her right eye.

374
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,680
For now, just rest,
my dear Leerin.

375
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
LAYFON: We live in a world of
mobile cities, called regios.

376
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,240
Sometimes this world
is far from peaceful,

377
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,400
and it often comes with
plenty of hardships.

378
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,560
But the one thing we
can't do is run away.

379
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,040
That's why I'm
staying in Zuellni,

380
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,600
and protecting this world.

381
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Alongside my friends.
