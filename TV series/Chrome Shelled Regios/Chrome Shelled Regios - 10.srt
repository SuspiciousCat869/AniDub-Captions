00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Close off the arena right away
and restrain Layfon at once.

171
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,920
Hey.

172
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,400
What's going on?

173
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,240
What the hell?

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,520
LAYFON: There are rules
for military artists

175
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,360
and Nen‐I operators.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Normal humans can't be
reminded we're a threat.

177
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,560
That's what her majesty
said before I was expelled.

178
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,320
FELLI: Does Gorneo
know about all this?

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
No, he doesn't.

180
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,360
He knows I was in the
underground tournaments,

181
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
and he knows I gave his
senior, Gahard, wounds

182
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,320
that will never fully heal.

183
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,240
That's about it.

184
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,440
And I imagine that's
all he cares to know.

You're an idiot.

Please, Felli.

That hurts really bad.

I mean it, Fon‐Fon.

No.

That hurt.

NINA (VOICEOVER): Layfon.

197

FELLI: It could be.

I'm picking up underground
readings of what

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
could certainly be bodies.

the real deal, huh?

Doesn't that take the cake.

NINA: All these graves.

208
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,480
There's no way they could
collect all the bodies

209
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
and bury them.

210
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,360
Not while being attacked
by Contaminoids.

211
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
It just doesn't seem possible.

SHANTE: Well, if not
them, who the heck did it?

Beats me.

over to point D3.

Hey, is something wrong?

up bioactivity just

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
southwest of here.

What?

219
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,840
It's the same thing
I felt above ground.

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,760
What the?

235
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,040
You're a being of
this realm, are you not?

236
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,720
I can't move.

237
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,760
Tell your people my body is
weak and has fallen to dust.

238
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
It can no longer serve
its intended purpose.

239
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,080
My blackened spirit
and furious hatred

240
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,000
propels me forward to transform
into the fire of change.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,160
Now I seek a new lord.

242
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,280
I yearn to be cleansed
from the inside and reborn

243
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
with a new sense of purpose.

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,080
Come to me, you who
desires the flame.

245
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Join me, and I will become
the blade that sweeps aside

Ignacius' filth and
devours your enemies,

leaving behind nothing
but a smoking pile of ash.

You tell them clearly.

You are responsible for
becoming your own worst enemy.

252

I am nothing more than a tool,
and as such, I am no one.

that which is nothing.

You're white as a ghost.

I need you to return
to the surface.

What?

287
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
The unknown life form
that Felli detected

288
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
and those mass graves
we saw earlier,

289
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,320
we still don't know
anything about them.

290
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,120
You have to get out.

It's not safe.

You're telling me
to abandon Felli?

293

That's not what I'm saying.

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,600
But if you don't get out
of here while you can,

295
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,520
there's a chance
all of us will die.

Do whatever it takes
to survive, right?

Yes.

299
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,480
You need to go while
you still have time.

Even if you make
it to the surface,

301

there's no guarantee
you're gonna be safe.

think he's cool.

The cerneum fuel repository.

It looks like the
flow is still active.

That's what I thought.

This is cerneum.
