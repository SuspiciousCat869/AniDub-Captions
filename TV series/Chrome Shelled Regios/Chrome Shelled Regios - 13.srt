00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,720
And as for Layfon,
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,280
can he never come
back here again?

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,240
Leerin.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm terribly sorry, My Queen.

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,920
No, please, it's
fine, because there's

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
simply no question in my mind
that for him, this is home.

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
I understand that he is
an extremely important

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,400
person to you as well.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,320
Yes.

QUEEN ALSHEYRA:
It's not impossible

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
for him to be allowed
to return here, however

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
it would take some time.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
Then it's‐‐

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,720
That said, even if something
like this were possible,

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,160
are you certain that he
would want to come back here?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,280
The way I see it, that is
a major problem that must

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,000
be addressed and not by me.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,400
You, Saiharden, your kind tends
to leave our city, don't they?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
Yes.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,120
A large number of
our citizens left

21

to follow the first
generation Salinban,

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,680
and many were disciples
of the Saiharden

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,480
two generations before.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Even your own brother
joined with those

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,120

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,520
Riyuho Gaju, a man whose
skills far exceeded my own.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,400
By all rights, he should
have been the successor

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,240
to Saiharden family name.

30

QUEEN ALSHEYRA: He's dead.

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
No, it can't be!

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,720
QUEEN ALSHEYRA: He fought
against the contaminoids,

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
after which he was
unable to cleanse

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,760
the horrible contamination
that remained within.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
Is that so?

Because your friend is a
member of the Saiharden line,

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,080
it simply cannot be denied
that leaving our city

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,160
is a part of his nature.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,920
You should resign
yourself to that fact.

Being unable to
hide your presence

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,880
is bad news for a shooter.

52

Maybe you should try stalking
a guy you have a crush on.

Trust me, it'll be
good practice for you.

Uh, I couldn't do that.

what is this about?

You're correct, bub.

What exactly are
you doing here?

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,280
I sincerely doubt that
you were asked to instruct

Unfortunately, I'm not
here to ply my wares.

But I did come a
hell of a long way.

See, I need to ask
for your assistance.

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
You're from a noble
Glendon family.

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
So I suppose it wouldn't be
that strange if you knew.

72

I'm speaking, of course, of the

I'm assuming you do know.

Hey, how come?

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,240
That's not fair!

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
There's no reason
to keep secrets.

You're saying they really exist?

But, yes, they do.

In fact, there was one

I checked it out myself
but couldn't find anything.

for it out here.

What are the fallen ones?

95
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
If you want to get
all fancy about it, when

96
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,320
a regios is destroyed,
they're the destructive power

97

that remains.

98

But to put it more
accurately, they're

Tell Sharnid we'll make good on
that promise, even without him.

323
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
So has there
been any progress?

324
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
No, nothing yet.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
(SIGHING) I guess they
won't show their true colors

326
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,240
quite so easily, will they?

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
NINA: Naruki, wait!

328
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Hold on!

329
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,320
(PANTING) I'm sorry,
but I talked to Dinn.

330
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,160
I wanted to take care of it
myself, the way I saw fit.

331
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Try to understand.

332
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,280
(IMPATIENT SIGH)
What were you thinking?

333
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
The way you saw fit?

334
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
Just what does that have
to do with anything?

335
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,080
All you did is tip them off
and give them enough info

336
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,920
to get away with it!

337
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,760
Listen to me.

338
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,720
I had to meet with Dinn.

339
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,200
I had no other choice, I swear.

340
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,000
You see, he and I have some
history between our platoons.

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
Wait, what do
you mean history?

342
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,640
This is about
Sharnid, isn't it?

343
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,520
It happened way before I'd
ever formed the 17th platoon.

344
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,160
Back then I was assigned to
a completely different unit.

345
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,840
From their first battle,
Dinn's group was special.

346
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,280
They were young, but they
dominated the upperclassmen.

347
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,040
They were so powerful.

348
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,600
To us, they
symbolized a new era.

349
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,800
They were unstoppable.

350
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,680
Then, one day, out
of nowhere, Sharnid

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
left the platoon in the
middle of a big tournament.

352
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
That broke up the trio that
had sustained the platoon,

353
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
and it fell apart.

354
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,600
Dinn was absolutely
furious, so furious,

355
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,360
in fact, that he challenged
Sharnid to a duel.

356
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
But he didn't defend himself.

357
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
Sharnid just took it.

358
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
He didn't even fight back.

359
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,360
Jeez.

360
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,160
I don't know.

361
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,120
Aw, come on now, ladies.

362
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,880
What's the worst
that could happen?

363
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,200
[LAUGHTER]

364
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,360
NINA: Not too long after, I went
to Sharnid with a proposition.

365
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,680
I was starting a platoon,
and I wanted him to join me.

366
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,520
In Dinn's mind,
it's as if I stole

367
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,560
Sharnid from the 10th platoon.

368
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah, but that's not
what happened, is it?

369
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,240
No, he'd already quit
when I approached him,

370
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,720
but they don't see it that way.

371
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
And now the 17th
platoon is the strongest

372
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,480
it's been since I started it.

373
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,880
We're strong enough to be
a major threat to the 10th.

374
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,320
[YAWNING]

375
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,520
Dinn's history
notwithstanding, you know I

376
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,320
have to report this to my boss?

377
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,120
Yeah, I know.

378
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
Hey!

379
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Guys, I ran into Felli just now.

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,000
She's not gonna make it today.

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
What's up?

382
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
Hm?

383
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
Oh, just wanted to
say, don't try so hard.

384
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,720
What do you mean?

385
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
Listen, about Dinn,
if the municipal cops

386
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,320
are showing up in person,
it means that they're close.

387
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,720
And unless I'm
completely off here,

388
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
I'd say they're zeroing
in on their target.

389
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,400
You knew about this?

390
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,320
But how?

391
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,080
Hey, nobody knows
what the 10th platoon

392
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,280
is capable of better
than me, do they?

393
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Now, I'm no detective,
but a person's K doesn't

394
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,080
just suddenly increase, right?

395
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,520
[SIGH]

396
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,240
(SIGH) The upperclassmen
will probably denounce

397
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,040
the military arts department.

398
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,400
Vanze could even lose his job.

399
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
They'll have to get rid
of him in order to make

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,720
the student federation happy.

401
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,520
The competition looks
pretty bad for us.

402
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,480
LAYFON: What about Zuellni?

403
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,400
If they graduate before it
happens, then who cares, right?

404
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,160
With things like this,
there's only one person

405
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,000
we can go to for sound advice.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm talking about our
student council president.

407
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,760
Are you sure we
should do that?

408
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,840
It can't be helped.

409
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,560
I mean, what other
choice do we have now,

410
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,680
since they decided to
take things this far?

411
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,320
Yes, I understand.

412
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,280
And what exactly would
you like for me to do?

413
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,560
Mr. President, I'm sure
you don't want there to be

414
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,600
commotion any more than we do.

415
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
We'd like you to deal
with it privately.

416
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,840
Well, dealing with it
privately is relatively simple.

417
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,760
All I have to do is
convince the chief of police

418
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,680
to close the investigation.

419
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,440
Mr. President,
that isn't going to‐‐

420
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,880
Of course, that alone
won't be enough, will it?

421
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,640
This will require your
participation, too.

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,760
What would you have us do?

423
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
You face the 10th
platoon in competition

424
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,600
very soon, don't you?

425
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,760
Wait a second, you
want us to destroy them?

426
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,160
Oh, no, I don't want
you to take it that far.

427
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,520
I just want you to render
them incapable of remaining

428
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,480
a platoon.

429
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
And if that were
to happen, I could

430
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,560
use my absolute
authority to order

431
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
them to disband immediately.

432
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
NINA: That would rob them
of their sense of purpose.

433
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
Well, better that than robbing
the students of their own city.

434
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,240
So Layfon, can you do it?

435
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,040
Hm?

436
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,640
Come on, if you can't,
then just say so, all right?

437
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,560
He can do it!

438
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
It's him!

439
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,640
What makes you so sure he can?

440
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,520
Tell me, Haia.

441
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,560
Because people trained
in the Saiharden style

442
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,160
have that kind of technique.

443
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,280
Stabbing someone with
a needle of ballistic K

444
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,120
makes it easy to heal
or break someone, even

445
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
for a guy like him,
who's a former keeper

446
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,400
of the heaven's blade.

447
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,120
But still, Saiharden
techniques only

448
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,760
work with a single‐edged blade.

449
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,040
They're impossible with
a dual‐edged sword.

450
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Put converse, though,
with a single‐edged blade

451
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,280
it is possible for him, yes?

452
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,600
Sir, this one's the
leader of the Salinban

453
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,560
Mercenary Training Group.

454
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,200
But many of us suspect he's
also involved with the overload

455
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,240
smuggling ring.

456
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,920
That's what you yahoos
are doing here, am I right?

457
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,240
Isn't that precisely why you
came up here today, to get

458
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,040
together and cover it up?

459
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
Stop it!

460
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,800
Fon‐Fon!

461
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Next time won't be so easy.

462
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,120
That's fine by me.

463
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
But I won't let you
use the Saiharden

464
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,800
name if you can't even
master a single‐edged blade.

465
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,920
Enough, you two.

466
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,280
Haia, listen, the only
reason that I called you here

467
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
is because you said you
had words for Layfon,

468
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
and not to allow
you both to fight.

469
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,720
Wait, what words?

470
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,520
It's the fallen ones.

471
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,600
You must have seen one in that
ruined city you went into.

472
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,080
They're unlike anything
you would have seen before.

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
They're mysterious and power.

474
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,800
Trust me, you don't
want that thing coming

475
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,520
anywhere near here,
which is exactly

476
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,097
why I'm going to capture it

477
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,040
Hey, what's the
matter, Naruki?

478
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,560
Oh, sorry about that.
