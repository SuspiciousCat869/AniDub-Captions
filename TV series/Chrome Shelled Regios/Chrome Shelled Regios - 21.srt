Two warriors, both experts
in the Saiharden sword style.

As fellow students,
they can read

each other's attack patterns.

this fight even have?

Tell me!

An elite like you could
never begin to understand!

What the hell are
you talking about?

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,720
I've never thought of
myself as an elite.

203
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,760
That's exactly
what makes you one.

204
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,120
You became a Blade like
it was no big deal, then

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,240
threw it all away
without hesitation.

206
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Your Heaven's Blade, and your
Saiharden blade were given up.

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,360
But guess what?

208
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm a successor to the
Saiharden style, too!

209
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm Ryuho's pupil!

210
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
Who cares about that?

211
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,120
If you think that gives you
the right to abduct Felli,

212
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,360
then you've got
another thing coming!

213

What are you doing?

214
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Wait, I know that stance.

This battle's just
getting started, bub!

218
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,840
Why can't I read his K flow?

219
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,240
Don't assume this will go
the same way as last time.

220
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,080
Stay put!

221
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,360
A single edged technique
with a regular sword?

222
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,840
You should know better.

Come and get some!

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,760
Haia's using a
technique he picked up

225
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,720
through countless
battles with the Salinban

226
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,000
mercenary training group.

227
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
It doesn't come from
the Saiharden style.

read his K flow‐‐

Fon Fon, you're hurt.

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
So you're worried
about your comrade,

243
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,120
even at a time like this?

244
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,320
I'll give you this much,
you're an admirable guy.

245
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,040
But it's different with me,
because yours truly has nobody

246
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
at all he needs to protect.

No home to return to.

This is all there is.

249

All that I've been left
with is a single sword.

250
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,840
But with this sword I will
bring honor to my way of life,

251
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,000
and glory to the
things I've done.

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,920
I'll prove my days with
this group weren't in vain.

training‐‐ there's

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
no way in hell it's
inferior to Dirk's, and I'm

258
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,240
going to prove it right now!

259
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,280
You see, he'd
always hated Ryuho.

260
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,680
It bothered him that he'd left
Dirk to inherit the style.

261
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,840
That Dirk was the one who
had the privilege of carrying

262
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,920
on the Saiharden line.

263
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
That's why we're fighting.

264
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,880
So Dirk's disciple has become
a keeper of the Heaven's Blade?

265
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,000
Layfon Alseif, huh?

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,320
It's a good name.

267
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,480
HAIA: When he learned Dirk's
disciple was made a Heaven's

268
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
Blade, he was thrilled.

269
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,680
He was overcome with
joy, like he was

270
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,320
truly happy for the first time.

271
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Don't you see how
unacceptable that is?

272
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,040
You were never supposed
to relieve Ryuho's burden.

273
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,240
Nor are you the one who should
have made my father smile.

274
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,000
Nobody should have done
that but yours truly, bub!

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,280
Haia, please‐‐ don't do this.

276
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,400
And that's why I
have to fight you.

277
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
Don't you understand?

278
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
Defeating you now is
the only thing that

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,640
can answer my father's wishes.

280
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,280
So stand up, Layfon Alseif.

Now that you're just
a military artist,

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,800
I'll strike you down and prove
Ryuho's power once and for all!

You're good with this, right?

No, she can't be‐‐

331
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,000

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Huh.

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
What do you know?

Disregarding the students
thrown into confusion,

345
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,720
Zuellni begins heading
towards Glendan.
