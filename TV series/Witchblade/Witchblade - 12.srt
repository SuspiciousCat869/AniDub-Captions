1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,541
Long sought
by the greed of men

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,416
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,166
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,625
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,666
Righteous Sword of God,
or Hand of the Devil himself?

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,250
A new Bearer finds out,

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,416
seeking balance
between ecstasy and ruin.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,208
[Music]

9
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,083
Man, how the crap did she
let herself get captured?

10
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,958
This can't be good.

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,750
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

12
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,916
Listen up, everyone,
Chief Nishida's on her way!

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,750
She's ordered us
to administer first aid

14
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,708
and make sure
the subject is restrained!

15
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,458
You boys wait in the van.

16
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,583
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,000
That was a rather bold move
they made.

18
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,125
I hope Masane's all right.

19
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
I mean, what if they try
to cut off her arm

20
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,291
just to get at the Witchblade?

21
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,000
I can only hope
they try something so foolish.

22
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,250
Any attempt to remove
the Witchblade,

23
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,541
and its defensive instincts
will take care of them.

24
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,666
I see.

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

26
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,625
The Witchblade, you say?

27
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,916
How interesting.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,958
I understand.

29
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,750
I'll call again soon.

30
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,625
Takayama's luck
may have finally run out.

31
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,708
What did they say, sir?

32
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,625
Did something happen?

33
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,916
Evidently someone has stolen
the Witchblade from him.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,125
Takayama.

35
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,458
What a stunning failure.

36
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
'Course it can't be that easy.

37
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,208
What're you doin'?

38
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,041
Only top level scientists

39
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,708
are allowed
through those doors, kid.

40
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,958
You should've known that.

41
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,041
Yeah.

42
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,208
I'm new.
Sorry 'bout that.

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,083
So hey,
what's goin' on in there,

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,625
like top secret stuff?

45
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,166
Nah, I doubt it.

46
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,958
It's some kinda
medical research lab

47
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,750
where they do complicated
surgeries and other crap.

48
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,541
A medical research lab?

49
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,500
For cryin' out loud.

50
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,625
Don't they teach you guys this
stuff at orientation anymore?

51
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,458
Hey, wait up!

52
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,500
You're takin' that trash down

53
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,000
to the collection facility,
right?

54
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,583
So how about
I give you a hand?

55
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,916
Is that cool?

56
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,375
Grandfather!

57
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,916
Ah, Maria.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,125
I came to see you!

59
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,416
That make you happy?

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,791
Yes, it does.

61
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,875
It's been a while, dear.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,250
Nishida's here, sir,
but she went straight to the lab

63
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
to see the Witchblade.

64
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,166
She's hasn't
changed at all, has she?

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,250
She said she would
come by later to say hello.

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,083
Tell her it's quite all right.

67
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,000
Once I've finished
my duties for the day,

68
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,625
I'll go down
to the lab myself.

69
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,125
That way, Nishida can--

70
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,125
I came all this way
to see you

71
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,833
and you won't stop
talking about Nishida!

72
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,458
Please stop, Maria.

73
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,916
Nora and I have
important business to discuss.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,916
Whatever!

75
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,541
I would appreciate it
if you would try to be

76
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,000
a little more reasonable,
my child.

77
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,583
You are putting
your incredible IQ to shame.

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,083
So why don't you just tell me
you don't like me?

79
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,375
You know that's not true.

80
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,708
Nora.

81
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
Why don't you
take Maria somewhere

82
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,375
that would help
lighten her spirits?

83
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,458
Yes, sir.

84
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,333
No! Let me go!

85
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,791
Stupid Nora!

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,916
Where's the host body?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,583
This is her?

88
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,375
She's rather unremarkable.

89
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,625
She's seriously injured
and her recovery

90
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,083
has been much slower
than that of the Neo-Genes'.

91
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,500
We need to treat her, ma'am.

92
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,333
Take samples from the Witchblade
and from the host body.

93
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,958
Then analyze
the gauntlet itself.

94
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,666
I've  got all the data
I need for now.

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,541
Riko.

96
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,125
Okay, Miss Rihoko,
time to take your temperature.

97
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,458
Was there somebody
in my room before?

98
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,833
I had this weird feeling like
someone was watching over me.

99
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,375
Could it have
been your mother?

100
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,708
Don't think so.

101
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,416
I'm pretty sure my mom
went home last night.

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,333
Maybe so, she did disappear
during your checkup.

103
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,875
But if she was going home,
don't you think

104
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,750
she would've
come in here and told you?

105
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,083
Well no, not necessarily.

106
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
Maybe it was her work.

107
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,250
Sometimes
she just has to leave.

108
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,625
Really?

109
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,166
Does her work
keep her that busy?

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,708
My mom's been working
really hard every day,

111
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,833
ever since we moved here.

112
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,750
But you know,
I need to hurry and get better.

113
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,208
Oh yeah?

114
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,416
Yeah, 'cause my mom
doesn't know how to cook at all!

115
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,166
This one.

116
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,208
This one.

117
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,958
And...

118
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,708
Look! This one's cute!
You want it?

119
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,083
C'mon, Mom!

120
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,166
How many times
do I have to tell you

121
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,166
I'm not a kid anymore!

122
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,541
Well, you'll always
be a kid in my eyes!

123
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,916
Mom.

124
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,708
Thank you.

125
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,666
You can take us
back to the hotel.

126
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,000
We're done shopping.

127
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,125
No, we're not!

128
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,333
I didn't even get
any stuffed animals!

129
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,666
I believe you've been taught
that creating a scene in public,

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,125
as you just did,
is unacceptable.

131
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,666
But she took it
right out of my hands!

132
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,208
What was I supposed to do?

133
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,666
You weren't gonna help me!

134
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,583
I'll inform Nishida
you're not ready

135
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,166
to visit the outside world yet.

136
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,583
I'd be more careful
if I were you, little girl.

137
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,000
Or I might lose
the ability to restrain myself.

138
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,500
I hate you!

139
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,416
Go ahead, driver.

140
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,000
I hope you die.

141
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:16,500
Getting Masane back is not
going to be an easy task, is it?

142
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,708
It's not like we can go
barging into NSWF Headquarters.

143
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,583
With any luck,
they'll come to their senses

144
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,916
and quietly hand her
over to us.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,875
That would be
the best case scenario.

146
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,500
Director Takayama's office.

147
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Ah, Director Wado.

148
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,791
Has Takayama made it back in?

149
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,125
He's away
from his desk right--

150
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,333
He must be having a hard time
sleeping lately.

151
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,041
What with the Witchblade's
recent theft.

152
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,125
I understand now
why he could never give

153
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,500
any clear information
regarding the Witchblade.

154
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,208
To think,
it was because he'd lost it.

155
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,291
With all due respect,
that's not really wha--

156
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,166
This is a huge failure
for us, Segawa.

157
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm calling an emergency
board meeting immediately.

158
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,583
Pass the word on to Takayama,
will you?

159
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,083
Now how on Earth
did Wado discover

160
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,750
the Witchblade had been stolen?

161
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,958
And this "emergency board
meeting" does not bode well.

162
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,166
Do you have a plan?

163
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,041
Give this to the lab.

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,833
Sir, are you sure about this?

165
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,958
Taking back the Witchblade
is our top priority.

166
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,541
This is the end of the line,
Takayama.

167
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
Oh, man!

168
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,083
I feel like such a jerk

169
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,208
for not bein' here with you,
Miss Rihoko.

170
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,000
I've been so worried.

171
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,583
Actually, the doctor said
it's nothing serious.

172
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,041
I go home tomorrow.

173
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,250
Really?

174
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,666
Here's a lovely bouquet
from yours truly.

175
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,125
And this is from Mari.

176
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,500
She's pretty worried
about you too, kiddo.

177
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, and a get-well charm.

178
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,333
From Naomi.

179
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,416
Thanks a lot!

180
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,958
So tell me, where's Melony?

181
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,250
Oh, she's at work.

182
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,791
Yeah?

183
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,750
You must be feeling lonely,
Rihoko!

184
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,375
I've been doing okay!

185
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,625
Mr. Cho?

186
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,125
I was wondering.

187
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,958
Did you see my mom
come home last night?

188
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,666
Didn't see her.

189
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,083
Musta pulled an all-nighter.

190
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,916
That's gotta be rough
at a time like this.

191
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,166
Careful, Mom.

192
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't push yourself too hard.

193
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,166
How are things coming along?

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Forgive me for not coming up
to say hello to you, Father.

195
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,458
That's quite all right,
Nishida.

196
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,583
This must be
the Witchblade's latest host.

197
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,875
Yes.

198
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,000
I've taken samples

199
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,458
to determine
her level of assimilation.

200
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,916
Apparently,
she has no memory

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,833
of anything before
the Great Quake.

202
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,250
And she has a daughter.

203
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,625
Up until earlier this year,
she's been living

204
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,958
in a half-way house.

205
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,166
How pedestrian.

206
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,833
She shows no signs of being
a suitable bearer.

207
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,250
Why would it choose
someone like her?

208
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,083
Doctor?

209
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,041
Father.

210
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,750
The results from
the assimilation tests are in.

211
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,583
Aside from the obvious fact
that they're conforming

212
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,166
at a rapid pace--

213
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,666
What is it?

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,000
We ran an update on all
of our sample comparison data.

215
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,875
And Reina's numbers
have dropped significantly.

216
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,916
I was under the impression

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,333
her numbers
were exceptionally high?

218
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,291
I'm afraid
that's no longer the case.

219
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,708
What does that mean?

220
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,625
Something must have happened
in the last six years

221
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,291
to cause this change.

222
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,708
At present, Reina
is completely incompatible

223
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,000
with the Witchblade.

224
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,625
Very well.

225
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,125
I hate to admit it,

226
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,958
but I have started to lose hope
in Reina as of late.

227
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,291
And now that I've seen
the woman it chose,

228
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,458
it's obvious to me
the Witchblade is not perfect.

229
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,708
You're right.

230
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,833
I'm rather disappointed
with it myself.

231
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,750
The blade
currently in development

232
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,000
will far surpass
the original.

233
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,375
I have high hopes
for the future.

234
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,875
We will complete
this new blade.

235
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,916
And the perfect
Neo-Gene specimen

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
will be the one chosen
to wield it.

237
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,625
Once that has come to pass,

238
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,125
I will have obtained
the ultimate mother.

239
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,708
What?

240
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,583
"Reina is incompatible?"

241
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
What are they talking about?

242
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,541
Bingo!

243
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,000
This is the only way
I'm gonna make it inside.

244
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,750
Well, I guess
I got no other choice.

245
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,500
Crap!

246
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,666
Hey! Don't I know you?

247
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,333
Yes, I thought so.

248
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,708
You're that photographer
Masane hangs around with,

249
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,916
aren't you?

250
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,166
What a small world.

251
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,083
Did you come here
to rescue her, too?

252
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,208
You're Doji guy.

253
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,625
C'mon, you ready?

254
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,958
Hey now! Wait a second!

255
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,625
There's nothing
to be afraid of!

256
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,416
It's not like they ever check
for intruders at this place.

257
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,333
It's the "getting out"
that might be difficult.

258
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,750
What the hell?

259
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,666
And what am I supposed to do
if I can't get out?

260
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,666
Not a problem,
you'll have Masane with you!

261
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,041
You dumbass!

262
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,416
How's she s'posed
ta help me when she's wounded?

263
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,666
You'll be fine, I'm sure.

264
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,875
I'll teach you
the magic words

265
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,875
that'll get her
back on her feet in no time!

266
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,666
Magic words?

267
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,500
Son of a...

268
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,750
Well, that was
unbelievably convenient.

269
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,375
Now, if we fail,
I can blame it on him.

270
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,791
Speaking of,
it's almost time.

271
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,500
Hey, you think
she's gonna be all right?

272
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,833
Chart says she's a DNR.

273
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,541
Poor woman.

274
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,875
So much pain.

275
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,875
Someone, please...

276
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,250
...help me.

277
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,916
Spectacular!

278
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,958
All that's left to do
is analyze this data.

279
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:34,791
And I should be able to upgrade
the Cloneblades substantially!

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,541
Father.

281
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,541
Very soon, our greatest desire
will be achieved.

282
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,208
Yes.

283
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,833
Finally, I have
almost reached your level.

284
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,916
You were perfect
in nearly every way.

285
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,166
But there is one thing for
which you can never be forgiven!

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,875
If only
it could have been different.

287
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,208
Hey, Melony!

288
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,125
Whoa, this is not good.

289
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,666
Tozawa?

290
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
Get it together!

291
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,583
Listen, we're gonna
have to use your power

292
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,333
to get us outta here!

293
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
I can't do it.

294
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,458
I can't move.

295
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,541
Hey!

296
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,958
Rihoko's waiting for you!

297
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,500
We gotta go! C'mon!

298
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,166
Riko.

299
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,041
That's right! Riko!

300
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,416
Riko.

301
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,916
Take care of her.

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,458
Mariko and Mr. Cho
will help you.

303
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,041
Please.

304
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,416
Come on!

305
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,958
Don't quit on me!

306
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,541
Jerk, this isn't funny!

307
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,875
Melony!

308
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,750
There's something
I've gone too long without.

309
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,041
There's somethin' savage
about this one.

310
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,833
Dammit!

311
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,708
"Magic words that'll get her
back on her feet in no time!"

312
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,000
Get up and walk outta here,

313
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,500
and Doji will pay you
10 million yen!

314
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,875
You listenin' to me?

315
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,708
10 million, Melony!

316
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,500
C'mon!

317
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,458
She's conscious!

318
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,208
Riko.

319
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,791
I'll do whatever I have to.

320
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,250
Yes! Now let's book!

321
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,000
Impossible!

322
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,750
A minute ago,
she couldn't even move!

323
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,041
Gotta be a scoop in these!

324
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,000
Father! The Witchblade host
has escaped!

325
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,000
She's what?

326
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
How many broads
they got workin' here?

327
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,375
No way
we're gonna get out now!

328
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,750
That's enough!

329
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,875
Hold your attack!

330
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,708
Any sudden movements,
and we will open fire!

331
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,541
What the hell is all this?

332
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,125
You will release
Masane immediately,

333
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,791
or Mr. Furumizu
will be blown to pieces!

334
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,625
Well, hello, Director Takayama.

335
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,791
It's been a while.

336
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,791
It's not like you to resort
to such violent threats.

337
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,916
You've caught me off-guard.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,833
I thought it best
not to draw this out.

339
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,500
If you had just been this
assertive from the beginning,

340
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,375
my precious sisters
could have avoided injury.

341
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,625
If you had just pretended
not to have the Witchblade

342
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,875
in your possession, I may not
have gotten this chance.

343
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,958
I see.

344
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,708
So what will it be?

345
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,541
Shall we re-enact what happened
six years ago?

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,666
I think I'll pass.

347
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,208
Melony.

348
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:51,250
Ten million. Ten million.

349
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,958
Do it for her.
For Riko.

350
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,625
Hey, it's all good.

351
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,375
So, those magic words.

352
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,041
Told you they'd work.

353
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,958
What I still
don't understand

354
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,208
is how Wado
found out about Masane.

355
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,416
There must be some connection
between Wado and the NSWF.

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,541
Understood.

357
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,666
Is there something wrong,
Director Wado?

358
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,916
What happened?

359
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,833
The emergency board meeting
is canceled!

360
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,333
Damn you, Takayama.

361
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,500
You got lucky.
Very lucky.

362
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,500
Riko!

363
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,833
Mommy!

364
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,291
Oh, Riko!

365
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,083
Mom!

366
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,791
Welcome home from
the hospital, Rihoko!

367
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,583
The Natsuki Building
was a gloomy place

368
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,791
without your smile!

369
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,958
We're so glad
to have you back!

370
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,125
Well, thank you
for coming to visit me!

371
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,333
I just thank heaven
you're okay!

372
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,083
Speaking of heaven,
I noticed the hospital

373
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
was full of hot nurses and...

374
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,708
Hello again, Ms. Amaha.
It's nice to see you.

375
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,083
Hold on!

376
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,625
What's the Child Welfare
Ministry doing here?

377
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,708
I'm sorry to intrude,
but the Ministry

378
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,291
sent me to deliver
this notice to you.

379
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Ms. Amaha, we have
obtained test results

380
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,708
which indicate that Rihoko
is not your biological daughter.

381
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,958
Impossible.

382
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,541
[Music]

383
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,833
No! I don't wanna
leave you, Mom!

384
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,083
I hate that stupid
Child Welfare lady!

385
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,083
Why would she make me leave you,
you're my mom!

386
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,166
Why does she always
wanna separate us!

387
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,541
Let's run away again!

388
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,375
If we ran away, we wouldn't
have to worry anymore.

389
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,291
We could go someplace
far, far away.

390
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,583
A place where
nobody would bother us.

391
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,875
We can build our own house
and live in it!

392
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,208
I already made
the blueprints!

393
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,333
I can't wait to show you!

394
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,708
We're gonna be together
forever.

395
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,833
Aren't we, Mom?
