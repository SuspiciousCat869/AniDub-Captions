1
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,125
So, what do you think?

2
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,416
Were you able to
determine a cause?

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,583
No, it's weird.

4
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,125
There's no evidence
of anything here

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,875
that would cause it
to activate.

6
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,583
You sure it's okay?

7
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,791
I mean, they're military
weapons, right?

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,625
Ah, no worries, mate.

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,208
We'll have Doji check 'em out
when we arrive.

10
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,625
[Music]

11
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,166
They're sayin'
an X-Con's on the run.

12
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,416
So what the hell's
Doji doin' about it?

13
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,958
Who cares, as long as
they don't tell us,

14
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,416
"Good luck, officers,
it's up to you!"

15
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,541
I'm perfectly happy with
"logistical support."

16
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,583
Sounds like the government's
gonna make Doji

17
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,208
take full responsibility.

18
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,541
Gotta get home.

19
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,541
Riko is waiting.

20
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,375
Uh, guys?

21
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,708
Isn't that an X-Con?

22
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,125
Doesn't look like one.

23
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,666
No, it is, I'm sure of it!

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,500
Go call it in!

25
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,541
This is Ginza 303!

26
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,250
We've encountered an X-Con
on Central Street, over!

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,125
Don't move!

28
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,291
Have to get home.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,625
We said freeze!

30
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,750
X-Con!

31
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,583
Whoa!

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
"Still be around,
but you won't see me?"

33
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,916
Man!

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,041
Musta been hard for her
to come up with that one.

35
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,541
But I bet it wasn't as hard
as actually having to tell you.

36
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,500
And you know she only did
'cause she had to.

37
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,833
You do understand why though,
don't you?

38
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,500
So I won't--
So I won't be lonely.

39
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,041
Yeah.

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,583
And also, so you might
learn to smile again soon.

41
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,625
Y'know?

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,291
But I can't lie to ya.
It's gonna be tough.

43
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,041
The Doji Group's attempts
to destroy--

44
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,041
Damn, that looks
awfully close!

45
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,000
Not gettin' any sleep tonight!

46
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,000
Criminy, that company's
doomed now.

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,375
It was always doomed.

48
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,541
But there are reports
that the fleeing X-Con

49
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,416
destroyed a police cruiser.

50
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,916
Its current whereabouts
are unknown.

51
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,875
You have failed me
for the last time, Nishida!

52
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,625
I told you to send more!

53
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,875
Shouting won't help
the situation.

54
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,041
The Witchblade's power levels
are increasing.

55
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,625
And assuming the Witchblade
was the cause of the Null Point

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,666
six years ago,
what we're seeing now

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,541
is barely a fraction
of its true energy.

58
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,416
I don't need
your explanations!

59
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,625
Figure out
what to do about it!

60
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,791
Planning an operation
of this magnitude

61
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,750
is not that simple,

62
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,708
especially if someone
keeps pestering me.

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,708
You arrogant--!

64
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,458
Don't call this number again.

65
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,916
Magnificent!

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,208
Damn that woman!

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,375
Can she not
grasp the situation?

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,833
Director.

69
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,416
Everyone is assembled
and waiting in the boardroom.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
They're expecting
your status report,

71
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,416
and then,
the press conference--

72
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,708
Yes, I know that!

73
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,583
I'm simply giving it
some thought!

74
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,833
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,583
I don't see how thinking
will change the facts--

76
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,000
Be quiet!

77
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,291
Like gum on your shoe.

78
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,458
Please, Masane.

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,416
You have to be all right.

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,791
It's here!

81
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,166
Make a run for it!

82
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,166
W-we have to save Rihoko!

83
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,458
Ri-Rihoko!

84
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,791
Whoa, what's the problem?

85
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,875
There's a monster!

86
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:29,958
It's tryin' to kill us!

87
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,583
By "monster" you mean--?

88
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,916
It's downstairs!

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,708
We can escape out the back!

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,916
Be gone, evil spirit!

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,916
Be gone from this place!

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,666
Are there any blunt objects?

93
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,208
Someone help us!

94
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,041
Oh my god, Melony!

95
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,583
Ri-ko.

96
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,000
Rihoko!
Get back over here!

97
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,166
It's okay!

98
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,583
Hi, Mom.

99
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,708
Welcome home.

100
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,166
Don't do this.

101
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,250
Mom, wake up!

102
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,250
Mommy?

103
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,250
Melony!

104
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,250
Melony!

105
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,375
Mom, say something. Please!

106
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,375
Hey!

107
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,500
Melony!

108
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,583
C'mom!

109
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,583
I can't believe it!

110
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,625
Asagi!

111
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,500
Could you hurry!

112
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,750
I'm tired.

113
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,958
The Witchblade's presence,

114
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,250
It's weakened a bit.

115
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,833
Not enough that I can't
easily tell where it is.

116
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,666
Such immense power.

117
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,041
When I just think
about you having it...

118
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,125
It's almost too wonderful
for words!

119
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,166
Uh-huh.

120
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,958
Oh, I know.

121
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,291
Something to eat.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,541
So you might learn to
smile again soon.

123
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,583
Y'know?

124
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,666
It can't be!

125
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,125
Our Melony...

126
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,541
had that horrible thing
happen to her!

127
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,708
It can't be.

128
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,875
It just can't.

129
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,166
Quit cryin'.

130
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,166
Yeah, but...

131
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,666
No really, stop.

132
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,625
He's right.

133
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,208
Crying isn't gonna
help anything.

134
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,541
They what?

135
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,166
What's the matter, sir?

136
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
It's the I-Weapons.

137
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,541
They've broken out
of the freighter

138
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,291
headed for Baradhi.

139
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,791
What?

140
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,500
The I-Weapons have
begun to move on their own!

141
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,916
They're all headed for Tokyo!

142
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,083
What the hell
am I going to do?

143
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,416
If the I-Weapons actually do
make it into the city, my god.

144
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,625
This is bad!

145
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,791
This is worse
than the X-Con mess!

146
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,541
The lab warned
of a malfunction,

147
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,416
I suppose this is it?

148
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,708
You!

149
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,750
Do something!

150
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,916
You have to stop
the I-Weapons!

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,583
I'm sorry sir, I can't.

152
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,083
What do I do?

153
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,208
What do I do?

154
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,041
No choice.

155
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,375
Takayama!

156
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,125
He knows the I-Weapons best!

157
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
You want me to call Takayama?

158
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,333
He's the only one
who can stop this.

159
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,291
Get him down here at once!

160
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,541
I'll have him reinstated,
whatever it takes!

161
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,333
Ah, yes.

162
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,541
I don't quite know
where he is.

163
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,041
But then,
now that I think of it,

164
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,333
I haven't heard from
the boys in the lab since--

165
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,375
Could they all be--?

166
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,250
I don't care,
just call him!

167
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,791
At this rate,
Doji and I are both ruined!

168
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,833
I don't believe we've reached
that level of disaster yet.

169
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,041
Mom?

170
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,833
Hi, Riko.

171
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,000
How're you feelin'?

172
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,458
I'm making dinner right now!

173
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,083
And I'm cooking
all of your favorite stuff!

174
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,958
Baby, I'm home.

175
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,875
Sorry, hadn't said it yet.

176
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,375
Better go,
the pan's gonna burn!

177
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,791
Sir!

178
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,458
Post-processing
is nearly complete,

179
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,041
but we can't expect
full protection

180
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,125
against the Witchblade's
interference!

181
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,583
Excellent work.

182
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,958
Impressive!

183
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,041
So it was you who stopped
the I-Weapons, sir!

184
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,166
Segawa?

185
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,291
No, please, it's all right.

186
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,875
He's come here
to speak with Takayama.

187
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,791
Greetings, Takayama.

188
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
The I-Weapons on what ship?

189
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,000
This is what you get!

190
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
We told you not to send them!

191
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,541
How could you ignore
the lab's warnings!

192
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,916
It's "worst-case scenario!"

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,041
We're screwed!

194
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,125
Shut up!

195
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,958
None of that matters anymore!

196
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,583
Takayama!

197
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,625
Surely you can--

198
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,458
How many?

199
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,166
Thirty-eight hundred.

200
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,208
Impossible!
We can't stop that!

201
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,083
Then make it possible,
or Doji is finished!

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,666
I'm sorry,
there's just too many.

203
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,750
Notify our contacts
in the government.

204
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,500
Evacuate the coasts.

205
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,833
No!

206
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Why else
would I come to you?

207
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,083
You can end this
before it goes public!

208
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,583
Takayama!

209
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,833
If you pull this off,
your job at Doji is as good as--

210
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,083
We're short on time!

211
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,833
Segawa, you're up.

212
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,833
Can you do what I said?

213
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,041
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,541
If I use Wado's name.

215
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,958
Then hurry!

216
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,375
Yes, sir!

217
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,916
Segawa, you rat!

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,458
Have you been a spy
for Takayama this whole time?

219
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,583
No.

220
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,458
I gave it some thought.

221
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,083
That's just the way the man is.

222
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,791
Takayama!

223
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,166
Think of the old days!

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,916
Just like in college,

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,041
we can row that boat
together again!

226
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,208
The boat known as Doji!

227
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,041
That boat has already sunk.

228
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,750
And, Wado...

229
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,708
you put the holes in it.

230
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,291
So this is all my fault!

231
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,000
Ota, locate the rogue
I-Weapons' signal

232
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,375
and determine their course.

233
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,666
We'll coordinate
our I-Weapons from here!

234
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,041
Everyone,
to your stations!

235
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,083
Yes, sir!

236
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,333
Evacuations
will commence right away.

237
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,541
Good.

238
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,708
You've changed
since I last saw you, sir.

239
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,375
In what way?

240
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,791
The Takayama I worked for
would've risked his neck

241
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,500
trying to save Doji.

242
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,500
My goal was always
to minimize loss of life.

243
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
Well, yes,
when you put it like that.

244
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,125
Thirty-eight hundred I-Weapons.

245
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,333
Hello?

246
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,541
I got you, finally!

247
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,708
Sorry, it's not a good...

248
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,041
Please, just listen!

249
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,666
Did you say I-Weapons?

250
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,291
Yes, 3,800 of them.

251
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,083
Headed for Tokyo.

252
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,625
You mean,
they're headed for me.

253
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,750
It's okay.

255
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,708
My body may be breaking down,
but I can sense the power.

256
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,166
I can feel it growing
and growing inside of me.

257
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,166
It's like it could
rip me apart at any time.

258
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,666
Be careful.

259
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,958
We still don't know the extent
of the Witchblade's power.

260
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,541
Yeah.

261
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,833
Try to avoid engaging them
in open areas whenever possible.

262
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,833
These models are good
on level ground,

263
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,208
but they have some trouble
with vertical movement.

264
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,625
Got it.

265
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,125
I'm sending in
the lab's I-Weapons

266
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,583
to back you up
for as long as we can.

267
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,875
Roger that.

268
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,791
Any other instructions, boss?

269
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,208
That is all!

270
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,250
Then there's one more thing
I need to tell you.

271
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,041
Sometimes, when Rihoko
talks in her sleep,

272
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,791
she's just like you are
when you're drunk.

273
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,666
You should look for that.

274
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,791
I will.

275
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,083
You take care now.

276
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,166
You too.

277
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,250
Hey.

278
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,416
Newsflash came on.

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,375
Said a crap-ton of I-Weapons
are headed this way.

280
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah, Takayama just called me
with the details.

281
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,125
You're not thinkin' about--?

282
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,291
I am.

283
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,875
That's crazy talk!

284
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,041
Mom!

285
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,250
Oh, hey!

286
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,416
Dinner's ready!

287
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,541
Awesome!

288
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,041
Wait, there's still more!

289
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,250
Your homemade cooking
is the greatest, Riko!

290
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,166
What's wrong?

291
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,958
Give me the current location
of the rogue I-Weapons.

292
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,458
8.4 kilometers
off the coast.

293
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,500
A few moments ago,
they started to split up, sir.

294
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,791
Our projections indicate
five landing points.

295
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,458
Should we follow suit?

296
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,500
With under 300 units
at our disposal?

297
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,958
No point.

298
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,708
We'll concentrate on one front
and strike head-on!

299
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,208
Understood!

300
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,833
Permission to mobilize
the lab's I-Weapons?

301
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,708
Of course we haven't received--
no, we never requested it.

302
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,458
I assure you--

303
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,500
It's all Director Wado's orders.

304
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,500
He says he will take
full responsibility.

305
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,583
Yes, thank you.

306
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,916
I guess it's time
to update my resume.

307
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
This is the Metro Police.

308
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,541
Evacuation orders have been
issued for this area!

309
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,083
Please evacuate
toward Ueno immediately!

310
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,666
Man, this is really serious!

311
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,750
Where are Rihoko
and everyone else?

312
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,083
I think Tozawa went
to talk to them.

313
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,666
There's no reason
to freak out.

314
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,291
Masane's eating the dinner
Rihoko made.

315
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,583
Okay.

316
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,083
Oh, that's fine.
I'm not in any rush.

317
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,500
What's the matter?

318
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,666
It's Melony.

319
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,708
It's nothin'.

320
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,833
She just lost
her sense of taste.

321
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,083
Oh, it's so delicious!

322
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,625
Like I said, Riko,
your cooking's the best!

323
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,958
I changed up the seasonings
a little bit this time!

324
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,250
It's great!

325
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,958
You're my genius princess
of the kitchen!

326
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,041
Here they come, boys.

327
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,375
So many I-Weapons.

328
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,416
I can feel some of them
heading our direction.

329
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,875
They're not only drawn
to the Witchblade,

330
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,000
but to us, as well.

331
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,375
So, now what?

332
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,458
We crush anything
that gets in our path.

333
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,583
Anything.

334
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,750
Mom.

335
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,416
What is that?

336
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,875
What, this?

337
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,541
Only everything we own!

338
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,791
I made it so you can use it
whenever you need to,

339
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,750
so do not lose it!

340
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
Oh, and also?

341
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,166
Take my phone.

342
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,833
It has Mister Takayama's
number in it.

343
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,958
Call him, and he'll come
to your rescue!

344
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,500
'Kay. I got it.

345
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,291
Excellent!

346
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,791
Here, for luck.

347
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you, Riko.

348
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,125
Oh, Mom.

349
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,000
Sorry for making you wait.

350
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,875
Take good care of her for me.

351
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,916
Melony, hon...

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,125

to worry about there!

353
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,500
Come along now, Rihoko.

354
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,541
You are comin' back!

355
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,875
You didn't pay
this month's rent!

356
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,291
And I ain't lettin' you off!

357
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,291
Yeah!

358
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,083
Masane!

359
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,708
Great luck!
You have great luck!

360
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,458
Thank you, Naomi!

361
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,958
Mom, wait!

362
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,416
I'll be with you!

363
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,666
I'll see you soon!

364
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,833
All right.
One last time.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,250
Let's blow some shit up!

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,250
Commence attack!

367
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,000
[Music]

368
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,958

369
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,833
I love you.
