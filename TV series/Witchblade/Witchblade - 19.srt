1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,458
Startin' today, I'm chargin'
for all the meals Rihoko makes.

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,500
Say what?

3
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,833
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,791
Mariko said making
all those meals for free

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,125
was hurting her business.

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,125
That's harsh!

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,958
You're damn straight.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,333
Morning!
I'm off to work!

9
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,875
Mom! Wait!

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,250
Man!

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,750
[Music]

12
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,625
She skipped out
on breakfast again.

13
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,666
What's with the get-up?

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,000
It's so not her.

15
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,708
Melony said she got moved
to Secretary Division.

16
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,625
And man, is her wardrobe
sufferin' for it.

17
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,416
Her new boss is either
blind or dead.

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,583
My instincts
must've been way off.

19
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,750
I was sure Melony
and that Takayama fella--

20
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,250
Were gonna get married
someday?

21
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,625
Hold on, kiddo, don't ya think
you're movin' a little fast.

22
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,208
But I really liked him
that time

23
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,291
when he stayed the night
'cause he was too drunk.

24
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,708
So, you like
the strong, silent type,

25
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,000
is that it, Rihoko?

26
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,750
I'm a little surprised.

27
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,541
Don't be silly;
I just like him for Mom.

28
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,583
He's a nice man!

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,208
Oh! A nice man, huh?

30
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,291
Mom would always talk
about Mr. Takayama before bed.

31
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,208
How he's cheap,
and always gloomy,

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,333
and he's gonna go bald one day.

33
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
Are you sure
those aren't insults?

34
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,750
But now she doesn't talk
about him at all.

35
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,541
It's almost like she's
not worried about him anymore.

36
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,583
It's weird.

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,791
Breathtaking view, isn't it?

38
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,416
Takayama would often
stand there and--

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,375
Segawa,
I'd rather not hear that name

40
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,875
first thing in the morning.

41
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,708
My apologies, sir.

42
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,875
I'll get right into it:

43
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,541
at 10 am,
you're scheduled to meet

44
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,000
with the Bio Division
and Special Division personnel

45
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,666
to officially inform them
of the planned merger.

46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,083
Though it's more like
the Special Division

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,625
is being "absorbed"
than anything.

48
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,750
It can't be helped.

49
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,291
It's company policy.

50
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,833
You know, I'm impressed
with your ability

51
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,375
to switch sides so quickly.

52
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,416
Especially after
your years with Takayama.

53
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,625
My job has always been
to act as an assistant

54
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,416
to Doji's Directors.

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,208
There was no "side" to "switch."

56
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,250
I see.

57
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, this is
certainly convenient

58
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,375
seeing as my secretary
resigned recently.

59
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,458
Yagi quit so suddenly.

60
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,583
Do you know what happened?

61
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,625
I do not.

62
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,083
Good morning, I'm here!

63
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,458
You're three minutes late.

64
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,708
I'm sorry, sir!

65
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,625
Listen, Amaha, unlike
your previous employer,

66
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,833
I'm not paying you anything
if you don't follow my rules.

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,041
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,208
Your attire
is passable for today.

69
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,333
However, that will not work
for the party tomorrow.

70
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,625
What party?

71
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,166
I have to attend
a party tomorrow

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,833
for a teacher I'm indebted to,
and you shall escort me.

73
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,125
With you?
Are you serious?

74
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,166
What's the matter?

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Having trouble
following orders?

76
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,500
No, sir.
I'll be there.

77
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,708
Shall I take care of her
clothing selection?

78
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,333
Yes, go see to it.

79
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,208
I did it!

80
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,875
If Takayama only knew.

81
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,750
The Witchblade, the woman,
and the secretary.

82
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,125
All of them belong to me now!

83
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,083
All finished.

84
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,875
I'll combine this
with Maria's genes right away

85
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,375
to create a new Sister.

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,708
This may be
the last time we do this.

87
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,291
I feel certain the next Sister
will be perfect.

88
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,375
Yes, Father.

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,208
I am inclined to believe
you are correct.

90
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,500
Aoi...

91
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you know what Grandfather
is trying to do

92
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,666
by creating the Sisters?

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,208
Um...

94
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,250
He's trying to create the
perfect human being, isn't he?

95
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,833
No, that's what the NSWF
is trying to accomplish.

96
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,875
Grandfather has a different
reason for creating the Sisters.

97
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,250
Different?

98
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,250
You know Sister-related
research is top priority

99
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,708
for all Japanese NSWF branches.

100
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,916
Yes, ma'am?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
They're doing all this
top-secret research

102
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,000
so that Grandfather
can have a mother again.

103
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,583
So he can have a mother again?

104
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,833
You mean--?

105
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,791
He was so cold
when I wanted to find my mom,

106
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,750
and all this time
he's been searching for his own.

107
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, Mother.

108
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,250
He's nothing but a pathetic,
selfish old man.

109
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
Miss Maria!

110
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,375
You really shouldn't talk
about Father that way!

111
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,625
Why not?

112
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,708
It's the truth.

113
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,291
All Grandfather really has
is power.

114
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,125
The power to get anything
and everything he wants.

115
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,625
But, you said
that we have power too,

116
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,333
because you and I
are the chosen ones.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,166
Power comes in many forms.

118
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:44,625
Yo! So the big corporate
secretary's on her way home?

119
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,500
C'mon.

120
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,125
Don't ignore me!

121
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,166
What do you want?

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,625
I'm here to pick you up.

123
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,666
Now get in.

124
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,958
So, why're you even still
working at Doji?

125
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,083
Things're gettin' ugly
over there.

126
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,166
Might be a good time to quit.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
You're the last person
I'd take advice from.

128
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,333
Hey, now.

129
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,625
I know the dirt
on those I-Weapons, too.

130
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,291
The X-Cons've caused
enough trouble as it is.

131
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,666
If word gets out that Doji's
turning corpses into weapons,

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,916
it's all over.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,125
Well, I've got job security
until then.

134
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,333
The pay is real good.

135
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,833
I'm not gonna quit.

136
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,375
So it's for Rihoko?

137
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,625
Yeah. And from now on,
I'm doing things my way.

138
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,208
Ya know, you've kinda been
on edge the past few days.

139
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,291
Baby, I'm home!

140
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,541
Smells great!
I'm starving.

141
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,166
Hello, welcome home.

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,333
Good to see you again.

143
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,708
Kyoko, hey!

144
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,416
Hey, Mom!
Are you surprised?

145
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,916
Yeah, um...

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,916
I'm working on a story.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,750
Since I was
in the neighborhood,

148
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,333
I figured I'd drop by.

149
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,000
So I asked Tozawa if he would
pick you up from work today

150
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,750
so you could get home faster!

151
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,750
There you have it.

152
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,041
C'mon, Melony!

153
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,916
Join us for a drink or two!

154
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,208
I suppose this merger means

155
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,333
you'll have twice the workload,
if not more.

156
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,000
Aren't you worried
you'll be overwhelmed?

157
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,625
No, I handled twice as much
before I even became a director.

158
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,958
Sounds as though
you've worked hard

159
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,333
to get where you are;
how inspiring.

160
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,333
I simply do the work that
nobody else wants to touch.

161
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,083
You could have an office
with a view like this yourself

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,500
if you worked hard enough.

163
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,083
I never acquired
a taste for hard work.

164
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,916
Besides,
if I ever made it this far up,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
I'd always be worried
about who might push me off.

166
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,500
Are you suggesting I'll follow
in Takayama's footsteps?

167
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,083
I meant in general.

168
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,458
People in power always have
other people behind them,

169
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,083
and those who have fallen
often come crawling back up.

170
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,500
What are you
so afraid of, Wado?

171
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,166
So much responsibility,

172
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,166
and always
having to watch your back.

173
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,750
I could never do it.

174
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,166
Your ability to grasp power
so fearlessly is amazing, sir.

175
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,041
A person attempting to
"grasp power"

176
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,500
should always have
that level of resolve.

177
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,500
"Those who've fallen
often come crawling back up."

178
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,708
Don't even try it, Takayama.

179
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,250
Miss Kyoko,
how's Yuuki doing?

180
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,541
Oh, just great!

181
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,000
She really misses you though.

182
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,083
You should come
and visit her sometime.

183
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,458
That'd be fun!

184
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,791
We should plan another
group date soon, too!

185
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,708
Yeah.
One of these days.

186
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
So I'm curious.

187
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,666
Why's Chief Editor Kyoko
out workin' a story by herself?

188
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,375
Is it somethin' big?

189
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,333
More like a follow-up
to something big.

190
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:37,083
The guy who resigned from Doji,
Reiji Takayama?

191
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,875
A man at the very top,

192
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,166
who, in a single day,
lost everything.

193
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,625
Wouldn't it be
fascinating to know

194
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,750
what was going through his mind
at the time?

195
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,083
So I--

196
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,750
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

197
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,583
Oh no, no, not at all.

198
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,458
So tell me...

199
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,291
have you seen this Takayama?

200
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,291
No. He left the hotel
he was living in.

201
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,791
But I have an idea
where I might find him.

202
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,750
I want to talk to people
around town first,

203
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,166
get a better feel for the guy.

204
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,291
Is this gonna be
a negative write-up?

205
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,916
I'm not sure.
I haven't met him yet.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
The media's been pretty harsh
on him so far.

207
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,916
Painting him
as this cold-hearted elitist;

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,208
a man who sees everything
as numbers.

209
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,791
They think his disappearance
could be evidence of suicide.

210
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,541
He would never do that!

211
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,166
I'm sure he must be
real depressed right about now,

212
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,791
but he's not the kinda guy
who would kill himself.

213
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,208
And he's not some elitist

214
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,041
who's never dealt with
suffering.

215
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,708
His mother died
when he was young,

216
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
so he's always felt alone.

217
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,458
Buuut, I wouldn't
call him cold-hearted,

218
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,125
a cheapskate, maybe.

219
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,583
I mean, he's a pretty decent guy
once you get to know him.

220
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,458
Masane, did you just say
you know him?

222
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,333
And quite well,
it would seem.

223
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,958
Um. What?

224
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,250
Okay, I see what's going on.

225
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,958
I guess your instincts
were right on the money.

226
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,583
Of course they were!

227
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,083
Hey, no wait, what?
What instincts?

228
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,583
Oh, Mom! You really do like
Mr. Takayama after all!

229
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,791
What?
Riko!

230
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,000
What would make ya think that?

231
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,500
What a relief!

232
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,416
Since you don't talk
about him all the time anymore,

233
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
I thought you weren't
even worried about him!

234
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,833
Jeez, who says I'm worried?

235
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,583
Well, you were talking
about him awful passionately.

236
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,791
Suddenly
I can see a pink aura.

237
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,083
Quit makin' crap up!

238
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
What's going on?

239
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,791
C'mon, Mom. You should quit
working for that new boss;

240
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,041
he's a jerk.

241
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,250
Enough, Riko.
Before I get angry.

242
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,000
But Mister Takayama
is way better!

243
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,000
He is not!

244
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,000
Is too!

245
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,208
Is not!

246
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,500
You're too young to
understand these things!

247
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,333
No, Mom, you don't understand!

248
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,083
Stop trying to tell me
how to deal with my job!

249
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,083
But, Mom!

250
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,083
Rihoko!

251
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,083
Now calm down, you two!

252
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,791
Chill out, ladies.
That's enough.

253
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,875
C'mon, kiddo.

254
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,958
You're just being stupid!

255
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:46,958
I hate you.

256
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,958
Now, now, Rihoko.

257
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,458
That mouth!

258
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,000
Honestly, I feel like
I don't even know you anymore!

259
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,583
I don't know you
anymore either!

260
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,625
Melony, hold on!

261
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,416
Can't we be mature 'bout this?

262
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,416
Guess not.

263
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,125
Kyoko, hey.

264
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,208
Do you mind if I come in?

265
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,375
I really made an ass
o' myself out there.

266
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,750
Forget it.
Kids can be scary.

267
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,958
Especially little girls.

268
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,000
They tend to be
surprisingly sensitive

269
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,083
to their parents' emotions.

270
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,166
I don't have a thing
for Takayama, I'm just...

271
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,583
Concerned?

272
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,166
Well, like I said, I think
I have a pretty good idea

273
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,500
where you can find him.

274
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,041
No, I don't think
that's such a good--

275
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,333
It's because of Rihoko, right?

276
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,833
You know, there was a time
when I overworked myself

277
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,333
for my girl's sake.

278
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,083
All that did was make our love
into a one-way street.

279
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,041
She missed
having her mom around.

280
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,208
Sometimes it's good to listen

281
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,083
to what our children
have to say.

282
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,000
Riko?

283
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,958
Listen, Riko.

284
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,958
I think I'd like
to visit Takayama.

285
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,583
Would that be okay with you?

286
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,541
Yeah, Mom, of course!

287
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,750
I might lose my job.

288
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,291
Don't worry!

289
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,333
If they fire you, I can sell
box lunches to make money!

290
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,125
Riko.

291
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,625
Thank you.

292
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,750
Oh, brother.

293
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,208
Guess I got no choice.

294
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,791
C'mon.
I'll drive you over there.

295
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,541
No umbrella, sorry.

296
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,708
Ah, don't worry about it.

297
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,958
Thanks again.

298
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,708
Yeah, yeah,
just hurry inside.

299
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,750
You're getting soaked.

300
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,750
Yeah.
See ya later!

301
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,125
Uh, hi.

302
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,750
How's it goin'?

303
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,708
What could you possibly
want at this hour?

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,708
That's the greeting I get!

305
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,041
I came to visit

306
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,625
because I've been
worried sick about you!

307
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,375
Well, I must've hit rock bottom
if you're worried about me.

308
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,166
Come on in.

309
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,041
He is so not cute.

310
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,500
People are allowed to
get depressed - even you.

311
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,916
I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't upset.

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,750
Guess I really cared
for that company.

313
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,250
Never realized how much.

314
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,125
And you protected
the company you love.

315
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
That's a good thing.

316
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,291
Why not get a clean start
in a new business?

317
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,625
Sitting in an office,

318
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,958
barking orders all day
was only making you bald.

319
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,333
Besides, I just don't think

320
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,541
you're much of
a "suit and tie" kinda guy.

321
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,833
Is this supposed to be
making me feel better?

322
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,583
I dunno, is it workin'?

323
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,041
Not at all.
Maybe if you try not talking.

324
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,625
What!

325
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,083
I'm trying to help!

326
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,041
You can help by shutting up.

327
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,375
Oh, I see.

328
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,916
Fine, then. I'll leave!

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,958
You know it's pouring.

330
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,708
Maybe I like the rain!

331
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,083
Balding jerk!

332
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,916
What the hell?

333
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,208
Let me go!
I told you I'm leaving!

334
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,000
Goodbye!

335
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,041
What was--

336
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,916
This isn't why I--

337
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,791
Yagi.

338
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,416
I'm doing my best to turn you
back to a normal man again

339
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
but there's an obstacle
in our way.

340
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,375
And as long as
that obstacle exists--

341
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,541
Taka-yama. Taka-yama.

342
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,083
Yes! Good work;
you catch on fast, Yagi!

343
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,750
Hey! I'm back.

344
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,666
This one's on the house.

345
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,625
Heartbreak and alcohol
go hand-in-hand, right?

346
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,416
So where's your daughter
right now?

347
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,750
Riko?

348
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,250
The folks back at our building
are watching her.

349
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Oh, I see.

350
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,541
Reiji...

351
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,583
Rihoko is your daughter,
isn't she?

352
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,083
Yes, she is.

353
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,750
Then I think
you need to tell her.

354
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,791
I can't.

355
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,583
I have no idea
how to interact with her.

356
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,041
And to be honest,

357
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,333
it doesn't even feel
like she's mine.

358
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,125
Pretty pathetic excuse
for a father, aren't I?

359
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,708
I used to be the same way,
you know.

360
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,458
But once you sit down
and talk with her,

361
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,958
I'm sure you'll feel better.

362
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,125
Get down!

363
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,333
Are you alright?

364
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,333
Masane!

365
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,125
I'm going!

366
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,166
Always in the way.

367
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:34,083
I'm gonna kill
Director Takayama!

368
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,125
I'll do it with my bare hands!

369
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Why don't you
have a go at me first.

370
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,208
Why not?

371
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,583
Sounds fun!

372
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,166
Masane!

373
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,125
Damn!

374
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,833
No!

375
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,041
He's gonna kill me!

376
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
I need more.

377
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,125
More power!

378
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,750
Don't worry.

379
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,166
It'll all be over soon!

380
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,166
Masane!

381
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,208
Are you all right?

382
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,458
I'm fine.

383
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,000
Really, it was nothing.

384
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,916
I assume everything
went as planned?

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,333
Yes Father, in several months,
a new Sister will be born.

386
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,208
Maria.

387
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,875
My dear.

388
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,833
Nothing makes me happier than
to see how you have blossomed.

389
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,375
Maria...

390
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,166
It's time to reward you again
for all your hard work.

391
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,750
What do you want?
Anything at all.

392
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,208
There is one thing.

393
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,708
And what is that?

394
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,625
Your power.

395
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,541
Maria.

396
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,041
Sorry, Grandfather,
but I will obtain what I desire.

397
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,500
And I mean,
everything I desire.

398
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,791
Maria.

399
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,333
You are marvelous, my dear.

400
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,666
Truly marvelous.

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,875
I have no doubt the next
Sister born will be perfect.

402
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,541
You are a fool, Father.

403
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,916
That is not your genetic stock
inside those capsules.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,458
We can't go on like this.

405
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,083
No further progress
can be made

406
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,500
with the continued use
of your genes.

407
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,458
What do you mean, Nishida?

408
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,500
Why didn't you use my genes?

409
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,375
Tell me!

410
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,541
Why?

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,625
It can't be!
How could you?

412
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,625
I was supposed
to be born again!

413
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,416
I need the perfect mother!

414
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,875
How else will my true self
be born?

415
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,541
How could you do this!

416
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,333
No!

417
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,958
You have to redo it!

418
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,875
Do it again!

419
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,291
You have to!

420
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,208
Mother!

421
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,250
So pathetic!

422
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,875
Aoi, we're done here.

423
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,916
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,041
Oh, Chief Nishida.

425
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,416
Don't go anywhere.

426
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,750
You may still be
of some use to me.

427
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,333
Such ferocity.

428
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,958
Such unbridled power.

429
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,916
At last, you are complete.

430
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,041
Maria.

431
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,083
[Music]

432
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,625
Hey, Riko!
Wanna go on a date?

433
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,083
Well, not a date-date.

434
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,583
You wanna go to dinner
with Takayama?

435
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,000
Remember how you told me
you really liked him?

436
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,708
Well, he told me
he wants to be friends with you!

437
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,125
He said he'll take you
anywhere you wanna go!

438
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,541
And if you want anything,
I'm sure you'll have no problem

439
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,416
sweet-talkin' him out of it!

440
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,416
Just let him spoil you, okay?

441
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,208
And even though
it might be difficult,

442
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,250
try not to think of him
as my boss.

443
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:57,333
I know you guys are gonna
like each other a whole bunch!
