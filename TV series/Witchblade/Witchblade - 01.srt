1
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,583
Sought by the greed of men
since the dawn of humankind,

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:28,416
but only bestowed upon the women
whose fate it forever scars.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,375
The Witchblade.

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,041
Is it the Righteous Sword
of God,

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,000
or the Hand of the Devil
himself?

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,750
Now a new Bearer
has been chosen.

7
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,916
And she must discover
the answers for herself.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,083
As she stands
on the brink of destiny,

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,000
she is forced
to seek the balance

10
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,291
between ecstasy and ruin.

11
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,750
[Music]

12
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,750
Wake up.
You gotta wake up.

13
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,000
Come on!
You hear me?

14
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,375
Wake up!

15
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,875
Mommy!

16
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,750
Come on,
wake up already!

17
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,833
Just a few more minutes, 'kay?

18
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,708
Wake up, Masane!!!

19
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,500
Cut it out, Riko.

20
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,875
I was actually comfy there
for a minute.

21
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,250
Yeah, sorry,
but you were the one

22
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,916
who told me
I should wake you up.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,541
Huh?
You mean, you saw it?

24
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,583
Over there.

25
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,208
It looks just like
it did on TV.

26
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,708
Six years ago,
that wasn't an island.

27
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,750
There was no water--

28
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,708
just buildings,
streets and people.

29
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,375
Wonder if we can see
any houses down there.

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,666
Mom, be careful.

31
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,041
Don't worry
your little head.

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,083
Duckies?

33
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,791
Looks like one of 'em's
on his own.

34
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,833
Just don't jump in after him.

35
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,083
Go on, little ducky!
Back to your family!

36
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,208
Don't want to end up all alone
in this scary world!

37
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,250
Go on!

38
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,041
Doggie!

39
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,791
What's going on out there?

40
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,083
Yeah, sorry.
I slipped.

41
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,458
It was the, uh--

42
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,791
Pretty irresponsible behavior
for a grown woman with a kid.

43
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,083
What does it matter

44
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,125
if one rubber ducky
gets split from the rest?

45
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,250
I wouldn't call it an omen,
'cause that's weird.

46
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,791
But I've never liked
being alone.

47
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,000
Being apart from the group
or left out, I dunno.

48
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,291
Something about it
just always felt wrong to me.

49
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,333
I mean, don't things
like that bother you?

50
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,708
Nothing bothers me.

51
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,416
Except maybe
when a parent lets a kid

52
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,208
wear the pants
in the family.

53
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,625
Look at her.

54
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,541
She's even got the dog
eating out of her hand.

55
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,041
Your kid's something else.

56
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,458
Yeah, she's all I got.

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,208
The one thing
I can be proud of.

58
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,875
You should be proud.

59
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,375
We lost a lot of great children
in that disaster.

60
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,500
Never seen that kinda horror
in all my days.

61
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,875
Wasn't it in the wake of that

62
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,458
they established
some group to help the kids?

63
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,916
Yeah, Child Welfare.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,583
What a load of crap.

65
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,958
Mom!

66
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,750
I don't think
you dried your hair enough.

67
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,583
You're gonna
catch a cold, you know.

68
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,500
I'll be fine, Lady Rihoko.

69
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,708
Princess of Worrywort Island.

70
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,500
We're just about there.

71
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,666
So, is this
a mother/daughter vacation?

72
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,958
Not, quite.
We're moving here.

73
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,208
The two of us'll be official
Tokyo residents.

74
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,750
Yay!

75
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,583
If you're going to make
your home in Tokyo,

76
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,083
ya gotta be careful.

77
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,708
'Course we will!

78
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,500
A lot of strange stuff
has been going down

79
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,291
over the past few weeks.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,333
Watch your backs out there.

81
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,041
Thank you, Captain.

82
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,583
And this is for you.

83
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,583
Looks like you were missing
a flag on the back.

84
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,458
Put this up in its place.

85
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,083
Thanks again.

86
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,041
Thanks?

87
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,041
Bye-bye, Mr. Boat Guy.

88
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,333
Bye-bye, doggie!

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,750
See ya 'round.

90
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,375
What a strange woman.

91
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,416
So different from
how it used to be.

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,916
And so many people.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,083
Careful, Mom.
I don't want you to get lost.

94
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,541
Aren't I supposed to
say that to you?

95
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,958
But you're right.

96
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,458
We need to find a meeting place
in case we get split up.

97
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,083
Tokyo Tower!

98
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,625
That's perfect.

99
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,625
If we get separated
for any reason,

100
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,750
we'll meet at the tower
as soon as we can.

101
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,750
'Kay.

102
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,500
Now. First things first.

103
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,125
Job and a place to live.

104
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,458
Don't be scared.

105
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,250
Before we do anything else,
we need to get some food.

106
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,375
And to celebrate our arrival,
we eat anything we want!

107
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,500
Yeah!

108
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,375
Morning, boys.

109
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,666
You're late.

110
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,958
Give me a break, Detective.

111
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,666
I was up late drinking.

112
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,000
Looks like the same M.O.

113
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,666
Disgusting, is what it is.

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,000
We'll need a power sander

115
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,583
to get the calcium deposits
out of the concrete.

116
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,875
What kinda sicko you got to be

117
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,958
to do this
to another human being?

118
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,083
Tozawa,
why'm I not surprised?!

119
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,625
Get down from there
before I have you shot down!

120
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,875
I got what I need.

121
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,583
Hell, I got more
than what I need.

122
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,750
And now...

123
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,916
Smells like cash.

124
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,875
Pulverizer Murder number four.

125
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,083
A National Science
and Welfare Foundation badge

126
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,041
is found at each scene.

127
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,291
'Course, NSWF runs
the Child Welfare Ministry.

128
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,291
Guess I'll pay 'em a visit.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Detective Nakata?

130
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,541
Detective Nakata!

131
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,541
What?

132
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,083
I'm busy.

133
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,500
We caught this creep
a few blocks over.

134
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,541
Yeah, he actually says
he's responsible for this mess.

135
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,500
No, not near enough
to satisfy this thirst.

136
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,875
Quit bringing me
every drunk off the street!

137
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
What are they teaching
at that academy?

138
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,458
A'right, what do you want us
to do with him?

139
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,875
I don't care!
Figure it out!

140
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,875
Yes, sir.
Right away.

141
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,958
You made us look stupid.

142
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,000
Shut up!

143
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,375
Very well.

144
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,958
Keep your eyes on him.

145
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,791
If the opportunity arises,
we'll make our move.

146
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,916
Understood.

147
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,291
Pardon me, Captain.
Can I ask you a question?

148
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,875
Yeah, what is it?

149
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,458
Have any of your recent
ferry customers

150
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,916
been a woman
with a six-year-old girl?

151
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,458
Yeah, you missed them
by a couple hours.

152
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,708
It seems
they came to Tokyo after all.

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,708
Did they happen to say
where they were going?

154
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,375
Those ladies
weren't criminals.

155
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,500
Who are you people?
Why you looking for 'em?

156
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,375
No need to worry.

157
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,625
We're the good guys,
Captain, I promise.

158
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,958
My name's Sakurai,
with Child Welfare.

159
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,375
Wow, that hit the spot!
Our compliments to the chef!

160
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,541
Thanks.

161
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,708
Though I gotta say,
it was a little odd

162
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,583
that you made the broth
with bonito.

163
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,083
Uh. Oh!

164
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,541
Thanks.
We'll come back soon.

165
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:04,083
We've been looking for you,
Masane Amaha.

166
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,083
Mom!

167
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,125
Hold on!

168
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,916
Young lady, you know
that under the new laws,

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
if you continue to stay
on the run with Rihoko,

170
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,750
you will be charged
with kidnapping

171
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,375
and child endangerment.

172
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,416
You can't!

173
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583
I cannot be
any clearer about this.

174
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,208
If the proper environment
does not exist,

175
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,958
the CWM is obligated
to take the child into custody.

176
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,458
Look at yourself, Masane.

177
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,666
You have no home, no income.

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,500
You evicted us from our home!

179
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,541
The maximum stay
at a domestic shelter

180
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,916
is six years.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,916
Well, now we're out
and we're gonna make it work!

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,125
Rihoko is only six years old!

183
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,458
But I'm busy helping my mom
all the time!

184
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,458
She doesn't even cook,

185
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,041
so I have to be with her
to help!

186
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,875
She'll be lost without me.

187
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,500
You can't take her away.

188
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,208
Please don't take my Mommy!

189
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
Rihoko...

190
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,875
I know you're worried,

191
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,583
but can I talk to your mommy
alone for a sec?

192
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,208
I'm her mother.

193
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,083
Why that's a problem
with you people is beyond me.

194
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,375
You've changed, Miss Amaha,
more than I thought.

195
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,541
Six years ago,

196
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,333
when they started sifting
through what was left,

197
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,541
somehow you and Rihoko
were found alive,

198
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,708
at the Null Point--

199
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,291
the epicenter
of the earthquake--

200
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,375
where the magnetic field
achieves a state of zero.

201
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,041
When you woke, your memory
was completely erased.

202
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,041
You didn't even
know your name.

203
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,125
Were it not for the maternity
diary you carried,

204
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,541
no one would have known
you were the girl's mother.

205
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,041
Especially since upon
your arrival at the center,

206
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,250
you told the counselor

207
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,750
you had no maternal feelings
toward Rihoko.

208
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,750
Remember?

209
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,833
I was confused. I--

210
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,083
Of course, you were.

211
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,541
Your memory
was completely gone.

212
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,083
No! What I said
to that counselor

213
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,250
is what I felt at the time.

214
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,625
But that was six years ago.

215
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,333
Today, this girl
is my daughter!

216
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,583
If that's true, Masane,
then you need to stop

217
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,458
and consider the best
course of action for <i>her.</i>

218
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,208
Children need structure.

219
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,875
Do you realize
how detrimental it can be

220
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,750
to live each day
in uncertainty?

221
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,500
Could you even afford a doctor
if she was to get sick?

222
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,208
It's not a perfect plan.

223
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,458
With Child Welfare,

224
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,666
Rihoko will have
a nurturing environment.

225
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,041
They have doctors
and schools.

226
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,208
Which path do you feel

227
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,833
is better for your child's
development?

228
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,625
As her mother,
you know the answer.

229
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,416
You should feel it
in your heart.

230
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,625
Once we've determined you're
capable of providing for Rihoko,

231
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
you can be a family again.

232
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,666
All right, Rihoko,
time for us to go.

233
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,791
Where's Mom?

234
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,250
Mommy's not coming.

235
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,250
Why not?

236
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
She said
you should go with me.

237
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No! Mom!

238
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,291
Please, Mom!
I want to live with you!

239
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,583
I'll cook for you,

240
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,583
and I promise to wake you up
nicer, I promise!

241
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,958
Mommy!
Let me go!

242
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,416
I wanna see my mom!

243
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,666
No!
Don't let them take me!

244
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,416
Mommy!!!!!

245
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,666
Riko!

246
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,750
Do you need an escort
to the center?

247
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,750
Mom!

248
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,791
Thanks,
but we'll be fine.

249
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,750
Riko!

250
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,875
Hey.

251
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,000
Mom!

252
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,375
Hurry!
Start the car!

253
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,375
Go now!

254
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,750
A'right!
Back it up!

255
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,083
Mommy!!!!

256
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,625
Mommy!

257
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm not letting go
'til you calm down!

258
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,500
Get offa me!

259
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,541
If only you cared this much

260
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,916
about actually
taking care of her.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,791
You can't understand.

262
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,708
A mother's rage!!

263
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,708
Let me out!
Let me out!

264
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,875
Let me out!

265
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,500
You'll see your mommy again
Rihoko,

266
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,750
but when the time is right.

267
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,458
You have no idea
what I'm going through!

268
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,166
So don't act like you care!

269
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,125
Riko!

270
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,125
Mom!

271
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,916
What kind of a lunatic
are you?

272
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,875
Stealing a police cruiser!

273
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,125
Now there's no chance

274
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,083
that woman is ever getting
her daughter back.

275
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,333
Stop the car!

276
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,375
Gotcha.

277
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Mother's milk.

278
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,791
Sun's about to set--

279
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,958
maybe I should go
have a look around.

280
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,041
Riko.

281
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,625
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm so sorry
I left you alone.

283
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,916
I'm sure you're happy
your mother wasn't hurt, Rihoko.

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,041
But what she did
was a very bad thing--

285
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,416
and very dangerous.

286
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,583
Stealing police cars

287
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,500
is not the example
we want to set for you.

288
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,541
I gotta pee.

289
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,583
Sure.

290
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,916
Take your time, okay?

291
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,958
Yeah.

292
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,333
I can smell it
in the night.

293
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,916
It's wonderful.

294
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,416
The flesh.

295
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,000
Aw, jeez, my back!

296
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,791
Oh!
Sorry about that.

297
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,958
Did I, um, hurt you?

298
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,291
Oh, no!

299
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,416
My camera!

300
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,875
Still works.

301
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,958
You're a lucky lady.

302
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,333
This sucker is my life-blood.

303
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,416
You gotta help me, mister.

304
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,708
Do you have a car?

305
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,708
Well, yeah.

306
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,708
So what?

307
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,250
Rihoko!

308
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,625
Where are you?

309
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,791
Rihoko, huh?
I'm guessin' that's you.

310
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,416
Please, help me
escape from this place.

311
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,750
What?

312
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,416
I've gotta save my mommy.

313
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,625
You nuts?

314
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,250
Don't you know
what they do to kidnappers?

315
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,125
Ma'am,
what's going on out here?

316
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,458
A little girl
just jumped out the window.

317
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,291
I need you to look for her
down there.

318
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm gone.

319
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,833
You there!

320
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,416
Come on out,
or I'm dragging you out.

321
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,375
We're cool.

322
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,000
So, where do we find your mom?

323
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,250
South Asagaya
Detention Center.

324
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,791
What's wrong?

325
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,333
Don't you know where it is?

326
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,583
Yes, I know where the jail is.

327
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,958
Hit a home run
with this kid.

328
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,625
It's gone.

329
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,458
The glowing on my wrist.

330
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,041
What's that racket?

331
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,916
Sounds like it's that lady
who boosted the police car.

332
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,041
I'm not sure, but I think
she might be sick!

333
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
Go check her out.

334
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,750
On it.

335
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,666
Hey, what's your problem?

336
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,500
You bastard!

337
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,166
Stop it!
That tickles!

338
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,208
Shut up!

339
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,625
Bye.

340
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,125
This is it.

341
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,125
I'm coming in with you.

342
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,125
Not a chance.

343
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,125
You keep it parked
right there.

344
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,708
I'll scope out the situation
on my own.

345
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,500
You got a photo or something?

346
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,291
A picture of your mom?

347
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,291
So you're the one
I've been sensing.

348
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,083
Such a potent aroma!

349
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,750
It will feel so wonderful
to rip you apart.

350
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,791
All you have to do
is stay still for me.

351
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,750
Here we go.

352
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,375
Oh, how I love the sound
of crushing bone,

353
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,125
the smell of blood,
the taste of soft flesh!

354
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,041
What?

355
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,333
What the hell is that thing?

356
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,375
Die!

357
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,916
We can't have their
interruptions, can we?

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,583
It's just you and me now,
my darling prey.

359
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,166
I can't wait for the pain!

360
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,625
The sounds of ripping tissue--
the taste of fresh marrow!

361
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,208
You're with NSWF.

362
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,583
No wonder you smell so nice.

363
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,541
You're the best
I've ever had!

364
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,041
I can't wait
to tear into you--

365
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,458
and finish you in one blow!

366
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
Sorry,
you don't do it for me.

367
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,416
I'm not finished with--

368
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,166
What the holy hell?

369
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,958
Hey, what are you doing
back here?

370
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,000
Busted.

371
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,750
And, cut.

372
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,791
Got it.

373
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,625
Now...
to collect the specimen.

374
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,708
Riko--

375
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,541
Mommy.

376
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,458
No problem.

377
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,000
The retrieval unit will handle
the X-con debacle.

378
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,208
Have you seen the video?

379
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,916
I'm watching it now.

380
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,583
I have no doubt.

381
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,541
She has the Witchblade.

382
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,000
She has a tranq coursing
through her system,

383
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,458
we'll have her shortly.

384
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
I look forward to it.

385
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,375
Yes, sir.

386
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,416
Why now?

387
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,166
Riko.

388
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,583
Riko.

389
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,958
I'm...

390
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,583
I'm coming.

391
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:55,958
Riko.

392
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,541
[Music]

393
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,708
Being forced away from you

394
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,166
the second
we arrived in Tokyo

395
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,541
was the worst thing
I've ever had to deal with.

396
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,041
And it keeps getting worse.

397
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,625
Anyway, how are you doing?

398
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,375
I know I gotta be a mother
so here's a piece of advice:

399
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,791
Don't talk to strangers.

400
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,541
That's a big one, okay?

401
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,083
I wish I could tell you
where I am,

402
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,500
or what's going on with me.

403
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,041
But I'm not sure.

404
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,708
All I know is
I've met someone--

405
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,333
a horrible, disgusting man.

406
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,875
But I will
get out of here, Riko.

407
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,125
I'll find you. Wait for me.
