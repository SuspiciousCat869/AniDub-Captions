1
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
She's lost a lot of blood

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,541
but her external injuries
aren't too serious.

3
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,583
The major problems
I've found are internal.

4
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,083
To be honest, I've never
seen anything like this.

5
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,250
Can you give me any insight
on what happened?

6
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,583
I'm sorry I can't.

7
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,666
It's uh...

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,125
Top secret, huh?

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,125
I had a feeling you'd say
something along those lines.

10
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,875
Sorry, at this rate,
she won't have long to live.

11
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,833
[Music]

12
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,125
Mister Takayama!

13
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,166
Is my mom...

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,208
Is she gonna be all right?

15
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,791
Yeah.

16
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,000
She's just exhausted
from all her work lately.

17
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,625
A little rest
and she'll be fine.

18
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,750
Really?

19
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,291
I'm so glad to hear that.

20
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
Mr. Takayama!

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,500
Ms. Amaha is awake
and she wants to see you!

22
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,083
She finally woke up?

23
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, but there's a problem.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,958
You're checking yourself out?

25
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,583
I'm sorry I had you
so freaked out about me, Riko.

26
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,333
But I am feeling
a whole lot better now.

27
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,666
Really?

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,666
You're not pushing yourself?

29
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,416
Nope, not even a little.

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,833
Honestly, you don't have to be
such a worrywart all the time!

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,333
Why don't you go
wait for me in the car, 'kay?

32
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,583
Okay.

33
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,125
Are y--

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,166
It's happening.

35
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,375
Sooner than I thought.

36
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,083
When did it start?

37
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,750
A few days ago.

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,333
Right after the fight
at your villa, I guess.

39
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,125
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

40
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,666
You can't get up yet!

41
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,166
You need bed rest!

42
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,708
If all I need is sleep,
I don't need a hospital,

43
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,916
I can do that anywhere.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Masane...

45
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,000
I wanna go home.

46
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,708
Our home,
with you and Riko.

47
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,416
How could you have failed!

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,666
Could you please
not yell like that?

49
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,208
I supplied you with
one of our I-Weapons!

50
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,958
Now you tell me
it's been destroyed,

51
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,000
and I'm just supposed to say,
"Oh sure, no problem!"

52
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, it wasn't
completely for naught.

53
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,458
I did manage to recover
some new data on the Witchblade.

54
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,625
Obviously a single I-Weapon
was no match for its power.

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,833
But with several,

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,083
I have no doubt
they could seize the 'Blade.

57
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,625
Then why didn't you
send multiple units

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,208
in the first place?

59
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,833
You know as well as I

60
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,958
that the preparation
of these units takes time.

61
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,000
We are scientists, Wado,
not magicians!

62
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,125
The new IU-Weapons
are progressing as planned.

63
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,416
You just worry about
your own responsibilities.

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,791
Fine. I'll do that.

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,958
Leave the groundwork

66
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,125
for the various
government sectors to me.

67
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,333
And keep in mind,

68
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,625
any further failure
will not be tolerated.

69
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,500
No, I'm sure it won't.

70
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,458
Goodbye, Wado.

71
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,541
Oh, how I long for a world

72
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,916
where I can immerse myself
in research.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,375
I've never had
a subject so worthy.

74
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,750
You fainted from anemia?

75
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,000
That's rough!

76
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,958
Are you feeling
better now, Melony?

77
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,291
Criminy!

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,083
It's probably 'cause
you overwork yourself.

79
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,625
Sorry, I didn't
mean to worry you guys.

80
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,208
Tell me straight, Mom,

81
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,250
are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,083
I'm fine, I promise!

83
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,333
With some rest
and your cooking,

84
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,666
I'll be back on my feet
in no time.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you sure?

86
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,125
In that case,
why don't we whip up

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,208
an amazing 'welcome home'
meal for ya.

88
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,625
Whadya say, Melony?

89
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
Yay! That'd be great!

90
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,625
Yay!

91
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,333
Alright, everybody!
It's time to get cookin'!

92
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,458
Alright!

93
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,666
Hey, wait up.

94
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,250
Tell me the truth.

95
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,625
Is it really anemia
or is it somethin' else?

96
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,166
Hey!

97
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,958
Why won't you answer me?

98
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
Hey!

99
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,625
I've heard that liver's
the best food to treat anemia.

100
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,958
From what I hear,

101
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,625
it's great for boosting
your stamina, too!

102
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,958
That's a good idea,

103
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,333
but I don't think
she'll eat liver.

104
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,083
She's never liked that stuff.

105
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,458
Well, what if we
deep-fried it Tatsuta-style?

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,416
She may not like liver
but I know she loves fried food.

107
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,208
You're right!

108
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,208
No.

109
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,333
Not now.

110
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,583
I'm not ready.

111
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,875
Not yet.

112
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:43,333
If I die, I-I'll
never be with Riko again.

113
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,041
If I remember correctly,

114
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,208
you were forced
into early retirement.

115
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,666
Never thought I'd see you
back at Doji's labs.

116
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,041
Why do I get the feeling
there's a major story here?

117
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,916
Maybe it's just a hunch.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,625
But then again,
my hunches are usually right.

119
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,833
Don't get too excited,
I'm here on personal business.

120
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,916
I'm sure it's nothing

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that would be
of any interest to you.

122
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,791
Personal business, huh?

123
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,791
Does it relate to Melony?

124
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,333
I'm comin' too!

125
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,875
And if you try'n stop me,
I'm callin' security!

126
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,375
I don't have time for this.

127
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,250
Do what you wish.

128
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,083
No cameras.

129
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:08,958
Tsh. Right.

130
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,625
Seriously though, what the hell
are you doing back here?

131
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,291
I thought you cut
all ties with Doji.

132
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,166
That's right, I have.

133
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,375
But unfortunately,

134
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,583
all of our research data
is still kept here.

135
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,916
What research data?

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Everything we know
about the Witchblade

137
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,541
and its previous wielders.

138
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,041
So somethin' did happen
to Melony?

139
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,666
Call me crazy
but I got a feelin'

140
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,333
this data has nothing
to do with anemia.

141
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,166
Speakin' of security,

142
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,208
thought this place was
just a research facility.

143
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,750
Who's there!

144
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,083
Director Takayama,
what're you doing here?

145
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,416
They're members
of my old staff.

146
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,916
Former employees
who shouldn't be here either.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,208
Correct me if I'm wrong,

148
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,000
but I thought Doji
fired you boys when I quit.

149
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,208
Oh, they did,
but something came up.

150
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,041
It sounds crazy,
but we received an SOS.

151
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,458
SOS?
From where?

152
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,208
Director Takayama!

153
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,625
What happened exactly?

154
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,666
Come have a look at this.

155
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,041
The I-Weapons
we rolled out last month

156
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,250
to send to Baradhi,

157
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,083
have started to act
on their own accord,

158
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
all of a sudden.

159
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,458
They were set
to "Sleep" mode,

160
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,708
but for some reason,
they'd automatically boot up,

161
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,625
react to commands
that were never given,

162
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,458
and then malfunction.

163
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,791
We've requested a recall
of all shipped units

164
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,250
so we can investigate further,

165
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,708
but the higher-ups flat-out
refused to listen to us.

166
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,625
Let me guess, Wado?

167
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,250
You got it.

168
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,541
Our hands are tied.

169
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,541
They won't let us do anything,

170
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,291
so we decided to secretly
call in Ota's team.

171
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,458
How many do we have left
in storage here?

172
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,833
300 units, sir.

173
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,583
Let me get this straight,

174
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,541
you're saying there's
hundreds of I-Weapons here

175
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,375
just waiting to malfunction?

176
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,833
When did this phenomenon start?

177
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,333
Just recently.

178
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,583
I'd say maybe two days ago.

179
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,083
But it was yesterday when they
really started to go haywire.

180
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,083
Sometime around five
in the evening.

181
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,708
What is it?

182
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,333
The Witchblade's doing this.

183
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,083
It was in combat mode yesterday,
right around that time.

184
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,291
Impossible.

185
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,166
The I-Weapons
have safeguards in place

186
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,291
to prevent them from
reacting to the Witchblade!

187
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,000
That was before the Witchblade's
power level spiked.

188
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,750
Those safeguards
are useless now.

189
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,083
We need something else.

190
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,791
Criminy!

191
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,541
Why did we buy so much?

192
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,833
Don't blame me
when you're eating left-overs

193
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
for the next week.

194
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,833
I don't think that'll be
a problem the way Mom eats.

195
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,000
She'll pretty much scarf down

196
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,625
anything
you put in front of her.

197
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,208
Oooo-kay!

198
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,541
I'm gonna make you the best
dinner you've ever had, Mom!

199
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,500
The Witchblade
and the I-Weapons

200
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,666
are undeniably connected.

201
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,000
I assume it's because

202
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,333
the latter are drawn
to immense energy sources.

203
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Hold on a second!

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
You think these I-Weapons are
gonna start going after Melony?

205
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,791
Uh, yeah.

206
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,916
That's pretty much
what we're lookin' at here.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,208
Let me have a look
at the computer.

208
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,750
There's some data
I need to check.

209
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,958
I've had it
with this damn thing!

210
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,000
If it weren't...

211
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,541
If it weren't for this,
Riko and I...

212
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,750
we could be together.

213
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,916
Why!

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,458
Why me!

215
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,250
And why Riko!

216
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,500
Why!

217
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,541
Why!

218
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,666
It's not fair!

219
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,958
We didn't ask for this power!

220
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,041
So why?

221
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,083
Why is this happening to us?

222
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,666
Hey.

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,375
She doesn't have a simple
case of anemia, does she?

224
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,833
The Witchblade's excess power

225
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,625
has been taking
a heavy toll on her--

226
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,250
it's eating away at her body.

227
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,583
At this rate,
she won't live much longer.

228
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,291
That can't be right.

229
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,333
I mean,
she can still be cured?

230
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,958
Isn't that why
you're checking this data?

231
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,541
This is the data
Reina Soho left behind.

232
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,041
I scoured her observational
records provided by the NSWF.

233
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,333
But, there's nothing
in her research

234
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,291
to suggest a way to prevent
Witchblade-induced breakdowns.

235
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,708
So what happens to her?

236
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,083
Tell me!

237
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,833
Like...
can't you just remove it?

238
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,791
If you can take
the Witchblade off her,

239
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,125
she'll be safe, right?

240
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,291
Unfortunately,
it's not that easy.

241
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,041
The only way to escape
the Witchblade is through death.

242
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,875
There's no other way
to save her?

243
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,125
That's a load of crap!

244
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,375
What the hell
is the Witchblade?

245
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,708
You're the one who's
responsible for this, you know.

246
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,416
She never wanted to fight!

247
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
She just wanted
to keep Rihoko safe.

248
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,416
But you had her tied
around your little finger,

249
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,458
didn't you,
you son of a bitch!

250
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:14,125
You ran her ragged
and this is the thanks she gets.

251
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,791
Now all of these I-Weapons
are gonna go berserk

252
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,958
and start going after her?

253
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,916
She never asked
for any of this.

254
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,541
Whether she asked for it or not,
this is her fate.

255
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,458
It is the fate of all the women
chosen by the Witchblade.

256
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,291
To attract danger,
to fight, and to die.

257
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,750
What!

258
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,250
There's nothing more I can do
except to continue

259
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,708
to support her
'til the bitter end!

260
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,083
It has been determined

261
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,083
that the recent scuffle
in the Bay Area

262
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,333
was instigated
by remnants of the X-Cons.

263
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,833
I was under the impression all
the X-Cons had been disposed of?

264
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,041
Is it possible
some of them survived?

265
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,583
To ease the concerns
of the public,

266
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,916
we should inform them

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,666
Doji is willing to take
full responsibility.

268
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,291
It would behoove us
to work publicly

269
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,833
with the local government to
eliminate any remaining X-Cons.

270
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,750
We must start our negotiations
with officials soon

271
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,875
to expedite the process.

272
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,708
You have some truly
amazing ideas.

273
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,750
Now we can capture
the Witchblade in the city

274
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,041
right under everyone's noses.

275
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,791
Just brilliant, Director!

276
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,416
As they say, a wise man
profits from his--

277
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,958
Shut up!

278
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,041
You're annoying me!

279
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,041
Aoi, go down to the Neo-Gene
training center

280
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,208
and find their most skilled
Sisters.

281
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,416
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,333
And how many do you
want me to bring back?

283
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,250
One will do nicely.

284
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,791
I'm afraid more than that
would only slow me down.

285
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,291
Miss Maria?

286
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
What's the matter?

287
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,666
Miss Maria?

288
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,458
It was nothing.

289
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,500
I will obtain
the power I desire.

290
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,041
The Witchblade will be mine.

291
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,958
Finally, I'll have the power
to have anything I want.

292
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,500
You're going to kill me,

293
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,500
and long after I die,
you'll still be here...

294
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,375
and then you'll do to Rihoko
what you've done to me.

295
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,541
No!

296
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,041
I refuse to let that happen.

297
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:53,750
I am gonna die,
but I won't let this continue.

298
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,041
I'm gonna take you with me.

299
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,208
Straight to Hell.

300
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm going to stay here

301
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,208
and take care
of these I-Weapons.

302
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,375
We won't know
what's going on

303
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,166
until I take
a detailed analysis.

304
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,625
With thousands of these things
goin' kaiju on Tokyo,

305
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,458
man, you got your work
cut out for ya.

306
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,208
I'll do whatever I can
to prevent that from happening.

307
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,000
In the meantime,

308
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,250
Masane and Rihoko
are in your hands!

309
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,750
Oh hi, Tozawa!
Welcome back!

310
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,208
Hey kid, we missed ya;
where the heck you been?

311
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,958
C'mon, get yourself
something to eat!

312
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,541
So, Mom...
what do you think?

313
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,458
It's delicious!

314
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,500
I swear, you're the best chef
in the whole world, Riko!

315
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,875
I gotta say I'm impressed
to see you all spunky.

316
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,583
I didn't think
you'd get better so fast!

317
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,625
Is it good? Whatcha think?

318
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,583
Yeah! It's great!

319
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,500
There's plenty
for you too, Tozawa!

320
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,875
Come on!

321
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,208
What're you just
standin' around for, ya bum?

322
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,833
Better get in
on some of this quick,

323
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,416
before Masane eats it all!

324
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,916
Yeah, right.

325
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
So where's Takayama?

326
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,875
Yeah, uh...

327
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,000
he's kinda over
at the Doji Labs.

328
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,375
Doji?

329
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,000
What's he doing there?

330
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,958
Well... some uh,
stuff came up.

331
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,541
So anyway...
how are things?

332
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey Tozawa,
is everything okay?

333
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,083
Did you eat
on your way home tonight?

334
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,083
No.

335
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,291
I'll eat, sure.

336
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,583
Hey! Why don't we
take some pictures?

337
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,250
What brought that on
all of a sudden?

338
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,666
Well, everyone
worked so hard

339
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,875
to make this
beautiful meal for me.

340
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:58,916
Let's commemorate it!

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,416
That's a great idea!

342
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,791
We can take one with
"Rihoko and Cho's special salad"

343
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,375
smack in the center!

344
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,541
That'd make a nice photo!

345
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,791
Riko, come sit on my lap.

346
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,625
'Kay, fine,
I'll get my camera.

347
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,958
Put all yer happy faces on!

348
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,791
Damn it.
I can't focus.

349
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,500
Okay,
everybody say "cheese"!

350
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,583
Cheese!

351
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,500
[Music]

352
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,250
That was so much fun, Riko!

353
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,583
We haven't had
a dinner party in a while!

354
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,458
I'm so glad Tozawa took
all those pictures for us!

355
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,708
We'll have to put some
up in the kitchen

356
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,833
once they're developed.

357
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,291
I love being with you, Riko!

358
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,875
I really do.

359
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,375
I always love seeing
your smiling face.

360
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,541
I mean, I love your face
even when you're crying

361
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,541
but it makes me so happy
to see you smile.

362
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,333
I hope you'll always have
that smile on your face.

363
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,000
That's the one thing
I wish for you.

364
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,541
I love you, Riko.
