1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,416
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,291
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,166
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,375
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,583
Righteous Sword of God,

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,708
or Hand of the Devil himself?

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,875
A new Bearer finds out,

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,250
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,291
[Music]

10
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,750
Is this wise, sir?

11
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,000
The woman may be endowed
with the Witchblade,

12
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,125
but she's completely untested.

13
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,541
If something should happen...

14
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,541
I am interested to see
the full extent of her power.

15
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,666
However, if she dies
in the proceedings,

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,000
we still recover
the Witchblade.

17
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,791
Could that prove to be...

18
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:25,916
preferential?

19
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,041
Commence.

20
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,875
Come...

21
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,333
you big thing.

22
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,333
I feel you!

23
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,583
Come on!

24
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,875
Can't stand it.

25
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,083
Deep inside.

26
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,500
Unbearable urges!

27
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,791
In position, sir.

28
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,583
Here we go.

29
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,250
I don't know what this is.

30
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,041
I don't care...

31
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,000
I must...

32
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,666
No, I want...

33
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,458
to destroy you!

34
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,291
Exquisite!

35
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,750
What did I...?

36
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,125
Ghastly.
Just looking at it.

37
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,791
She performed well,
if a bit savagely.

38
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,208
Although, if she hadn't
lost consciousness,

39
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,250
the damage would've been
much more severe.

40
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,625
We should consider
ourselves lucky

41
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,375
events played out
as they did.

42
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,833
Let me out!
You hear me!

43
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,625
Let me outta here!

44
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,833
Dammit all!

45
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,500
Your recovery time
is impressive.

46
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,708
Is that resilience the reason
the Witchblade chose you

47
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,708
to wield it?

48
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,250
What the hell
you askin' me for?

49
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,000
You got all the answers!
What was all that?

50
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,291
Why did you make me
fight that thing?

51
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,666
Just what the hell
is the Witchblade?

52
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,916
As I've said...

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,791
it exists for one purpose--
doing battle.

54
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,541
That doesn't tell me anything!

55
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,291
Gimme somethin'
I can understand!

56
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,958
No further explanations
are needed.

57
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,041
You should be fully aware
by now of what you've become.

58
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,375
No longer simply human--
you are a living weapon.

59
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,416
Weapon?
Ridiculous!

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,416
I can't be--!

61
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,291
Surely you felt it.

62
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,916
Felt the craving
for destruction.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,875
You initiated combat.

64
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,958
Without the slightest urging
on our behalf.

65
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,791
N-no, you're wrong!

66
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,583
That wasn't me, I--

67
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,875
The influence of the Witchblade
on those who bear it

68
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,625
is immense.

69
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,458
However, with our technology,
we can help you control it.

70
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,958
And I can promise you
a life with your daughter.

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,166
Riko.

72
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,875
Oh my god,
have you found her?

73
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,083
Do not be concerned.

74
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,916
I will have her
brought to you shortly.

75
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
In the meantime,
think hard on this.

76
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,333
Are you able to live
with the burden

77
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,958
that's been placed on you?

78
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,625
I have to hand it to you.

79
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,916
We went through great pains
to find her.

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,375
I won't let her
just walk away.

81
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,916
What of the girl?

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,791
We've not received any word.

83
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,375
That's top priority.

84
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,875
We need to find her
if we wish to use the woman.

85
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,250
What do I do?

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,250
What can I do?

87
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,916
Riko.

88
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,416
If we get separated
for any reason,

89
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,541
we'll meet at the tower
as soon as we can.

90
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,416
Mom will come for me,
I know it!

91
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,666
I have to be there for her
when she does!

92
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,000
Somebody.

93
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,333
Somebody special.

94
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,750
I'll find her
and warm her up real good.

95
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,083
Niiice and warm!

96
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,208
Oop!
Careful.

97
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,750
There.
You gotta watch yourself!

98
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,125
This neighborhood
can be pretty dangerous.

99
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,208
Oh! Thank you!

100
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,500
C'mon.

101
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,708
Why do I gotta go
lookin' for her?

102
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,000
You're the one who brought her
here in the first place!

103
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,291
That makes her
your responsibility!

104
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,041
Yeah, well you're the one
she ran away from!

105
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,583
So I say you should go.

106
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,833
Shaddup!

107
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,541
Tell ya what,
you don't wanna go?

108
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,541
Pay me everything
you still owe me!

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,208
Damn! That's just mean!

110
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,125
No-good bastard!

111
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,625
Naomi.

112
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,750
See if you can tell
where that girl went.

113
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,875
I keep telling you--
it's "Nah-OH-me", not "NOW-me".

114
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,791
The accent is on the "O".

115
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,166
Why can't you at least
try to remember, Mariko.

116
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
It's mean!

117
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,833
Yeah right, sorry.

118
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,666
The accent's on the "O".

119
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,541
"O" is important!

120
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,291
I put the little line
over it and everything!

121
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,375
Where the hell'd you go, kid?
Criminy.

122
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,416
One child, please!

123
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,250
Yes, ma'am!
One child's ticket!

124
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,541
Oh no!

125
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,083
Ah, lemme guess--
pickpocket.

126
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,333
Backpacks aren't good,
they make easy targets.

127
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,083
What do I do?

128
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,958
I have to get to Tokyo Tower!

129
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,166
Uh-mmm.

130
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,500
Yeah, wish I could
help you out!

131
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,125
Thank you anyway.

132
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,000
Hi, boy!

133
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,791
Ahoy there, young lady!

134
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,375
Hey! Mr. Captain!

135
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,458
Life been treatin'
you all right, lass?

136
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,666
Yeah!

137
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,708
Oh come on, that's it?

138
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,625
Mmmm!
Let me make you warm!

139
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,250
Who said that?

140
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,833
I can warm you up real good.

141
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
Nice and warm!

142
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,708
Really, you've done enough!

143
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,541
Enjoy the rest of the ride!

144
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,458
I don't charge that much
for a trip to Tokyo Tower.

145
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,875
I don't mind.
When we came to Tokyo,

146
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,625
my mom and I decided
that just because we're girls,

147
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,625
we wouldn't take advantage
of the kindness of others.

148
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,375
That's a great attitude
to have, Rihoko.

149
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,166
Thank you!

150
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,583
By the way,
after I saw you last,

151
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,208
Child Welfare came by.

152
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,750
They were looking for you.

153
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,833
Um... yeah, them.

154
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,333
We talked to them already,
it was nothing!

155
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,958
F'you say so.

156
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,333
Let me get this straight.

157
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,416
She was here,
but then she disappeared?

158
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,250
She ran away, lady.
How the hell is that my fault?

159
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,625
It's irresponsible!

160
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,833
Child Welfare law
clearly states:

161
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,208
Adults are required
to protect all children!

162
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,166
And to care
for all wayward children

163
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,416
until placed in the custody
of proper authorities!

164
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,291
What a nice story.

165
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,541
Hey, lotsa luck to ya
trackin' her down.

166
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,833
Now listen!

167
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,833
Do you have any idea
how precious children are

168
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,875
in this day and--?

169
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,583
Wha--what are you doing?
I'm not finished!

170
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,250
This is a very important point
I'm trying to make!

171
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Here's my point:
you're hurtin' my business!

172
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,750
Now go on,
get outta here!

173
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,791
Shoo! Shoo-shoo!

174
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Well, I never!

175
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,166
"Find the girl!"

176
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,333
Like I'd even know
where to look!

177
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,125
Child Welfare Center, huh?

178
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,000
Wonder if there's
an easy way to sneak in.

179
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,208
Minato Four-Ten.
Code Zero-Niner.

180
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,500
Tagai Building, back alley.

181
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,666
All units, please respond.

182
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,458
"Oh-Niner?"
That's homicide!

183
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,166
All right.

184
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,000
What're we lookin' at?

185
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,500
The autopsy
will tell us more,

186
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,916
but it seems
the internal organs

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,333
suffered massive trauma

188
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,708
due to extreme
thermodynamic stress.

189
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,041
In English?

190
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,041
To put it simply, sir,
it's as though her insides

191
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,958
went through a microwave oven.

192
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,291
Microwaved on the inside!

193
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,458
The plot thickens.

194
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,208
Another one?

195
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,166
Yes. I believe
an X-Con was responsible.

196
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,333
These incidents
are becoming more frequent.

197
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,083
Is this due to the Witchblade's
reappearance?

198
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,791
Our information
to this point has been

199
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,291
inconclusive at best.

200
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,250
The Doji Group's role,
if any, is also unclear.

201
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,166
Let's find out, shall we?

202
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,791
I think it's time
we knew everything.

203
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,250
What kind of woman does it take
to bear the Witchblade?

204
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,333
So you say she was taken
to this tavern?

205
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,541
Are you certain
you have the right girl?

206
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,791
Sounds like her.
She ran away from there, too.

207
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,958
Gutsy, for a six-year-old.

208
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,500
Maybe it's a family trait?

209
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,666
This is Segawa.
Go ahead.

210
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,916
What? An X-Con?

211
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,791
Yes, sir,
I confirmed it myself.

212
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,791
It was a Type EM.

213
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,875
Thanks for the call.

214
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,250
And please, keep me posted.

215
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,166
Director...

216
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,750
Time is growing short.

217
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,208
Have you thought
about my offer?

218
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,000
What you said to me earlier,

219
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,000
that you would guarantee me
a life with my daughter.

220
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,208
Did you mean that?

221
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,416
Of course.

222
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,875
All right.

223
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,875
What do I have to do?

224
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,750
Bye, Mr. Captain!

225
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,500
Bye, doggie, thank you!

226
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,541
Hold up there, lass!

227
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,166
Here ya go.

228
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,000
I bought me a proper flag,

229
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,791
so you can give this
back to your mom.

230
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,500
The machine you fought
in your altered form earlier

231
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,416
is known as an I-Weapon.

232
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,208
It is our main product.

233
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,541
Product?

234
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,875
One of our more successful
initiatives.

235
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,083
The next generation
of our X-Con project,

236
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,458
which was shut down
due to production issues.

237
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,541
During the Quake,

238
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,416
several X-Con prototypes
were misplaced.

239
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,708
And have yet to be found.

240
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,333
Bye-bye!

241
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,958
They were designed
to appear no different

242
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,375
from any other human being,

243
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,416
nearly impossible
to distinguish.

244
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,333
Naturally, this has hampered
our retrieval of them.

245
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,750
However, their recent actions
have been quite overt.

246
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,875
They've caused
11 deaths so far.

247
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,333
You've seen
what they can do.

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,125
That was one of 'em?

249
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,500
You've already made
short work of one X-Con.

250
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,375
We feel confident
you can do so again.

251
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,291
We'd like you to...
lend us a powerful hand.

252
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,416
If I do this for you,
I get my daughter back?

253
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,916
You have my word.

254
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,416
Mommy!

255
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,791
Mom-meeeee!

256
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,125
Have you made a decision?

257
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,291
Do we have a deal?

258
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,541
Or not?

259
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,000
Decide now.

260
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,000
I need your answer.

261
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,375
Need more.

262
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,166
It wasn't enough!

263
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,458
I need to make it warm.

264
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,083
Nice and warm!

265
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,000
Whatever, I'm fine!
Night!

266
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,333
That scent!

267
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,166
Oh, the aroma!
Just a whiff, but that woman!

268
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,458
Oh! I have to make her warm!

269
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,791
Warm!

270
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,833
Nice and warm!

271
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,333
Warm her up.

272
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,708
I'll just warm her up.

273
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,166
I feel it... the power!

274
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,708
This throbbing.

275
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,833
I can't help myself!

276
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,666
Amazing!

277
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,833
What a find!
I--I need to release!

278
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,041
I'll make you warm!

279
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,583
So warm! Nice and warm!

280
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,958
Warm! Niiice and warm!

281
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,583
Incre--Incredible!

282
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,583
Sooo waaarrm!

283
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,791
You haven't seen me warmed up.

284
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,583
Recovery of the X-Con
is complete, sir.

285
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,916
Excellent, thank you.

286
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,208
I trust the rest can be
handled without incident.

287
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,666
Well, I must say,

288
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,250
I certainly
was not expecting you

289
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,750
to work out so nicely
your first time in the field.

290
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,083
Yeah great,
what about my daughter?

291
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,708
We're still looking.

292
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,958
We learned Rihoko spent
last night at a tavern.

293
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,083
We can try looking there.

294
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,333
Wait! Over there!

295
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,000
Ri-kooooo!

296
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,416
Mommy.

297
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,458
Mommy!

298
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,291
Riko!

299
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,041
Masane! Please, wait
until we touch down!

300
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,000
Mommy!

301
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Riko!

302
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,375
Mommy!

303
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,916
I knew if I waited here,
you'd find me!

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,791
I made a promise, didn't I?

305
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,000
It's been a long time.

306
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,541
Now why would you
be calling me?

307
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,666
Why, the Witchblade.

308
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
Seems a new Bearer
has been chosen.

309
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,416
Let me make you warm.

310
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,875
Niiice and warm!

311
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,625
[Music]

312
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,875
Finally, our new life
in Tokyo can begin.

313
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,208
This suite is nice,

314
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,875
but with all the heavy
security and surveillance,

315
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,125
it doesn't really feel
like home.

316
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,708
We need to find
something else--

317
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,666
a place we can call
our very own.

318
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,875
The building you told me about
sounds kind of nice,

319
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,750
maybe we can try there.

320
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,833
Though, you did say
the landlady was a bit scary.

321
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,875
So now I'm not so sure.
