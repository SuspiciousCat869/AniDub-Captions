1
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,583
It concerns me
that she could be injured

2
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,291
by an older-generation
Neo Gene.

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,291
Maria still needs
some "fine tuning".

4
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,875
With continued training,
I feel confident

5
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,791
this will
no longer be an issue.

6
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,166
Then Nishida
had better train her well.

7
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,291
I will not tolerate
any further setbacks.

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,125
This is our latest
research data.

9
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,333
You realize victory for our side
is now virtually assured.

10
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,375
Either way, I expect
the usual compensation.

11
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,541
Yes, of course.

12
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,916
The funds have already
been transferred.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,041
Good.

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,750
My dear...

15
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,250
you're leaving so soon?

16
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,541
I have a lot of work to do.

17
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,750
And I'd prefer an environment
more conducive to my research.

18
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,583
Watch your back, Takayama.

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,000
[Music]

20
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,416
So, Mr. Cho,
you goin' on a trip?

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,750
Mm-hmm!

22
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,416
Two days and one night
at a fancy seaside resort

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,125
all alone with a whole bunch
of hot college girls!

24
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,708
Hot college girls?

25
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,125
That's right!

26
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,916
I gave Tozawa a hand
with somethin' awhile back,

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,291
and asked him to repay me
in the form of a group date!

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,666
Yeah?

29
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,875
I wasn't aware
Tozawa knew any college girls.

30
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,375
Anyway, this sorta thing
doesn't happen too often,

31
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,500
so I decided to go all out!

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,291
Wait, you've got money for
your little horndog vacation.

33
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,791
But you still can't manage
to pay your back rent?

34
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,208
You know how it is,

35
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,375
once in a lifetime opportunities
and all o' that.

36
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,416
No more excuses,
you old pervert!

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,791
Now gimme the rent money,
all three months of it!

38
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,833
What! Three months?

39
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,250
Swimming in the ocean
sounds like fun!

40
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,000
We can still go
swimming somewhere!

41
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,500
Really, Mom? Can we?

42
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,750
Sure, why not?

43
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,541
I bet the Metro Pool is open.

44
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,291
And after that, we can stop
someplace yummy to eat!

45
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,291
Okay!

46
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,291
Criminy.

47
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,500
The woman's an amnesiac,

48
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,958
yet she still knows
how to stretch a yen.

49
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,875
But how does someone
of your age act?

50
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,500
Hey, tell you what, ladies!

51
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,083
We'd have a lot more fun
if you both came too!

52
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,291
Entirely my treat, of course!

53
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,666
Think of it as an exercise
in family bonding!

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,166
Rent, Cho!

55
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,250
Mari, darling, naturally
you and the lovely Miss Naomi

56
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,750
are invited along
on this epic excursion as well!

57
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,791
Oh boy! All of us
taking a trip?

58
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,666
You sure about this?

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,583
It'll be my pleasure.

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,250
And speaking of that,
I'll even buy you

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,250
a nice teeny-weeny bikini!

62
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,708
And a new suit for Riko, too?

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,083
Hey, why not?

64
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,416
At this point,
I'll buy practically anything!

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,708
Yippee!

66
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,833
It's my first time
swimming in the ocean, Mom!

67
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,166
All things being equal,
I really think

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,875
I'd rather
just have the rent money.

69
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,666
Oh. So you're not gonna go then?

70
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,250
Wait, I didn't say that!

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,791
Good fortune lies within
a floral-patterned suit.

72
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,500
Man,
you guys're awful lively today.

73
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,500
Hey, nice job
settin' up Mr. Cho

74
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,375
with some hot college girls.

75
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,958
Oh great, I guess
the cat's outta the bag, huh?

76
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,166
Though, technically,

77
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,625
I'm not sure
they're actually in college.

78
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,625
Yeah, no big deal, bring as many
people as you want.

79
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,125
I mean, hell, it's not like
I'm paying for it.

80
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,708
Right, whatever,
just bring the girls!

81
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,416
This is gonna cost you.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,541
Like say, I don't know,
one-third your normal rate

83
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,000
for your next scoop?

84
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,500
Come on!
You're killin' me here!

85
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,708
If it makes you feel better,
I've spoken to the girls

86
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,666
in the editing department.

87
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,666
What are they like?

88
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,708
They're um...

89
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,250
why don't you
just wait and see.

90
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,958
Personally, I'm a bit more
interested in you.

91
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,125
Yeah?

92
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,583
As in your future?

93
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,541
'Bout time you started
thinkin' about that, huh?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,208
Yusuke, it's been over six years
since the Great Quake.

95
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,250
Just bring the girls, okay?

96
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,666
Yo, Chief!

97
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,458
Got a question
about tomorrow's meeting!

98
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,250
Yeah. Be right there!

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
C'mon, you guys!

100
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,250
Let's go!

101
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
What's the big hold-up?

102
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,416
Get a move on!

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,291
Criminy!
Keep your pants on!

104
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,916
I'm so excited, I couldn't
sleep at all last night!

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,250
Me neither!

106
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,333
Actually,
that makes three of us!

107
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,458
Hey there, good morning.

108
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,500
You the gang from
the Natsuki Building?

109
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,166
That's us, so you must be--?

110
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,166
Supple!

111
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,166
Long!

112
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,125
Firm!

113
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,791
I'm Kyoko Sasaki.

114
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,625
And these are my coworkers.

115
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,375
Nice to meet all of you!

116
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,291
So not what I expected.

117
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,708
Hey, how's it goin'?

118
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,208
Morning, Yusuke.

119
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,208
It's all yours.

120
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,208
Wha--?

121
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,250
Pictures of our trip!

122
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,250
Take good ones!

123
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,875
Oh, gimme a flippin' break!

124
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,750
You know I hate digital cameras!

125
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,166
Sorry! Can't hear you!

126
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
Like I said,
make sure they're good!

127
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,291
Where's Melony?

128
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,000
Mom's gonna
catch up to us later.

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,083
She had to stop by work first!

130
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
So, could you try
and make this quick?

131
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,291
I'm supposed to be leaving
on a family outing.

132
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,375
Yes, of course.

133
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,291
Just one more moment.

134
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
Here you are.

135
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,458
Your payment for dealing
with the most recent X-Cons.

136
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,041
Thank you!

137
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,750
Tell you guys what,
I'll pick you up some souvenirs.

138
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,083
What would you both want?

139
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,125
There's no need
for such niceties.

140
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,375
You earned that money.

141
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,500
Spend it on your daughter
and yourself.

142
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,166
Well, thank you again, see ya!

143
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
Hold on.

144
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,791
We need to talk.

145
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,708
Can it wait?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

146
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,541
No, it cannot wait.

147
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,708
It's concerning
you and the Witchblade.

148
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,208
Thank you so much
for inviting us, Mr. Cho!

149
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,166
You must be loaded
if you can afford all this!

150
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,666
Um, me? Loaded?

151
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,625
Uh, you have no idea!

152
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,583
Ooh, I like you already!

153
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,125
Nanako, it is the height
of rudeness to throw yourself

154
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,500
at a man you just met!

155
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,083
Whatever, Satomi.

156
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,458
You know you're out
to get with him too!

157
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,250
What? No, I happen to be
bad at computers

158
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
and I wanted some advice.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,708
Some professional advice!

160
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,333
Oh yeah? Why don't I set up a
private lesson for you sometime?

161
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,375
You'd do that?

162
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,875
How sweet of you!

163
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,750
So, hey, Mr. Cho.

164
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,208
When we get there,
you up for a little swim race?

165
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,750
You're on!

166
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,083
Y'know, I work out every day,

167
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,166
so I'm a pretty confident
swimmer!

168
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,250
An athletic type,
color me impressed!

169
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,833
I hope I can stay as active
as you as I grow older, Mr. Cho!

170
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,833
Oh, thank you.

171
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,000
Miki's so unfair!

172
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,000
Listen. My advice?

173
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,958
You gotta think young.
Act young.

174
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,541
Really,
that's all there is to it!

175
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,333
Criminy, what do they see
in that old pervert?

176
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,750
What do you think?

177
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,291
First they heard he made
a fortune from his IT firm.

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,666
Then they found out
he also owns several hotels

179
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,083
and hot springs?

180
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,958
All they see are yen signs.

181
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,708
You jackass!

182
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,166
Couldn't you have made up
something more believable?

183
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,833
How else could I get 'em
to go out with the old goat?

184
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,666
Not my fault if he gets hurt.

185
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,458
Just remember,
karma's a bitch.

186
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,250
Hey. That Tozawa guy
seems like he's pretty cool!

187
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,916
Does he have a girlfriend?

188
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,750
A girlfriend?

189
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm not real sure, why?

190
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
'Cause if he works
for my mom,

191
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,833
she should bring 'im home
some night!

192
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,041
Maybe I'll be brave
and try to get his attention!

193
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,250
You have now had
several occasions

194
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,500
where you've witnessed
how the Neo-Genes perish.

195
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,083
Yeah?

196
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,541
The Cloneblade's extensive
power and abilities

197
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,208
place an immense burden
on its host.

198
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,833
The body begins to slowly
deteriorate

199
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,125
until it is ultimately consumed.

200
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,333
Our only conclusion
is that's what happens

201
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,916
to bearers of the genuine
Witchblade as well.

202
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,416
You mean...

203
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,333
So I'll end up like them?

204
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
Yes.

205
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,958
Especially if you continue
to use it as you have been.

206
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,291
You need to start avoiding
any unnecessary fights.

207
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,208
I realize
you're trying to earn money

208
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,541
for your daughter's sake.

209
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,750
But don't forget,
you're also the only mother

210
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,250
that little girl has.

211
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,041
I know.

212
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,458
Please, Masane.

213
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,291
You need to live to watch her
grow into womanhood.

214
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,250
The longer the better, actually,
since when you do perish,

215
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,416
the Witchblade
will be passed down to her.

216
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,875
Segawa!

217
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,083
I'm sorry, Director,
but it's the truth.

218
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,333
We know Reina's compatibility
dropped greatly

219
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,791
after giving birth to Rihoko.

220
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,958
What's he saying?

221
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,791
Explain!

222
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,041
Six years back,

223
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,375
during her stint working
alongside the Doji Group,

224
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,708
Reina Soho tested very highly
for compatibility

225
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,500
with the Witchblade.

226
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,875
But after she gave birth,

227
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,583
those numbers dropped
significantly.

228
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,083
In all likelihood, the earlier
results were not indicative

229
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,875
of Reina's compatibility,

230
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,583
but instead were readings
of the unborn daughter

231
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,750
growing inside of her...
Rihoko.

232
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,875
In short,
you're only a temporary host

233
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,666
until Rihoko is old enough.

234
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,500
A placeholder of sorts.

235
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,208
You're lying!

236
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,416
Rihoko.

237
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,833
I apologize, sir.

238
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,708
I honestly thought Masane
had already realized this.

239
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
Forget it.

240
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,250
Won't happen.

241
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
If it does...

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,041
if anyone ever even tries
to put this thing on Rihoko,

243
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,083
I'll kill them myself!

244
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,541
Warm summer sun,

245
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,291
sparkling waves,

246
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,833
snow-white sand,

247
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,125
and of course,

248
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,791
a bevy of beautiful-bodied
bikini babes!

249
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,791
Bam!

250
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,208
Bam! Oh God, why?

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,208
How rude!

252
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,500
Come along now, sweetheart!

253
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,375
I can hear the ocean
calling our names!

254
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,166
Yes! Let's get wet!

255
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,958
Mr. Cho, you said you'd get
some shaved ice with me!

256
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,666
One cup, two spoons,
you promised! Remember?

257
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,083
Nice try, sister.

258
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,375
Mr. Cho's comin' with me!

259
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,958
No! He's buying me
a shaved ice!

260
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,000
Now, now, ladies!

261
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,750
There's no need
to fight over me!

262
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,000
Pardon me, Mr. Cho?

263
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,791
If it's not too much trouble,

264
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,166
could you help me with this?

265
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner!

266
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,833
Excuse me, girls.

267
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,041
So tell me, Mr. Cho,
is it true,

268
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,083
do you really own
this whole beach?

269
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,625
Oh, uhh, yeah!

270
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,041
Yeah, I guess I do!

271
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,041
Wait! Oil me up too!

272
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,791
No, me!
Then I'll do your back!

273
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,916
I've died and gone to heaven!

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,375
And I went too far?

275
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,166
Don't let Mr. Cho
have all the fun!

276
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,875
Why don't you go and talk
to one of them?

277
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,875
Too much trouble.

278
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,583
Thought he was the old man.

279
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,750
Since when do girls
like that work for you?

280
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,541
Isn't he great?

281
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,458
Whatever do you mean?

282
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,125
Take us with you!

283
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,708
So! What shall
the three of us go do?

284
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,791
Oh, what was I thinking?

285
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,333
I knew I shouldn't have come!

286
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,083
What're you talkin' about?

287
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,500
It's adorable,
it looks great on you!

288
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,750
Are, are you sure?

289
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,875
C'mon, girls,
what's the big holdup?

290
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,125
We're at the beach,
don't be embarrassed, honey!

291
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,375
If ya got it, flaunt it!

292
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Naomi!

293
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,791
Oh my gosh,
Riko, that's amazing!

294
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,833
You nailed it
dead center every time!

295
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,416
What's your secret?

296
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
I dunno,
I don't really think about it,

297
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,875
I just sorta aim
where it feels right.

298
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
Cool, that's what I'll do.

299
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,416
Hey, girls?

300
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,375
I think we've done our damage.

301
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,375
You're all
a bunch of amateurs!

302
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,125
The true watermelon-smashing
has just begun!

303
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,041
Tremble in awe as you face:

304
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,041
"Double Blind Lovey-Dovey
Tag Team!"

305
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,833
Lovey-Dovey Tag Team?

306
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,166
You're so heavy!

307
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,041
Now, let's see, where can we
find the watermelon?

308
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,875
Is it over here?

309
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,458
Or, maybe right over here!

310
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,875
Oh, Mr. Cho!

311
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,666
You're so naughty!

312
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,625
That's not how tag-team works!

313
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,666
What do you know?

314
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,125
This is a team-based sport

315
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,333
that blends traditional
Japanese art

316
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,833
with the ancient martial art
of melon smashing!

317
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,833
Your filthy ploy is so obvious,
you old freak!

318
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,833
Too much, huh?

319
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,291
Yeah, right?

320
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,083
Show a little restraint,
there are children present!

321
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,250
Mom!

322
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,166
I finally caught up to ya!

323
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,583
They gave me a bonus,
so I took the bullet train!

324
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,875
So, Riko,
has the ocean been fun?

325
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,250
Yeah, you bet!
Guess what?

326
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,000
I met a new friend
named Yuuki!

327
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,958
Wow, Riko's mom is hot!

328
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,625
She's way different
from you, Mom!

329
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,041
What was that?

330
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,458
I just mean
you look different.

331
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,125
Like your jugs.

332
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,583
Is that the kind of stuff
that comes out of this mouth!

333
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,166
So the whole gang's
finally here.

334
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,041
My God, Melony's got
a dynamite, gorgeous body!

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,333
I'll make you pay
for that remark!

336
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,500
Y'know, I don't think
I've ever seen you take

337
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,333
plain-old snapshots before.

338
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,208
Well, it's kinda by force,

339
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,958
and she knows
how much I hate digital gear.

340
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,208
Lemme guess.

341
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,375
Can't say no to the news editor,
can you?

342
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
Whatsamatter,
she got somethin' on ya?

343
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,458
Stop right there.

344
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,083
We're just old acquaintances.

345
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Thank you.

346
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,750
For what?

347
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,083
The only reason
you owed Mr. Cho

348
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,833
was because you were
trying to help Riko and me.

349
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,333
It was for the scoop.

350
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,000
By the way, I still expect
that interview sometime!

351
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,791
My interviews don't come cheap,
you know!

352
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,791
Excuse me?

353
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,458
Riko! It's lunchtime!

354
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,625
'Kay!

355
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,500
So what do you s'pose
those two were talking about?

356
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,250
Who knows.

357
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,875
Guess I'm no match
for her grownup charm.

358
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,541
That's silly, Yuuki,
you've got plenty of charm.

359
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,875
Well, I'm not getting
any help from you!

360
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,041
If you actually tried,
you could land a guy like him!

361
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,416
Just find a good man already!

362
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,791
Yes, ma'am!

363
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,000
I haven't done this
in so long.

364
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,000
It's hard
when you work all the time.

365
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,250
I hear you're
a single mother too, right?

366
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,458
Yeah, this is the closest thing
to a vacation we've ever had.

367
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,250
It can be a real burden
sometimes, can't it?

368
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,333
You want to be there for her
at every possible moment.

369
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,000
But it doesn't always
work out that way.

370
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,208
So how do you deal with it
when that happens?

371
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,625
Simple,
I deal with it with love.

372
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,000
I cancel out the sadness
I've caused by loving her

373
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,208
with every fiber of my being.

374
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,833
Love, that's it?

375
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
I wouldn't worry.

376
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,916
You're doing great
in that department.

377
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,333
I can tell
just by looking at Riko.

378
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,750
She's the one treasure
I have in this life.

379
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,041
If it came to it,

380
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,583
I bet there's nothing
I couldn't do for her.

381
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,916
I know what you mean.

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,708
No matter how exhausted
I might be,

383
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,666
as soon as I see Yuuki's face,

384
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
I feel like I can
take on the world!

385
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
Exactly!

386
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,875
Rumor has it, Mr. Cho, that
you also own a resort in Bali!

387
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,166
I'd love to go
scuba diving there!

388
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,083
Uh, Bali, yeah, sure!

389
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,708
I dunno about this.

390
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,083
Mr. Cho, 'fess up.

391
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,166
You're not really rich,
are you?

392
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,166
Nanako!
That's disrespectful!

393
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,791
Well, he doesn't
seem to have a yacht,

394
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,416
or we'd have taken it here.

395
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,250
And if he owns this hotel,
how come he's paying for stuff?

396
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,583
Something's not right!

397
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,083
Good point,
well, Mr. Cho?

398
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,625
I thought
I recognized him before!

399
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,500
Girls, look! It's Michael!

400
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,333
Oh my God, it is Michael!

401
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,458
I can't believe I didn't
notice him this whole time!

402
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,833
I never dreamed
I'd meet the Michael

403
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,666
in a place like this!

404
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,291
Wait.
Did I miss something?

405
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,541
Is Michael famous?

406
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,666
You don't know!

407
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,416
Only super-lame losers
have never heard of Michael!

408
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,625
That just proves it!

409
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,125
You may act young
on the outside,

410
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,666
but on the inside,
you're just an old man.

411
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,125
That is so pathetic.

412
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,250
Michael!

413
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,666
I'll come swim with you!

414
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,291
You, Michael...

415
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,500
are dead to me.

416
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,666
Ooh! Check this one out, Riko!

417
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,666
It looks just like
a piece of candy!

418
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,958
Yeah! It does!

419
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,250
Pretty!

420
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,458
Cool! Hey, try and see
if they'll fit together!

421
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,833
Wow!

422
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,083
Did you know?

423
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,500
When you find
two different seashells

424
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,958
that fit exactly right,

425
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,791
it means you'll never be apart
from someone you love!

426
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,500
Someone I love?

427
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,833
So you should give them
to somebody

428
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,166
you never want to be away from!

429
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,208
I guess it's kinda
like a good luck charm!

430
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,083
Now I gotta find some!

431
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,625
Then someday,
when I'm older,

432
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,916
and I have a boyfriend of
my own, I can give them to him!

433
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,208
Mom!

434
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,000
We're gonna head back
to the hotel now!

435
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,541
You guys must be starving!

436
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,958
Yeah!

437
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,791
So, did you two find
lots of seashells out there?

438
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,083
Uh-huh! I'm gonna make mine
into a necklace later!

439
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,833
Here, Mom.
I have something for you.

440
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,625
What is it?

441
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,541
Ooh, it's so pretty!

442
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,166
Is this really for me?

443
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,250
Hm-mmm.

444
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,666
When two shells fit together,

445
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,916
it means you'll never be apart
from someone you love!

446
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,916
Yuuki taught me about that!

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Now we'll always
be together, Mom!

448
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,208
Is that so?

449
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,666
Then thank you, Riko.

450
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,083
I'll treasure it always.

451
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,708
Dark summer ocean.

452
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,583
My tears should be those of joy.

453
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,625
But all is now lost.

454
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,291
Okay, who's ready
for another sparkler?

455
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,375
No thanks, Mr. Cho, I'm good!

456
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,916
Please don't go yet, Rihoko,

457
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you're the only one
I have left!

458
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,833
Save the lectures, will ya?

459
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,750
What are you
actin' all tough for?

460
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,916
I caught you havin'
a good time earlier!

461
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,625
And it might just
be this talkin',

462
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,000
but I get a good feeling
about you and Masane!

463
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,333
Yeah, she seems real sweet.

464
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,166
Young, and attractive,
holds together a family.

465
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,958
She gets
the "Kyoko Seal of Approval!"

466
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,541
Don't be an idiot!

467
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,291
I don't see her
in that way at all.

468
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,708
Yeah, whatever!

469
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,416
I saw the gentle look
in your eye

470
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,208
when you were taking pictures
of the two of 'em.

471
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,208
Mom!

472
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,208
Hi, sweetie!
I was just headin' your way!

473
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,333
I dunno where
she gets her ideas!

474

Ka-bloo-yah!

477
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,041
Cool!

478
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,250
Yep.

479
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,416
Did you have
a good time, Riko?

480
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,958
Oh, yeah, the best!

481
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,416
I really hope all of us can
come back here again sometime!

482
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,000
That would be fun!

483
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,583
We should definitely
come back!

484
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,000
[Music]

485
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,250
Swimming in the ocean
was so fun, Mom!

486
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,916
But my sunburn sure hurt
when I got into the bath!

487
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,833
I hope I get to see
Yuuki again soon!

488
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,208
And Mom, I know you said
we'd take another trip sometime,

489
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,958
but I know
you're busy with work,

490
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,500
so there's no rush!

491
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,833
And I only say that

492
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,583
because you've been acting
a little strange lately.

493
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,416
The beach was lots of fun,
but we don't always

494
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,666
have to go on a trip
or go shopping.

495
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,416
I just like being
with you, Mom!
