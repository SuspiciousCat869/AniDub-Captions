1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,666
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,166
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,208
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,333
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,625
Righteous Sword of God,

6
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,458
or Hand of the Devil himself?

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,750
A new Bearer finds out

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,541
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,041
[Music]

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,166
Really?

11
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,125
That's all you've got?
How disappointing.

12
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,333
I expected
so much more from you.

13
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,791
I've got plenty more.

14
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,291
This little dance
is just gettin' started!

15
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,375
If you refuse
to take this seriously,

16
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,583
I won't enjoy killing you.

17
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,166
Then by all means...

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,291
let's get serious!

19
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,916
You've got nice moves.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,583
In fact, I think
I'm starting to like you.

21
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,041
Thank you, I'll pass.

22
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,375
Suh-weet!

23
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,333
I won't miss again!

24
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,125
C'mon! Get up!

25
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,375
Those cracks.

26
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,250
I said, get up!

27
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,041
Fight me!

28
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,000
Ah, this is lookin' ugly.

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,833
She's gonna
get herself killed.

30
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,958
Wait, is she laughing?

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,083
Shiori.

32
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,750
What's the matter?

33
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,666
You can't give up while
we're having so much fun.

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
Damn. Melony!

35
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,500
Let's move!

36
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,791
Osada! We gotta roll!

37
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,250
We're gone!

38
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,666
She is my prey!

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,041
She will not escape!

40
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,083
Shiori! Come back here!

41
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,958
And I thought
I had a scoop before!

42
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,333
This should do it.

43
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,791
How's it look out there?

44
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,166
She's still on our tail.

45
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,500
As long as
the van's armor holds,

46
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,666
we should be fine.

47
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,541
Try'n buy us some time!

48
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,125
Roger that.

49
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,375
Pardon the intrusion.

50
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,541
Is there anything wrong?

51
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,041
No, not at all.

52
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,208
Nothing serious,
but it is urgent.

53
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,041
Accept my apologies,

54
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,500
I must return
to my office right away.

55
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,458
I understand.

56
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,750
I'm glad we had a chance
to talk after all this time.

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,958
And I as well.

58
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,208
Now if you will excuse me.

59
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,583
I pray we may
avoid our past mistakes.

60
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,791
And ensure
the tragedy of six years ago

61
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,000
does not repeat itself.

62
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,708
If there is ever a way
I might be able to help you,

63
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,750
please,
do not hesitate to ask.

64
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,291
That man is a lying weasel.

65
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,708
It is inconceivable to me
that he is unaware

66
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,083
of the Cloneblades'
attack on Masane.

67
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,791
However, we're still
claiming ignorance

68
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,750
in regards to the Witchblade.

69
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,833
So we couldn't
rightly call his bluff.

70
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,875
Regardless, we must avoid
direct confrontation

71
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,625
with the NSWF.

72
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,458
It's Doji Group policy.

73
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,083
Since when do you
follow the rules?

74
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,375
What's the current situation?

75
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,416
They're using Emergency
Extraction Route A.

76
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,458
That means they're headed
for the laboratories.

77
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,541
Is that bad?

78
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,250
In this case,
somewhere unaffiliated

79
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,458
with the Doji Group
would be best.

80
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,750
Have you sent
for my cabin cruiser?

81
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,458
I anticipated you might want
to leave before we docked, sir.

82
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,166
I've had her
following us all evening.

83
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,416
All right, we'll meet up
with you there.

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,541
And hurry!

85
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,166
Right!
We're on our way!

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,458
New plan: Crescent Bridge!

87
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,750
Ah, crap!

88
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,500
She's right on top of us!

89
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,750
See if you can shake her!

90
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,750
Okay, hang on!

91
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,125
Got a stubborn one!

92
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,916
Do it, now!

93
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,708
Damn it!
There's no time.

94
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,458
We're not gonna
make the rendezvous.

95
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,166
Come on!

96
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,291
I found you!

97
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,083
You won't slip away again!

98
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,625
Nine--
Eight--

99
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,541
Seven--
Six--

100
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,625
Five--
Four--

101
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,583
Three--
Two--

102
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,958
One--
Zero!

103
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,416
Oh, man.
It's rainin' scoops!

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,958
I gotta check out that van!

105
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,875
Let another team
retrieve the vehicle.

106
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,375
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,750
Transfer complete, Director.

108
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,750
Good. Move out.

109
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,250
That's enough!

110
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,708
Shiori!
Get a hold of yourself!

111
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,083
Shiori!

112
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,250
Do you know who I am?

113
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,000
Doctor.

114
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,291
Damn it! I can't get anything
through all o' this smoke.

115
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,791
'Sides, who the hell
are these people

116
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,958
with all their resources?

117
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,166
First, an armored van,
and now a cabin cruiser?

118
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,458
What's Melony
gotten herself into?

119
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,583
She's in pretty bad condition.

120
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,041
You'll have to
treat her here.

121
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625
It's safer if we stay at sea
for a while.

122
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,625
Understood, sir.

123
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,708
How are you feeling?

124
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,333
I'm fine, Doctor.

125
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,916
Really,
you're overreacting,

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,875
this isn't necessary.

127
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,166
I just let myself get
a little too worked up, is all.

128
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,250
I hope so,

129
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,541
but I would like to run
a complete checkup.

130
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,375
It gives us important data.

131
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,625
Still...

132
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,000
to have you oversee
my treatment personally.

133
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,541
All right.

134
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,708
Try and get some rest.

135
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,166
'Kay.

136
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,666
Take that sample
down to the lab, if you would.

137
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,083
Make sure to use my name
so it gets priority.

138
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
Yes'm.

139
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,833
Oh.

140
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,708
Mom sure is working
really hard.

141
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,666
So I'll work hard too!

142
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,166
Here ya go.

143
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
Criminy!
He's got his own room

144
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,833
he doesn't even pay me for,
why's he sleeping out here?

145
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,791
C'mon, ya bum!
Wakey-wakey!

146
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,625
My cafe does not double
as your spare bedroom.

147
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,166
Did uh, Melony
come home last night?

148
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,458
What, you mean,
you were waiting up for her?

149
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,000
You dirty dog, I didn't know
she was your type!

150
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,541
Uh no, it's nothing
like that.

151
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,916
I assure you,
it's purely work-related.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,166
What work?

153
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,833
Sorry, sweetheart,
can't say just yet.

154
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,791
Sounds like
a load o' B.S. to me.

155
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,875
Patience, you'll see.

156
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,625
Good morning, everybody!

157
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,291
You're all looking
a bit pale as usual!

158
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,750
But fear not,
for young Rihoko has prepared

159
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,166
the ultimate breakfast
for each and every one of you!

160
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,458
Voila!

161
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,958
I went a little overboard
and made way too much!

162
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,208
Hey! More is better!

163
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,166
Naomi, darling.

164
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,333
That plate in front of you
is as sad as your precious face!

165
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,250
You need a pick-me-up!

166
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,041
Now you just wait a minute!

167
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,000
Speaking of,
Mari, coffee, please!

168
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,708
Hellooo.

169
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,750
You in there?

170
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,750
Here! Try some!

171
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,166
Uhh, yo...

172
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,041
Do you know if your...

173
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,000
ma ever happened
to make it home last night?

174
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,083
Hm-mm.
She was at work.

175
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,666
At work, huh?

176
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,291
So, what kinda work
does she do exactly?

177
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,000
My mom does odd jobs.

178
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,833
Right now, she's working
at a big important company.

179
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,250
A big important company, huh?

180
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,333
What's it called?

181
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,958
Why are you so curious
about my mom?

182
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,750
Can't tell you now,
ask me later.

183
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,500
Tozawa, my boy!

184
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,500
Rihoko doesn't need to be
around your influence too much,

185
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,208
you're far too old for her!

186
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,416
Yeah, Cho,
you're one to talk.

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,875
Yes, but she and I
are friends, right?

188
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,875
Yeah!

189
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,250
Come along, Rihoko.

190
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,750
Let us sit together
and enjoy our meals.

191
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,083
Okay!

192
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,875
I don't care
what this story is.

193
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,333
Leave the kid out.

194
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,333
Got it?

195
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,083
Yeah right, I got it.

196
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,916
Divine!

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Oh my, it's, it's delicious!

198
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,083
You think so?

199
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,375
I tried something new
this time,

200
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,291
I put in a touch of mustard!

201
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,250
You are quite the gourmet,
young lady!

202
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:45,125
Ooh, I tell ya, if only
I were 60 years younger!

203
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
Are you sure it's wise
to inhale your food like that?

204
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,708
Back off!

205
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,291
Using the Witchblade always
makes me freakin' starving!

206
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,958
You clearly don't eat
like a person

207
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,666
who almost died last night.

208
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,458
Didn't your mother
teach you how to knock?

209
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,125
Her recovery rate
is truly astounding, Director.

210
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,708
Far better
than we ever expected

211
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,625
of the Witchblade's
capabilities.

212
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,791
That is impressive.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,083
Hey!

214
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,291
Get your hand off me!

215
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,666
Yes, I see.

216
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
Her healing rate has increased
rather dramatically.

217
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,500
Send the new data to the lab.

218
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,500
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,833
That's it!
I've had enough,

220
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,708
I'm not your damn hamster!

221
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,916
Not my hamster?

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,083
I believe she meant to say
"guinea pig."

223
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,083
Whatever.
I'm going home now!

224
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,333
Thanks, it's been real!

225
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,166
You might want to look
out the window.

226
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,833
What the hell is this?

227
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,458
We've been at sea all night,

228
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,875
so we're a considerable
distance from shore.

229
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,333
We're on a course
for the harbor now,

230
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,583
but we still have some time
before we arrive.

231
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,750
What the crap?!

232
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,875
I haven't even been able
to talk to Rihoko!

233
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,208
Then, by all means,
give her a call.

234
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,458
Ah, but first let me
change your bandages.

235
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,000
Remove your clothing, please.

236
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,625
I need to see how your wounds
are healing as well.

237
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,625
Are you telling me
you did this?

238
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,083
You needn't be concerned.

239
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,208
I am also a registered nurse.

240
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,541
That's not what I'm...

241
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,541
Oh, great.

242
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,583
And I suppose you were there
for all this too?

243
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,083
Would that have been preferred?

244
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
Did you want for me to watch?

245
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,208
Hell no, I didn't!

246
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,500
Wait! Masane!

247
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,041
Get out.

248
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,791
Scumbag-lecher-pervert-freaks!

249
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,291
Icky-icky!!!

250
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,458
I'm a bit concerned.

251
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,041
This type of laceration

252
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,583
should have completely
healed by now.

253
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,041
But it doesn't hurt, Doctor.

254
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,750
Not at all.

255
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,333
I see.

256
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,916
She's clearly undergoing
some kind of change.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,541
But into what?

258
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,125
Are you certain?

259
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
Yes ma'am, one of the
groundskeepers just found it.

260
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,583
Call Cadaver Disposal
down in the morgue.

261
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
Father will not be pleased

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,458
if any commotion is raised
over an incident here.

263
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,541
Best to handle it
quietly in-house.

264
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,583
Y-yes, ma'am.

265
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
Doctor...

266
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,291
could it be an X-Con?

267
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,666
That is one possibility.

268
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,916
Then I can go--

269
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,291
Nowhere.
You stay put.

270
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,291
But, I...

271
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,708
That's an order, Shiori.

272
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,916
You're confined to bed
until we get your test results.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,625
Doctor...

274
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:56,375
If an X-Con were this close,
you and I would have sensed it.

275
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,416
It's something else.

276
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,708
I'm comin'.

277
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,375
Odd Jobs Amaha!

278
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,041
Oh, hi, Mom!

279
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,166
Sure! Mister Cho
and everybody else is here,

280
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,541
so I'm not lonely!
But what about you, Mom?

281
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,000
Are you okay?
Are you eating right?

282
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,083
Uh-huh! Though the food
wasn't near as good

283
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,625
as your cooking.

284
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,250
Stuff at work is taking
a little longer than I expected.

285
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,375
so make sure and tell Mr. Cho
if you need anything.

286
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,791
'Kay. Thank you.

287
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,458
I'll work really hard.

288
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,375
Don't worry about it!

289
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,166
Bye, sweetie!

290
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,083
Y'know...

291
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,125
from this angle,
he's not half bad.

292
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,583
Yes, what is it?

293
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,625
Oh! Uhh...

294
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,333
No, nothing!

295
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,708
Uhh...

296
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,916
just I heard the salt air's
no good for your hair.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,458
So, be careful!

298
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,625
You are one strange woman,
you know that?

299
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
Here you are, ensnared
by this bizarre weapon

300
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
called the Witchblade,

301
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,833
drawn into deadly battle
night after night,

302
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:15,583
yet you neither cry nor shout
about the lot you've been given.

303
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,166
Just the money.

304
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,458
Perhaps you simply don't have
the brains to wrap around it.

305
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:24,000
Wha--? Jeez, rude much?
Of course I wonder.

306
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,625
Every day, I wonder
why I was chosen for this,

307
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,166
whether I can handle it.

308
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,666
I wonder why everyone wants
the Witchblade for themselves.

309
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,166
And?

310
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,666
Well...

311
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,666
What can you do, y'know?

312
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,791
"What can you do?"

313
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,208
Yeah, "what can you do?"

314
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,166
What happens, happens.

315
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,625
What's important to me now
is trying to give Rihoko

316
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,208
the life she deserves.

317
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,833
Admirable.

318
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,541
Then again...

319
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,208
"Then again", what?

320
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:04,958
Nothin'.

321
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,208
But I'm curious,

322
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,416
does all o' this
qualify me for workers comp?

323
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
You want workers comp?

324
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,625
Damn straight I do,
I got injured on the job!

325
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,291
Don't I get
some kind of compensation?

326
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,916
Oh! Runnin' away, eh?

327
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,666
Don't you try'n stiff me!

328
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,166
It appears I was correct.

329
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,166
In the end,
you are simply brainless.

330
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,541
What'd you call me?

331
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,333
Well, you're nothin'
but a cheapskate.

332
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,166
Cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap-
cheap-cheap-cheap!

333
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:38,583
This pic's the equivalent
of snappin' a live alien or UFO.

334
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,416
Gotta be careful
how I roll with this.

335
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,041
I mean, this is the big scoop
I've been waitin' for, right?

336
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,875
A good first impression
is essential

337
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,583
in your line of work,
Naomi, darling.

338
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,958
Yeah, that's right!

339
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,666
We could do something
with your hair, Miss Naomi.

340
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,250
And I can show you
some makeup tricks

341
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,375
I learned
during my time in France.

342
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,916
They work like magic!

343
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,166
Criminy, he tore
outta here in a hurry.

344
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,541
Like the bum's
got somewhere to be.

345
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,583
Ol' Tozawa hasn't been
hangin' out with us much lately.

346
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,500
Still thinks
he's a reporter.

347
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,750
Figures.

348
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,708
All the signs I see are bad.

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,666
Melony's gotta have
some corporate backers

350
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,250
footin' the bill.

351
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,083
'Bout time I found out who.

352
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,000
Structurally, the Cloneblades
are virtually identical

353
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,708
to the Witchblade.

354
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,291
So what's gone wrong?

355
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,083
What is this?

356
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,208
My God!

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,166
Are you feeling any better?

358
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,000
Why, yes.

359
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,333
Much.

360
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,916
In fact...

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,083
this won't hurt a bit.

362
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,041
How dare he treat me
like some bimbo?

363
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm so pissed at that...

364
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,166
that...

365
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,833
Holy crap, is that...?

366
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,416
Out of the way!

367
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,083
Shiori...

368
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,416
Shiori, look at me!

369
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:52,041
Doctor?
I-I feel weird.

370
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,125
[Music]

371
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,833
Hey, Mom.

372
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,500
I know you're super busy
with work right now,

373
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,708
so I just want to
make sure you know

374
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,583
that I'll be just fine!

375
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,666
I have Mr. Cho
and Miss Mariko here,

376
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,416
so I won't be lonely!

377
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,625
By the way, that Tozawa guy
is totally after you.

378
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,291
And let me tell you,
I do not approve!

379
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,125
I mean,
he's so not your type,

380
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,375
and you can so easily find
somebody way cooler.

381
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,416
But don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on him.

382
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,166
You just focus on your work,
and I'll see you real soon!
