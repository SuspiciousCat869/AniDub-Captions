1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,666
What are all these?

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,625
They're the data files
on the mothers.

3
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,625
Check it out.

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,125
What? The mothers?

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,500
These are the women
who provided their genetic stock

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,083
to create the newest
generation of Neo-Genes.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,750
This is her.

8
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,791
This is my mom!

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,166
Okay.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,875
We've kept
our end of the bargain.

11
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,750
Now let us get our readings.

12
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,083
It's imperative now that you're
wearing the Cloneblade.

13
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,291
I have such high hopes
for you, Maria.

14
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,166
You may well be
the perfect Neo-Gene.

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,166
I know who my mom is.

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,458
I know now.

17
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,500
[Music]

18
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,166
I gotta try to stop
thinkin' about her.

19
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,666
My breakdown
is progressing quickly.

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,041
Deterioration of my mental
condition has also begun.

21
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,583
However, the sensation is not
as unpleasant as anticipated.

22
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,041
In fact, it feels rather nice.

23
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,291
Could this have been
how Shiori felt

24
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,750
when she began to break down?

25
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,125
Or is this sensation instead
a result of some other factor?

26
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,916
Perhaps my latent
maternal instincts.

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,833
It's unknown.

28
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,708
Sorry, no Kahlua.

29
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,083
This place...

30
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,708
It's so quiet.

31
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,166
Yeah.

32
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
That's why my old man
bought this place out here.

33
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,208
So...

34
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,208
all of this...

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,916
Was this just...
to comfort me?

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,166
Well, uh--

37
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,958
Never mind.
You don't have to tell me.

38
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,208
Hey, what's up?

39
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,041
Finally, I got through!

40
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,750
Where the hell are you?

41
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,041
Um, around.

42
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,166
Listen, you gotta
go get Rihoko right now!

43
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,708
Check this out.

44
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,375
The NSWF's sisters aren't
just a group of random chicks

45
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,750
with good breeding.

46
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,291
They put their own genes
back in the mix,

47
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,458
as the mothers
of the next wave.

48
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,625
It's some weird-ass,
jacked-up inbreeding thing.

49
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,208
Inbreeding? What?

50
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,208
This is what I got so far.

51
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,208
Basically, these "sisters"
are all created

52
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,791
using the genes
from the same "father."

53
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,833
So, each new generation
may have new mother genes,

54
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,875
but they keep usin'
the same dude.

55
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,250
This guy's like the father,

56
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,000
husband and grandpa
to all these girls.

57
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,500
See what I mean by jacked-up?

58
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,125
From what I can tell, there's
only one prime candidate.

59
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,791
The father's "Father."

60
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,083
Are you serious?

61
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,541
I dunno what
the old guy's up to,

62
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
but it can't be
anything good.

63
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:52,125
And though she may have
walked away from the NSWF,

64
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,750
that Reina Soho chick
is still one of the sisters.

65
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,125
She's still a part
of all this craziness.

66
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,583
You have got to
get Rihoko back!

67
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,958
There's no way you can
leave her with that monster.

68
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,458
Hey Melony,
are you listenin' to me?

69
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,166
If she's a monster, so am I.

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you sayin'?

71
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,041
I'm not fit to be her mother,
I never was.

72
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,500
Melony!

73
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Damn it!

74
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,416
What the hell
has gotten into her?

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
Not fit to be her mom, my ass.

76
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
What was that about?

77
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,291
He told me
I have to take Rihoko back

78
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,000
because Reina's a monster.

79
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,250
Like I can
really judge her for that.

80
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,041
Look at me.

81
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,833
Reina was there
to save Rihoko's life.

82
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,333
Not once, but twice.

83
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,458
Besides, Reina is rich.

84
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,250
She's a doctor,
and above all else,

85
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,000
she's Riko's biological mother.

86
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,791
I'm pretty certain
she can make Rihoko much happier

87
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,041
than I ever could.

88
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,791
If you truly think that,

89
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,958
you have nothing more
to worry about.

90
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,250
Yeah, right.

91
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,125
Here's your breakfast, Maria.

92
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
Dr. Nishida is going to be
out on business for the day.

93
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,416
So she told me
you can take today off.

94
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,833
Seriously?

95
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,916
I can get the car and take you
shopping if you'd like.

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
No thanks!

97
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,416
I'll just stay here and play.

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,250
Fine, I'll be back
to check on you later.

99
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,125
She's my mom.

100
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,916
So she has to be with me!

101
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,291
You do know
it's against regulations

102
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,875
to copy personal data,
don't you?

103
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,250
I'm just takin' a few notes.

104
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,500
That stuff is really
not supposed to be seen

105
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,333
by outsiders.

106
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,791
Like you weren't supposed
to be seen with that chick?

107
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,500
Bet your wife would love to see
the shots I got of you two.

108
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,666
Here we go!

109
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,041
Um...

110
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,583
are you feeling better now?

111
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,583
Y'know, 'cause you weren't
feeling good last night.

112
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,833
Oh, right.

113
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,833
It was nothing.

114
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,083
I'll be just fine.

115
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,583
Stay here.

116
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,333
Hi, Mom!

117
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,875
What is that?

118
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,083
Tell me.

119
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,125
I've never seen
that version of the blade.

120
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,958
And I don't recognize her.

121
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,208
She's a next generation
Neo-Gene.

122
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,708
What do you want?

123
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,291
What is that thing?

124
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,166
This girl is my daughter.

125
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
Your what?

126
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,791
No, she can't be.

127
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,583
And you can't be her mom
because you're mine.

128
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,541
My mom!

129
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,583
This one is dangerous.

130
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,125
She has no boundaries.

131
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,333
I remember from that file.

132
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,875
I get it now.

133
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,333
That must be
my big sister, right?

134
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,125
That's right.

135
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,458
Why is it so scrawny?

136
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,000
It's because
she was born naturally.

137
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,500
The file said it was dead.

138
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,333
Then the file is incorrect.

139
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,250
Or perhaps
it was altered on purpose.

140
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,875
I don't care
about your excuses!

141
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,791
Go to the garage
and wait in the car.

142
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,125
Go.

143
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,625
Why don't you try to calm down
and we'll have a nice talk.

144
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,291
I need to go out
and do some shopping.

145
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,041
Do you mind
waiting here for a while?

146
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,250
Okay!

147
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,958
Wow! Is all this stuff for me?

148
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
Wait a minute.

149
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,125
They belong to it.

150
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,500
They lied to me.

151
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,125
It's all a big lie.

152
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,416
This isn't the way
that everything

153
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,375
was supposed to work out.

154
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,375
Why?

155
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,583
Tell me.

156
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,208
I trained
and I studied so hard.

157
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,458
So I could find out
who my mom is.

158
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,958
I wanna know.

159
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,083
Why is my mom living here
with that thing?

160
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,458
Why won't she give me
a big hug and a kiss?

161
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,750
Why, Mom?

162
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,750
Why!

163
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,833
Why!

164
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,208
Why!

165
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,958
That girl.

166
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,083
Such incredible power.

167
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,833
No. No, damn it!

168
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,166
Don't die on me now!

169
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
Time to die.

170
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,333
Ah, dammit!

171
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,541
What is it?

172
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,833
I dunno.

173
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,375
Something just...

174
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,916
An X-Con?

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,041
Neo-Gene?

176
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,875
I can't really tell.

177
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,166
It's too far away.

178
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,166
But it's...

179
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,583
My god, it's powerful.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,625
She's coming!

181
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,083
Should, um...

182
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,625
Should we maybe
just walk back?

183
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,666
We can't do that.

184
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,708
Why not?

185
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,500
I have little chance of
defeating someone so powerful.

186
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,708
But...

187
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,208
Stay right here, Rihoko.

188
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,833
Where are you going?

189
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,125
Do as I say. Stay here!

190
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,375
Okay.

191
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,000
It'll be all right.

192
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,583
I promise
I'll come back for you.

193
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,708
She kinda reminded me
of Mom just then.

194
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,083
A second generation
Neo-Gene has appeared.

195
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,166
And for some reason,
I am its target.

196
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,000
Therefore I have chosen
to split up with Rihoko.

197
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,416
It'll be all right.

198
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
I promise
I'll come back for you.

199
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,208
Why did I make a promise
that I cannot keep?

200
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,583
You're my mom.

201
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,166
That certainly
appears to be the case.

202
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,166
Genetically, at least.

203
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
That thing is over there,
isn't it?

204
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm gonna
get rid of it forever.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,541
No, little girl.

206
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,375
You will not.

207
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,083
You hate me, too.

208
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,708
Why, Mom?

209
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,416
You're not supposed
to hate me.

210
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,708
You're my mom!

211
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,083
Why? Tell me why!

212
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,333
Okay, fine.

213
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,041
I'll get rid of you too!

214
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,708
I can feel it, can you?

215
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,625
I can feel it!

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,958
Are those monsters?

217
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,416
Rihoko!

218
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,541
It's me!

219
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,500
Tozawa! Hi!

220
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,416
I'm so glad to see you.

221
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,083
But what're you doin'
all the way out here?

222
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,208
It's kinda hard
to explain, kiddo.

223
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,875
Stop the car!

224
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,791
What's wrong?

225
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,875
I can feel it.

226
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,041
Rihoko's in danger!

227
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,666
The same feeling
you had before?

228
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,375
So what now?

229
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,083
You said you were
an unfit mother.

230
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,208
Riko!

231
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,333
Well, that answers my question.

232
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,958
Stop dodging, Mom!

233
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,250
When you make me miss,
I get angry!

234
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,875
Aw man, way too easy.

235
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,833
Somethin' smells good over here.

236
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,166
Where's it comin' from?

237
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,833
Tozawa, are those...?

238
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,750
Yep, they're monsters, kiddo.

239
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,916
People say they don't exist
but I've seen plenty of 'em.

240
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,791
Don't worry, I gotcha.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,750
Now, that looks good!

242
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,208
I will not let you
harm my daughter!

243
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,708
Hey?

244
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,583
You done already?

245
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,291
Guess I'll go and have my fun
with that other thing.

246
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,916
Let go!
Why're you trying to stop me?

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,916
Good question.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,958
I wish I had an answer for you.

249
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,958
You're weak.

250
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,166
You can't be my mom.

251
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,333
Why'd you do that to me?

252
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,958
It hurts.

253
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,458
You have incredible power,
but you mustn't abuse it.

254
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,166
If you do not learn control,
it is pointless.

255
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,708
There she is!

256
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,041
Begin retrieval!

257
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,833
Ma'am,
what about the other one?

258
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,333
There's no need
to waste your time.

259
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,875
It'll be all right.

260
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,875
Your mom's on her way, okay?

261
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,125
Mom's comin'?

262
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,791
You bet she is.

263
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,583
Takin' care of nasty monsters
like them is part of her job.

264
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,625
No way.

265
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,041
I'm serious!

266
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,125
She's comin' here?

267
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,541
But she's not
comin' to see me.

268
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,208
'Cause she's not my mom anymore.

269
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,166
That's not true!

270
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,958
Why do you think
she's been out every night

271
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,750
doin' such dangerous work?

272
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
She does it for you.

273
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
She always has!

274
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,625
Don't you get it, kid?

275
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,375
The reason she fights
is to keep you safe.

276
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,041
Your mom loves you
more than anything.

277
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,500
Promise.

278
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,583
Riko!

279
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,291
Is that mom?

280
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,666
Mommy.

281
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,041
Mommy!

282
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,291
Mom!

283
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,875
Riko!

284
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,041
Riko!

285
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,166
Are you all right?

286
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,916
I'm better now!

287
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,291
Mommy!

288
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,875
It hurts.

289
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Mom.

290
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
Reina?

291
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,125
It is you!

292
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,250
Let's get you
to my recovery team!

293
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,791
Thank you,
but there's no need.

294
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,833
There's nothing they can do.

295
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,583
I'm almost out of time.

296
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,541
Where's Rihoko?

297
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,958
She's safe.

298
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,250
I'm glad.

299
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,291
Reina...

300
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,625
You have to give her back.

301
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,000
That's fine.

302
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,208
I've concluded my research.

303
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,666
Do whatever you want with her.

304
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,708
Thank you.

305
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,041
You know, that's the first time
I've ever felt pleasure

306
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,083
while fighting.

307
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,791
Was it because of my breakdown,

308
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,208
or because
I was protecting her?

309
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,458
I've spent all this time
studying myself,

310
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,916
and I still don't understand.

311
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,500
I thought I understood,
for a time.

312
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,791
Reiji...

313
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,833
I once felt this inexplicable
emotion for you.

314
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,958
Now I wish I had shared it
with you sooner

315
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,541
but this feeling,

316
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
I'll never forget it.

317
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,291
[Music]

318
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,416
Great news, Riko!

319
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,375
Mr. Cho's taking us
to the beach!

320
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,875
I'm sure he just wants to
see me in my swimsuit

321
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,666
but he's harmless, right?

322
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,125
Oh, and a friend of Tozawa's
is gonna come with us.

323
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,250
And she's bringing
her daughter,

324
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,250
who's just a few years
older than you.

325
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,916
This is gonna be so much fun!

326
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,625
I can't wait!

327
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,625
I could never take you
cool places before

328
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,000
but I'm gonna make sure we do
all kinds of fun stuff now!

329
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,791
I'm gonna work hard
so we can go wherever we want!
