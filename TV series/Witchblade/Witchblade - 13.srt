1
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,291
This is a DNA
maternity report we received.

2
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,458
What?

3
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,583
How can this be?

4
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,625
[Music]

5
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,708
After going through
the data in this report,

6
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,583
there's no doubt in our minds

7
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,208
that the woman
claiming to be Rihoko's mother

8
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,000
is in fact
her biological parent.

9
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:15,125
Riko and I aren't related?

10
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,416
Impossible.

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,416
This woman...

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,375
we'll call her "Ms. S" for now,

13
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,041
said you happened
to pass by her

14
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,125
when the Great Quake hit
six years ago.

15
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,333
In the chaos, she was
separated from her daughter.

16
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,708
She never imagined her child
would still be alive.

17
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,541
But recently,
Ms. S caught sight of Rihoko,

18
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,583
and became convinced
she was her long-lost daughter.

19
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,083
Usually we don't divulge any
information about either party

20
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,625
but I thought
you would want to know.

21
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,750
In any case,
the Child Welfare Ministry feels

22
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,958
it would be in Rihoko's
best interest

23
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,875
to return her
to her biological mother.

24
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,458
You can't.

25
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,625
Ms. Amaha,

26
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,125
I'm sure this must be
difficult for you.

27
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,500
The two of you have lived
as a family all this time.

28
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,958
But isn't it only fair to let
her live with her real mother.

29
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,625
She's my daughter!

30
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,333
My daughter.

31
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,041
And I'm not...

32
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,375
you know
I can never agree to this!

33
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,583
Ms. Amaha.

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,916
Her "real mother"?

35
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,458
That's crap.

36
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,125
You're the ones who said
Rihoko was my daughter

37
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,125
in the first place!

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,583
And now you wanna
take her away from me?

39
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,500
That was an unfortunate
mistake on our part.

40
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,125
But what else were we to assume
when you were found

41
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,083
with an infant
and a maternity diary?

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,708
At that time,
we weren't even aware

43
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,208
that the name "Masane Amaha"
was made-up.

44
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
Made-up?

45
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,958
Evidently you had
some problems.

46
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,958
And I'm afraid your memory loss
didn't exactly help the matter.

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,583
But I...

48
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,916
I've worked so hard!

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,083
Worked to make a life
for Riko and me.

50
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,583
Well, there's no need for you
to worry about that anymore.

51
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,416
What are you saying?

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,416
Riko is the only thing
that matters to me!

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,750
I understand that.

54
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,541
But please...

55
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,708
Rihoko is still young
and impressionable.

56
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,708
She needs to know the love
of her real mother.

57
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,958
Get out.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've heard enough.

59
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,416
Get out!

60
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,458
You'll need time
to pack up her belongings,

61
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,750
so I'll leave Rihoko
with you today.

62
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,916
Ms. Amaha, I truly hope
you'll consider

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,458
what's best
for Rihoko's happiness.

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,458
Goodbye, Rihoko.

65
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,583
I'll be back tomorrow
to pick you up.

66
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,666
Then you'll finally
get to meet your real mother.

67
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,250
Doesn't that sound exciting?

68
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,708
Sorry to disturb you all.

69
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,666
Get the hell out, old bat.

70
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,916
This is just so horrible.

71
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,875
Rihoko, wait!

72
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,625
Mom!

73
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,041
Riko!

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,375
Mom!

75
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,083
You're my real mom,
aren't you?

76
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:31,375
Tell me that lady
was just lying!

77
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,416
Riko.

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,958
I don't want another mom!

79
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,791
I wanna stay with you!

80
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,083
I don't want her
to take me away!

81
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,458
Oh, Riko.

82
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't want to be
away from you either.

83
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,125
I never want to let you go.

84
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,250
Y'ask me, Melony,
you shouldn't have to.

85
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,083
Look, you're the one
who raised that child.

86
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,333
Who cares about some broad
that pops up outta nowhere!

87
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,333
She's your kid!

88
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,458
That's what I'm sayin'.

89
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,458
Mister Cho...

90
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,500
Mariko!

91
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,000
Mom, let's run.

92
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,416
That does it!

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,666
Don't worry 'bout a thing,
lil ladies!

94
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,166
Leave everything
to Mister Cho!

95
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,375
They're not related?

96
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,541
No, sir.

97
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,375
Apparently,
the girl's biological mother

98
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,000
ran a complete DNA test,

99
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,125
and took the results
to Child Welfare.

100
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,208
Who is she?

101
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,083
The biological mother?

102
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,000
That's kept confidential.

103
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,833
But, I am pulling a few strings
within the department.

104
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,625
Will Masane give the child up?

105
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,041
I assume she has to.

106
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
Yes, I see.

107
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,416
And I assume I'll have
that data relatively soon?

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,000
Wonderful!

109
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,041
I'll talk to you then.

110
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,208
Here you are.

111
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,375
Get all of my department
managers down here.

112
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,125
I'm starting up a new project.

113
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,708
What kind of project, Director?

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,958
I call it
"The Witchblade Project".

115
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,708
Man, it's nothin'
but financial reports.

116
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,833
Let's give this one a shot.

117
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:10,958
Knock-knock!

118
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey there, kiddo.

119
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,458
Think you can
spare me a minute?

120
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,333
Good evening!

121
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,208
Whatcha doin'?

122
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,458
What?

123
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,833
I hate studying!

124
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,625
I'm not gonna!

125
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,708
Stop acting
like a spoiled brat!

126
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,708
Why do you always
have to be such a problem?

127
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,833
As if I'm not stressed enough
with the Cloneblade upgrade.

128
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,791
Who cares about you?
Jerk.

129
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't tell me you're
neglecting your studies again?

130
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,166
Father!

131
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,208
Maria, you have

132
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,833
such spectacular intellectual
capabilities, my dear.

133
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
You know, if you study,

134
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,958
you can become an even more
exceptional young lady

135
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,666
than you already are.

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,000
Will that make you like me?

137
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,375
Of course,
I'll like you even more.

138
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,375
That means you don't
like me at all right now.

139
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,250
Maria.

140
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,583
I know.

141
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,291
What if we gave you
some sort of incentive?

142
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,333
We'll reward you for studying.

143
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,666
Reward?

144
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,125
That's a brilliant idea,
Nishida.

145
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,291
If you could have anything
in this world, Maria,

146
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,333
what would it be?

147
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,958
My Mom.

148
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,583
My mom!
That's what I want!

149
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,625
My mom would like me
no matter what.

150
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,875
I know it.

151
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,125
All right then.

152
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,083
Maria, promise you will devote
yourself to your studies,

153
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,458
and once you're able to wield
the Cloneblade,

154
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:53,583
I'll tell you all there is
to know about your mother.

155
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,375
How does that sound, dear?

156
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,125
You swear?

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,250
I'll do it!

158
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,291
Was that wise?

159
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,416
Making her that promise?

160
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't worry, Nishida.

161
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,625
What harm
could there possibly be

162
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,541
in telling the child
about her mother?

163
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,041
Speaking of...

164
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,916
I heard her other child
turned up.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

166
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,583
Honestly, I cannot believe
she was so foolish.

167
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,583
A mother choosing to deliver
her own child?

168
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,333
How utterly primitive.

169
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,791
You think?

170
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,500
I find it rather intriguing.

171
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,000
Father?

172
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,041
Would you mind if
I borrowed Nora for a while?

173
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,000
Nora?

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,041
You have no idea
where they might have gone?

175
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,291
Nope, no idea whatsoever.

176
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,291
Why don't you give up already?

177
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,625
We can't tell ya somethin'
we don't know, lady!

178
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,875
Now listen to me!

179
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,166
If you intentionally
withhold information

180
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,208
about a child who is to be
taken into custody,

181
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,875
you are in violation
of Child Welfare laws.

182
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,541
Hey guys, I'm back.

183
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,291
Melony and the kid are--

184
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,958
Criminy crap.

185
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
I demand you tell me
where they are!

186
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,333
We already told ya.

187
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,666
We don't know.

188
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,791
Ahoy, Captain!

189
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
Look at all the goodies I got!

190
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,791
We should have a party, huh?

191
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,375
I hope we haven't put you
in a bad spot.

192
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,125
Don't sweat it.

193
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,666
It's kinda crazy.

194
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,583
Who'da thought you gals would
know an old geezer like Cho?

195
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,583
Small world, huh?

196
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,250
He said he was gonna
talk to an old friend but,

197
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,666
I had no idea it was you.

198
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,875
Well, it must be fate.

199
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,916
You ladies are welcome to stay
until things've cooled down.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,958
I won't let anyone
on this boat.

201
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,375
No Child Welfare,
hell, not even the police.

202
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,541
Thank you.

203
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,833
Hey, Captain?

204
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,166
I was wondering.

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,083
Does he have a name yet?

206
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,583
Naw, I'm no good
at that kinda stuff, little one.

207
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,625
Then I'll think up
a good one for him!

208
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,541
Come over here, doggie!

209
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,125
She's such a cutie.

210
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,208
I can see why you don't
wanna give her up.

211
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,750
So what should we name you?

212
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,958
My daughter?

213
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,166
My daughter
means everything to me.

214
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,458
She ran away?

215
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,541
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
Ms. Sakurai
is looking for her now.

217
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,833
I understand.
Thank you for the call.

218
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,083
Ma'am--

219
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,791
What is she doing?

220
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,083
She knows
Rihoko isn't her child.

221
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,958
Why is she so afraid
of losing her?

222
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't understand.

223
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,583
Bunta!

224
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,958
Am I too heavy?

225
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,083
Hey, Riko?

226
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:05,958
Yeah?

227
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,291
Mommy has to run by the bank
really quick.

228
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,458
Wait here, and I'll
bring ya back a present, okay?

229
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,208
'kay!

230
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,583
Are you certain?

231
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,375
Reina is her biological mother?

232
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,625
Yes.

233
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,916
Shocking, isn't it?

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,625
Who would have thought
the reason she vanished

235
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,083
six years ago was because
she was with child?

236
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,250
I don't have any data
on the father yet.

237
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,833
But I do wonder why she went
into seclusion to give birth?

238
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,625
Reina has always
shown an interest

239
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,791
in her own Neo-Gene nature.

240
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,166
Not just physically,
but mentally as well.

241
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,833
It often seemed like
everything about her

242
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,875
was the subject of research.

243
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
She wanted to assess
every situation on her own.

244
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,875
Even childbirth.

245
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,833
Oh! Speaking of...

246
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,333
It seems Reina
and the Witchblade

247
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,041
are no longer compatible.

248
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,083
What?

249
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,791
Evidently,
while she was being held,

250
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,208
Masane overheard
one of the scientists.

251
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,750
And she's positive?

252
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,583
I know, let's write a letter

253
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,833
to Mr. Cho
and everyone back home!

254
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,958
Let's see.

255
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,833
"How are you? I'm good."

256
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,958
Must be boring
stuck on this boat all day.

257
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,375
It's fun!

258
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,208
Actually,
I was just writing a letter

259
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,125
to Mr. Cho and the others.

260
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
Hey, that's great!

261
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,708
Ya know, my old buddy there's
been over to Cho's place

262
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,458
a whole bunch of times.

263
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,500
I bet he can deliver
that letter for ya.

264
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,833
Really!

265
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,458
You're such a good boy, Bunta!

266
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,791
So, that's his name?

267
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,791
Bunta?

268
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,000
Uh-huh!

269
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,000
Mom!

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,166
Back to living
in constant fear again.

271
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,708
I'm sorry, Riko.

272
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,000
Man, am I pooped.

273
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,000
I thought
she would never leave.

274
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,458
I dunno who that broad
thinks she is

275
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,333
bargin' in here like that.

276
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,291
Stupid old bat!

277
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,916
You can come out now, Naomi.

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,208
Coast is clear.

279
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,375
The wicked witch is gone.

280
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,916
Puppy!

281
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,666
Hey! How are ya, pal?

282
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,958
That's right.

283
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,750
Riko's supposed to
start school next year.

284
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,416
But the way things are now...

285
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,458
Can I help you find something?

286
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,916
Uh, no, thanks.

287
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,416
Well, that was fast!

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,750
Welcome back, Bunta!

289
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,250
Ms. Amaha,
I truly hope you'll consider

290
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,166
what's best
for Rihoko's happiness.

291
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,041
Riko has a "real" mother.

292
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,625
But I don't want
to give her up.

293
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,791
Does that make me selfish?

294
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,916
Then again...

295
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,041
She needs to know
the love of her real mother.

296
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,000
Mom.

297
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,291
Please, mom.

298
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,000
Help me.

299
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,041
Riko!

300
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,833
Riko!

301
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,291
Riko!

302
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,916
What do you think
you're doing?

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,208
Me?

304
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,541
Nothing.

305
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,583
My job is simply retrieval.

306
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,791
That is my child.

307
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,166
Keep your hands off her.

308
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,125
Father is quite displeased
with your recent behavior.

309
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,458
True.

310
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,416
But I'm still not going to
hand her over to you.

311
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
To be honest,

312
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,041
I've always wanted to
have it out with you, Reina.

313
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,333
They say you're the strongest
Neo-Gene on record.

314
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,250
Let's find out.

315
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,458
Ready or not.

316
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,041
Wait! Someone's fighting?

317
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,000
Impressive, Reina.

318
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,625
But I...
I've just begun!

319
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,875
It's beginning.

320
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,708
Goodbye!

321
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,458
Riko!

322
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,791
She's fine.

323
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,416
Did you come here
to save her?

324
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,541
It's only natural

325
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
to want to protect
one's own child.

326
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,166
You're Riko's--

327
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,666
Why are you trying
to keep her from me?

328
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,166
Um...

329
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,916
Well, I...

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,166
Time to accept
that you're not her mother.

331
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,541
Quite clearly.

332
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,333
Since you didn't care
about leaving her in danger.

333
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,583
I what!

334
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,791
I "didn't care?"

335
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,166
You weren't even there
when she had a cold

336
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,125
and fainted a few days ago.

337
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,333
You mean, you're the one
who helped her then, too?

338
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:08,500
I only did what
any caring mother would do.

339
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,083
What were you doing?

340
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,291
I was...

341
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,291
Mom.

342
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,333
That you?

343
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:20,958
Mom!

344
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,458
What's wrong?

345
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,000
Riko...

346
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,750
This lady...

347
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,291
She's your real mother.

348
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,125
You're going to live with her
from now on.

349
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,541
Why! But, Mom!

350
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,500
I thought we decided
to stay together?

351
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,208
C'mon, Mom!

352
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,291
Let's run away again!

353
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,208
I don't wanna live
with anybody else!

354
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,750
Please!

355
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,375
I changed my mind.

356
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,791
We're not really family,

357
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,666
so I'm not going to
take care of you anymore.

358
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,041
It'll be easier for me
if I'm alone.

359
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,000
I won't have to worry
about money so much.

360
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,000
I can go out,

361
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,791
have all the fun I want.

362
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm tired of all this.

363
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,708
Hey!
What the hell are you sayin'?

364
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,375
Go.

365
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,125
Hey!

366
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,125
Riko...

367
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,125
I get it.

368
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,416
Listen, your mom...

369
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,916
We can't be together.

370
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,416
You can't be my mom anymore.

371
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,916
'Cause I'm not
really your daughter.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Am I right?

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,875
Take her and go.

374
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,916
Go!

375
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,041
So, you ready?

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,333
Riko.

377
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,500
Riko.

378
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:43,000
If I stay with Mom,
she can never be free.

379
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,250
So we can
never be together again.

380
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,708
Because this lady
is my mom now.

381
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,583
My real mom.
