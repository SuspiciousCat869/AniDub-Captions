1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,875
Long sought
by the greed of man,

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,708
but bestowed only
upon the women

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,583
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,000
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,750
Righteous Sword of God,
or Hand of the Devil himself?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,208
A new Bearer finds out,

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,583
seeking balance
between ecstasy and ruin.

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,041
[♪♪♪♪♪]

9
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,083
Good morning.

10
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,916
Morning, Mom!

11
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,875
Smells good!

12
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,500
That's yours on the table,
all ready to go.

13
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,208
I have to go deliver this,
so you can start without me.

14
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,791
'Kay. See you in a bit.

15
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,416
That hit the spot!

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,416
Hello?

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,666
Anybody up?

18
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,708
What the hell's
wrong with you?

19
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,541
Why can't you knock?

20
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,333
Tryin' to sneak a peek
first thing in the morning?

21
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,583
Yeah, you wish.

22
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,583
I was up all night.

23
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,750
Where's Rihoko?

24
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,916
With Mr. Cho.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, in that case,
we can talk about this.

26
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,708
I dug up some documents
on Doji Group Industries

27
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,041
at the newspaper.

28
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,166
I got a connection
down there.

29
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,625
I'm tellin' you,
they're a big-time corporation.

30
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,583
So big in fact,
other top companies've

31
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,500
been tryin'
to take 'em down for years.

32
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,541
Why's that?

33
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,958
Ain't it obvious?

34
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,833
Doji manufactures
and exports weapons.

35
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,458
There's always money in death.

36
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,583
You've been hangin' out
with that Doji director a lot.

37
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,416
S'prised you didn't know
all this.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,250
I wasn't really interested,
'til now.

39
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,666
Well, judging
from what you've told me,

40
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,666
these I-Weapons must be exactly
what they've been exporting.

41
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,458
While that may be a huge issue
for peace-freaks,

42
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,541
it doesn't make
for much of a story.

43
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,333
Unless, we can prove
how they're made.

44
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,916
Prove they're using
real people,

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,583
like Nakata's dead cop buddy.

46
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,166
Yeah.

47
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,500
I assumed the I-Weapons were
machines in human form but,

48
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll ask Takayama about it
when I see him later.

49
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,791
Gettin' it
straight from the top, huh?

50
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,458
We want the truth, don't we?

51
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,875
Only way to get it.

52
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,208
True. Then I'll try attackin'
from a different angle.

53
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,916
I'm gonna look up
those Neo-Genes

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
you were talkin' about.

55
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,208
Deeper down
the rabbit hole, eh?

56
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,583
Lemme taste.

57
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,083
So good!

58
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,125
I wanted to try something
a little different this time

59
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,583
so I used maple syrup!

60
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,250
The sweetness
is so delicate and subtle!

61
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,583
And the fluffy-soft texture
is just perfect!

62
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,375
Everything you make
is so tasty, kiddo!

63
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,583
Oh, uh...

64
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,875
But of course,

65
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,166
you still make
a damn fine cup of coffee, Mari.

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,166
In fact,
it may be better than ever!

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,583
That's 'cause
I got a new coffeemaker.

68
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,750
Well, that may be, but I can
tell you really put your heart

69
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,625
into pressing that button.

70
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,041
Hey! It's Tozawa!

71
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,708
Hey! Don't forget my hot chicks
for the group date you promised!

72
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,083
I won't!

73
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,500
So, are group dates
better than regular dates?

74
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,791
Yeah!

75
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,541
They're miracles of destiny,

76
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,458
where a man can meet
all the women of his dreams!

77
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,541
Good morning!

78
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,208
Morning, Melony!

79
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,375
What's up?

80
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,083
Care for a cup of Mari's
delicious coffee?

81
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,583
Thank you, Mr. Cho,
but I'll pass.

82
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,250
I gotta get goin'.

83
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,458
Okay, Riko,
I should be home by tonight

84
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,583
but I'll give you a call later.

85
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:09,833
Wait a minute, Mom.

86
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,458
Are you going out like that?

87
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,708
Well, yeah.

88
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,708
But you still have bed-head!

89
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,666
You really should pay more
attention to the way you look.

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,458
Nah, it's fine!

91
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,458
See you later!

92
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,541
Have a good one!

93
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,791
The lab report meeting is
scheduled to end at 15:00 hours.

94
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,125
Then this evening you've got--

95
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,708
Cancel all of my plans
for tonight.

96
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,291
And what's this?

97
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,041
An invitation to
the Bio-Division's reception?

98
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,041
Ah, yes.
Wado sent e-mails to everyone

99
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,000
bragging about
his research team,

100
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,208
and how they won
this year's

101
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,541
International
Science Foundation Award.

102
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,791
But, sir.

103
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,083
This invitation isn't
even addressed to you.

104
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,125
That's right,
the head of Motor Vehicles

105
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,250
was nice enough
to give it to me.

106
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,958
I think you should take
a good look at the guest list.

107
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,375
You have got to be kidding?

108
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,666
These are all officials
involved with our division.

109
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,166
He's even invited top brass
from our affiliate companies.

110
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,541
Sounds exactly
like something Wado would do.

111
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh, I get it.

112
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,000
The guest list
is full of people

113
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,000
he wants to add
to his clique.

114
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,291
Clever ploy.

115
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,541
Precisely.

116
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,958
While I doubt he'd do
anything stupid tonight,

117
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,166
I thought I might as well
drop by the party to make sure.

118
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,000
In an attempt
to keep him in check.

119
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,583
Understood.

120
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,916
I'll rework your schedule
for tonight.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,041
Shall I arrange for
a high-profile escort

122
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,625
for you as well, sir?

123
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,083
An actress, perhaps?

124
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,166
An actress?

125
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,291
Yes, sir.

126
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,541
It says here
it includes a "plus-one".

127
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,333
So I would recommend
you bring somebody.

128
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,541
If you don't act the part,

129
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,625
they may question
your lack of invitation.

130
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,541
Don't want to seem
like a party-crasher.

131
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,541
Look at Wado.

132
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,416
Whenever he attends a function

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,333
he always has
some kind of arm-candy.

134
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,958
Like a famous actress
or a super model.

135
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,583
Good morning.

136
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,291
Good morning, Masane!

137
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,625
Something wrong?

138
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,458
I have a question.

139
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,833
Well then,
go ahead and ask it.

140
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,541
It's about the X-Cons.

141
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,791
And what do you want to know?

142
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,375
Are they...?

143
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,875
Are they human?

144
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,208
What makes you think that?

145
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,583
I met someone who knew
the X-Con from yesterday.

146
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,833
How unfortunate.

147
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,166
So you're not denying it?

148
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,625
And that goes
for all the I-Weapons?

149
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,166
Yes, you are correct.

150
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,291
Director...

151
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,416
There's no point
in hiding it any longer.

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,458
Tell her everything.

153
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,000
Right.

154
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,916
It's good to see you, Father.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
It's been a long time.

156
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,791
Reina, my daughter,
is there something the matter?

157
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,833
Ever since Shiori's
unfortunate accident,

158
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,958
it has seemed that you have
lost your passion

159
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,083
for re-acquiring the Witchblade.

160
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,833
I am conducting other research

161
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,041
that is more
important to me, Father.

162
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,333
Even more than the Witchblade?

163
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,541
Yes, in my eyes it is.

164
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,333
I'm having a hard time
hiding my disappointment,

165
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,666
given your personal history
with the matter.

166
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,083
That's the only reason you
still care for me, isn't it?

167
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,416
Because the Witchblade chose me.

168
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Of course not.

169
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,041
But what father wouldn't adore
a daughter who was so chosen?

170
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,000
So you adore me?

171
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,333
What kind of emotion
is that, exactly?

172
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,750
What is it, Reina?

173
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,625
Why are you questioning me?

174
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,166
I'm sorry, Father,
I didn't mean to offend you.

175
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm afraid I must
leave your side for a while

176
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,791
to continue my research.

177
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,625
The other sisters can
search for the Witchblade.

178
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,166
Thank you, Father.

179
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,333
Goodbye.

180
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,083
It's my fault, really.

181
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,000
I've pampered her too much.

182
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,041
It certainly appears
that way, sir.

183
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,583
The question is,
what to do now.

184
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,000
Let me clarify.

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,666
Technically,
the I-Weapons and X-Cons

186
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,291
are not "human"
in the strictest sense.

187
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,958
"Former humans"
would be more appropriate.

188
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,166
What does that mean?

189
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,291
They're created from cadavers.

190
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,791
They come from
all sorts of backgrounds.

191
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,791
Most often,
we make agreements with people

192
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
while they're still alive,
but, sometimes,

193
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,541
we deal with their families
post-mortem.

194
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,666
You what?

195
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,916
How can you do that to people?

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,916
It's disrespectful!

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
Perhaps, but their families
are quite well compensated.

198
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,750
You're selling their loved ones
as weapons!

199
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,833
This is a business, Masane.

200
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,375
You guys are sick!

201
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
By manufacturing weapons,
you're only causing more wars

202
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,125
to break out--

203
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,250
Wars are not caused by weapons.

204
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,125
Mankind has fought
since prehistoric times.

205
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Humans will never
be free from war.

206
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,750
Therefore we should try
to limit our casualties.

207
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,291
And I suppose you think
your I-Weapons do that?

208
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,583
An overwhelming show of force
can end a war quickly

209
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,875
or it can even
deter it all together.

210
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,000
Not to mention,
with an army of I-Weapons,

211
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,833
fewer live soldiers
are necessary.

212
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah, but...

213
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,500
you guys are still
using people!

214
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,583
That's true,
but you forget,

215
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,958
those people
are already deceased.

216
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,541
Isn't it an army's duty
to protect the living?

217
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,541
You talk a big game
when it comes to money,

218
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,875
I guess that's all
you can handle.

219
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,833
Never mind, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

220
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,000
According to
our recovery team's report,

221
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,166
there was a civilian with you

222
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,958
when you took care
of that X-Con yesterday.

223
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,333
That douche bag?

224
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,500
He's a guy who lives
in my building.

225
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,125
He was just...
well, he...

226
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,541
Does he know about you?

227
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,416
Yeah.

228
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,875
About that.

229
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,291
I take it that's a yes.

230
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,541
You know,
it would really help

231
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,875
if you told us
these things sooner.

232
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,208
You're not gonna go
hurt him or anything, are ya?

233
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,500
Nothing of the sort!

234
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,625
We simply wish to
grasp the situation.

235
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,333
A photographer or two
doesn't concern me.

236
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,500
Especially
if it's someone you know.

237
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,041
However...

238
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,708
you still have
to pay a penalty.

239
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,125
Segawa, I want you
to escort Ms. Amaha

240
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,916
to the best boutique in town.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,625
Try to turn this primate
into something presentable.

242
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,916
What did you call me!

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Well, you're nothin'
but a big gloomy gorilla!

244
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,291
Please, you should know
ladies don't talk like that.

245
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,666
And you might want to spend
more time on your appearance.

246
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
Don't tell me what to do!

247
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,708
I'm going home!

248
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,958
You have to pay your penalty.

249
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,708
Would you prefer
to pay financially?

250
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,416
Fine, I'll do it.

251
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,500
Segawa, please have them
charge it to my card.

252
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,750
Thank you.

253
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,791
Dammit! What's going on?

254
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,583
What is this "penalty"?

255
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,958
Don't yell when you speak.

256
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't walk with long strides.

257
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,666
And always call me
"sir" in public.

258
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,666
You got that?

259
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,750
What is all this!

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,458
Woah.

261
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,291
Sorry
this always happens, baby.

262
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,916
It's not a problem, Mom!

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,958
Just make sure you don't
drink too much, 'kay?

264
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,583
Bye-bye!

265
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,500
Lemme guess,
Melony's workin' late again?

266
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,625
Since she's not here,
you wanna have dinner with me?

267
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,750
I'll make us
something really yummy.

268
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,583
Really? Lucky me!

269
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,666
I get to taste some more

270
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,541
of your delicious
homemade cuisine!

271
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,291
How 'bout this,
we'll invite the others

272
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,916
and make it a dinner party!

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,166
Your kitchen's big enough.

274
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
Ooh, I'd like that!

275
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,875
Hey Mari, that sound good?

276
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,583
I never miss a party.

277
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,208
In fact,
I'll make something too.

278
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,958
I know that pose!

279
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,291
Mari's out for blood!

280
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,250
Director Wado!

281
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,000
Congratulations
on winning the ISF Award!

282
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,250
Why, thank you.

283
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,291
Bio Division is the face
of the company now!

284
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,333
If only we could all be
as successful as you!

285
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
How flattering.

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,958
But my vision for the department
has yet to be fully realized.

287
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:40,958
You don't say.

288
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,750
I've not yet
had the opportunity

289
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,958
to work with your
Machines Division.

290
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,250
But I very much hope we can
collaborate in the future.

291
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,083
Great, just say the word.

292
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,875
Director...

293
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,458
Over there. Mister Takayama
has just arrived.

294
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,125
Has he now?

295
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,541
What nerve.

296
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,166
Waltzing in here.

297
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,583
Um, excuse me, sir, may I see
your invitation, please?

298
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,333
Takayama, Director
of the Special Section.

299
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,750
Don't tell me
you haven't heard of him?

300
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,333
Director Takayama!

301
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,333
Good to see you again!

302
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,166
Forgive my rudeness.

303
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,375
Congratulations to you
on winning the award, Wado.

304
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,625
Thank you.

305
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,250
How good it is of you to come.

306
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,541
You know, I never
received my invitation.

307
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,958
I just figured
it must have been

308
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,583
an unintentional oversight.

309
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
Absurd.

310
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,125
I can assure you my division
would never make such a mistake.

311
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,416
Remarkable!

312
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,791
Takayama, who is this
beautiful woman with you?

313
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,750
Wado, this young lady
is Masane Amaha.

314
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,708
She's a distant
relative of mine.

315
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,916
A distant relative?

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,458
Yeah, right!

317
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,791
So dressing me up and
showing me off is my "penalty"?

318
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,250
I bet he totally likes me!

319
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,375
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Wado.

320
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,458
Umm...

321
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,125
Listen.

322
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,041
I'm sure the invitation mix-up
was a clerical error on my part.

323
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,208
I apologize, Takayama.

324
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,333
And I forgive you.

325
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,333
Holy crap!

326
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,708
Look at that spread!

327
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,083
Oh, hell, yeah!

328
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,333
So, is all of this stuff free?

329
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,583
Please help yourself
to as much as you'd like.

330
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,750
I'll take that!

331
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,875
At your service, Miss.

332
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,416
What do you think
you're doing?

333
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,333
Please do not
embarrass the director,

334
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,208
especially not in front of
Wado and his colleagues.

335
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,333
What's the big deal?

336
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,458
I mean, can't a girl
have a little fun?

337
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,500
If I'm such an embarrassment
to him,

338
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,208
then why'd he make me come?

339
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,625
The director
had to bring a date

340
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,083
in order to keep up appearances.

341
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,666
I'm a trophy date?

342
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,041
It doesn't matter;
just please behave yourself.

343
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,041
Here you are.

344
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,041
Oh, nice.

345
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,083
So any woman
would've been fine.

346
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,500
What a jerk.

347
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,541
Director, I see the Former
Prime Minister is here.

348
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,583
Why would he come
to Wado's function?

349
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,958
Didn't you hear?

350
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,208
He served as the head judge

351
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,166
on the committee
for this year's award.

352
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,166
Really?

353
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you think
Wado bought him off?

354
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,541
Let's just say
I have no doubt

355
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,666
that Wado has been contributing
to his political funds.

356
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,166
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am honored to be here tonight

357
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,041
to present
the prestigious ISF Award

358
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,083
to Director Wado
and his research team.

359
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
Oh, wow!

360
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,875
I gotta bring
some of these home for Riko!

361
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,416
Hey, I don't suppose you could
box up a couple for me.

362
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,708
Take as many as you'd like.

363
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,958
Lucky me!

364
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,125
What else you guys got?

365
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,541
No! The crystal plaque!

366
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,208
What the hell?

367
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm sorry, sir!

368
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,041
I hope it wasn't important.

369
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,916
Of course it was important!

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,333
Um, I'm really sorry!

371
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,875
Your half-ass apologies
mean nothing to me.

372
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,333
Do you know what you've done?

373
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,583
I'll pay for it.

374
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,833
What?

375
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,541
I said I'll pay you for it.

376
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,708
How much did it cost?

377
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,666
You must be kidding.
Pay me?

378
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,416
Just tell me
how much I owe you!

379
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,333
Far more than a primate
like you could ever afford!

380
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,625
No please, tell us.

381
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,666
I'll be covering her expenses.

382
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,125
She is my guest, after all.

383
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,875
That's very generous, Takayama,
but it's not something

384
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,000
that can be easily compensated.

385
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,083
No problem, Wado, I'll simply
ask the Honored Gentleman here

386
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,125
exactly how much
you paid him for the award.

387
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm sure I can
have it to you immediately.

388
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
What did he say?

389
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,416
I'm kidding, of course.

390
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,083
What a zinger, director!

391
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,041
We're leaving!

392
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,791
Thank you, Miss,
but you needn't reimburse me.

393
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,791
It's not about
the value of the plaque,

394
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,208
however,
it is a matter of honor.

395
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,458
Thank you, Wado.

396
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,750
Your generosity speaks
to your great character.

397
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,708
Remember how we handled
our disagreements

398
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,666
when we were in college?

399
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,458
That's how
we'll settle this today!

400
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Are they kidding?

401
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,416
Wado and Takayama?

402
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,083
Drinking?

403
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,833
Stop! Please.

404
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,041
Don't do this because of me!

405
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,250
Drinking like that
is really dangerous!

406
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,333
Don't tell me you're
worried about me now.

407
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,791
Keep dreamin', jerk!

408
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,416
Don't worry about him.

409
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,291
We used to do this
all the time.

410
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,666
Seriously?

411
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,916
That's right.

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,041
And Takayama was always
the first to go down.

413
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,625
Is he gonna be okay?

414
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,166
No, Wado is known for
his ability to hold his liquor.

415
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,875
The Director
is at a disadvantage.

416
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,750
This is bad.

417
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,000
What a breathtaking battle

418
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,458
between two
consummate professionals!

419
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,750
Wow. You can smell
the tension.

420
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,750
Sure can.

421
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,083
The food smells great too!

422
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,666
Amazing.

423
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
What's going on?

424
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,625
How is he still going?

425
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
My god, he won!

426
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,666
Director!
Are you all right?

427
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,791
Oh, my.

428
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,041
Segawa.

429
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,458
Go make sure
Director Wado isn't dead.

430
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes, sir.

431
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,750
Let's go.

432
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
I'm finished here.

433
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,375
There's no reason to stay.

434
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,083
Uh. Okay.

435
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,500
Slow down!

436
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,041
Wait for me!

437
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,458
So you are drunk,
I knew it!

438
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,000
But then,
how could you not be?

439
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,750
I never thought
I'd see you get wasted,

440
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,750
but it's kinda cute.

441
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,750
Did you just call me cute?

442
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
Cute.

443
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,375
Next to a primate like you.

444
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,916
Say what?

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,083
You're the one who forced
this primate to be your date!

446
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,041
How rude,
no wonder you're single!

447
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,791
I'm not tryin' to be rude.

448
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,458
I like primates.

449
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,625
They're cute.

450
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,125
Wait. You what?

451
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,833
Don't pass out on me!

452
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,000
Guess he didn't have
much of a choice.

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,083
Okay, I'm cold!

454
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,291
We've got Rihoko's omelet
and Mari's pizza!

455
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,958
It's hard to decide
which one's tastier!

456
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,458
This one is delectable,
and this one's scrumptious!

457
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,958
You're right!

458
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,166
You're pretty good, kid.

459
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
You're not so bad yourself!

460
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,583
Tell me,
how are the girls coming along?

461
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,208
Brilliantly.

462
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,166
We've made progress with the
Cloneblade improvements as well.

463
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,791
But I must have
the original Witchblade

464
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,041
to proceed any further.

465
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,791
I understand.

466
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,791
We should have it to you
very soon.

467
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,416
That's good,
thank you, sir.

468
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,875
The results will surpass
the original in every way.

469
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,625
I look forward to it, my dear.

470
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,083
And this girl
will surpass them all.

471
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,666
[Music]

472
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,750
Why do you drink so much
when you go out, Mom?

473
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,041
You know you shouldn't!

474
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,208
You get drunk so easily!

475
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,291
Look at you!

476
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,208
You're finally
wearing a pretty dress

477
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,958
and it goes to waste!

478
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,041
When you never came home
last night,

479
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,750
Mr. Cho and the others
got pretty worried.

480
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,333
But I'm glad I finally
got to meet your boss!

481
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,875
You talk bad about him
but I really like him!

482
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,208
He's way better than Tozawa!

483
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,500
Probably be even cooler
if he didn't have a hangover!

484
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,375
You should marry him, Mom!
