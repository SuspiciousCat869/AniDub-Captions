1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,166
Here is the report
you requested,

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,375
and the letter
for Power of Attorney.

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,333
Good work.

4
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,458
Send those out
along with a special message.

5
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,041
[Music]

6
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,208
How do things look
within the division?

7
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,625
It seems the employees
are under a gag order.

8
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,125
The decision has been made

9
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,166
not to alert
the general staff as yet,

10
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,208
so that business
can continue as usual.

11
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,750
To be safe,
let's increase surveillance

12
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,000
on the top officials.

13
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,833
We need to keep
everything under wraps,

14
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,250
at least until
I'm in total control.

15
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,833
And eliminating
the First-Gen Sisters?

16
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,666
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,916
They will be dealt with shortly.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,166
Good.

19
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,791
They're such a disappointment.

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,458
Come in.

21
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,750
It seems you've become
quite comfortable

22
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,250
in the President's chair.

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,208
You're a piece of work.

24
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,958
But I suppose
I should expect nothing less

25
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,041
from the latest
and greatest Neo-Gene.

26
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,208
What do you want?

27
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,291
About Furumizu.

28
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,000
Blame his death
on an accidental explosion.

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,708
I'll consider it.

30
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,583
Thank you, Nishida.

31
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,375
Now that I'm free
of his inane restrictions,

32
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,791
I can finally conduct
my research the way I want.

33
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,125
I look forward
to your results.

34
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,250
You really are something.

35
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,291
Ridiculous!

36
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,416
This organization
serves no purpose.

37
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,416
It will never live up
to my expectations.

38
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,250
One day...

39
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,833
the power to obtain
anything I want...

40
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:02,916
will be mine!

41
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:30,208
While she's definitely skilled,
she's extremely dangerous.

42
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,416
The slightest mistake,
and I'm next.

43
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,625
Hello?

44
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,208
Ah, Director Wado.

45
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,291
How are you?

46
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,125
Don't play stupid!

47
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,625
Did you even look at the data
I sent you?

48
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,666
Data?

49
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,666
Wha--what is this?

50
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,708
She defeated our Ultimateblade
without even breaking a sweat!

51
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't anyone inform me
that the Witchblade

52
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,958
was capable of such power?

53
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,291
And now that she's gone
and allied with Takayama,

54
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,791
there's no telling
when she may come after us.

55
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:21,916
Nishida?

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,333
Are you listening to me!

57
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,041
Yes, Wado.

58
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,000
I heard you.

59
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,333
I think we may have found
our trump card.

60
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,958
What do you mean, trump card?

61
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,750
We'll have to capture her
right away.

62
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,541
However, we can't do that
with just an Ultimateblade.

63
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,166
We're going to need
some of Doji's technology.

64
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,166
Yes, I agree.

65
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,708
Good.

66
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,125
Are you sure you're all right?

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,291
You used
a lot of power back there.

68
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,958
It might have affected you,
somehow.

69
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,833
No way!

70
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,875
Don't be silly; I feel fine!

71
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,125
See?

72
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,125
Couldn't be better!

73
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,291
Regardless.

74
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,916
You need to try
to avoid fighting.

75
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,000
If you get hurt, or worse,

76
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,583
imagine
what it would do to Rihoko.

77
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,625
And me.

78
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,208
So, does that mean
you've decided

79
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,666
you're ready to be her father?

80
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,666
Yeah.

81
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,208
Seriously?

82
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,833
Then we need
to get the two of you together

83
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,416
so you can start bonding.

84
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,291
We'll go slow at first.

85
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,416
But you're the only dad
she's ever gonna have.

86
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,750
Okay?

87
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
I suppose you're right.

88
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,458
Excellent!

89
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,083
Then I've got a little
proposition for ya.

90
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,291
Okay,
so here's the deal, Riko.

91
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,250
Tomorrow afternoon,
you, me and Mr. Takayama

92
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,458
are all gonna go out.

93
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,125
Whaddaya think?

94
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,083
Yaaay!

95
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,666
Does that mean
you and Mr. Takayama made up?

96
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,333
You could say that.

97
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,000
But are you sure
you want me to come along?

98
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,125
I mean, if I go with you,
I don't wanna feel

99
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,583
like I'm in your guys' way
or anything.

100
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,791
Don't be silly!

101
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,500
Mr. Takayama and I
aren't like that.

102
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,083
Where d'you get
such grown-up ideas.

103
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,750
Huh, kiddo?

104
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,750
I dunno, I just like him!

105
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,833
Thank Criminy.

106
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,208
Things're finally
calmin' down 'round here,

107
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,041
as much as they can.

108
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,875
I was hopin' I'd get to step in
as Rihoko's father figure.

109
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,583
But now,
it's not gonna happen!

110
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,000
My dreams are dashed,

111
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,125
and I'll never get to be
her surrogate daddy!

112
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,458
Get a hold of yourself, old man.

113
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,708
I woulda been a great daddy.

114
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,375
'Sides, there's a guy
who's got it a lot worse

115
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,666
than you right now.

116
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,833
...and I'd love her mom...

117
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,291
What? You mean me?

118
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,750
Let's start drinkin', Tozawa.

119
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,708
We'll drown our sorrows
in booze

120
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,958
until the sun comes up.

121
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,375
Listen, I already told you,
it's not like that, okay?

122
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,000
Happiness is yours.

123
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,583
Though it may seem
far, far away,

124
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,333
it will find its way to you.

125
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,750
I have foreseen it.

126
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,041
Mind your own business!

127
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,375
It's just you?

128
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,000
Where's your mother?

129
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,708
Oh, Mom had some last-minute
work stuff come up.

130
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,541
She said go on ahead
and she might meet us.

131
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,208
She had to work?

132
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,875
Oh yeah, here.

133
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,333
She sent this for you.

134
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,333
"I thought it would be nice
for you and Rihoko

135
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,958
"to have some one-on-one time.

136
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,416
"So have fun
and spoil her rotten!

137
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,083
Good luck, Daddy!"

138
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,458
Is there something wrong?

139
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,166
Uh, no.

140
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,458
Nothing at all.

141
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,416
Did she happen to say
anything else?

142
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,333
She told me I should leave
everything up to you

143
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,708
since you probably know
all the best restaurants

144
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,375
and date spots in town.

145
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,416
What?

146
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,000
Good afternoon.

147
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,916
What do you think,
Mr. Takayama?

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,291
It's fine.

149
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you.
Come again.

150
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,958
Have you decided?

151
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,625
Um. Not yet.

152
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,208
What do I do?

153
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,000
He looks mad.

154
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,541
I wish mom would
hurry and get here.

155
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,833
I noticed you left quite
a bit of food on your plate.

156
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,750
Was it not suitable
to your tastes?

157
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,833
No, I liked it,
the food was delicious.

158
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,875
That's good.

159
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,041
So, um...

160
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,500
are you bored because
my mom isn't with us?

161
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,833
What?

162
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,416
No, not in the slightest.

163
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,375
Why do you ask?

164
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,416
It's just...

165
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,375
'cause you've been scowling
all day long.

166
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,125
It makes you look angry.

167
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,666
Sorry. I'm...

168
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm just...
a little nervous.

169
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,458
To be honest,

170
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,083
I don't really know
how to interact with you.

171
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,583
I'm not used to being
around children.

172
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,250
You shoulda said somethin'.

173
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,958
Kids are easy.

174
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,625
All you gotta do is
smile real big and say, "Nee!"

175
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,833
Neee?

176
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,833
Almost.

177
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:36,916
But not like that.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,416
Go, "Nee!"

179
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,583
'kay?

180
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,791
Neeee?

181
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,916
Yeah.

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,291
But that one
was a little creepy.

183
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,500
Try it again. "Nee!"

184
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,958
Neeeee!

185
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,958
Neee!

186
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:51,958
Neee!

187
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,166
What the hell are they doing?

188
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,041
Maybe it was a bad idea
for me

189
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,291
to just leave the two of them
alone like this.

190
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,750
Is everything okay?

191
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,875
I'll be right back.

192
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,333
Can you wait here
for a minute?

193
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, crap!

194
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,458
Where do you think
you're going?

195
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,958
Uh, to the restroom?

196
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,375
So you've been
following us the whole time?

197
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,083
Gimme a break,
I was worried about you two.

198
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,583
Seriously.

199
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,875
Oh, come on!

200
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,125
You knew you would
have to do this eventually.

201
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,791
Figured it's better
if it happened sooner

202
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,833
rather than later.

203
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,000
Looks who's here!

204
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,083
Hey, Mom!

205
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,750
You finished
with work already?

206
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,708
Yep. All done for now.

207
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,666
So, what do you think
of Mr. Takayama?

208
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,208
I like him all right.

209
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,541
Yeah?

210
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,791
I'm so glad!

211
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:01,458
Now, you get to decide
what we do next.

212
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,625
'Kay!

213
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,250
You sure picked a lazy activity
for us, Riko.

214
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,416
It's something
I've always wanted to try.

215
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh, you got one!
You got one!

216
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,458
Stupid fish stole your bait.

217
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,500
Let's see.

218
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,250
There you go.

219
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,458
Thanks a lot!

220
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,583
All right!

221
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,666
I'm gonna catch a bunch!

222
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,583
Better keep up, Riko!

223
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,125
Oh, I will!

224
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,750
Hey. You've got a bite.

225
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
I do? I do!

226
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,666
Oh wow! Hey!

227
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,500
That one got away too!

228
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,875
Hey, can you bait
my hook for me?

229
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,291
You're a big girl,
do it yourself.

230
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,083
Awww, come on!

231
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,375
You're not doing it right!

232
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,666
You have to give it
some panache!

233
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,958
Mom, don't be so mean
to Mr. Takayama.

234
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,875
Don't you remember
your first time?

235
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,375
You spilled it everywhere!

236
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,041
Whose side
are you on here, Riko?

237
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,875
Not mine, obviously.

238
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,750
Okay. Here's yours,
Mr. Takayama.

239
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,791
Why, thank you.

240
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,458
What do you think?

241
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,500
Mmm, you're an excellent cook.

242
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,750
Really?

243
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,041
Thanks again!

244
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,458
That was delicious!

245
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,416
You know, I should've
just left you in charge

246
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,708
from the very start.

247
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,416
No, I think you did just fine!

248
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,666
I felt like
a grown-up at lunch.

249
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,500
And riding on that boat
was awesome.

250
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,875
I had a great time with you!

251
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,083
That's good.

252
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,416
I had a great time too.

253
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,875
A goldfish shop!

254
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,708
C'mon!

255
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,583
Let's check it out!

256
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,375
Whatever you say.

257
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,625
Wow! Look at them!

258
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,708
They're all so cute!

259
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,958
Oh, I like that little,
tiny one!

260
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,333
But I like that chubby one, too!

261
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,916
So, any thoughts
after spending a whole day

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,541
with your daughter?

263
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,583
Don't tease me.

264
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,166
I knew you two
would hit it off.

265
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,750
Yeah, things are kinda
awkward now but that'll pass.

266
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,666
Now I know I can leave
Riko in your care.

267
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,375
What is it?

268
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
I sense it.

269
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,500
What?

It's coming!

00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:16,875
Use the gun!

274
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,166
In the glove compartment,
quick!

Get down, Riko!

What's going on?

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,958
Just do it!

So, that's it.

283
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,000
You want the Witchblade.

No!

285

Damn you!
I can still fight back!

286
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,916
Not Riko.

287
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,583
I will not let you have her!

288
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,500
I can feel it.

289
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,375
This is it.

The power.

Impossible.

even the Ultimateblade.

I'm sorry, Mom.

I had no idea
your job was so rough.

322
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,083
I don't want you to work
so hard anymore.

00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,791
And please, don't worry
about money either.

she'd give me half the profits

the money I make,

we can build
our own house someday.

you just need to get better.
