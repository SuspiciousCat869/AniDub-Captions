1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,375
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,166
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,791
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,291
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,708
Righteous Sword of God,
or Hand of the Devil himself?

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,041
A new Bearer finds out,

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,625
seeking balance
between ecstasy and ruin.

8
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,416
[Music]

9
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,833
Ohhh-kay.

10
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,458
I got so many questions for ya,
my head hurts.

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,041
I don't even know
where to start.

12
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,166
So, why don't you
just fill me in?

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,041
And don't try to
weasel out this time.

14
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,041
Please, just...

15
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,791
Leave it 'til tomorrow.

16
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,375
I can't do this
in front of her.

17
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,375
But...

18
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,666
A'right, fair enough.

19
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,291
Just don't go skippin' town
on me or nothin'.

20
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,541
This is the first real home
we've ever had.

21
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,583
You think I'm gonna
throw that away

22
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,458
'cause o' some jerk like you?

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,916
Lookin' forward to chattin'
with ya, sweet-cheeks!

24
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,875
Oh, Riko.

25
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,250
You worked so hard,
you cleaned the whole place.

26
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm sorry, are you closed?

27
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,416
Long as I'm still up,
we're still open.

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,166
Kahlúa and milk then, please.

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,458
Hittin' the hard stuff.

30
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,125
I like it!

31
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,916
Is there somethin' wrong
with that?

32
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,958
Okay, so.

33
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,583
What do you do, exactly?

34
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,708
You say you do "odd jobs".

35
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,833
But what would make you
leave that kid alone all night?

36
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,708
Everything I do is to
keep her from being alone,

37
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,541
keep us together.

38
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,958
Yeah, well.

39
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,958
Heh. One thing's for sure

40
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,541
she's a whole lot more
"together" than you are.

41
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,291
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

42
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,208
I dunno, guess
she takes after her father.

43
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,708
What happened to him?

44
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,750
Wish I knew.

45
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't remember him.

46
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,833
What's that supposed to mean?

47
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,875
I don't remember anything
before the Great Quake.

48
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,666
If I didn't have Riko's
maternity diary

49
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,041
when they found me,

50
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,708
I wouldn't even know
my own name.

51
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,750
'Sides, it'd be a little awkward
if he showed up now,

52
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,666
and I don't know who he is.

53
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,875
Just about everybody lost
something in the Great Quake.

54
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,666
I guess for you,
your memory was that thing.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's a nice photo there.

56
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,583
Tozawa took that back
when he wasn't such a bum.

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,583
Really?

58
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,541
It's so good!

59
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,125
I know.

60
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,125
I keep tellin' him he could
make a career with that eye,

61
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,833
but all he wants
is his elusive "scoop."

62
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,125
Yeah! You got that right!

63
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,708
I mean who the hell
does he think he is!

64
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,333
Eveni-- Heeyyy!

65
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,125
C'mon! Where's the love?

66
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,750
We're drinkin' with
Melony tonight?

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,541
How come nobody told me?

68
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,583
Mr. Cho, please,
my name is Masane.

69
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,416
Sure thing, Melony,
so, what're ya havin'?

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,708
Mari. My shochu, please!

71
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,958
Now it's your shochu,
not mine?

72
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,166
Lemme check, I don't think
your name is on it.

73
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,666
Details-schmetails!

74
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,125
Naomi, the usual?

75
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,125
Cup o' warm milk?

76
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,041
A little moo-moo boob juice?

77
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,833
Okay?

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,958
Michael!

79
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,458
Perfect timing!

80
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,833
Let's get our drink on!

81
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,291
It's in the air.

82
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,708
All-night fever!

83
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,416
Yeah!

84
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,333
Some call it a tavern,
but I call it home!

85
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,333
'Ey!

86
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,958
Tozawa!

87
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,041
Come have a drink or three!

88
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,041
Yeah, no.

89
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,041
Thanks, but, not tonight.

90
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,041
What, can't hold your liquor?

91
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,791
Heh, I said "liquor".

92
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,041
Hey, now.

93
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,541
Don't forget
what you promised me tomorrow!

94
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not listening!

95
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,708
Not until you drink with us!

96
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,333
Drink! Drink!

97
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,333
Damn it, drink!

98
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,625
Ah, jeez.
Look at yourself.

99
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,375
No, hey, Michael.

100
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,541
Tonight's not.

101
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,041
Come on, Tozawa!

102
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,875
You know you wanna
get drunk with us!

103
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,416
Aaaand, down the hatch!

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,750
Yeah! Go for it, Melony!

105
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,416
Chug! Chug!
Chugga-chugga!

106
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,833
One down, one to go!

107
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,166
Keep 'em comin', boys!

108
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,333
And the reigning champion,
Lady Melony,

109
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,208
steps up for another one!

110
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,666
The following is a statement
prepared by Father.

111
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,083
"In regards to Shiori Tsuzuki,
my sadness runs deep.

112
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,500
"I anxiously await
a full investigation and report

113
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,750
"into why this tragedy occurred.

114
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,000
Additionally, I expect the same
concerning the Witchblade."

115
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,208
As a side note, Reina,

116
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,250
Father is a bit unnerved
that no such report

117
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,500
or any explanation at all

118
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,958
has yet been given
by you personally.

119
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,541
That is all.

120
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,375
What, again?

121
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,208
Dis is a classy joint!

122
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,666
An' you reekin' o' smoke
don't help our reputation!

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,208
Fire me.

125
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,416
Please be the one.

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,791
Be the one to say it.

127
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,208
Who's there?

128
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,250
"Star light, star bright.

129
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,333
Let my love quicken
your heart tonight!"

130
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,041
Mom, c'mon, wake up!

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,625
It's time for breakfast!

132
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,208
Mom!

133
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,458
I don't feel good.

134
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,375
My head hurts!

135
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,625
No! You drank too much again?

136
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:54,000
I distinctly remember
telling you to take it easy!

137
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,083
I did take it easy.

138
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,666
'Least it went down easy.

139
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,708
Oh well, what can you do?

140
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,333
I have to go
to the supermarket anyway.

141
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll getcha some medicine
while I'm there!

142
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,166
'Kay. Thank you, baby!

143
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,708
Yeah, come in.

144
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,041
Door's open.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,916
Mornin'...

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,583
Melony.

147
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,250
All right, you promised.

148
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,041
Time to spill the beans.

149
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,208
About what?

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,291
Don't gimme that.

151
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,125
Now, what the hell's going on?

152
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,791
That thing you changed into,
what is it?

153
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,791
Why d'you wanna know?

154
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,291
Why do you think?

155
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,083
This is huge.

156
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,833
Buyers'll be trippin'
over themselves.

157
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,833
So you're tellin' me
you'd go public?

158
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,208
Course,
I'll give you a healthy cut.

159
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,750
A'right, truth is:
I don't know a thing!

160
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,750
Nope, don't have
the foggiest idea

161
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,416
what you're talking about!

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,541
Oh, come on!

163
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,708
Who do you think
you're foolin'?

164
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,041
I got photographic proof,
clear as day!

165
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,500
And you're just gonna
stand there and deny it?

166
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,833
Deny what?
That picture's not me.

167
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,666
How can you even say that!

168
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,458
No idea
what you're talkin' 'bout!

169
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,375
Sorry, completely lost me!

170
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,791
Liar!

171
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,666
No clue, dude!

172
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,750
That's not me!

173
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,500
To be continued!

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,166
Shinjuku Four-Ten.

175
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,875
Code Zero-Niner,
Chuo Building.

176
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,250
Squad Three, please respond.

177
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,083
Detain all possible
eyewitnesses.

178
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,666
A'right, I'm back.

179
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,583
Would you cut me a break
already?

180
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,041
You say you do
odd jobs, right?

181
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,208
'Cause I got an odd one.

182
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,041
Now if you're gonna work for me,
I expect you to work.

183
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,625
But you won't complain,
long as I pay ya, right?

184
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,375
Yeah, right.

185
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,583
He says she was fine when
she came into work last night.

186
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,166
How could this happen
in just a few hours?

187
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,166
The M.O.'s new,
but sump'm tells me

188
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,916
it's connected to the others.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So what?

190
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,583
Y'think it's all
the same perp?

191
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,500
Nah, not necessarily.

192
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,916
Tsh.

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,333
'Til this, I thought I had
all the victims connected.

194
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,416
Oh, God.

195
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,583
I hope my stomach holds out.

196
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,000
Looks like another one of
your creepy-crawlies struck.

197
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,708
Look, I've been all over
these horrific murder cases.

198
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,833
And just when I thought
I was onto a solid lead,

199
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:21,458
I found you, and it was you,
right in the middle of it.

200
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,666
I will figure out
what's going on here.

201
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,833
Tozawa!

202
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,000
Get the hell outta there!

203
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,833
See, there you go again,
Detective,

204
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,375
bossin' everyone around!

205
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,416
Bet it drives your fellow
boys in blue up the wall!

206
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,833
Oh, that's rich!

207
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,625
You want another ass-whoopin'?

208
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,916
Whoa, hey.

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Wouldja look at the time?
Bye!

210
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,750
Detective Nakata
is the lead investigator

211
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,750
on all these cases
I'm following.

212
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,250
He's a bit of an asshat.

213
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,791
So you sell photos
of crime scenes?

214
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,916
'Zat a problem?

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,250
You talk tough, but really,

216
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,375
do you have fun
doin' that sorta thing?

217
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,416
You tell me, Amnesia Girl.

218
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,708
Is it fun for you?

219
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,375
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

220
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,166
Your call.

221
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,833
Yeah, it's his car.

222
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,583
Let's give him a warm welcome.

223
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,750
Been a long time.

224
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,375
Tozawa.

225
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,750
I'm sorry, sir,
have we met before?

226
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,333
One year ago, you sold
some photos to a magazine.

227
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,583
A valued customer entering
my establishment with a woman.

228
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,916
Yeah, it's ringin' a bell.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,375
Surely you can appreciate
our humiliation,

230
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
when we were accused
of poor security.

231
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,083
Yeesh.

232
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,333
Tell ya the truth,
those pics really didn't sell

233
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,625
for all that much.

234
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,500
Guy just wasn't
a big enough deal.

235
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,541
What!

236
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,833
Y'know what?

237
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,458
I'll make it up to ya.

238
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,750
Melony, hon?

239
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,166
Be a dear and grab
that envelope off the dash.

240
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,708
Go ahead.

241
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,750
You catch on quick,
I like that.

242
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,833
I wasn't born yesterday.

243
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,208
It's not in here.

244
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,083
Are you sure about that?

245
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,166
I coulda sworn I...
Close the door!

246
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,166
Does this kind of thing
happen to you a lot?

247
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,291
No more than you'd think.

248
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,583
Pain in the ass!

249
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,333
What, are you tryin'
to get us killed?

250
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,750
'Ey, if you tell me yer story,

251
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
I might be persuaded
to slow down.

252
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,083
Is this really the time?

253
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,708
I need to hear it.

254
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,791
Please tell me.

255
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,625
Damn it! Where'd he go?

256
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,458
Best to play it safe
and lie low a bit longer.

257
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,666
Why don't you go to the cops?

258
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,208
Why bother?

259
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,208
Piggies've got a whole lot
better things to do

260
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,875
with their time
than chase down street thugs.

261
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,666
Wish you had better things
to do with your time.

262
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,375
Not a chance, sweet cheeks.

263
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,666
Why the hell not?

264
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,416
Ain't rocket science.

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,750
Who in their right mind
would sit on a story like this!

266
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,375
I see!

267
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,333
Too bad I don't know
anything about it.

268
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,750
Just drop it.

269
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,875
If I'm sure of anything,
it's that this is you.

270
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,583
You can deny it
'til you're blue in the face,

271
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,583
but the truth'll come out

272
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,041
as soon as
this thing sees print.

273
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,541
Stop this!

274
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,791
What're you doing?

275
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,000
I have the negative,
I can make copies!

276
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,083
Please, just don't.

277
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,625
I don't want Riko to find out.

278
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,583
Please.

279
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,625
Look, I get where you're
comin' from, it's just...

280
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,791
Director.

281
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,375
Per your request, I've sent
the crystallized remains

282
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,583
of the Neo-Gene
who attacked us to the lab.

283
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,791
And I have the file for your
Board of Directors meeting.

284
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,166
Is it true the Witchblade

285
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,375
ultimately consumes
and destroys its hosts?

286
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,541
If past records are accurate.

287
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,125
And it'll do the same to Masane?

288
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,250
The lab will investigate that.

289
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,291
If that is the case,
I feel sorry for her.

290
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,208
The Witchblade is on the agenda
for discussion.

291
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,791
There was pressure from
the director of Bio Division

292
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,041
to have it included.

293
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,500
Wado did this?

294
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,000
Seems he's beyond rivalry,
he truly views you as his enemy.

295
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,083
It may get ugly in there.

296
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,708
Arguments with him
always get ugly.

297
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,375
He doesn't know
when to give up, I take it?

298
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,750
Do you know
how all of us described Wado

299
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,583
back in our college days?

300
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,166
How?

301
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,000
"Like gum stuck to your shoe."

302
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,416
Actually, that's perfect.

303
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,375
Well, this is boring.

304
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,375
Gee, y'think?

305
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,416
Sorry 'bout
that "Amnesia Girl" crack,

306
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,666
Mari told me.

307
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,791
Is it true?

308
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,500
Yeah, it is.

309
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,541
I don't even remember
giving birth to Rihoko.

310
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,958
I'm amazed you can
get through each day.

311
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,916
Well, it gets easier.

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,916
Sure, it was hard at first.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
But Riko and I are a family.

314
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,458
Somehow things work out.

315
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:36,500
By the way, I meant to tell you
how much I like your photograph.

316
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,875
The one hanging in the café.

317
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,791
Oh, that.

318
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,916
Pics like that...

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,875
can't take 'em anymore.

320
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,541
Back when I was
young and naïve,

321
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,541
I sold all
my earthly possessions

322
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,625
and trekked around
the worst parts of the world,

323
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,541
honing my photography skills.

324
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,791
I came home once I felt
I finally had enough experience.

325
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,958
But the people I was so anxious
to show my photos to,

326
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,833
family, girlfriend, teachers,

327
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,875
they were all dead.

328
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,583
The irony was overwhelming,
I couldn't cry or scream.

329
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,625
And then I realized,
all I had left

330
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,291
was the camera in my hands.

331
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,125
Everything I had,
everything I was,

332
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,250
was buried in that rubble.

333
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,250
So, that's my story.

334
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,666
When I talked to Mariko,

335
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,750
she told me that everybody lost
something in the Great Quake.

336
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,291
Ain't that the truth.

337
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,250
We're kinda the same.

338
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,250
Damn right.

339
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,041
Which is why
you should just tell me

340
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,125
'bout all the wacky stuff.

341
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,875
Huh! And how d'ya figure that?

342
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,250
Hey, work is work!

343
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,583
We were totally having a moment,
and you had to go an' spoil it!

344
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,458
Y'know, any normal person
would say,

345
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,250
"Here, lean on me!
Have a good cry!"

346
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,416
Dumbass!

347
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,708
What a bunch o'
sentimentalist crap!

348
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,125
Come on, out with it!

349
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,958
After you call me names?

350
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,791
Forget it,
I'll never tell you now.

351
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,166
What's wrong?

352
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,041
Please be the one.

353
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,041
Please!

354
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,791
Be the one to say it!

355
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,125
"Star light, star bright,

356
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,916
Let my love
quicken your heart tonight!"

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,916
Dammit! I shoulda been
paying attention!

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,791
C'mon, we can't just sit here!

359
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,625
Gee, y'think?

360
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,458
Please, I need you to say it!

361
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,625
What the--?
I should have changed by now.

362
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,125
Yeah, so...

363
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,541
you might wanna do somethin'.

364
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,583
It isn't working.

365
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,500
"Let my love quicken
your heart tonight!"

366
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,500
We gotta run!

367
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,625
Yeah!

368
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,416
Please, just say it!

369
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,250
"Star light, star bright!"

370
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,416
Aw, crap!

371
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
"Let my love
quicken your heart tonight!"

372
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
Whoa, Melony!

373
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
You all right?

374
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,541
T-Tozawa...

375
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,166
Make me a deal!

376
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,166
Huh!

377
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,458
What're you talkin' 'bout?

378
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,791
Take all the photos
of me you want!

379
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,916
But the catch?

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,083
I've gotta tell Rihoko myself!

381
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,833
And you don't go public
'til I do!

382
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,125
How long?

383
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,458
At least a year.

384
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,708
No way!

385
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,125
You have to give me this!

386
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,791
You won't be sorry!

387
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,875
All right, fine.

388
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,041
You got one year, that's it.

389
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,541
The pact has been sealed!

390
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,875
Help me.

391
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,291
I can't.

392
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,041
I can't take anymore!

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,083
Crap, he's gone!

394
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,000
He was different
from the others.

395
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,416
But how?

396
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,416
I got a bad feelin' about this.

397
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,958
'Kay, hope
I didn't forget anything.

398
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,166
Thank you, come again!

399
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,291
Let's see, got that,
and I got that and...

400
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,708
Yep! Got everything!

401
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,916
Hello there.

402
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,041
Um, hello.

403
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,166
Um, is there something
that you wanted?

404
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,333
Not really.

405
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,625
Do I need a reason
for coming to the market?

406
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,375
Yeah, uh...

407
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,833
My mom is waiting.

408
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:46,916
Your mom.

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,958
I see.

410
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:48,958
Well...

411
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,416
Goodbye, now!

412
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,208
They think that...?

413
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,083
What a piece o' crap.

414
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
How can you say that?

415
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,500
I love this car!

416
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,916
Hi, Mom!

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Riko, hey!

418
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,833
Whoa.

419
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,000
Mom, what's going on?

420
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,875
Why're you with Mister Tozawa?

421
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,875
No biggie.

422
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,250
I had a little work to do

423
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,333
and your ma was
just helping me out.

424
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,250
I'd be careful, Mom!

425
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,125
I think Mister Tozawa's
got his eye on you!

426
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,541
Oh yeah, I'll be careful,
I'll be real careful!

427
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,833
Hey!

428
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,625
What kind of family are you?

429
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,958
Oh yeah, Mom?

430
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,083
Almost forgot.

431
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,458
Just a minute ago...

432
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
Yeah?

433
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,791
It was nothing.

434
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,041
Oh! I got your medicine!

435
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,041
Oh, awesome!

436
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,458
Thank you!

437
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,541
"My love,
let my love quicken."

438
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,041
No, please.

439
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,166
Don't make me do this anymore!

440
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,791
[Music]

441
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,625
Wow, Mom, there are
so many people in Tokyo!

442
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,416
I know we haven't been here
very long,

443
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,583
but I already have
so many friends.

444
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:41,041
Mister Cho, Miss Mariko,
Miss Naomi, and Mister Michael.

445
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,375
I guess I can include
Mister Tozawa too, huh?

446
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,166
And lately, there's this
pretty lady I keep seeing,

447
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,750
but I don't know her name.

448
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,875
Oh! And I met a nice man
at the park.

449
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,291
He's going to buy
a new house soon!

450
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,958
I hope we can get our own
cute little house someday!
