1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,791
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,500
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,375
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,541
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,875
Righteous sword of God?

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,875
Or Hand of the Devil himself?

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,291
A new bearer finds out,

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,583
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,375
[♪♪♪♪♪]

10
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,375
Maria! Stop it!

11
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,166
Let her go!

12
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,333
First-aid! Quickly!

13
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,625
How many times must we
have this discussion, Maria?

14
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,000
This is training.

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,125
Your behavior is unacceptable!

16
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,125
Whatever.

17
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,916
Don't "whatever" me.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,333
Chief Nishida, ma'am.

19
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,791
Really?

20
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,166
Wow. That was like, easy.

21
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,458
Kinda weird, huh?

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,708
Maria! That was
one of your sisters!

23
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,375
Try and show some remorse!

24
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,750
Fine then.

25
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sick of this.

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,125
And it's obvious you hate me.

27
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,208
I'm gonna go talk
to Grandfather.

28
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,833
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,583
Perhaps I spoke too harshly.

30
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,916
Tell you what, why don't
I take you shopping next week?

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,541
I'll buy you a whole bunch
of new stuffed animals!

32
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,250
Yeah, okay.

33
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,625
That makes five now,
doesn't it?

34
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,375
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,416
Then I have high hopes
for the future.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,666
Once we equip her with
the new blade we're developing,

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,041
who knows what will happen?

38
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,041
Bo-rrring.

39
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,208
Ah, Nora.

40
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,250
Sir.

41
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,500
I believe I will let
the matter of the Witchblade

42
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
fall into your hands.

43
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,083
I will take care of it, Father.

44
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,250
With all due haste.

45
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,583
Morning, Mister Takayama!

46
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,208
Are you feeling all right?

47
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,208
Where am I?

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,416
Oh good, you're awake.

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,708
This is my place.

50
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,125
What?

51
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,291
You totally passed out
in the park last night.

52
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,333
I had to get my neighbors
to help carry you.

53
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,125
Yep, you were quite a handful!

54
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,208
You didn't
have to do all that.

55
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,000
You could've
just called the company.

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,583
Well,
I was a bit drunk myself.

57
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,458
Ah yes, right.

58
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,583
Then I sincerely thank you
for helping m--

59
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,250
The bathroom's
right over there for ya.

60
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,583
Wow, I've never seen him
look so vulnerable before.

61
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,625
Don't get any ideas, Mom.

62
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,625
He is still your boss,
you know.

63
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,833
What, you think I like him?

64
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,083
No way.

65
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,958
I don't see why you wouldn't.

66
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,125
He's a way better catch
than that Mr. Tozawa.

67
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,333
In fact,
you should marry him, Mom!

68
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,791
I wouldn't mind it
if he was my dad!

69
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,625
Marry him?
Ew, don't say that!

70
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,583
Here you go!

71
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
The sofa is all yours.

72
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
I really need to be going.

73
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,375
Running around now
will just make you sick again.

74
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,416
What you need is rest!

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,416
Move along, right this way.

76
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,208
Trust me, it's best
if you just do as she says.

77
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,333
Princess Rihoko
is always right.

78
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,041
Take this:
it's Mom's hangover medicine.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,083
Now lie back and relax.

80
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,083
No, I, uhh...

81
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,625
Rest!

82
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,708
Want anything to eat?

83
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,250
No, not ready for food.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,375
Thank you.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,791
Aw! The Dreaded Hangover Beast
turned you into a human being!

86
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,166
Ooh, some miso soup
might help!

87
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,625
I gotta run
and buy green onions first.

88
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,000
Want me to go for you?

89
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,791
Thanks,
but no thanks, Mom,

90
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,291
you'd just buy
old, withered ones.

91
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,291
Gimme a break,
I'm not that bad!

92
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,833
Sorry, you are.

93
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,041
Anyways, be right back!

94
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,958
Whatcha got there?

95
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,083
Nothing!

96
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,625
Now I gotta know.

97
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,333
It's a secret.

98
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,583
Hey, you sneezed
last night too.

99
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,333
Riko, do you have a cold?

100
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,541
Your face looks
a little flush to me.

101
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,291
No way, I'm fine!

102
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,166
See ya in a sec!

103
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,750
I have to say, your daughter
is really something.

104
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,208
The one thing in my life
I'm truly proud of.

105
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,916
Yeah, I'll bet.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,916
She's a lot more together
than you are.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,333
This from the guy who couldn't
even stand up last night.

108
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,708
That only happened
because of your behavior.

109
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,875
You were like a child running
wild at an amusement park!

110
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,041
Well, if I'm such a child,
why'd you even make me go

111
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,916
in the first place?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,916
Be quiet,
my head is throbbing!

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,708
You are impossible!

114
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,708
And after you were
so sweet last night.

115
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,250
Hello, Segawa.

116
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,583
Yes, it's me.

117
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,708
Director.

118
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,958
Where are you?

119
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,833
Something came up.

120
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,416
I'll be in this afternoon.

121
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,958
That's not
really advisable, sir.

122
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,958
What?

123
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,791
Wado came storming
into your office

124
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,000
a short while ago.

125
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,250
He's demanding to speak to you
about the Witchblade.

126
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,958
And he's clearly still upset
over the "incident"

127
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,625
at the party last night.

128
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,583
I felt it would be prudent
to turn him away for the day,

129
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,291
so I told him you were ill.

130
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,375
That wasn't necessary.

131
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,875
Honestly, sir,
I don't think you should risk

132
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,041
exacerbating the situation.

133
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,208
Wado is in rare form today.

134
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,458
Please accept
my apologies, sir.

135
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,500
And thank you for waiting.

136
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,625
Unfortunately,

137
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,458
Director Takayama
can't move a muscle.

138
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,958
Such a shame too,
since you've come all this way.

139
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,416
Oh! Speck of dust.

140
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,666
I've been watching you.

141
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,166
Segawa, right?

142
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,083
I must say,
from what I've seen,

143
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,916
I'm quite impressed
with your skill as an assistant.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,416
I'm honored
to hear you say so.

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,750
It's said the make of a man
can be told by his appearance.

146
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,125
In that regard,
you are truly impeccable.

147
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,208
What concerns me is why
someone of your caliber

148
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,625
is wasting his time working
for a man like Takayama.

149
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,833
I like to surround myself
with strong people.

150
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,041
Is that it?

151
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,416
Maintain that philosophy, son,
you'll go far.

152
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,583
Yagi, we're finished here.

153
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,791
Ah, Wado.

154
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,208
Naturally, I plan on taking
the liberty of seeing

155
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,125
exactly how strong you are.

156
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,666
Aw, Rihoko!

157
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,166
You got a cold?

158
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,583
Oh, no! I'm fine!

159
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,625
Hey Rihoko, I got
some nice freshwater clams!

160
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,375
Perfect cure
for your mom's hangovers!

161
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,083
Really? I didn't know
clams were good for hangovers.

162
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,625
They go great
in a big pot of miso soup!

163
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,875
Hold on now!

164
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,125
It's not miso soup
without green onions!

165
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,916
Here ya go, Rihoko,
top quality, on the house!

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,125
I'm tellin' ya,
clams are the way to go.

167
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,833
Can it, sea-hag!

168
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,625
Rihoko clearly came
to my shop, not yours!

169
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't you try'n monopolize
her, Mr. Selfish!

170
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,833
Rihoko, are you okay?

171
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,541
Rihoko, what's wrong?

172
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,625
Rihoko!

173
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,000
What do we do?

174
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,125
Somebody call a Doctor.

175
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,250
This is just weird.

176
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,208
Having Takayama
in my home like this.

177
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,583
Masane!

178
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,958
Rihoko fainted at the market!

179
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,791
I heard somebody
took her to the hospital,

180
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,291
but they said...

181
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,541
No!

182
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,541
Wait!

183
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,375
There's more,
I'm not finished!

184
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,541
You forgot your shoes!

185
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,833
Hold up a second!

186
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,958
Oh, Riko.

187
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,958
You really were sick earlier!

188
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,083
I'm so sorry!

189
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,166
I should've been
paying more attention!

190
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,833
Come-on-come-on-come-on,
I-do-not-have-time-for-this!

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,750
Um, excuse me, which way
is the nearest hospital?

192
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,875
What, are you, deaf!

193
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,333
The hospital!

194
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,250
Where is it?

195
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,125
Get in!

196
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,000
So you ran out blindly
with no idea where to go?

197
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,875
I cannot imagine
what you were thinking.

198
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,625
But, Rihoko! She's--

199
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,000
Calm down and
just listen for a minute.

200
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,166
It sounds like there's no need
to be in such a panic.

201
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,208
Apparently, there was a doctor
among the crowd at the market,

202
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,166
who treated her
and took her to the hospital.

203
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,416
Riko! Riko!

204
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,458
Are you the girl's mother?

205
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,666
Riko!
I mean, I'm, yes!

206
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,666
Is she?

207
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,208
Your daughter is fine.

208
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,958
It's acute enteritis
caused by her cold,

209
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,625
but she'll be better in no time.

210
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,416
She will?

211
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,666
Oh, thank god.

212
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,750
To be safe, we'd like to keep
her tonight for observation,

213
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,416
but she can go home tomorrow.

214
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,666
Great!

215
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,208
Thank you,
thank you so much!

216
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,375
Oh, before I forget,
I heard when she fainted,

217
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,041
there was a doctor passing by
who brought her in.

218
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,041
Yes, but she doesn't actually
work in this hospital.

219
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,458
She said she didn't do much
to treat your daughter,

220
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,625
so she left without
giving her name.

221
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,000
Aw, that's too bad.

222
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,250
I was hoping
I could thank her too.

223
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,666
Good day, ma'am.

224
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,791
Thank you again, Doctor.

225
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,666
Hi, Mom.

226
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
Riko! Are you all right?

227
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,500
How are you feeling?

228
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,541
I'm fine.

229
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,416
I just wish you would've told me
you weren't feeling well.

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,583
It's my fault too, though.

231
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,375
But I really
did feel okay earlier.

232
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,500
Then all of a sudden,
my tummy started hurting.

233
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,125
I'm sorry, Mom.

234
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,125
Oh, Riko.

235
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,208
I was so frightened.

236
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,291
Thank you, by the way.

237
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,833
For the taxi, my shoes.

238
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,041
You know...

239
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,625
there is such a thing
as overreaction.

240
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,500
The second I heard
Riko had fainted,

241
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,875
my mind just went
completely blank.

242
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
I suspect that would be
a natural response

243
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,000
from any good parent.

244
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,875
Well, I suppose
you have a good side, too.

245
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,958
You think?

246
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, yeah.

247
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,500
I would never guess
you were someone

248
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,916
who was in the business
of re-animating corpses.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,958
Great.
Are you still on about that?

250
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
Yeah, of course I am.

251
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,250
So now what?

252
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,416
"So now what," what?

253
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,208
Your job with the X-Cons,
do you want to quit?

254
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,541
What'll it be?

255
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,250
Will you stop fighting?

256
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
Well, I...

257
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,708
What's the matter?

258
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,208
I feel something.

259
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,333
Not an X-Con,
something different.

260
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,375
A Neo-Gene?

261
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,958
Yeah.

262
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,958
But I'm pretty sure
it's not Lady.

263
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
It doesn't feel the same.

264
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,208
I have to go!

265
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,583
No, wait.

266
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,583
If it is a Neo-Gene,
there's no reason to fight her.

267
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,875
Just let it go.

268
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,083
I can't.

269
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,875
She's come looking
for a fight.

270
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,458
And I won't let that happen
anywhere near Riko.

271
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:07,083
Besides, I'm not the one
calling the shots!

272
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,625
But, what about...

273
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,958
What if...

274
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,083
What if the Witchblade...

275
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,750
I mean, I thought
you would be afraid

276
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,791
of what might happen.

277
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,000
Hell yes, I'm afraid!

278
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,958
But...

279
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,041
I know I'm not any good
at doing motherly-type things.

280
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,625
I have no job skills
and no family.

281
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,333
So I at least
want to make sure

282
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,166
I leave Rihoko some money
when I'm gone.

283
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,750
So, there's your answer.

284
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,666
I can never stop fighting!

285
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,750
I'll fight your X-Cons,
and if Neo-Genes want to attack,

286
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,291
I'll fight them, too!

287
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,833
I can't afford to worry
about dying right now.

288
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
For Riko's sake...

289
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,208
I fight!

290
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,041
What are you looking at
over there?

291
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,291
They're blueprints
for a house!

292
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,666
This is where my mom and I
are gonna live someday!

293
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,291
Yeah? I bet it's nice!

294
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,416
Father would like
a word with you.

295
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I would appreciate it
if you'd come with me.

296
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,125
No thanks!

297
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,375
So be it.

298
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,625
Send a recovery team.

299
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,375
Our operative's made contact
with a Neo-Gene.

300
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,666
She may find herself
in need of backup.

301
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,833
Understood, sir.

302
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,416
Such wonderful resistance!

303
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,083
Like a nearly-ripe fruit
dangling from the vine.

304
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,375
You can stop running.

305
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,250
I promise I won't kill you.

306
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,000
Or you could just
stop running after me.

307
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,083
I'm afraid
that's asking for too much.

308
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,666
Now let's put an end
to this charade, shall we?

309
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,541
Yes.

310
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,208
Let's.

311
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,000
Once I've made my point!

312
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,750
Get her out of there!

313
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,083
I can't do it!

314
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,708
They're too close,
I don't have a clean shot!

315
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,958
Damn it!

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,083
Now then...

317
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,958
Shall we be going?

318
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
Father is waiting.

319
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,125
Damn it!

320
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,541
Oh, man.

321
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,125
And gettin' in
was just the first part.

322
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,916
Only place I'm gonna find
any straight answers

323
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,416
about the Neo-Genes is here.

324
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,291
Melony!

325
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,291
What the hell is goin' on?

326
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,250
Riko.

327
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,166
Rihoko.

328
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,708
[Music]

329
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,208
Riko...

330
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:33,125
I'm so sorry I didn't
realize you had a cold.

331
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,583
Is your tummy
feeling better now?

332
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,208
I have to work again.

333
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,541
And this time I don't think
I'll be coming home very soon.

334
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,416
I decided to work extra hard
for your sake,

335
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,208
but I'm so afraid
I'm going to disappoint you.

336
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,541
I know, I'm pathetic.

337
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,791
I just wish I could
see your face right now.

338
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,166
Hearing your voice
for even a second

339
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,958
would give me strength.

340
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,958
Listen to me.

341
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm such a terrible mother.
