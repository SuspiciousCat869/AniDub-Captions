1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,375
I apologize about
what happened to Nora.

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,958
I'm not concerned.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,791
I believe she had reached
the full extent of her power.

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,125
Regardless, I find no reason

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,458
to investigate
Reina's child any further.

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,666
But Father,
what if she possesses...

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,000
That is simply
not possible, my dear.

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,375
No mere human could ever
surpass the Neo-Genes.

9
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,375
It is inconceivable.

10
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,208
[Music]

11
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,125
So um...

12
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,375
We're going to your house,
right?

13
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
What's it like, exactly?

14
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,416
Well, it's not really a house.

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,250
I live on the top floor
of a condominium.

16
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,833
It may be different
from what you're used to.

17
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,916
Oh.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,541
Okay.

19
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,708
It's all right.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,208
There's no reason
for you to be concerned.

21
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,208
You're my daughter now and
I will take good care of you.

22
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,208
Yeah.

23
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,000
I have relocated
the child to my home.

24
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,875
As of today,
I shall begin a record

25
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,291
of our mother-daughter
relations.

26
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,875
Oh, wow!

27
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,958
This place is huge!

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,791
There is a bedroom
for you as well.

29
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,458
Here you are.

30
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,625
No way!

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,916
It's almost like
a toy store in here!

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,291
I wasn't sure
of your preferences,

33
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,250
so I purchased a variety.

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
If you find anything lacking,
please let me know.

35
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,666
It's more than enough,
thank you.

36
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,333
You can play until dinnertime.

37
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,416
Oh!

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,833
I can help!

39
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,333
I'm a good cook,
I do it all the time!

40
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,625
No thank you.

41
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,750
It is the mother's job
to prepare the meals.

42
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,166
Children need their playtime.

43
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,291
'Kay.

44
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,750
But if you change your mind,
just come and get me

45
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,375
and I'll be happy to help!

46
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,416
I'll let you know.

47
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,041
At this point in time,
the child's actions

48
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,166
appear to be normal.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,250
Some minor agitation
is apparent,

50
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,541
but there's no cause
for concern.

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,125
I have yet to experience
any noteworthy changes myself.

52
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,333
Everything is proceeding
extraordinarily well.

53
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,166
This situation
is so screwed up!

54
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,166
This sucks!
They can't do that!

55
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,541
Real mother, my ass!

56
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,625
Melony is Rihoko's
real mother!

57
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not right!

58
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,375
"Children become what
their parents make of 'em".

59
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,958
Man, people were pretty smart
back in the day.

60
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,500
Hey, Mari, ya ever
heard of Judge Ooka?

61
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,583
Betcha, foster parents
raised him.

62
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,625
It's not our place
to be buttin' in, old man.

63
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,500
Well, it still sucks.

64
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,625
Melony's made her decision.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,375
You're right.
But she's sufferin' for it.

66
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,541
I hate seein' her
down in the dumps like this.

67
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,041
Man, there's gotta be
another side to all this.

68
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,958
Dammit!

69
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,916
The Cloneblade
is in its final stages, Father.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Once Maria
is outfitted with it,

71
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,000
we could achieve results
we never thought possible.

72
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,541
I must say
I've been impressed

73
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,958
with Maria's newfound
motivation to train.

74
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,750
The promise of a reward
for her efforts

75
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,250
has proven effective.

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,041
Great work today, Maria.

77
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,875
You've been in a good mood
lately, what's up?

78
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,625
Grandpa promised
once I finish all this,

79
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,625
he'd tell me about my mom!

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,416
So hurry up and put
the Cloneblade on me, okay?

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,416
I'm sorry, Maria,
but not yet;

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,291
the Cloneblade is still
in its fine-tuning stages.

83
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,250
Now there's one last thing.

84
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,250
This way.

85
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,500
Why not?

86
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,166
Why can't you put it on yet?

87
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,000
I've been working so hard
all this time!

88
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,625
I hate them all.

89
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,041
Hope they all die!

90
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,958
Hey, you know what?

91
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,458
My mom would do anything
for me.

92
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,666
Whatever I want,
and all I gotta do is ask.

93
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,208
She'd never do
anything bad to me.

94
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,208
And she'll always wanna be
with me no matter what!

95
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,375
Wonder what she's like.

96
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,833
I gotta meet her.

97
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,416
Her mental development
is progressing much slower

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,541
than her physical growth.

99
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,208
Each girl does develop
at her own rate.

100
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,750
Whoa, neat!

101
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,791
It's like at a restaurant!

102
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,500
Let's eat, shall we?

103
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,583
Okay, thank you so much!

104
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,333
Delicious!

105
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,083
Is it? I'm glad.

106
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,083
Soup's good too.

107
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,375
I can taste the butter
and milk flavors.

108
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,166
But there's no consommé,
is there?

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,250
I only put in
what the recipe called for.

110
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,666
You mean, you don't
normally cook like this?

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,083
No.

112
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,541
It's pretty impressive that
you can make such yummy food

113
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,208
when you don't really cook.

114
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,875
Isn't that what
a mother's supposed to do?

115
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,833
You're the best cook
in the whole wide world, Riko!

116
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,958
Is something wrong?

117
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,208
Oh, no!

118
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,166
Thanks for dinner!

119
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,000
Your bedroom's down the hall,
remember?

120
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,791
I know, but we haven't said
goodnight to each other yet.

121
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,625
Oh! Good night, Rihoko.

122
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,458
I can do that if you want!

123
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,875
Let me brush the back for you!

124
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,166
Thanks,
but I can do it myself.

125
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,000
What's wrong?

126
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,708
Nothing.

127
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,083
Good night.

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,833
Mom! Quit movin' around!

129
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,541
Well, stop tickling so much!

130
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,375
No.

131
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,125
Not anymore.

132
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,833
Miss Reina is my mom now.

133
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,041
Day 1 of our cohabitation
has come to an end.

134
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
There are no incidents
worthy of report.

135
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,416
I have yet to experience
any changes physically or...

136
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,125
Revision:
It seems that my own

137
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,250
Blade-induced breakdown
has begun.

138
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,083
End report.

139
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,916
You don't seem to be
eating much, either.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,875
Why are you ignoring my calls?

141
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,958
What if I need you
for an emergency assignment?

142
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,208
Don't tell me you've forgotten
about our contract.

143
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,291
I'm backing out.

144
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,208
You what?

145
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,791
There's nothing to fight for.

146
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,625
I quit.

147
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,500
Not like I need
the money anymore.

148
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,125
Don't be stupid!

149
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,166
Like it or not, you are
the bearer of the Witchblade!

150
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,708
You can't simply quit
whenever you feel like it!

151
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,875
Fine then, take it.

152
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,875
Go ahead!

153
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,041
Cut off my arm,
do whatever it takes.

154
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:50,958
I don't want it.

155
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,333
Come on!

156
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,333
What the hell
do you think you're doing!

157
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,541
Let go of me, you jerk!

158
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,208
I said, let go!

159
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,416
Woo-hoo!

160
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,833
Why'd you do that?

161
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,041
Like I said, you're the bearer
of the Witchblade.

162
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,916
I refuse to let you
sabotage yourself any further.

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,083
Yeah, well...

164
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,416
I did tell you to do
whatever you had to.

165
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,041
Hey.

166
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,250
You used to go out
with Reina Soho, didn't you?

167
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,916
You don't think
you could be Riko's father.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,625
In all honesty,

169
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,041
it's not an impossibility.

170
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,083
That's it?

171
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,083
That's all I get?

172
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,875
Whatever.

173
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,166
Guess it's
none of my business anyway.

174
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,291
I shouldn't care.

175
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,958
I'm not Riko's mother anymore.

176
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,458
So...

177
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,916
How about we go outside?

178
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,916
What for?

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,250
Well, the weather's really nice,
we could take a walk,

180
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,875
or go shopping.

181
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,916
Don't worry about the shopping,
I'll do that later.

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,375
The only thing you should
concern yourself with

183
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,625
is playing.

184
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,666
'Kay.

185
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,458
What's the matter?

186
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,583
It's um...

187
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,916
Nothin'.

188
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,000
Umm...

189
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,000
What's wrong?

190
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,083
Stay back!

191
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,583
I'll be fine!

192
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
Go to your room and play!

193
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,916
'Kay.

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,416
Ladies and gentlemen of
the Witchblade Project, welcome.

195
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,666
You are the chosen few

196
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,375
who will carry the Doji Group
into the future.

197
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,125
I have the utmost faith
that you will make

198
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,750
mass-production
of the Witchblade a reality.

199
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,125
While I respect the efforts
of the Special Division

200
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,958
up to this point,

201
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,250
they've wasted a good deal
of our time and budget

202
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,500
with no real results.

203
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,375
The Bio Division will not
fall prey to those mistakes.

204
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,750
We will achieve
what others could not!

205
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,875
I don't know, Director.

206
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,500
He's serious about
taking us down.

207
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,333
Interesting.

208
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,041
So Wado and Bio Division

209
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,000
have formed their own
Witchblade research team?

210
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,250
It's already causing trouble
in our division.

211
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,750
Perhaps it would be a good idea

212
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,958
if you took Masane somewhere
and returned to the office.

213
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,541
No.

214
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,291
Let him do
what he wants for now.

215
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,166
But sir, Wado's confidence
makes me think

216
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,625
there might be something
to all his claims.

217
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,250
He's already failed once.

218
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,250
He won't do any better
this time.

219
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,208
Hello? Director!

220
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,708
When something happens,

221
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,541
don't blame me.

222
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,541
Need to get back to work?

223
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,291
I know you're pretty busy.

224
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,375
This is work.

225
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,791
For both of us.

226
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,750
We need you back on your feet
as soon as possible.

227
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,083
So, where're you takin' me?

228
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,250
To your old hometown.

229
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,541
We dug into your past life,

230
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,083
from before the Great Quake.

231
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,208
And that led us
to this place.

232
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,666
Here?

233
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,750
This is where you grew up.

234
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,041
You lived here
until you were 17.

235
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,416
What about
my parents or siblings?

236
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,208
We tried our best
to find that out.

237
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,958
But nothing turned up.

238
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,375
We did find out
that the children and staff

239
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,000
from this home
were caught in the Great Quake

240
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,375
while they were
on a field trip to Tokyo.

241
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,166
Every single one of them died.

242
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,291
Having lost
all of its residents,

243
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,125
the home was shut down.

244
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,458
I used to live here?

245
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
I don't remember it.

246
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,833
But you did live here,
for over 17 years.

247
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,916
It's only the last six
you've lived as Masane Amaha.

248
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,000
Yasuka Ohara.

249
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,083
That's your name.

250
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,916
Yasuka Ohara?

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,875
Now that you hear it again,
does it ring any bells?

252
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,541
Not really.

253
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,541
Nothing specific.

254
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,166
So none of this
is coming back to you?

255
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,250
Nothing looks familiar?

256
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,250
No, not a thing.

257
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,000
What's wrong?

258
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,041
There's a piece missing.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,333
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

260
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,333
I'll look for it.

261
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,458
The girl who lived here.

262
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,000
She was the real me.

263
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,041
But I don't know her.

264
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,666
I don't remember
that version of me.

265
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,125
It's no use.
I can't remember anything.

266
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,583
How naïve of me.

267
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,916
What do you mean?

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,875
You're simple-minded enough.

269
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,958
I thought
coming here would help.

270
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,000
Thanks, I think.

271
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,750
Did you find
the missing puzzle piece?

272
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,000
No.

273
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
But I found something.

274
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,875
This.

275
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,958
It's just like I am.

276
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,750
Rough around the edges.

277
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,583
Out of place.

278
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,666
This rock is me.

279
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,333
The family that I never had.

280
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,666
My old self that somehow
got erased in the Great Quake.

281
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,750
They're gone.

282
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,750
And they're never coming back.

283
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,416
And nothing can
ever make up for it.

284
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,666
It's kinda sad.

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,416
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

286
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,333
I knew this wasn't going to be
easy for you, but I'm sorry.

287
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,333
So...

288
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,333
what about your family?

289
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,333
I realized you've never
mentioned them.

290
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,916
Bet you were a spoiled rich kid,
weren't you?

291
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,791
Much like you, I'm not sure.

292
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,583
What do you mean?

293
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,041
I don't know my family.

294
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,958
My mother died
when I was very young,

295
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,916
and my father
was hardly home.

296
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,375
Always working.

297
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:15,125
We were connected by blood
and that was about all.

298
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,791
Wow!

299
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
Then I met you.

300
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,666
Seeing you and Rihoko,

301
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,625
I finally understand
what family is.

302
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,500
Wait.

303
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,333
We seemed like a family?

304
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,875
Really?

305
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,458
Yes.

306
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,708
Without a doubt.

307
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,541
You are mother and daughter.

308
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,333
You're right.

309
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,250
And I'm nothing without her.

310
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,041
She's all I have.

311
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,333
She's my...

312
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,833
my everything.

313
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,583
Riko.

314
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,958
Rihoko.

315
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,750
Isn't she magnificent?

316
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,833
I cannot express to you
how proud I am

317
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,666
that you've come this far.

318
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,666
My darling young child.

319
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,750
Grandpa!

320
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,791
Now tell me about my mom!

321
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,291
You promised!

322
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,875
Why do you want to know
so badly?

323
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,291
Knowing who your mother is

324
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,125
isn't going to change
anything, my dear.

325
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,666
Of course it will, Grandpa!

326
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,541
I've never had a mother,
so I wanna know all about her.

327
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,291
Come on!

328
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,416
This is my mom!

329
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,875
There it is again.

330
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,541
That's the same genetic code
from before.

331
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,291
Yeah. So that means
the father's genes are the same.

332
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,708
You got it.

333
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,291
From what I can tell,
all the Neo-Genes in this file

334
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,458
share the genes of one man.

335
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,791
Basically,
they've all got the same father.

336
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,041
Which means
they're all related.

337
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,375
Guess that's why
they call 'em Sisters.

338
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,458
Duh.

339
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,833
That's creepy.

340
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,416
Ya know, I'd like to get
some information on the guy

341
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,750
that's fathered
all these Neo-Genes.

342
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,416
Why dontcha pull up his file?

343
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,208
'Cause it's not here.

344
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,416
It might've gone missing,
but I bet the real deal

345
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,416
is that the NSWF is keepin'
his info top secret.

346
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,958
Yeah, figures.

347
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,625
Hey, take a look
at these chicks, kid;

348
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,916
what a bunch of hotties!

349
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Ya know, there's not
a single one of 'em

350
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,500
I'd kick outta bed.

351
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,291
Hold it there!

352
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,625
What are these files?

353
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,958
What, these?

354
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,333
They're the data files
on the mothers.

355
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,708
The mothers?

356
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,291
These are the women
who have provided their genes

357
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,208
to create the newest generation
of Neo-Genes.

358
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,916
Hi, Mom.

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,916
I hope I get to see you soon!

360
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,333
I didn't ask you for that.

361
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,083
I know.

362
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,541
But I thought
you might like it.

363
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,000
Um, would you mind if
I helped you fix dinner tonight?

364
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,958
I'm still working real hard
at becoming a better cook.

365
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,166
And plus...

366
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,208
I wanna spend
more time with you.

367
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,666
You know, talking.

368
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,833
Getting to know you better.

369
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,041
Is something wrong?

370
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,750
It appears to be
a hyper-secretion of tear fluid.

371
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,791
It seems that the changes

372
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,750
occurring within
my endocrine system

373
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,833
have begun to affect
my bodily functions.

374
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,666
So, are you all right?

375
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,666
What is this?

376
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,041
This sensation?

377
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,416
I've never felt this.

378
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,625
What is it?

379
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:02,875
[Music]

380
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,666
How are you doing?

381
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,166
I hope you're okay.

382
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,583
I never got to show you
my plans for our house.

383
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,041
Guess it's too late now.

384
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't forget,
your hangover medicine

385
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,541
is in that second drawer
in the kitchen.

386
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,375
And if you get hungry,
I left some Salisbury steak

387
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,500
in the fridge.

388
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,083
Oh!

389
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,083
And when you buy green onions,
make sure you get the good kind.

390
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,833
Please try not to
drink too much, okay?

391
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,583
And make sure you eat
so you can stay healthy.

392
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,250
Don't worry about me.

393
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,708
I'll be fine.
