1
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:30,333
Holy crap, haven't seen
anything this rough in awhile.

2
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,458
Me either.

3
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,833
With all this damage,

4
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,250
gotta be automatic weapons.

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,500
But I tell ya, I got no idea
how they pulled this off.

6
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,416
Yeah, no kiddin'.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,458
This ain't no ordinary murder.

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,875
There's gotta be a reason
they wrecked the place.

9
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,125
Detective Nakata!

10
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,875
[Music]

11
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,750
The ammunition found
at the crime scene

12
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,000
was a type specifically
used by the military.

13
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,916
And the only outfit
in Japan who uses 'em

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,208
is Doji Industries.

15
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,458
This ain't
the kinda firepower

16
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,500
just anyone
can get their hands on,

17
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,541
so that's what led me to you.

18
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,625
These recent murders

19
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,458
would've been impossible
for Joe Public.

20
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,875
In fact, the only way
that coulda been the case

21
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,708
is if the perps had access
to military-grade weaponry.

22
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,250
Follow my logic?

23
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,666
I must say
I'm quite impressed.

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,333
You sound just like
the detectives I see on TV!

25
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,583
Yeah, thanks.

26
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,125
Look, Director Takayama,
I'm not tryin' to accuse

27
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,791
any of your employees
of murder here.

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,833
I'm just sayin' there
may be some kinda connection.

29
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,291
Meaning what?

30
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,958
Meaning,
maybe weapons were stolen,

31
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,500
or an ex-employee
leaked some top secret data.

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,208
There could be
some psycho out there

33
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,875
building replicas
of your weapons right now.

34
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,000
That's absurd!

35
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,416
The Doji Group's security
is flawless.

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,583
Our corporate secrets would
never be leaked to the outside.

37
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,708
I'll advise our staff
to be more strict

38
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,500
with their
information management.

39
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,791
Is that all, Detective?

40
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,666
That could have gone better.

41
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think
he bought it for a second.

42
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,541
I'm sure he'll be back.

43
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,958
And he'll get the same answers.

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,041
Doji Industries
will never be prosecuted.

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,583
I imagine the detective
is aware of that.

46
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,833
He must enjoy wasting his time.

47
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,833
Forget him.

48
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,250
Back to the investigation.

49
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,333
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,875
Who did this?

51
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:03,625
If the killer wasn't
an X-Con or a Neo-Gene...

52
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,125
We heard anything
from the lab yet?

53
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
They're takin'
their sweet time as usual, sir.

54
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,166
Check that attitude!

55
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,125
Why you always
gotta pick on the new guy?

56
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,750
Damn.

57
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,666
Gotta find some
honest-to-god hard evidence.

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,333
Something this big
can't stay hidden forever.

59
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,416
I'm sure those Doji bastards
are corrupt.

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,791
I heard they're connected

61
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,666
to all kinds of politicians
and police officials.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,875
I guess there's not
a whole lot we can do.

63
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you not get
how this detective thing works?

64
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,041
Ass.

65
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,583
Ta-da!

66
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,125
Aren't you pretty!

67
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,291
That dress is absolutely
adorable on you, Rihoko!

68
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,083
Wow, not too shabby, Melony.

69
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,500
You actually did some
decent shopping for once.

70
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,000
The sales ladies picked out
pretty much everything.

71
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,625
I just paid for it.

72
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,625
Thanks, Mom.

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,625
I love it!

74
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,125
Just you wait!

75
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
We're not done yet, kiddo.

76
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,541
There's still
a whole 'nother bag!

77
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,750
Check it out!

78
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,416
I got you shoes, socks,
a scarf, and a hat!

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,416
Oh, my.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,333
And take a look at this!

81
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,625
Holy cow, she must be
rollin' in the dough.

82
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,958
Criminy.

83
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,416
How much cash did you drop
on your shopping spree?

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,208
Well, I started out
with a hundred thousand yen,

85
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,125
and now there's this much, so...

86
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,291
Whoa! I've spent
a lot of money.

87
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,541
Hey, mom.

88
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,958
I really like
all the new clothes and stuff,

89
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
but don't waste
your money on me.

90
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,375
Don't be silly!

91
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
It's not a waste
if I'm buying something special

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,291
for my little girl!

93
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,333
But...

94
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,500
It's okay.

95
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,625
I promise everything'll be fine,
so don't get upset.

96
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,541
I would do anything for you,

97
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,416
so don't you worry
about a thing!

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,625
But, Mom...

99
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,833
Now, why don't you try
something else on?

100
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,083
Let's see Princess Rihoko
in this one.

101
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,041
Isn't it cute?

102
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,041
You're my little girl...

103
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,958
Oh man,
Melony sure is worried

104
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,666
about keepin'
that little one happy.

105
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,750
No kiddin'.

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,250
See? Now don't you think
it was worth it?

107
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,208
You'll never
defeat an opponent like that.

108
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,333
Apart from allowing yourself
to be hit first,

109
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,333
your problem is,

110
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,666
your recovery time
is too slow.

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,250
I gave you the chance to counter
and you didn't.

112
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,000
Just keep your cool and watch
your opponent's every move.

113
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,416
Thank you, ma'am.

114
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,291
I know you can do it.

115
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,750
You just need
confidence in yourself.

116
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,125
You are one
of the chosen ones.

117
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,291
Like me.

118
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:54,958
Yes!

119
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll admit
I had my concerns about Maria.

120
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,166
But she is maturing
into a fine young woman.

121
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,291
It would appear that Maria
has finally reached adulthood.

122
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,875
Yes, splendid.

123
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,458
Using her as the new mother,

124
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,875
we'll create
an even more perfect being;

125
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,208
her genes will take us
to the next level.

126
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,000
You want to advance to
the next generation of Sisters?

127
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,666
Yes, begin the preparations
immediately.

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,416
I expect great things.

129
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,291
Then you'll be disappointed.

130
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,166
As long as we use
your paternal genes,

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,666
the results
will remain the same.

132
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,000
This is not what
I wanted to create.

133
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,083
But the true Witchblade's
chosen bearer...

134
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,250
what do her genetics
look like?

135
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,166
This was the only real evidence
found at the crime scene.

136
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,375
Man, talk about overkill.

137
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,500
Why would the killer

138
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,500
purposefully leave
those shell casings?

139
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,875
I mean, that's some
incriminating evidence, sir.

140
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,458
Maybe the killer ain't
afraid of gettin' caught.

141
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,791
Then he wouldn't care what
kinda evidence he left behind.

142
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,708
Detective. Here.

143
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,375
This was sent to the task force
this morning.

144
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,666
We checked. The contents
aren't hazardous.

145
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,791
Yeah?

146
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,166
Where's it from?

147
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,833
No return address.

148
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,833
The hell?

149
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,875
Some sort of data, perhaps.

150
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,666
Who knows, maybe
someone sent us a tip?

151
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,875
Dumbass!

152
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,666
Just check and see
what's on 'em!

153
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,375
They appear to be video files.

154
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,416
Watch.

155
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,416
Some sort of cleanup crew?

156
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,250
Whoa! Take a look at that!

157
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
What the hell is it?

158
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,625
Some kinda monster?

159
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,291
But check out their van!

160
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,125
Maybe they're some kind of
special effects crew.

161
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,166
But this obviously
took place in the city.

162
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,166
Hold on!

163
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,583
Look!

164
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,541
This is near crime scene
number five.

165
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,583
Damn it.

166
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,458
This is bigger than I thought.

167
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,541
Detective Nakata!

168
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,500
The media's in a frenzy
about somethin'!

169
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
In these recordings,
which seem to have taken place

170
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,458
at various crime scenes,
we can see multiple workers

171
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,500
recovering
some sort of machinery.

172
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,208
Now, who these workers
are affiliated with

173
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,375
still remains a mystery.

174
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,916
Like many other news agencies,
this footage,

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,500
which we received this morning,
was sent to our studio

176
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,666
by an anonymous source.

177
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,958
Wha--What does all this mean,
Detective?

178
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,416
Have those files
analyzed immediately!

179
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,708
I want IDs on every car
and every person, yesterday!

180
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,125
Uh, yes, sir!

181
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,333
Contact the D.A.

182
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,250
Start preparing for a raid.

183
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,666
A raid!
What's the target, Detective?

184
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,791
Wait.

185
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
You got it, kid.

186
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,000
If my hunch is right,

187
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,541
those bastards work for Doji.

188
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,125
About all we can verify
at this point,

189
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,000
is that this footage
was simultaneously sent

190
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,041
to all news media outlets,
and was also uploaded

191
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,458
to numerous major Internet
news sites and message boards.

192
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,916
But the question remains:
What exactly are we seeing here?

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
There are hundreds of people
on the 'net

194
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,458
attempting to identify
these workers

195
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,291
and the vehicles
involved.

196
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,166
Many are also claiming
that the vehicles

197
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,916
are somehow connected
to the military industry.

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,291
Well, it certainly seems
we're dealing

199
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
with a large-scale
investigation--

200
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,291
Who the hell leaked that video?

201
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,083
While we can't divulge the name
of the company just yet,

202
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,208
we have been told the machinery
being recovered--

203
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,208
Hey, wait a minute!

204
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,666
Aren't those our I-Weapons?

205
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,166
So they're employees
of the Special Section?

206
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,958
No, sir.

207
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:41,458
Well, yes, the footage does show
employees of our company.

208
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,458
Yes sir,
but it's not as bad as--

209
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,041
I refuse to cover up
for your mistakes any longer.

210
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,583
Now the whole world knows
what Doji is up to.

211
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,125
The police are
threatening to raid

212
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,625
the Doji Industries building!

213
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,458
I can't be involved.

214
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,208
But sir, if you would just--

215
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,250
Hello?

216
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,583
Damn.

217
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,458
Sure, no problem
taking the bribe,

218
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,791
but you run
as soon as things get tough.

219
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,916
What the hell
was Takayama doing?

220
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,666
Yagi.

221
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,375
Have you calmed down a bit?

222
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,625
Any new developments?

223
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,250
We administered
a strong tranquilizer

224
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:32,041
and it appears to be
restraining the Blade for now.

225
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,208
Terrifying.

226
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,625
To think it would go this far.

227
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,083
We've noticed
his physical breakdown

228
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,916
is progressing rapidly.

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,708
At its current rate,
his crystallization

230
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,541
should occur
in only a matter of days.

231
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,250
I suppose we've seen the limits
of what can be achieved

232
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,750
with an untrained civilian.

233
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,416
But the Ultimateblade itself

234
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,083
still has incredible
untapped power.

235
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,875
Uh, sir,
it's none of my business

236
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,125
but are you sure it was
a good idea to leak those files?

237
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,125
What if this becomes
a company-wide problem--

238
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,791
We had no choice!

239
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,291
There was no other way!

240
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,291
His escape caused us
a great deal of trouble

241
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,333
that we did not need!

242
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,708
Too late to change
anything now.

243
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,000
There's no turning back.

244
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,041
The Special Division
will take the fall for us.

245
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,166
And Takayama
will take the full blame.

246
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,916
Yeah. Uhh...

247
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,125
I got a search warrant, kid.

248
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,166
Lemme through.

249
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,166
Director Takayama.

250
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,125
This time I'm not leavin' 'til
I get a confession out of you.

251
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,208
Local police
have just made their way

252
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,791
into the Doji Group Industries
building.

253
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,041
According to officials,
the company is accused

254
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,666
of attempting to cover up
a string of murders

255
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,916
that were allegedly caused

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,625
by their special
top-secret weapons.

257
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,625
They do nothin' but build
murder weapons!

258
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,500
Doji should pay
for their crimes!

259
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,583
They're a threat not only
to this nation's citizens

260
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,458
but to the entire world!

261
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,000
Production of these
top-secret weapons

262
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,375
is handled by
Doji's Special Division.

263
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
Its director, Mr. Takayama,
is under fire

264
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,083
because officials believe
it was his recklessness

265
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,791
that led to this situation.

266
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,833
Sorry, kiddo, you must be pretty
bored watchin' the news.

267
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,625
Let's go to my place
and watch some cartoons.

268
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,791
Sure, but...

269
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,125
Yeah.

270
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,958
No luck. Can't seem
to get through.

271
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,791
Guess I'll have to go
down there myself, huh?

272
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,916
Go? Where, to Doji?

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
C'mon, Melony!

274
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,791
Dontcha think maybe you should
wait til this mess clears up?

275
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,833
It's a zoo
over there right now!

276
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,125
Well, I can't sit here
and hope somebody calls me.

277
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,166
I'm just gonna go
check it out real quick.

278
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,791
Not a good idea!

279
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:30,875
Hey.

280
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,125
Nice work there,
Detective Nakata!

281
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,875
You got no business here.
Scram!

282
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,833
C'mon, no need
to be like that.

283
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,041
Thanks to you and your boys
stickin' your noses in,

284
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,791
I already lost
the one big scoop I had.

285
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,625
You're not smart enough
to figure out

286
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,666
who was behind
those murders, Junior.

287
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,208
You're right,
'cause I'd never guess

288
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,291
rogue weapons from Doji
Industries were who did it.

289
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,458
"Who"
is not exactly appropriate.

290
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,791
We're talkin' about runaway
machines, not real people.

291
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,250
Not real people?

292
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,250
Somethin' you wanna tell me?

293
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,125
No, not at all.

294
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,291
So, can't you at least arrest
the Doji guys responsible?

295
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,166
They should get Gross
Negligence and Manslaughter.

296
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,333
But since all of this
was supposedly an accident

297
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
that happened
during the Quake,

298
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,666
I'm sure they'll use
the Great Quake Act

299
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,291
to escape any charges.

300
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,583
And that's why you're in
such a rotten mood today,

301
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,958
huh, Detective?

302
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
Better get outta here
before ya take it out on me.

303
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Hey!

304
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,916
I guess they still haven't
figured out the craziest part.

305
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,291
That the X-Cons and I-Weapons

306
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,875
are created
using deceased humans.

307
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,208
That means my scoop
isn't completely dead yet.

308
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,958
But if this keeps up,

309
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,750
things could start to get
real ugly for Melony.

310
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,208
We have just been informed

311
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,791
that members of Doji Industries'
Special Division...

312
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,416
I can't believe
they got the names

313
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,666
of our entire recovery team.

314
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,791
I doubt the men in that footage
can avoid being arrested.

315
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,291
As for us,
it depends whether

316
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,416
the police feel
we're responsible.

317
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,000
Sorry I'm late.

318
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,875
Ah, Takayama.

319
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,083
They've finished
questioning you already?

320
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,666
Why don't we cut to the chase?

321
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,458
Takayama, would you explain
what's going on?

322
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,958
Mistakes like this
are not like you.

323
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,375
The damage this will have
on the Doji Industries brand

324
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,916
is unfathomable.

325
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,458
Our stocks are plummeting!

326
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,958
By this afternoon, we've already
lost well into the billions!

327
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,875
How do you intend to bring
this situation under control,

328
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,916
Takayama!

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,291
While I realize
the Special Division

330
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,125
is one of Doji's major branches,
they've always held

331
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,916
enormous sway in the company's
decision making.

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,125
But that man
and his reckless practices

333
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,291
are clearly the cause
of this dilemma!

334
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,125
If you do not trim back
its overgrown branches,

335
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,291
the growth of an entire tree
can be undermined!

336
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,291
What are you
so afraid of, Wado?

337
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,625
I'm not afraid!

338
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,875
Have I ever--!

339
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,583
Wado, please.

340
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,416
Try to calm yourself.

341
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,000
I know it's easy to be shaken
by all that's happened today.

342
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,083
But it is impossible
for Doji's foundation

343
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,875
to be weakened.

344
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,625
This situation is but one
of the scenarios I anticipated.

345
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,458
Are you saying you've
already devised a strategy?

346
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,958
Chopping off a single branch
will not kill the tree.

347
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,000
I am in agreement with Wado.

348
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,958
Takayama...

349
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,291
are you saying...?

350
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,291
'Scuse me!
Let me through, please!

351
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,625
Who're you, lady?

352
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,958
I don't suppose
you work for Doji, do ya?

353
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,291
You work for
those war mongering devils?

354
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,958
All you murderers
are gonna burn in hell!

355
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,333
Hands off, buddy!

356
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,083
What the hell'd
I ever do to you?

357
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,083
Leave me alone.

358
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,083
Why should we?

359
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,125
You wanna go!

360
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,000
What do you think
you're doing?

361
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,583
Honestly, trying to waltz
through the front door?

362
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,458
What has come over you?

363
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,541
Well, I wouldn't have had to

364
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,125
if I knew
where the back door was.

365
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,458
Then I'll show it to you.

366
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,541
All of the employees
are using it now.

367
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,500
You can't be so reckless.

368
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,333
So is Doji gonna be all right?

369
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,250
I mean, all this stuff
has gotten out.

370
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,458
Don't worry.

371
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,750
Large corporations like Doji

372
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,500
have their own
unique ways of survival.

373
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,833
Pardon the intrusion.

374
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,500
Hey, wait.

375
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,375
Aren't you that guy?

376
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,666
Ah, yes.

377
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,541
And you're the girl
from my award party.

378
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,041
Oh dear.

379
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:30,000
I'd never suspect you were
the bearer of the Witchblade.

380
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,125
Where's Takayama?

381
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,666
He's no longer with Doji.

382
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
What are you saying?

383
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,416
So it's true that weapons
from Doji Industries

384
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,708
are responsible for the murders
of innocent citizens?

385
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,000
What does the company
intend to do

386
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,500
to put the public at ease
after these attacks?

387
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,458
I have only one thing to say.

388
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,416
My name is Reiji Takayama,

389
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,458
Director of
Doji's Special Division,

390
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,708
and I accept
full responsibility.

391
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,625
As such,
I take this opportunity

392
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,833
to tender
my immediate resignation.

393
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,875
That is all.

394
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,958
Takayama quit his job?

395
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,291
Correct.

396
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,791
All Witchblade-related affairs
previously handled

397
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,125
by the Special Division

398
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,083
will be now handled
by my Bio-Division.

399
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,208
Segawa will continue on
to take care

400
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,166
of the business side of things.

401
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,833
I'm looking forward
to continuing our work together,

402
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,916
Masane.

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
Wait a minute.

404
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,916
So basically, I've been
switched from Takayama to you,

405
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,166
just like that?

406
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,666
We require the Witchblade

407
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,083
in order to continue
our research.

408
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,125
We'd like to mass produce
the UltimateBlade

409
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,333
but we still have
a few issues.

410
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,083
What we're saying
is that, for now,

411
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,125
we still have
plenty of work for you.

412
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,416
Isn't that great?

413
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
Screw a whole bunch of that.

414
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,958
I'm outta here!

415
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,291
What about Rihoko?

416
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,416
Doji will go on
with or without you.

417
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
If you quit now, the only one
who stands to suffer is her.

418
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,708
I understand you were
attached to Takayama.

419
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,958
But business is business
and we need you, Miss Amaha.

420
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,625
The Bio-Division
promises good pay

421
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,666
and that would benefit
both you and your daughter.

422
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,500
Rihoko.

423
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,666
Do it for her.

424
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,583
So in the end,
it looks like

425
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,958
the Director's
gonna take the fall,

426
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,958
and Doji's gonna stay
safe and sound.

427
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,458
Man, the corporate world
is cold-blooded.

428
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,791
Hey, mom!
Welcome home!

429
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
Why're you gettin' home
so late, Melony?

430
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,708
We were startin' to worry.

431
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,833
Sorry.

432
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,625
We had to talk over
what happens next.

433
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,958
Did you see Mr. Takayama there?

434
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,666
No, but I'm sure
he's just fine.

435
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,541
Don't worry
about a thing, Riko;

436
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,750
I promise
I'll take care of you.

437
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,625
Okay.

438
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,250
We'll be fine.

439
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,166
I know
we can make it through this

440
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,875
as long as the two of us
are together.

441
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,166
I'll always be here
to protect you.

442
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,041
[Music]

443
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:33,625
Hey mom, I don't wanna be mean
but I'm kinda mad at you.

444
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,583
Your boss, Mr. Takayama,
is in big trouble

445
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,458
and you don't even
seem to care!

446
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,208
Aren't you worried about him?

447
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,833
And why're you still
working for that company?

448
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,000
Have you forgotten
about Mr. Takayama?

449
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,833
You've been acting
real strange lately, Mom.

450
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:52,041
Somehow you're different,
not like your usual self.

451
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,875
Don't do something
you don't think is right

452
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,666
just for my sake.

453
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,875
Please, Mom.
