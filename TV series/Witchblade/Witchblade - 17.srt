1
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,416
Mom!

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,625
Riko!

3
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,083
Mommy!

4
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,583
[Music]

5
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,791
Mom?

6
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,875
Is something wrong?

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,750
No dear, nothing at all.

8
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,208
Princess Riko!

9
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,541
Uh, Mom, the chopsticks?

10
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,625
Careful.

11
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,250
Oh yeah, sorry 'bout that!

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,333
Now get up and wash your face!

13
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,833
Who wants breakfast?

14
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,208
Me!

15
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,750
The thought of Riko
bearing this thing.

16
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,291
No! It's too much!

17
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,750
I can't--
I refuse to let that happen!

18
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,791
Never!

19
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,041
Ow. That hurt.

20
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,625
Whoa, what happened?

21
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,833
I'm okay.

22
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,166
I just lost my balance!

23
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,291
Poor thing,
you must be exhausted.

24
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,375
You should be more careful,

25
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,166
since you do
such dangerous work!

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
Really, I'm fine!

27
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,333
"Since I do such dangerous--?"

28
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,666
How would she know?

29
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,625
Tozawa!

30
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,208
You told her!

31
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,250
I can't believe
you told Riko about me!

32
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,958
I'm half asleep.

33
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,208
Come back
when I can understand words.

34
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,041
She knows about my work!

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,666
Yeah, that...

36
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,916
I guess I mighta mentioned
you fight X-Cons.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,916
But that was all I--

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,541
You did what!

39
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,375
How could you betray my trust?

40
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,458
You promised to keep it
a secret from her,

41
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,791
you swore to me!

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,750
Why!
Why'd you tell her?

43
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,125
You stupid ass!

44
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,291
Wait. It's cool.
Trust me.

45
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,125
I didn't tell her about that
cosplay nightmare you turn into!

46
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,625
I dunno.

47
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,458
She probably thinks
you're like a rent-a-cop.

48
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,250
Rent-a-cop?

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,625
Well, I guess it could be worse.

50
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,666
But then...

51
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,375
Listen.

52
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,041
I got a ton of stories
I'm sitting on here

53
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,708
'cause of our agreement.

54
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,208
That means I'm losin' money.

55
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,708
So please, try and be
a little grateful?

56
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,791
You're in a tough spot.

57
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,333
Of course I'm grateful.

58
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,416
Hey!

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,250
At this point,
I don't mind the wait.

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,458
By then I'll know
the whole sordid tale!

61
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,041
So, now I'm lookin' into
that Father guy.

62
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,791
Did you know that all
the so-called Sisters

63
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,541
have his genes in 'em?

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,416
That's way beyond
just obsession.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,666
You wanna help me
find out why?

66
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,708
Not really.

67
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,958
As long as
he stays away from Rihoko,

68
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,000
I couldn't care less.

69
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,208
And don't you dare
tell her anything else!

70
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,166
Rihoko this, Rihoko that.

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
Am I wrong,

72
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
or is she more protective
of that girl than ever?

73
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,125
Looks perfect!

74
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,208
So it's official?

75
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,958
That document means
you and Rihoko

76
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,000
are legally a family again?

77
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,125
You've always been a family.

78
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,958
With or without
a stupid piece of paper!

79
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,041
Naomi.

80
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,375
What do you see?

81
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,458
What's in this happy family's
future?

82
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,541
Who arranged it?

83
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,416
Was it that Takayama fellow?

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,208
More than likely.

85
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,791
Oh yeah?

86
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,750
That sure was nice of him.

87
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,333
What's that s'posed to mean?

88
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,416
'Kay!
Come and get it!

89
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,708
They look magnificent!

90
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,083
Yummy-yummy cupcake!

91
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,291
Oh, wow!
You keep getting better!

92
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,125
Oh! Thank you!

93
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,375
All right.

94
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,458
And one for Miss Kei
at the bathhouse!

95
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,458
You're going out?

96
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,916
Wait!
You can't go aloooone!

97
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,541
Criminy, she's in more danger
if you go.

98
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,083
Stay out of it, Mariko!

99
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,708
This is strictly
a family matter!

100
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,625
Riko. Let's go.

101
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,041
'Kay.
Just watch your step.

102
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,750
Melony's really crackin' down,

103
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,833
never thought she'd be
that kinda mom.

104
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,416
Must be rough
on that little tyke right now.

105
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,541
Eh! She can't be
like that forever!

106
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,666
Not good.

107
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,458
My cupcake.
It's gone!

108
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,208
Mr. Cho!
That was Naomi's!

109
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,541
No!
It was, um, an extra!

110
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,791
You're terrible!

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,291
I hate you!

112
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,958
You're a terrible,
horrible, awful man!

113
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,833
I'll give it back if you want!

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,791
Hey, once we drop these off,

115
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,625
amusement park?

116
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,083
You mean it?

117
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,625
I hardly ever get to
hang out with just you anymore,

118
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,833
I thought it might be nice!

119
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
Yippee!

120
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,541
"Baradhi is bad!"

121
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,666
"Stop killing children!"

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,041
"Baby killers!"

123
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,916
"No War."

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,875
My, that's a rather
sizable crowd.

125
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,375
Granted, we are in the business
of weapons manufacture.

126
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,958
But lately, they've seemed
a bit more vocal.

127
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,166
It's nothing new.

128
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,583
Call the PR department.

129
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,708
I'm sure
they can take care of this.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's on the schedule?

131
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,375
You're booked solid today.

132
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,541
We're still playing
a bit of catch-up

133
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,916
due to all the time you've spent
with Masane recently.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,916
Sounds like
you have a complaint.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,958
Not at all, sir.

136
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,833
It's just that Wado's project

137
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,166
seems to be progressing
quite rapidly.

138
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,250
I would hate for us
to appear complacent.

139
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,875
Like I've said,
Wado will fail.

140
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,916
I know it's easy for you
to think that way,

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,291
because you've known Wado
since college.

142
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,416
But people can surprise you.

143
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,583
After all, the tortoise
did come from behind

144
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,500
to beat out the hare.

145
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,083
Though calling you a hare
is far too cute for your image.

146
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,541
He's the hare,
looking for shortcuts.

147
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,000
That's a disturbing image, too.

148
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,500
We've been contacted
by the Baradhi military,

149
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,375
inquiring about
the Witchblade Project.

150
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,708
Then, leaking word
of the project is paying off.

151
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,333
Their current budget allows
them to consider a purchase.

152
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,083
Provided they can verify data
from the final prototype.

153
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,291
Not a problem.

154
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,375
The prototype's complete.

155
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,000
And it outshines Takayama's
I-Weapons in every regard.

156
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,750
The contract
is as good as ours.

157
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,750
But Baradhi is
a well-established client

158
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,833
of Director Takayama's.

159
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,250
Are you sure about this?

160
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,708
What I'm sure of is that they
want a superior product.

161
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,375
Desiring the strongest weapons
is only natural.

162
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,375
I have an elaborate
presentation ready

163
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,333
for today's board meeting.

164
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,750
While Takayama
has the Witchblade itself,

165
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
but no results.

166
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,166
Combined with losing
a top client,

167
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,875
it will be his end.

168
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,666
I can see him weeping already.

169
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,541
Buying off that NSWF researcher
was a wise move, Director.

170
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,625
Never speak of that!

171
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,000
I apologize, sir!

172
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,208
She's made great progress

173
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,291
following
the Cloneblade procedure.

174
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,916
No signs of rejection.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,625
Her numbers have actually
improved across the board.

176
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,333
We're still awaiting
test results

177
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,333
on genetic-level changes,
but I'm optimistic.

178
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,125
I expect big things
from this one.

179
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,166
There.
We're all done!

180
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,791
You did great.
Thank you, Maria.

181
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,208
Chief Nishida,

182
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,208
doesn't something about Maria
seem strange to you?

183
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,208
You said yourself
the data was fine.

184
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,583
It's her demeanor.

185
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,750
She's very quiet,
all of a sudden,

186
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,708
and her earlier selfishness
is completely gone.

187
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,708
You're right.

188
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,541
But it's not strange.

189
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:08,375
Maria is finally maturing,
shedding her childish behavior.

190
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,666
Her growing up a little

191
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,583
will only make our research
that much easier.

192
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,625
Right.

193
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,000
But Maria's at the peak

194
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
of what can be done
with the Sisters.

195
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,250
We'll never do any better.

196
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,041
What do you mean?

197
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,041
We're limited to using
only Father's genes.

198
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,083
Those were his instructions?

199
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,791
Is he perfecting the process
to create clones of himself?

200
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,166
I doubt that's it.

201
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,125
I could've given him
genetic duplicates years ago.

202
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,083
I don't know
why he's so obsessed

203
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,291
with using his own genes.

204
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,750
But our research
is about to hit a dead-end.

205
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,875
You were so perfect in life.

206
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,000
As a father,
as a scholar, as a man.

207
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:01,125
But you made
one grave mistake...

208
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,291
when you chose the woman
who bore me into this world.

209
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,291
Because of that filthy harlot,
my body will remain cursed,

210
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,125
for as long as I live.

211
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,875
"The Great" Tatsuoki Furumizu.

212
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,500
Man, what a history.

213
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,916
Raised in the lap of luxury.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,416
And smart as hell, to boot.

215
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
That's a formidable combo.

216
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,708
Oh, really?

217
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,375
His old man was
a prize-winning scientist, too.

218
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,000
If his ma
turns out to be a hottie...

219
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,875
What the crap?

220
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,375
There's nothing here
on his mother at all!

221
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,958
Yes, I'm writing a review of
Tatsuoki Furumizu's biography.

222
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,083
Can you put me
in touch with the author?

223
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,708
So, why is his father
covered in extreme detail,

224
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,583
yet there's not even
the slightest mention

225
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,166
of his mother?

226
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,416
During our interviews,
Furumizu claimed

227
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,041
his mother didn't like to be
in the public eye.

228
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,000
Among all the photographs
he gave me,

229
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,791
I've managed to find
only one image of her.

230
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,041
I'm sure he meant
to dispose of it,

231
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,000
but about all
I can tell you is,

232
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,291
I recognized
what's in the background.

233
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,041
So good!

234
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,041
Today feels like
Christmas and New Year's

235
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,416
and my birthday,
all wrapped into one!

236
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,958
I'm having a blast!

237
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,000
What should we do next?

238
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,083
Your pick, Riko,
anything you want!

239
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,833
How 'bout that?

240
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,583
That?

241
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,833
Oh God,
it's dark and it's scary

242
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,250
and I can't see anything!

243
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
Uh, Mom.

244
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,958
That's 'cause
your eyes are closed.

245
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,458
They're kinda cute, I guess.

246
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,291
See?

247
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,666
Wow, really?
Those things scared you?

248
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,791
There, there, Mom!

249
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,708
It'll all be over soon!

250
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,333
This is it.

251
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,166
The place in the photo.

252
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,625
But would she really live
in a place like this?

253
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,583
Excuse me, ma'am?

254
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,375
Could I ask a few questions
about someone

255
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,958
who lived here
a long time ago?

256
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,208
How long ago
you talkin' 'bout?

257
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,500
You tryin' ta tell me
I look old or somethin'?

258
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,916
Uh, no!

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,250
That's, uh...
not what I... uh...

260
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,541
Darling!

261
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,500
There's some man out here
tryin' to hit on me!

262
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,833
What was that, honey?

263
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,750
Oh, hey!
How's it goin'?

264
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,250
Get the hell outta here!

265
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,666
Takayama.

266
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
It's been a while.

267
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,083
I hadn't noticed.

268
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,250
The meeting should be fun.

269
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,875
I have an announcement
that I know

270
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,708
you're just going to love.

271
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,750
I can hardly wait.

272
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,708
Well, you won't
have to wait long.

273
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,583
This confidence.

274
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,125
What if things go badly
for the Director in there?

275
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,583
Just to be safe.

276
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,958
A speck of dust.

277
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,500
How kind of you.

278
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,375
No problem!

279
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,958
Director Wado
of our Biotechnology Division

280
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,666
has a presentation for us.

281
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,375
Why don't we begin there?

282
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,250
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

283
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,541
If you would all please
direct your attention

284
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,250
to your displays.

285
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,666
Gentlemen...

286
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,875
I present to you
the crowning achievement

287
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,916
of the Bio-Tech Division's
Witchblade Project.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,500
The Ultimateblade!

289
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,375
Surely Director Takayama
can see where I'm headed.

290
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,875
In essence,
we've built a Witchblade

291
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,541
that bonds to a man.

292
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,583
Is that even possible?

293
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,625
I assure you.

294
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,291
The specs are right here.

295
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,916
Allow me to elaborate.

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,125
The Joule-Heat Armor
is powered

297
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,625
by the host body's
own electricity.

298
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,166
Its mass efficiency
is 4.5 against KE penetrators,

299
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,041
theoretically withstanding
even tungsten shells.

300
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,458
The composition is a new
metallomic alloy filament

301
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,708
over four times more responsive
than the I-Weapons'.

302
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,458
And that's it.

303
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,166
Takayama,
you're a top weapons developer.

304
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,250
I'd love to hear
any feedback you may have.

305
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,666
Please give me
your honest opinion.

306
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,416
Of course, Wado.

307
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,416
It may be the most powerful
weapon I've ever seen.

308
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,083
Thank you, sir.

309
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,958
It's an honor
coming from you.

310
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,958
However, this device
runs the risk

311
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,208
of turning its very users
into weapons themselves.

312
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,291
Is that not
precisely the point?

313
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,208
According to our latest
market analysis,

314
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,625
exports of the Ultimateblade
will yield sales figures

315
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,750
over 150% higher
than last year's.

316
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,041
That's good in theory,
but our client countries

317
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,041
don't have unlimited budgets.

318
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,000
I also take issue
with your encroachment

319
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,875
upon Takayama's territory.

320
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,083
It was unavoidable, really.

321
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,875
In fact, Baradhi
has already made inquiries

322
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,375
about the Ultimateblade.

323
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,541
Takayama, I know
they're your client, but--

324
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,125
No, go right ahead.

325
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,250
Thank you, Takayama.

326
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,666
It won't matter.

327
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,583
Your forecast is incorrect.

328
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,833
Explain!

329
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,458
You won't sell more than
one or two at most.

330
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,625
Now you're
embarrassing yourself!

331
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,250
A minute ago, you were
endorsing its strength!

332
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,041
I just received this.

333
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:46,000
An order from Baradhi
for 700 more I-Weapons.

334
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,083
Wha-what is this?

335
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,041
You mean, they didn't plan
to buy any Ultimateblades!

336
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,083
They said
they just made inquiries.

337
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,041
Wado, have you ever been
on a battlefield?

338
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,625
Modern warfare is not about
devastating power.

339
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,250
It's precision.

340
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,208
Strategic design
with minimal loss of life.

341
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,458
All the things
the Ultimateblade lacks!

342
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,916
What are you saying?

343
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,125
'Cause performance-wise,

344
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,666
it's far inferior
to the I-Weapons.

345
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,291
Our clients want
the best product for the job.

346
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,333
You've done no more
than play games on paper.

347
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,625
Nicely done, sir!

348
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,041
Seems Wado let his guard
down again!

349
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,500
Ah! Speck of dust!

350
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,416
Well, certainly glad
I didn't switch sides.

351
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,833
You will pay for this, Takayama!

352
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,583
Yagi.

353
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,125
Yagi!

354
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,583
Poor Riko,
you must've been pooped!

355
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,125
Just a sec!

356
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,458
What happened to you?

357
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,791
Don't ask.

358
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,000
But I got the goods.

359
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,208
Father hates his mother.

360
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,458
His mother?

361
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,500
Father's father used to be
a top scientist at the NSWF.

362
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,666
But when he was
still in school,

363
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
he fell in love and had a kid.

364
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,416
And that was Father?

365
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,708
Yeah, keep up.

366
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,750
Now besides
still being a student,

367
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,041
the Furumizu family
was real strict.

368
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,000
It was 10 years before he was
allowed to marry the woman.

369
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
So, during all that time,

370
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,333
Father lived
only with his mother.

371
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,750
But that means
she was the one that raised him.

372
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,625
How could he hate her?

373
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,583
Apparently, she ran some kind of
business out of her home

374
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,416
that the cops
weren't too keen on.

375
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,291
As a kid, Father was
probably embarrassed by her.

376
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,500
But as he grew older,

377
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,791
it started to evolve
into outright hatred.

378
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,541
Yeah, but why?

379
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,333
How's this for ironic!

380
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,333
Turns out Father can't
actually have kids of his own.

381
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,916
In his mind,

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,833
being even slightly different
from his father

383
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,583
was tantamount to failure,

384
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,500
and would have been cause
for his complete rejection.

385
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,541
So, he blamed his flaw
entirely on his mother,

386
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,750
an otherwise kind,
good-natured woman

387
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,208
who had to raise him in
a bad environment for a while.

388
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:36,125
Maria, someday you will grow
to become the perfect mother.

389
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,750
The perfect mother,

390
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,625
crafted from my
and my father's genes.

391
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,958
And the child born unto you
will be the true me.

392
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,541
My flawed self will disappear,
while my proper self

393
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,416
will live on
to sire a new family line.

394
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Oh, Mother.

395
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,333
That's messed up!

396
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,000
Creating people
for something like that?

397
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,125
Basically, he's got
one hell of a mother complex.

398
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,166
Like a Reverse-Oedipus.

399
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,791
Better watch
you don't go nuts too.

400
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,416
Why do you say that?

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,833
Well, lately you've been
a little over-obsessive

402
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,250
with Rihoko.

403
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,166
I'm her mother!

404
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,458
It's called love,
not obsession!

405
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,458
How dare you compare me
to that freak!

406
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,791
Riko.

407
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,833
An X-Con?

408
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,166
It's gone now.

409
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,541
What?

410
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,166
We recovered
the remaining X-Cons

411
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,833
during our last encounter
with Reina.

412
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,875
Nothing else could do
something so horrendous!

413
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,083
Figure it out!

414
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,041
What does this mean?

415
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,875
I-I'm sorry.

416
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,416
Did I wake you, ma'am?

417
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,750
Miss Maria?

418
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,250
Crying and throwing tantrums
is for little babies.

419
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,875
They won't give us
what we want.

420
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,250
We have to take it
for ourselves.

421
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,666
And we have the power
to do just that.

422
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,708
We Neo-Genes.

423
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,916
No.

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,958
We chosen ones.

425
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,000
[Music]

426
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,541
Riko.

427
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,416
You won't have to worry
about money ever again!

428
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,583
I'm going to keep working
lots and lots,

429
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,916
so I can earn us
loads and loads of cash!

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,791
You'd be so shocked
if you saw how much

431
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,416
we already have saved up!

432
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,750
Wanna take a peek?

433
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,958
Too bad, can't look yet!

434
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,375
It's still a secret!

435
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:51,666
Instead, how about I buy
you a bunch of new clothes!

436
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,041
And then we'll go
anywhere you want!

437
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,166
For you, Riko,
I'll do anything.
