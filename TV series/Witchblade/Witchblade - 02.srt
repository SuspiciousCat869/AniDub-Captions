1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,791
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,583
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,500
whose fate it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,666
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,000
Righteous Sword of God,

6
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,833
or Hand of the Devil himself.

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,250
A new Bearer finds out,

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,500
seeking balance
between ecstasy and ruin.

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,208
[Music]

10
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,083
Mom.

11
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,750
'Ey kid.

12
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,333
You didn't see
a woman come this way?

13
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,750
Do you mean my mom?

14
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,041
Hope not.

15
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,166
Your ma run around
in a funky body armor thing?

16
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,541
I coulda swore I saw her
rabbit off this way.

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,333
You sure
you didn't see my mom?

18
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,625
Kid, I'm done for the night,
it's beer-thirty.

19
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,750
Cops're all over the place,
go bug one'a them for help.

20
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,250
I can't go to the police!

21
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,541
Please, Mister!

22
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,750
I just need to get inside,
you gotta help me!

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,125
No way! I just helped you
run away from Child Welfare.

24
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,958
What more
do you want from me?

25
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,041
Last thing I need
is them on my ass.

26
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,208
There's laws 'n stuff, y'know?

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,166
Whoa.

28
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,166
Hey-hey!

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,250
Enough with the grabbin'!

30
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,250
Fine then.

31
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,666
I'll find her myself!

32
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,916
Wait.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,541
Kid, hang on,
you don't wanna go that way!

34
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,708
There's some scary stuff
goin' on over there.

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,458
Might give you nightmares!

36
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,458
But my mom!

37
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,458
Trust me on this!

38
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,083
Tozawa!

39
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,625
What the hell're you up to?

40
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,166
D'oh!

41
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,833
S'plain to me why it is
I keep runnin' into you.

42
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,791
You're stalkin' me
'cause of my good looks?

43
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,666
Thing is, you're
at my crime scene, again!

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,041
F'you know somethin'
about this crap, spill.

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,666
Who, me?

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
So you're saying
this is related

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,791
to those other recent murders.

48
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,541
The fact you're even here--

49
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,083
Shut it!

50
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,416
What's with the kid?

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,708
Don't tell me
you're one'a them.

52
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,708
Nothin' like that!

53
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,708
I'm babysittin'--
for extra cash!

54
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,875
Well, sir.

55
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,958
Keep fightin' the good fight!

56
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:00,041
Any other night, and I'd have
hauled your ass downtown.

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,416
Okay, that was
a little too close.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,791
Can't believe I got out of there
without any new bruises.

59
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,583
Yeah, so.

60
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,250
If you're tryin' to
avoid the badges,

61
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,375
I'd suggest
skippin' that area for a while.

62
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,791
And I'm sure your mom'll
turn up real soon.

63
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,083
I'll take you back
to the Welfare Center.

64
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,916
No! Not there!

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,250
Ya got anywhere else
you can go?

66
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,916
Nuh-uh.

67
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,333
It's Segawa, sir.

68
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,708
Come in.

69
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,541
Director,
we've got her.

70
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,875
I've had her placed
in the V.I.P. lounge.

71
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,916
Do we know who she is?

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,666
Well, according to
the police database,

73
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,666
she's a "Lost ID."

74
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,208
Any record of who she was
before six years ago

75
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,416
was lost
in the Great Quake.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,083
It seems the government
created a new ID for her.

77
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,333
I understood they did that

78
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
mainly for orphans
and the senile.

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,416
They found her
shortly after the Quake.

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
She was suffering
from amnesia.

81
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,750
Interesting.

82
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,000
There's more--

83
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,208
She was found
holding an infant.

84
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,916
At the near by hospital,
it was determined

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,958
from a maternity diary
she carried,

86
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,583
that the child
was indeed hers.

87
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,583
And there was nothing
about the woman's identity

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,083
in this diary?

89
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,416
No, nor did she have any family
come forward to claim her.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,958
But what I found most curious

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,458
was the location
of their rescue.

92
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,750
The Null Point, sir.

93
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,166
The Quake's epicenter.

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,541
It stands to reason

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,958
that she acquired
the Witchblade there.

96
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,333
Personally,
I'm not certain

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,541
whether she was lucky
to have survived...

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,625
or cursed.

99
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,666
End of the line, kid.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,958
Where are we?

101
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,000
My office/sleeping quarters.

102
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,083
So you confirm there was
some kind of explosion,

103
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,708
but can you tell us the cause?

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,500
No, nothing definite
has been determined.

105
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,500
According to a reliable
inside source,

106
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,666
the suspect smuggled
explosives into the building.

107
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,916
No comment.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,166
We're receiving reports

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,000
there were
very few guards on duty.

110
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,000
S'up.

111
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,625
'Ey, welcome back.

112
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,291
All right.

113
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,250
What's with the kid?

114
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,250
Um...

115
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,250
Yeah.

116
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,541
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

117
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,041
Okay, so.

118
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,541
You decided the best thing
would be to bring her here?

119
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,541
'At's right.

120
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,833
What are you, mental?

121
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,500
What was I supposed to do?

122
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,666
Anywhere I coulda taken her
woulda brought me headaches

123
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,916
I can't afford.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,625
Not when I'm so close
to breakin' this story.

125
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,166
Ah, jeez.

126
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,500
When you gonna give up
this reporter pipe dream?

127
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,166
You take pretty pictures
and that's it.

128
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,333
Stick to what
you're good at, huh?

129
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,541
But this is the scoop
that'll make my career.

130
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,625
And when the story breaks,

131
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,875
I can pay you
all the back-rent I owe!

132
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,708
I'd be happy if you had
one month's rent, right now!

133
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,041
Yeah. Not so much.

134
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,875
Naomi, you're hearin' all this,
help me out here.

135
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,416
Great, here we go.

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,541
How's this work again?
Y'say you're a fortuneteller.

137
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,041
An' you're afraid
o' talkin' to people?

138
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,416
Get a new job!

139
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
My name's not "NOW-me".

140
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,833
It's "Nah-OH-me."

141
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,750
Thank you
for the food, ma'am.

142
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,166
No prob.

143
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,833
Oh, and you'll be spending
the night at my place.

144
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,083
There is no way
I'm lettin' you stay with him.

145
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,750
'Sides, I don't have a bed.

146
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,083
And tomorrow, you're goin' back
to the Child Welfare Center.

147
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,208
No! Please,
I can't go back there!

148
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,416
I hafta find my mom!

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,083
Sorry, Missy, not listenin'.

150
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,791
Now let's go--
time for bed.

151
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,625
Come with me.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,208
Please, I'll do anything!

153
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,833
I can help you cook
or do the dishes--

154
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,833
just lemme stay!

155
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,291
Not an option.

156
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
Do you have any idea
how much trouble I would be in

157
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,416
with Child Welfare?

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,250
Now come on!
Enough of this foolishness!

159
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,541
Get out from under there
this instant!

160
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,791
NOW!!!

161
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,916
No! I don't wanna!

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,333
Oh, you did not just kick me!

163
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,625
Settle down!

164
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
All right, fine!

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,500
Stay there all night
if you want!

166
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,458
Either way, you are going back
first thing in the morning!

167
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,583
Criminy! You picked up
a handful, didn'tcha?

168
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,791
She's gutsy, fightin' you.

169
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,208
Anyway, your handful now.

170
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,875
Look at the time!

171
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Better get to sleep!

172
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,958
Big day tomorrow:
scoop of the century,

173
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,208
startin'
my new life of luxury.

174
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,791
Your luck will abandon you
in the afternoon.

175
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,458
Now there's a cheerful thought
right before bed.

176
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,291
Night, everyone.

177
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,958
See ya, kid!

178
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,791
My word.

179
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,208
Cute--but stubborn.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,416
Mommy.

181
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,875
Guess I could
turn up the heat.

182
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,250
Where am I?

183
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,875
Ah, good.
You're awake.

184
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,708
I've brought a little
breakfast for you.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,916
Where, um...

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,583
What is this place?

187
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,458
Doji Group Industries
Headquarters.

188
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,916
VIP room.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,375
Doji Group?

190
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,750
We rank among the top ten
multi-national corporations.

191
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,250
That's great, but,

192
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,666
what do you want with me?

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,916
Director Takayama
will explain everything

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
after you've had a chance
to eat.

195
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,208
I'm so sorry, I should've
introduced myself.

196
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,208
I'm Segawa,
the Director's assistant.

197
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,208
Please, enjoy your meal.

198
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,583
Uh. Wait!

199
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,208
Seems the tranquilizer
hasn't quite worn off.

200
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,791
I recommend you take it easy
for the time being.

201
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,875
Should you require
anything further,

202
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,125
please feel free to call me
at extension 33.

203
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,041
If you'll excuse me.

204
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,750
Riko--

205
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,666
Riko.

206
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:04,958
Yes that's right,
she's fine.

207
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,875
I have her right here.

208
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Who cares
how she wound up here?

209
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,000
Just come down an' get her
outta my hair already.

210
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,375
Of course, ma'am.

211
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,791
Thank you again
for contacting us.

212
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,791
Did I hear that right?

213
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,000
Someone found Rihoko?

214
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,750
Yes.

215
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,458
Good, what a relief!

216
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,791
Ms. Sakurai!

217
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,500
Father is outside, ma'am.

218
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,166
Oh dear, not now!

219
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,375
It has been one full year
since Tatsuoki Furumizu,

220
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,833
Chairman of the non-profit
organization NSWF,

221
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,250
has been seen in public.

222
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,583
His appearance today

223
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,500
consisted of a visit
to the Child Welfare Center,

224
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,708
which he helped
the government to establish.

225
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,791
Since its formation,

226
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,083
NSWF has focused
the majority of its work

227
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,250
in areas
that benefit children,

228
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,083
which has earned Furumizu
the affectionate nickname,

229
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,083
"Father."

230
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,041
Bye-bye!

231
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,458
G'bye!

232
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,833
Have we received any word
on the Witchblade?

233
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,625
Not yet, sir.

234
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
Time is of the essence.

235
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,500
Bye-bye!

236
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,208
G'bye!

237
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,416
Four victims
in the Pulverizer Murders,

238
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,166
two of whom
were employees of NSWF.

239
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,625
Then, outside
an NSWF-run facility,

240
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,958
was some mutant freak.

241
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,375
Followed promptly
by the arrival

242
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,250
of Detective Nakata
from Special Investigations.

243
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,500
Could it all be connected?

244
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,500
Nah, forget it.

245
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,041
Where are you taking me?

246
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,750
You said you would explain.

247
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,041
Yes, of course.

248
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,916
We'll fill you in en route
to another facility.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,541
The Director
is anxious to meet you.

250
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,250
This way.

251
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,291
Please, I only ask
that you listen to him,

252
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,166
so you may understand
your situation.

253
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,583
So I take it
you're this "Director?"

254
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,208
I am.

255
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,208
I'm told you're the man
who can tell me

256
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,500
what this is all about,
so get to it.

257
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,458
You've brought an end
to our search.

258
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,208
For that.

259
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,875
Do you remember
what you did last night?

260
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,166
I'm not really sure.

261
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,250
Has this ever
happened to you before?

262
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,291
No, I've never--

263
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,250
I don't even know
what happened!

264
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,750
What is this thing?!

265
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,083
If you've got answers, talk!

266
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,000
You bear the Witchblade.

267
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,625
It's a...

268
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,041
what now?

269
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,583
Earth's greatest weapon.

270
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,083
It has existed
since the dawn of mankind.

271
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,458
It's said
whomever wields it

272
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,875
holds the power
to control the world.

273
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,041
For countless millennia,

274
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
wars have been waged
in utter secrecy

275
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,333
to gain dominion over
the Witchblade's strength.

276
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,333
That's insane!

277
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,416
I've never heard
of anything--

278
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
What benefit is there
in making known

279
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,250
the existence
of such a treasure?

280
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,666
I could give you
more details about its past,

281
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,375
but they have
nothing to do with you.

282
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,708
Most recently,

283
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,333
the Witchblade was in the care
of the Doji Group.

284
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,166
That is,
until the Great Quake

285
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,291
six years ago
leveled our research lab

286
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,000
and it was lost to us.

287
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,250
The location
should ring familiar to you.

288
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,250
The Null Point.

289
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,750
But that was...

290
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,458
Yes, where you were discovered
after the Quake, unharmed.

291
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,916
You seem to know
an awful lot about me already.

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,833
I've seen your file.

293
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,000
I enjoyed the part about
assaulting a police officer.

294
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,166
That wasn't...

295
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,166
Whatever! You know, I don't
really appreciate the way

296
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,416
you're talking to me!

297
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,916
Is this how you treat
every girl you meet?

298
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,125
As I was saying.

299
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,083
We have no doubt
it was during the Quake

300
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,583
in which you acquired
the Witchblade.

301
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,958
I don't get it.

302
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,541
Why me?

303
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,583
That is a question you must
ask the Witchblade itself.

304
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,833
What, it talks?

305
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,583
I can tell you this:

306
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,333
the Witchblade will not bond
with just anyone.

307
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,541
Throughout history,

308
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,208
only women have achieved
a successful union.

309
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,750
Women?

310
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,708
Merely being a woman
does not guarantee

311
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,166
one will be a suitable host.

312
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,583
In fact, most are not.

313
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,500
We have not learned
what conditions must be met.

314
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:40,916
But regardless of what they are,
the Witchblade has chosen you.

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,083
This is all a bit much.

316
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,833
I need a minute
to let it sink in.

317
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,208
I imagine so.

318
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,208
All right, minute's over,
I've heard your lame story.

319
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,416
And the whole point
you're tryin' to make is

320
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,083
this thing is yours, right?

321
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,583
So go ahead,
take it back!

322
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,000
Not possible.

323
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,208
Wwww-what?

324
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,333
Research is still ongoing
with regard to its removal.

325
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,500
However, if you insist,

326
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,375
an amputation
can be arranged.

327
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,000
That's the best
you can come up with?

328
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,916
I want this thing offa me!

329
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,875
There's really
no cause for alarm.

330
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
The Witchblade
is quite valuable.

331
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,083
Yeah? Well, not to me,
it isn't!

332
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,583
You misunderstand,
I was not referring to you.

333
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,000
As you said,
it belongs to us.

334
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,791
So long as
it cannot be removed,

335
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,166
you belong to us, as well.

336
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,708
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

337
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,000
It means from this point
forward, you work for me.

338
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,250
Thanks for the offer,
really,

339
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,333
but I'd prefer to find
my own employment.

340
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,125
We're done! Land this thing
and lemme out!

341
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,250
You've made it clear
this has nothing to do with me!

342
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,500
Ow, hey! Let go of me!

343
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,083
You are mistaken again.

344
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,416
This has everything
to do with you.

345
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,625
You bear the Witchblade,

346
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,250
your fate is
to be locked in battle.

347
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,750
Locked in battle?
Against who?

348
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,958
You will soon find out.

349
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
Screw you!
Just let me go home!

350
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,791
Home to where exactly?

351
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,291
You're a wanted fugitive.

352
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,833
Last night, you escaped
from police custody.

353
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
Yeah? Well, now you've got me,
what's that make you?

354
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,041
The charges don't stop there.

355
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,625
Child Welfare violations,

356
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,833
property damage,

357
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,000
obstruction of justice.

358
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,875
It's enough to break
a daughter's heart.

359
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,000
Rihoko? Where is she?

360
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,000
She ran away
from Child Welfare.

361
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,583
Naturally, we're doing
all we can to find her.

362
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,291
Oh, God! How could you not
tell me this in the beginning?

363
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,791
You gonna sit there
and stare at it all day?

364
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,583
I made it for ya.
Eat up.

365
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm not throwin' it out.

366
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,375
But, um--

367
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,708
No buts.

368
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,625
...continuing coverage
of last night's explosion

369
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,916
at the South Asagaya
Detention Center.

370
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We have recently learned
that a female suspect

371
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,958
who was being held
at the Detention Center

372
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,000
is currently listed
as missing.

373
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,000
It's possible
the woman is buried

374
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,458
in the building's rubble,

375
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,375
although that has not been
confirmed at this time.

376
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
Rescue--

377
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,375
Were they talking
about my mom?

378
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,333
I dunno, all he said was
it was a woman.

379
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,916
Might've escaped in
all the confusion though, right?

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,916
That's what I woulda done.

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, that's right.

382
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,250
My mom--
she can run real fast.

383
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,083
That's nice.

384
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,625
Mom got away.

385
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,708
I know she did!

386
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,500
Let me outta here!
I want out now!

387
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,750
We've arrived.

388
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,416
This is our top R&amp;D Lab.

389
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,125
Lab?

390
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,500
Tozawa!

391
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,833
Crap, Mari,

392
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,791
you forget how to knock
or somethin'?

393
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,125
The little girl is gone!

394
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,083
I'd like to see how the
Witchblade takes form this time.

395
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm hoping you will
accommodate us.

396
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,750
What?!

397
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,750
What's happening?!

398
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,416
Hey! What's going on?

399
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,916
Help!
You can't do this to me!

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,583
Lemme outta here!
Open the door right now!

401
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,375
Help! Please!

402
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,791
You've gotta stop this thing,
I want out!

403
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,041
Please! I've had enough!

404
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,250
What the hell is this place?

405
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,166
Hello?

406
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,833
What do you expect me to do?

407
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,208
How do we proceed?

408
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,375
Can we really just...
turn it on?

409
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,375
We'll see.

410
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,791
Begin.

411
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,208
Riko.

412
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,583
I taste her fear,
she's looking for me.

413
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,458
This is it.

414
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,500
Her completed form.

415
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,583
I taste it.

416
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,041
I taste...

417
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,000
death!

418
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,041
If we get separated
for any reason,

419
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,833
we'll meet at the tower
as soon as we can.

420
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,125
[Music]

421
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,250
Dear Mom.

422
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,125
I know you're okay.

423
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,000
And, I know I'm gonna
see you again real soon.

424
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,708
That mean lady
who took you away from me

425
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,791
tried to make me stay at
that nasty Child Welfare Center.

426
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,583
But I ran away!

427
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,333
I'm safe from them now,
so don't worry about me.

428
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,875
Just hang in there, Mom!

429
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,500
Keep your chin up
and everything will be fine.

430
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,875
I'll be waiting
at our meeting place

431
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,458
like I promised!

432
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,958
I'll wait forever
if I have to.
