1
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,333
Next pairing.

2
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,750
Aoi!

3
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,333
We cannot allow the Sisters

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,208
to continue
such rigorous fighting;

5
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,208
they'll destroy one another
if this goes on any longer.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,333
Did Father really
order you to do this?

7
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,625
Yes.

8
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,458
He sent me
to choose one Sister

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,250
to help him
seize the Witchblade.

10
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,625
But I...
I was under the impression

11
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,083
he wasn't interested
in the Witchblade anymore.

12
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,666
Circumstances have changed.

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,500
There's a rumor going around.

14
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,666
Word is, Father
was actually murdered

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,958
and the company executives
are trying to--

16
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,375
That's just ridiculous.

17
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,458
I assure you
Father is very much alive;

18
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,666
he sent me here himself.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,416
You. What is your name?

20
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,958
Asagi.

21
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,541
Please come with me.

22
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,125
You are the chosen
Sister, Asagi.

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,166
What the hell's that mean?

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,458
As the chosen Sister,

25
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,250
it's your responsibility
to help us obtain

26
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,625
that which we have
longed to secure.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,750
How simple it all is.

28
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,708
This enormous organization,
the near limitless budget.

29
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,958
And I can do
whatever I want with it.

30
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,708
And to think
I used to make such a fuss

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,333
over a single stuffed animal.

32
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,166
Now there's only
one thing left.

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,291
And once I have it...

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,791
I have no need for you anymore.

35
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,791
[Music]

36
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,541
I'm gonna ask ya
one more time.

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you sure there's no way
to take that thing off?

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,708
Look, I've tried
everything I can.

39
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,208
But it's not comin' off, Tozawa.

40
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,666
The damned thing
never even budged.

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,166
There's no reason for you
to be depressed about it.

42
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,291
It'll be okay.

43
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,416
Yeah, how's it gonna be okay?

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,083
If you can't take
that friggin' thing off...

45
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,666
that means...

46
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,958
it means...

47
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,375
I know,
and I'm okay with it.

48
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,041
I've got no choice
but to accept it.

49
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:44,791
But, how am I
supposed to tell Riko?

50
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,375
I mean,
I know she's gonna be fine.

51
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,083
I've saved
lots of money for her.

52
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,750
And now,
she's got her father.

53
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,750
Her father?

54
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,666
Hmm-mm.

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
Takayama.

56
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,416
Hold on,
just 'cause you're an item

57
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,250
doesn't mean he's gonna agree
to take in your kid.

58
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,250
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

59
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,958
Man, we really
haven't talked in a while.

60
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,208
Takayama's
her biological father.

61
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,791
Aw, fer cryin' out--!

62
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,250
Isn't it a relief, though?

63
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,750
Well, dad or no dad...

64
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,000
you know it's not
gonna make this crap

65
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,291
any easier on Rihoko.

66
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,958
Yeah, I know that.

67
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,166
She's gonna lose
her mother, regardless.

68
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,708
It's gonna break
her poor little heart.

69
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,333
I love you, Mom.

70
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:39,500
But, I don't want it
to stay broken.

71
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,083
I want her to be able
to smile again.

72
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,125
I feel like if I say
something to her now,

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,291
maybe it'll make it easier.

74
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,333
But what can I say
to make it less painful?

75
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,833
I dunno.
What're you askin' me for?

76
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:57,708
Yeah, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:03,250
I guess this is
kind of tough, isn't it?

78
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,041
Here ya go.
Ya want seconds?

79
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,375
Oh, Riko!

80
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,000
Damn it.

81
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,291
There's gotta be
something we can do.

82
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,708
Now, Ota!

83
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
It works!

84
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,291
Installing
this antibody program

85
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,958
onto the malfunctioning
I-Weapons

86
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,791
will block the Witchblade's
interference

87
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,708
and allow us
to control them again.

88
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,125
Good!
Now split up and get to work.

89
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,041
I'll get you boys
the access codes.

90
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,166
Three?

91
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,291
You only have three
IU-Weapons?

92
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,708
That's correct.
It should be enough.

93
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,916
We should have
at least five to be sure.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
Are you insane, Wado?

95
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,166
They're going to fight
the Witchblade.

96
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,291
What do you want?

97
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,500
To destroy the whole city?

98
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,958
At any rate,
preparations are complete.

99
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,708
The rest is up to you.

100
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,791
I hope you've done your part
and laid the groundwork.

101
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,333
Don't underestimate me.

102
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,791
Doji is nothing like your
pathetic little organization.

103
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,208
Is that so?

104
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
And who was it who begged

105
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,000
said
'pathetic little organization'

106
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,416
to sell information to him?

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,125
You're the one
who came to me for money!

108
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,166
It doesn't matter now.

109
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,833
I look forward to possessing
the Witchblade very soon.

110
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,833
What a sniveling coward.

111
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,666
Once I control the Witchblade,
I'll cut him off for good.

112
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,041
She has finally
outlasted her usefulness.

113
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,583
Director?

114
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,875
The government has just approved
our X-Con Removal Plan.

115
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,041
Hm, really?

116
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,166
The areas we've specified
as danger zones

117
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,875
have been placed
under strict curfew.

118
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,333
Once we give them a location,
police and fire departments

119
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,791
will evacuate the citizens
in that area.

120
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,916
Shall I instruct the lab
to mobilize I-Weapons?

121
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,750
It's already
been taken care of.

122
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,375
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware.

123
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,000
Ah yes, speaking of the lab,

124
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,500
they've made a request
to halt the Baradhi shipment.

125
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,833
The I-Weapons in storage

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,500
experienced
only minor malfunctions.

127
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,250
Halting the entire shipment
would be excessive.

128
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,041
Regardless, I believe the ship
has already left port.

129
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,333
Yes, sir, two days ago.

130
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,208
Then there's no problem.

131
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,958
The Witchblade
is far more important anyway,

132
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,250
and failure
is not an option.

133
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
Good morning, baby!

134
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,166
What's going on, Mom?

135
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,166
You never get up before I do.

136
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,666
I always have to wake you up.

137
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,125
It's such a beautiful day
I didn't wanna sleep it away.

138
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,166
Hey, what do you say
the two of us go hiking?

139
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
You wanna go hiking?

140
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,208
Why not? It'll be fun.

141
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,250
And look,
I made you a lunch.

142
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,958
No way.
You made that yourself?

143
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,708
Not too shabby, huh?

144
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,375
It may not be pretty,
but I bet it tastes really good.

145
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,333
Wow, thanks!

146
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,583
Good morning!

147
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,916
Morning!

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Looks like you ladies
are headin' out somewhere.

149
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
Yeah!

150
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,166
Mom and I are going hiking
at Sakuragaoka Park!

151
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,791
See you later!

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,208
Come on, Mom! Hurry!

153
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,375
Coming!

154
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,791
Hey, so where are
the two of them headed off to?

155
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,208
They're going hiking
at Sakuragaoka Park.

156
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,166
You don't look so hot.

157
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,125
S'matter, you not sleepin'?

158
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,625
I'm fine.

159
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,375
Tell me somethin', Mariko.
Do you believe in God?

160
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,083
'Cause if He really does exist,

161
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,208
I was thinkin' maybe
I should start praying to Him.

162
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,416
I couldn't tell ya.

163
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
But you know,
if He does exist,

164
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,250
he's probably been long buried
under all that rubble.

165
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,791
You're prob'ly right.

166
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:58,791
Miss Maria, I have selected
a Sister to help us.

167
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,583
Asagi, please say hello.

168
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,750
Good work, Aoi.
She's perfect.

169
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,791
Go have her fitted
with a Cloneblade.

170
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,083
Yes, ma'am.
Come with me please.

171
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,250
She says my job
as the "Chosen Sister"

172
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,125
is to help you
obtain what you desire.

173
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,750
Yes, that's correct.

174
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,375
So what is it?

175
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,708
Power.

176
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,583
Power, huh?

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
That doesn't interest you?

178
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,333
I dunno.

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,708
Asagi, you mustn't say
anything rude to Miss Maria.

180
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,833
That's unacceptable.

181
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:46,875
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,958
She's just pretending
to be an adult.

183
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,250
Watch your mouth!

184
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,125
She's so a kid
on the inside.

185
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,541
A spoiled little kid.

186
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,166
Oh, wow!

187
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
Mom! Come look!

188
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,125
These cosmos flowers
are so pretty!

189
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,625
Dontcha think?

190
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,416
Please, give me the strength
to tell her.

191
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
Thank you for the food!

192
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,791
Delicious!

193
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,208
You used just the right
amount of salt, Mom!

194
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,583
You see?

195
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,333
I'm not such a terrible cook
after all.

196
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,666
No, but you might've used too
much sugar in this tamagoyaki.

197
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,375
Think so?

198
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,916
Mom!

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,166
Hey, Mom!

200
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,750
It's so pretty,
don't you just love it out here?

201
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

202
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,458
The park is very pretty,

203
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,250
but I bet Heaven
is even prettier than this.

204
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,458
Well, you see...
Riko, when people die,

205
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,791
their spirits go to
a beautiful place called Heaven.

206
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,958
But it's not like
it's a sad thing or anything.

207
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,125
It's just...

208
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,250
Even though
they seem far away,

209
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,041
the people in Heaven
are always close by,

210
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,291
watching over you.

211
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,708
It's far in the sky--

212
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,041
What?

213
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,625
I don't understand
what you're saying.

214
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,666
Um...

215
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,666
Well, it's...

216
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,250
kind of uh...

217
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,666
you know...

218
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,666
oh, man...

219
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,083
Who cares!

220
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,375
Never mind that Heaven business;
I wanna live here.

221
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,666
Let's build our house
somewhere like this!

222
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,666
A two-story house
with a garden.

223
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,541
So we can have
lots of flowers!

224
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,541
Oh, and maybe a doggie!

225
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
Those blueprints might be
a little small now.

226
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,541
Whadya think?

227
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,666
Wouldn't be nice
to have a big house, Mom?

228
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,125
Rihoko...

229
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,625
That house of yours...

230
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,541
I can't.

231
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,291
Mom? What's wrong?

232
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,375
Listen, Riko...

233
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,541
Pretty soon,
I don't think

234
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,916
you're gonna be able
to see me anymore.

235
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,166
Don't worry.

236
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,125
I'm still gonna be around,
you just won't see me.

237
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,166
But I'm not gonna leave you.

238
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,083
I could never leave you, Riko.

239
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,875
I'm going to stay by your side
like I always have.

240
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,375
You'll never be alone.

241
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,458
I promise.

242
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,083
Don't ever forget that.

243
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,291
We interrupt this program
for an urgent news report.

244
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,333
Doji Industries has a critical
warning to all citizens;

245
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,875
they suspect
one of their weapons is loose.

246
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,250
No way! Is this for real?

247
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,583
...all of the devices
that were mistakenly unleashed

248
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,625
during their recent
security breach.

249
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,083
What's goin' on?

250
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,000
I thought all the X-Cons
had been recovered?

251
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,333
...but depending
on the situation,

252
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,583
evacuation orders
may be given.

253
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,083
Please pay attention
to news and police reports

254
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:44,833
for further instructions.

255
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,916
Hey, that includes us!

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,416
What about Masane and Rihoko?

257
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,125
My God, that's right!
They're still out there!

258
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,458
At Sakuragaoka Park, right?

259
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,583
I'm on my way.

260
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,666
We're just now getting
our first images of the weapon,

261
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,875
reportedly called an X-Con.

262
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,458
What the hell is that?

263
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,083
Looks like a woman,

264
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,333
but even I gotta pass
on that one!

265
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,375
So creepy.

266
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,333
I can't let it go down
like this.

267
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
This is the Metro Police.

268
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,083
This area is currently
under curfew.

269
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,625
Please evacuate
to a safe location immediately.

270
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,791
Hey, Riko?

271
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,041
I'll be fine, but I need you
to run on home, okay?

272
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,708
Mom!

273
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,708
Wait!

274
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,125
Tozawa!

275
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,791
Don't try and take this on
all by yourself!

276
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,916
Get outta here.

277
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,166
Take Rihoko now, and run!

278
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,250
C'mon, Melony!

279
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not doing this
to be stubborn.

280
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,125
There's a part of me

281
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,250
that can't resist
the desire to fight!

282
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,166
As long as I have this thing,
it'll be the same wherever I go.

283
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,250
I have to keep fighting.

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,583
Take Riko home.

285
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
Please.

286
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,875
Go now!

287
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:26,916
Rihoko.

288
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,750
Mom said soon I wasn't gonna
be able to see her anymore.

289
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,375
Tozawa?

290
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,250
That means...

291
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,458
it means she's gonna die,
doesn't it?

292
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,333
I'm sorry, Rihoko.

293
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,541
Mommy!

294
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,458
Director!

295
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,083
It's happening!
Just like before!

296
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,666
That must mean Masane is...

297
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,166
Bad news, sir.

298
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,458
Wado has been granted permission
to mobilize our I-Weapons

299
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,375
under the pretext of
removing an X-Con!

300
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,458
I knew it, the bastard
is after the Witchblade!

301
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,500
Director.

302
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,541
We're not gonna
make it in time!

303
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,208
No. We have to.

304
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,541
We can't let them
reach the city!

305
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,666
Yes, sir!

306
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,083
Masane!

307
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,250
If you keep fighting like this,
you won't last.

308
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,333
Try to suppress your power!

309
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,208
Even just a little.

310
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,083
The power inside me
keeps growing and growing.

311
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
So much, feels like
it could tear me apart!

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,416
She's incredible.

313
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,416
Her power
has increased immensely!

314
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,541
What exactly is happening
inside of her?

315
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,208
I must learn more.

316
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,625
I'll never see anything
this magnificent again!

317
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,750
What the hell...

318
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,291
is this thing!

319
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,583
No!

320
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
What happened?
Call the infirmary!

321
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,625
Don't stop!
Keep working!

322
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,375
Director!
That's all that's left.

323
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,000
It's almost like something
is calling out to them

324
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,375
from somewhere.

325
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,583
Ota!

326
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,250
Get one of the units
we've fixed, and attack!

327
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,625
In here? Are you sure?

328
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,791
Better here than outside.

329
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,833
Move it!

330
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,833
Yes, sir!

331
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,875
Osada. Oda!

332
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,208
Fire in the hole!

333
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,375
Get down!

334
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,041
Damn!

335
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,708
Are they at war or something?

336
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,750
Hold on a sec.

337
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,875
Is it possible?

338
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,833
How can this be?

339
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,375
All of our planning,

340
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,708
yet we still can't
capture the Witchblade.

341
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,958
This is atrocious!
Absolutely atrocious!

342
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,833
I'd have to agree.

343
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,291
Which reminds me,
given the I-Weapon malfunctions,

344
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,375
I wonder how the lab is doing.

345
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,916
I don't give a damn
about that, Segawa!

346
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,625
What's going to happen to me?

347
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,250
A little late
to worry about that.

348
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,458
Roger that.

349
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,958
We are headed back.

350
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,125
Could you have
a tugboat ready?

351
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,791
I have to go back.

352
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
I have to get home.

353
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,125
Riko.

354
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,625
[Music]

355
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,541
Mom! The rice balls
were delicious!

356
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,541
And the tamagoyaki
was a little too sweet,

357
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,375
but it was still good.

358
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,333
Our picnic at the park
was so much fun.

359
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,000
The flowers were so pretty!

360
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,375
But now I know
what people mean

361
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,000
when they say
"the picnic is over."

362
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,833
Why don't we go home and eat?

363
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,791
I'll make tons of yummy food!

364
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,500
We can go
to the bathhouse after,

365
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,791
and then we can stay up
and talk and talk

366
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,166
until we fall asleep.

367
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,208
So please, Mom, come home.

368
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,958
Okay?
