1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,375
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,208
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,166
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,291
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,708
Righteous Sword of God,

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,625
or Hand of the Devil himself?

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,875
A new Bearer finds out,

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:33,541
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,333
[Music]

10
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,500
Oh, wow!

11
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,791
So fluffy! Is this what
all suites are like?

12
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, the suites
in this hotel

13
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,666
are a tad more luxurious
than most.

14
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,583
Here are your things,
which we retrieved,

15
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,125
as well as
a change of clothes.

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,750
For any pressing needs.

17
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,250
While we search for
a more permanent dwelling,

18
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,333
please enjoy all of
the hotel's amenities.

19
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,250
If you need me, I'm in Room 15,
right down the hall.

20
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,208
Here to keep
an eye on us, huh?

21
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,708
Look at it more as
"here to assist."

22
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,833
I'll take my leave,

23
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,833
but do call
if there's anything else.

24
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,916
Bye now, Rihoko,
have a good night!

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Thank you, I will!
G'night!

26
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,791
Riko!
Get your hands offa that!

27
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,875
Sorry.

28
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,541
So Mom, are you gonna work
at Mr. Segawa's company?

29
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,208
Sure am.

30
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,791
But Mr. Segawa's
not my boss, though.

31
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,125
Is it a good company?

32
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,041
Well, it's a real big one.

33
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,791
But what about the police?
And the Child Welfare people?

34
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,250
Won't they come back?

35
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,791
Don't worry about them.

36
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,375
You and me stick together!

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
Yippee!

38
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,750
We've only been in Tokyo
a few days.

39
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,833
But I swear it feels
more like a few weeks.

40
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,208
Mommy!
Your tummy's calling!

41
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,416
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

42
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,083
Let's order in!

43
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Whatever you want,
sky's the limit!

44
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,291
But Mom, we need to
watch our budget.

45
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,583
It's all good,
we'll bill it to the company.

46
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,500
But won't that get you fired?

47
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,166
Not a chance!

48
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,791
Delicious!

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,916
Delightful sauce,
I wonder how they made it?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,666
Yeah, I just realized.

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,916
It's been a long time since
we've had your home cooking.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,666
When we find a real home,
I'll cook whenever you want!

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,750
Sounds good.

54
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,291
A place where
no one can complain

55
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,708
and we won't
cause any trouble.

56
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,416
Yay, I can't wait!

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,625
For the first time,
we'll have a house, just for us!

58
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,875
That's right.

59
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,416
Just the two of us,
from now on!

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,666
Go, Team Amaha!

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,750
Go, go, go!

62
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,333
And on the first floor,

63
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,500
where the cranky
photographer man lives,

64
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,375
is the lady
who owns the place.

65
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,833
Her name is Mariko.

66
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,000
She's kinda scary at first,

67
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,125
but really,
she's pretty nice.

68
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
She let me spend
the night there,

69
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,708
and she made me breakfast
in the morning.

70
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,958
Really?

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,625
Then, we'll have to
go by there tomorrow

72
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,208
and thank her properly.

73
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,208
Okay, Mom.

74
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,916
Have you made a decision?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,958
Do we have a deal?
Or not?

76
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,625
Of course I did it.

77
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,125
I had to.

78
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,708
I'll never let them
take you away from me again.

79
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,166
It's been a long time.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,458
Now why would you
be calling me?

81
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,833
Why, the Witchblade.

82
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,875
Seems a new Bearer
has been chosen.

83
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,166
So it appears.

84
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,500
Don't be coy,
I know you have her.

85
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,041
Just as I know

86
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Doji Industries is incapable
of controlling the Witchblade.

87
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,416
I believe I may be in
a position to help you, Reiji.

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,250
Your personal assistance?

89
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,833
Or that of an NSWF employee?

90
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,666
Does it really matter?

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,750
The last thing I want
is a repeat of six years ago.

92
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,333
So many years.

93
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,708
Who remembers the details?

94
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,916
The truth never fades.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,958
Speaking of, I apologize,

96
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,166
but we've not yet
located the Witchblade.

97
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,541
Though it was good
to hear from you again.

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,291
Reiji...

99
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,791
All this time,

100
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,125
and she's still
after the Witchblade.

101
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,833
I will not
let you have it, Reina.

102
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,916
I swear.

103
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,500
How was the call?

104
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,291
Any luck?

105
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,083
It wasn't easy,
Takayama's not naive.

106
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,750
But I have no doubt.

107
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,375
The Doji Group is now
in possession of the Witchblade.

108
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,583
I'm curious about the new girl,
I wonder what she's like.

109
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,250
Good question.

110
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,916
And in due time, I'm sure
we'll discover the answer.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,958
In person.

112
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,291
Yes.

113
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,916
I get the feeling
you're right.

114
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,125
Is it that late?

115
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,583
I suppose you have to leave,
what with tomorrow and all.

116
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,625
Uh, don't worry,
I can clean that up for you.

117
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,625
All right.

118
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,291
Thank you.

119
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,708
My pleasure.

120
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,125
Dr. Soho, ma'am.

121
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,083
Good night, Shiori.

122
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,541
Oh, my dearest Reina.

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,208
Ah! Good morning, ladies!

124
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,208
If you're going out,
I'll be happy to drive!

125
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,416
Mr. Segawa!

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,625
Good morning!

127
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,666
Right this way please,
Miss Rihoko.

128
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,666
Thank you, sir!

129
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,916
Hey! No!

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,208
This is a private matter.

131
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,291
You're not invited!
Riko, come along.

132
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,250
Allow me to act
as your bodyguard.

133
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,625
Last thing I need's a--

134
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,250
C'mon, Mom!
Hurry up!

135
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,708
Please, ma'am.
Right this way.

136
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,041
Ah. To thank her for letting you
stay the night?

137
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,041
Uh-huh.
Do you know where it is?

138
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,208
Of course!
In fact, from now on,

139
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,791
you just leave
everything to me!

140
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,041
Hang on!

141
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,500
Okay! Y'know,
I like you, Mr. Segawa!

142
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,416
You talk to me
like I'm a grown-up!

143
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,750
You're a very refined
young lady, Miss Rihoko!

144
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,041
Why, thank you!

145
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,041
Oh, yeah!

146
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,041
That's what
I'm talkin' about, volume!

147
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,833
Heh!
My mom's are way bigger.

148
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,166
I'd love to see 'em, eh?

149
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,791
How's it goin?

150
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,916
Uh. You must be young Rihoko.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,250
I've heard so much
about you.

152
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
So that must mean...?

153
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,208
Hi, uh...

154
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,500
Rihoko's mama, welcome!
I heard all about you, too!

155
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,250
Just as I pictured,
Young, sweet, beautiful!

156
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,083
I'm so happy
I was able to meet you!

157
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,625
So very happy!

158
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,625
Hello!

159
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,833
Such a fine mama.

160
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,250
Yeah, um.

161
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,708
My heavens! In fact,
these are quite fine indeed!

162
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,208
Mr. Cho at your...

163
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,208
O-kay!

164
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,500
Listen,
it's nice to meet you,

165
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,833
but, are you the husband?

166
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,291
Who, me?

167
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,875
Husband? Of that old broad?
You gotta be kiddin' me!

168
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,875
I got high standards, hon!

169
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,708
The bikini standard!

170
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,083
In her day, she could
rock a skimpy number.

171
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,541
But not since she moved
to "Support Girdle City".

172
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,166
You talkin'
'bout Miss Mariko?

173
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,166
Yep.

174
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,500
But, uh, she's out right now.

175
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,625
Do you need her for somethin'?

176
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,708
S'cuse me.

177
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,250
Do you live here, too?

178
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,750
So, uh...

179
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,750
Do you know if there's
a room we can rent?

180
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,875
Well, this is what you call
a "mixed residential",

181
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,666
a multi-use building,
not really made for living in.

182
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,583
But a tenant just moved out,
so there is an open room.

183
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,291
I can also tell you,
the rent is dirt cheap,

184
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,208
but prob'ly 'cause
there's no bath.

185
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,541
Sounds great!
I'll take it!

186
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,416
I said "I'll take it!"

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,875
Really, Mom? Can we?

188
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,000
They're taking their time.

189
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,125
I got leads and angles
out the wazoo,

190
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,583
but none of it
seems to fit.

191
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,541
Even though a bunch
of the stiffs worked for NSWF,

192
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,708
it's not enough.

193
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,833
I need proof.

194
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,500
Crap!

195
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,666
Well.

196
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,666
Guess all I've gotta do now
is find a way to get inside.

197
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,375
And I bet
it won't be as easy

198
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,791
as just "borrowing"
someone's ID card.

199
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,958
Then you are well aware
of what has transpired.

200
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,333
That the Witchblade
has made its reappearance.

201
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,583
Yes.

202
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,958
And that Doji's I-Weapons

203
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,958
are responsible
for our Sister's deaths.

204
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,916
Their loss weighs
heavily on me.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,041
I am deeply saddened.

206
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,625
However,
I am also concerned.

207
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,791
If your Sisters fall to the
likes of I-Weapons and X-Cons,

208
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,208
they are not worth mourning.

209
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,708
The Witchblade is the most
powerful object on this Earth,

210
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,500
and we are
its rightful owners.

211
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,458
We must be above failure.

212
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,708
We must not let the Doji Group
obtain the Witchblade.

213
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,250
Furthermore, we cannot abide
the senseless loss

214
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,416
of any more of your Sisters.

215
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,125
I believe these two tasks
fall within your capabilities.

216
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,916
Yes, sir,
I won't let you down.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,333
I know you won't.

218
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,250
I'm placing
a great deal of trust in you.

219
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
Just as I trust
what occurred in the past

220
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,000
will not occur again.

221
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,666
Like you said, Father,

222
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,166
it's all in the past.

223
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,666
Of all my daughters,

224
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,166
you are the one most worthy
of the Witchblade's blessing.

225
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,708
What?

226
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,541
You wanna live here?

227
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,333
Yeah, well.
I know we just met

228
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,333
and you don't really know us,

229
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,541
but please
let us rent the room!

230
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,750
Yeah! Pretty please?

231
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,458
All riiight!

232
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,958
'Bout time the scenery
in this place

233
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,416
got some upgrades, y'know?

234
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,666
Yeah, you know.

235
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,708
Mari, I am drawing up
a contract as we speak,

236
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,625
You can't have it!

237
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,416
I need this.

238
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,333
Sorry, no kids allowed.

239
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,375
They're noisy and messy.

240
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,583
'Sides, I'm only zoned
for commercial leases.

241
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,083
Ah, she's full of it!

242
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,375
'Cept for the bar,
we're all single residents.

243
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
Yeah! And it's a wonder
I ever get rent from anybody!

244
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,666
Please, I promise!

245
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,666
We'll pay the rent
on time every month!

246
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,958
I promise too!

247
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,708
I'll be real quiet,
Miss Mariko!

248
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,375
And I'll keep
everything clean--

249
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,833
I said, no!

250
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,333
Gimme one reason!

251
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,958
I'm the landlord
and I said so!

252
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,750
Hey, I worked hard on that!

253
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,583
Come on!
That's so unfair!

254
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,833
Damn straight.

255
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,708
And if you don't like it,
get out!

256
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, real mature!

257
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,500
All right, it's on,
you crabby old gasbag!

258
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,458
Who'd wanna rent from you?

259
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,958
Mom!

260
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,583
Crabby old gasbag?!

261
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,791
Guess that makes you
just an over-developed bitch!

262
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,625
Yeah?
It takes one to know one!

263
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,875
Mom, please stop!

264
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,125
See?
She's makin' noise already!

265
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,625
You're the one
who started yellin', hag!

266
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,625
You started it!

267
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,625
I'll finish it!

268
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,375
All of the signs are bad.

269
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,250
It doesn't get
any worse than this.

270
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,500
You don't fool me.

271
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,375
You know you think
the kid is cute.

272
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,541
Oh, shut up!

273
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,291
Don't be ridiculous!
Not that it matters.

274
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,375
We're being evicted.

275
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,333
"City redevelopment."

276
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,708
We've got one year.

277
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,041
Then they demolish
the building.

278
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,375
Damn government.

279
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,458
Greedy,
that's what that is!

280
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,291
After all this.

281
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,833
And they're just gonna
tear the place down.

282
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,500
What a world, huh?

283
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,875
Don't run away from me.

284
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,625
I want to help
make you warm inside!

285
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,250
Niiice and warm!

286
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,916
Niiice and warm!

287
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,625
I want to make you
warm inside!

288
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,750
Niiice and warm!

289
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,583
Same method as the last one.

290
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,750
Seems like an awful lot of work
just to kill some girl.

291
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,541
Maybe 'cause whatever
killed her wasn't human!

292
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,541
What are you sayin'?

293
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,083
Some sorta boogeyman
did this?

294
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,125
I dunno.

295
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,875
You're
Mr. Big Bossy Detective-Man,

296
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,875
why don't you tell me?

297
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,458
Tell me I didn't just
hear you call me bossy!

298
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,000
First,
you try'n tell me my job,

299
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,583
an' then you call me bossy?

300
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,166
Okay, easy!
I'm sorry!

301
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,458
Another one of our Sisters.

302
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,375
Her internal organs
were heated to liquification.

303
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,083
Then I suppose an autopsy
won't be necessary.

304
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,958
A Type EM did this.

305
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,208
More than likely,
not just one.

306
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,458
I wanna make it warm.

307
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,458
Make it warm inside.

308
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,958
I wanna make it warm.

309
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,291
Niiice and warm!

310
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,041
The rent is gonna
kill us everywhere!

311
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,125
I still think Miss Mariko's
place was the best bet.

312
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,458
Maybe we could go ask her
one more time.

313
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,916
Forget it.

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,500
I wouldn't even wanna rent
from that crabby old gasbag.

315
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,000
Y'know, you went a little
overboard yesterday too, Mom.

316
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,000
Ohhh.

317
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,833
You're taking her side now?

318
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,708
No, I'm not taking any sides.

319
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,958
A'right.

320
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,000
When Miss Mariko said she was
a "commercial lease zone,"

321
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,500
what did that mean?

322
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,583
It means she only rents out
office space,

323
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,708
for businesses.

324
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,083
Yeah, I got it.

325
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,208
I'll be right there.

326
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,375
Baby...

327
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,708
Mommy has to go to work
for a meeting.

328
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,625
See you later, Mom!

329
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,666
Okay, bye-bye!

330
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,166
I'll be back soon!

331
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,083
Sure glad I don't hafta work.

332
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,458
"Odd jobs?"

333
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,958
I got it!

334
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,416
Just you today?

335
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Yes. The Director won't
involve himself personally

336
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,708
unless it's pressing.

337
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,125
Not that I wanted to see him.

338
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,958
I have the specs
and research data

339
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,791
on your next X-Con target.

340
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,333
Classification, Type EM.

341
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,333
Wait. I thought
I already got that one.

342
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,375
You did. Several models
were mass-produced

343
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,541
for testing purposes.

344
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,541
Mass-produced?

345
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,833
Already,
we have a special team

346
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,291
working on tracking them
down for you.

347
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,750
When they find one,
they'll call this.

348
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,833
A specially modified
cell phone.

349
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,291
Of course.

350
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,250
There may be an occasion
where you discover one yourself.

351
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,583
If an X-Con
is in your vicinity,

352
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,750
the Witchblade
will detect it.

353
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,750
And that concludes
this briefing.

354
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,916
We're counting on you.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,625
This is crazy.

356
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,000
I feel like some
kind of subcontractor.

357
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,083
A subcontractor hired
to exterminate X-Cons!

358
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,291
Good one!

359
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,916
Yeah, I wasn't really
tryin' to be funny.

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,416
Riko?

361
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,458
Riko, you here?

362
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,291
She didn't!

363
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,083
Okay, yeah,
sounds good.

364
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,333
I'll let you know
when I've made a decision.

365
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,291
Thank you very much.

366
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,125
Hello, everybody!

367
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,541
Don't even try!

368
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,375
I'm a paying customer today.

369
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,125
Awright.
What'll it be?

370
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:24,166
Pudding ala mode, please!
With extra fruit!

371
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,583
But the menu said...

372
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
Fine, shut up!

373
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,708
Hey, Mari.

374
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,083
Glass o' water?

375
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,625
Hey! Little Rihoko!

376
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,875
I missed you!

377
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,500
Hello there, Mister Cho!

378
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,875
So, where's your ma?
Is she here?

379
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,083
Oh yeah, she's uh--

380
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,208
Riko!

381
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,458
Now how did I know
I'd find you here?

382
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,708
Ohhh!

383
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,875
I, I told you this place
is off limits!

384
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,000
We're going home, now!

385
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, but Mom,
I really like it here!

386
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,125
What'd I say?

387
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,125
Yeah, but...!

388
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,333
She'll only rent
to a business!

389
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,500
Doesn't matter now.

390
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,208
Couldn't rent it to you
even if I wanted.

391
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,083
Yeah, whatever.

392
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,291
Just got a call
out of the blue

393
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,291
from some guy
at a real estate agency,

394
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,541
and I've made my decision.

395
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,958
So you're gonna
rent out the room?

396
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,958
Uh-huh.

397
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,708
You mean,
you decided already?

398
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,750
Just now, in fact.

399
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,750
Are you sure?

400
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,166
Persistent much?!

401
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,625
Unlike you and your mother,

402
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,791
this one
is a legitimate business!

403
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,125
What's the name of it?

404
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,541
They're called,
"Odd-Job Amaha."

405
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,416
Wait. That's weird.

406
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,791
Our name is Amaha.

407
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,833
Wa-hoo!

408
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,083
We did it! Surprise!

409
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,666
Odd-Job Amaha is
actually our company!

410
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,333
What are you saying?

411
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,541
I called and asked
the real estate agent myself!

412
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,166
It's okay, Mommy, isn't it?

413
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,291
Our company name?

414
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,833
Odd-Job Amaha?

415
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,083
Yeah, that, uh,
kinda sums it up!

416
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,625
Well then, now that we're
officially your new tenants...

417
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,958
H-Hold on! I haven't...

418
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,375
I'd say it's time
to admit defeat.

419
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,000
Who's got a pen?

420
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,583
Thank you, Mariko!

421
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,166
Go, Team Amaha!

422
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,333
Go, go, go!

423
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,458
A sign of disturbance.

424
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,750
But not necessarily bad.

425
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,375
You do know

426
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,291
you only have a year 'til
the building gets torn down.

427
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,375
You can have the place,

428
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,083
but you'll have to find
a new one soon.

429
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,250
Yeah, breaks my heart.

430
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,875
Only one more year
in paradise.

431
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,083
But that's plenty o' time!

432
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,708
A mixed residential?
And she plans to live there?

433
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,916
Yes, well, that's how things
turned out, it seems.

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,125
She's quite headstrong.

435
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,833
And you can't
talk us out of it!

436
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,958
I'm living here with Riko!

437
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,125
'Cause I refuse to
let you watch over us!

438
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,875
Have you forgotten
your work agreement?

439
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,833
Oh, I'll do your odd jobs!

440
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,583
But I will not be used!

441
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,625
I work on
a contract basis only!

442
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,000
You got that?

443
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,291
I wouldn't hold my breath.

444
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,916
Fine.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
Do as you please.

446
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,375
Okay.

447
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,041
Really?

448
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,791
Doctor...

449
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,750
You two are...

450
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,083
Incredible.

451
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,666
Such an amazing aroma.

452
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,916
Oh, dear.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,708
However did they find us?

454
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,833
They're not difficult
to neutralize.

455
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,083
Stay on the move
and you'll be fine.

456
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,791
I want to make you
warm inside!

457
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,750
Make you
niiice and waaarm!

458
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,291
What is this?

459
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,000
I feel it.

460
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,833
But it's different
from before.

461
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,791
Masane, wait!

462
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,125
I need you!

463
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,666
But you're
the last one left.

464
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,500
She looks like--

465
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,583
Waaarm!

466
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,291
Doctor.

467
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,166
That's her,
she's wearing the Witchblade.

468
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,500
Yes, so it would seem.

469
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,708
Are you X-Cons?

470
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,125
Must not be too bright

471
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,958
if she doesn't know us
from those piles of scrap.

472
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,791
Almost feel sorry for her.

473
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,625
She's obviously not
been told many details.

474
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,583
Why is it all of a sudden
I'm really itchin' for a fight?

475
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,666
[Music]

476
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,291
We did it!

477
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,333
We finally found
a place to call home!

478
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,625
Mister Cho,
Miss Mariko, Miss Naomi.

479
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,791
I love them all!

480
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,208
As soon as I can,

481
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,375
I'm going to make
a special treat for them!

482
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,875
But don't worry, Mom.

483
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,500
Of course, I'll still do
all the cooking for you too!

484
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,791
You know...

485
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,833
I think I'd like to learn
more about cooking,

486
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,875
maybe I could be a chef!

487
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,916
By the way,
that gets me thinking:

488
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,166
what exactly
is your job, Mom?
