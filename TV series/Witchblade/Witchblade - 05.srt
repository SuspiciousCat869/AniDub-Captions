1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,250
She doesn't seem
very powerful, Doctor.

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,541
Rather disappointing

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,958
since she's the one
the Witchblade has chosen.

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,125
I agree.

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,916
Quite disappointing.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,041
Shall I do her?

7
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,791
What the hell is going on?

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,541
Who are you people?

9
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,041
We'll leave her for now.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,916
I think we've
seen enough today--

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,541
we can test her
her abilities later.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,625
Understood.

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,250
What the hell
was that all about?

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,291
[Music]

15
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,166
They found you earlier
than I anticipated.

16
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,375
What do you mean
"they found me"?

17
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,583
Their powers seemed
an awful lot like mine.

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,000
Who were they?

19
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,208
You know of the NSWF.

20
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,708
Yeah, aren't they like,

21
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,750
the Child Welfare
Ministry's boss?

22
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,416
Their boss?

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,250
Not quite the way
I would've worded it.

24
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,958
Segawa,
I think it's time she knew.

25
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,666
Tell her about the Cloneblade.

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,958
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,375
Cloneblade?
What's that?

28
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,583
There was a time when
the Doji Group and the NSWF

29
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,166
shared technological
information.

30
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,250
Together, we succeeded
in creating the Cloneblade.

31
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,458
It is a fusion of
our Witchblade research

32
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,916
and the NSWF's biotechnology.

33
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,041
When compared to
the actual Witchblade,

34
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,041
it's quite inferior
in performance

35
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,708
but it has the same
basic structure.

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,750
So those two women.

37
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,833
They're from the NSWF's
Neogene program.

38
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,833
As such, they are
genetically predisposed

39
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,416
to wield the Cloneblade.

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,458
Neogene?

41
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,041
A human sub-species
born from biotech.

42
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,541
One of the women
you encountered,

43
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,791
is the most advanced
Neogene on record.

44
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,166
She is known as Lady.

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,583
We have no intel
on the other woman.

46
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,083
But judging by the way
she destroyed those X-Cons,

47
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,166
she must be
rather advanced as well.

48
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,166
Wait a minute.

49
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,458
Were you the one
who ordered them

50
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,541
to take out those X-Cons?

51
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,916
Of course not.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,083
we haven't collaborated
with the NSWF for six years.

53
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,541
So why would they choose
to fight them

54
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,291
if they didn't have to?

55
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,416
Because...

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,083
they understand
how the I-weapons work.

57
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,666
How they always look
for the strongest opponent.

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,750
A Neogene is more appealing
than a normal human.

59
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,208
It's very similar to the way
the Witchblade craves battle,

60
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,750
with which you are now
quite familiar.

61
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,541
You, of all people,
should be able to empathize.

62
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,625
One factor we cannot ignore
is the NSWF's director,

63
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,208
Mr. Furumizu.

64
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,166
He is determined to acquire
the Witchblade for himself.

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,541
Why?

66
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,666
Ultimately, his goal is to
unite the Witchblade

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,416
with one of his top Neogenes,

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,958
creating the most powerful
human in history.

69
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,541
A rumor's been circulating
for some time

70
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,458
that the Child Welfare
Ministry is just a cover.

71
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,791
That Furumizu's using it

72
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,125
to select future
Neogene candidates.

73
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,208
Seriously? He's experimenting
on those poor kids?

74
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,583
That's the rumor.

75
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,750
The lesson of course
is to never side with the NSWF.

76
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,333
Don't even worry about that.

77
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,583
I got a history
with those jerks.

78
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,750
Good.
You're free to go now.

79
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,708
Yeah, I'm not done.

80
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,791
What's the deal with
this money you gave me?

81
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,083
For your living expenses.

82
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,458
You'll also be earning
a regular salary.

83
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,750
That doesn't
really work for me.

84
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,541
I don't wanna be
a kept woman.

85
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,166
How 'bout
we do things my way?

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,208
I do a job,
and then you pay me.

87
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,958
Well, if you insist.

88
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,666
Not so fast, pretty boy.

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm gonna call this one payment
for the last job I did.

90
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,708
Your last assignment
ended in failure.

91
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,375
So you get nothing.

92
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,791
What?
But I went to the scene!

93
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,125
And I got them to retreat,

94
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,916
so I should at least
get a percentage!

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,208
You were given orders
to eliminate the X-Con.

96
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,541
You did not--
therefore, you do not get paid.

97
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,708
Oh, come on!

98
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,958
Thirty percent?

99
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,291
Do you have
a hearing problem?

100
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,166
I am not going to pay you.

101
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,333
Gimme a break!

102
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,375
I'm sure you guys
are rollin' in dough!

103
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,666
You shouldn't stress
over chump change like this,

104
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,041
it'll make you bald.

105
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,041
'Fact, your hairline's
lookin' iffy already!

106
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,083
Masane,
I think that's enough.

107
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,333
Okay, fine.

108
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
Then how about
if you pay me

109
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,083
for that first job
I did back at the prison.

110
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,333
But that was before we even--

111
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,250
Whatever!
I killed the thing, didn't I?

112
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,916
Okay, enough.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,208
Segawa, give her the money.

114
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
Why, thank you.

115
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,583
Oh, and by the way,

116
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,083
I am done
bein' this guy's bodyguard.

117
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,333
My goodness.

118
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,416
You almost gave me
a heart attack in there.

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,291
Oh, please.
I was just tellin' the truth.

120
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,375
Well, that's the first time

121
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,416
I've ever seen
Mr. Takayama concede.

122
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,625
So, how much does the job pay?

123
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,250
You mean, you don't even know
what you were negotiating for?

124
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,250
Well, I would guess.

125
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,375
I dunno,
like a hundred grand?

126
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,625
You've underestimated
Doji Industries.

127
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,708
You'll be making the same
as our top lab researchers,

128
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,916
over two million.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,166
What?
Two million?

130
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,375
Ssshhh.

131
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,208
That woman'll be
the death of me.

132
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,041
Dim the lights.

133
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,000
And to think
the Witchblade chose her.

134
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,166
Yes?

135
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,041
It's time for the Board
of Directors meeting, sir.

136
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,291
You're exactly one minute
and 30 seconds late,

137
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,708
Mr. Takayama.

138
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,333
Well, this is it.

139
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,500
Wow!

140
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,333
Check it out, Mom!

141
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,958
Just look at this kitchen;
it's awesome!

142
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,875
Right? I'm sure my little chef
can make this work, huh?

143
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,041
You bet!

144
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,958
Next month's rent is due
at the end of this month!

145
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,208
And don't be late with it!

146
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,875
For this month,
it's 35,000 pro-rated.

147
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,500
Hey! Wait a minute!

148
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,875
You said this place
goes for 60,000 a month.

149
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,083
So half of that would be 30.

150
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,208
The extra five's
a surcharge for the kid.

151
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,708
How is that fair?

152
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,916
If you don't like it, get out!

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,916
Witch!

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,166
Sticks and stones.

155
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,166
Dun-da-da-daaaa!

156
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, sorry to keep
you ladies waiting!

157
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,916
I got ya
a housewarming present.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,958
You like it?

159
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,833
Oh, wow!
A mattress!

160
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,916
Thank you so much!
That's a big help!

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,833
And I've got these.

162
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,125
Tickets to the bathhouse;

163
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,250
unfortunately,
we don't have one here.

164
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,041
You ladies care to join me?

165
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,625
Aw, yeahhh!
Can we, Mom?

166
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,125
Sure.

167
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,208
You know, I was just talkin'
to Kei from over there.

168
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,000
She said you were
in the women's bath

169
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
claiming to be senile again.

170
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,458
Terribly sorry,
I don't recall, uh.

171
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,458
So...

172
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,750
Bath time.

173
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,791
Damn it, Kei.

174
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,583
Let's get going, you two.

175
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,000
We're right behind ya.

176
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,166
See ya.

177
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,208
Yeah, sure.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,250
Gonna be a long year.

179
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,208
Going down.
Heh.

180
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,666
I've never been
to a bathhouse before!

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,041
I'm excited!

182
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,291
Me too!

183
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,875
Hey!
How you doin' there, big guy?

184
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,875
This is Michael.

185
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,583
He lives on the top floor.

186
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,166
He just got himself an office
job somewhere around here.

187
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,333
Oh, really?

188
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,041
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Michael.

189
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,000
Umm.

190
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,083
We're going to the bathhouse.

191
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,500
Wanna join us, Naomi?

192
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,833
"Nah-OH-mi"!

193
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,708
Yeah, it's what I said.

194
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,375
Naomi is kinda shy
so she goes in the morning

195
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,541
when it's not
as crowded, right?

196
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,333
Right.

197
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,458
Looks like the only resident
we're missing is Tozawa.

198
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,666
Oh yeah, is that the guy
Riko was tellin' me about?

199
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,125
You got it!

200
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,916
He hasn't been home
in a while.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,166
Probably found
a lady friend.

202
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,666
Damn that geezer Nakata.

203
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,208
Bargin' in on me like that.

204
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,291
Oh God, not the cold sweats.

205
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,750
Can we put our clothes
in the same basket?

206
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,750
Go for it, kiddo.

207
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,791
Okay!

208
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,916
Uh, mom.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,416
What is it, Riko?

210
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
It looks like
you've gained some weight.

211
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,375
What?
You think so?

212
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,750
I like my women with
a little meat on their bones.

213
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,541
Yeah, but then I'd have to
walk through the cold air.

214
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,041
My love.

215
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,208
You perverted old man!

216
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
It's so big in here.

217
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,625
Wanna go swimming?

218
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,166
Don't be silly.

219
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,916
Didn't you see
the sign out front?

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,833
It says no swimming allowed.

221
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,541
I know, but that's no fun.

222
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,166
I like this bathhouse, though.

223
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,125
Can we come here every day?

224
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,166
Why not?

225
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,666
Hey, you wanna go
shopping tomorrow?

226
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,541
Yeah! We're gonna need to buy
stuff for the kitchen,

227
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,416
like knives and bowls,
and we need--

228
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,083
No, I meant we should
go shopping for clothes.

229
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,083
You do need
some new clothes mom.

230
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,916
I really think you should
try to dress more ladylike.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,541
Yes, ma'am.
Whatever you say.

232
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,250
Princess Rihoko.

233
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,291
Cut it out, mom!

234
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,583
Prepare yourself
for my shower attack!

235
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,791
So, she has a child.

236
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,875
A daughter?

237
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,750
Yes, that's right.

238
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,333
She's six years old.

239
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,708
Interesting.

240
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,375
That's all I need for now.

241
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,791
You can stop tailing them.

242
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,833
Got it.

243
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,083
Couldn't be.

244
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,583
Need more.

245
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,041
It's not enough.

246
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,583
Honey, I'm home.

247
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,250
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

248
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,208
Man, I'm beat.

249
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,250
No way I was gettin'
any sleep in that place.

250
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,666
Where the hell were ya?

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,541
You don't wanna know,
just make me somethin' to eat.

252
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,875
How do you expect to make
a living doin' what you do now?

253
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,875
You'd make more money
serving Ramen.

254
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,750
Yeah?

255
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,958
Good morning, sir!

256
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,333
Oh.

257
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,000
Didn't think I'd be
seein' you again so soon.

258
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,250
Lemme guess,
still on the run, kid?

259
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,416
My mom and I
moved in here yesterday.

260
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,541
We're neighbors now.

261
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,125
That's nice.

262
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,416
You must be the man
who helped Rihoko.

263
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,250
Thank you so very much.

264
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,541
I'm Masane Amaha, by the way,
I'm Rihoko's mother.

265
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,541
Nice to meet you.

266
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,708
Yeah, likewise, Melony.

267
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,625
What the... Melony?

268
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,791
That's a good one.

269
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,375
'Cause your boobies
are big like melons!

270
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,041
It's the perfect name for ya.

271
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,250
Mel-on-y.

272
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,583
My name is Masane.

273
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
Ma-sa-ne.

274
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Wait! You're that chick

275
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,833
who disappeared
from her jail cell!

276
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,833
I've been lookin'
all over for you!

277
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,291
So hey, ya mind answerin'
a few questions?

278
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,916
Please. Did ya see
anything strange, that night?

279
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,750
I don't think so.

280
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,458
I'm not real sure
what you're askin'.

281
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,541
You know something.

282
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,291
I can tell by the look
on your face.

283
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,583
Tell me, please!

284
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,375
I'm beggin'!

285
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,666
C'mon, lady!
Gimme a lead!

286
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,041
Hands off, jerk!

287
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,541
I already answered
your question.

288
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,541
But...

289
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,208
I didn't see anything.

290
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,666
C'mon Riko,
ready for some shopping?

291
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,083
And you...

292
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,416
you better stop
harassing my mom!

293
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,125
What was all that about?

294
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,458
Somethin' happen at the jail?

295
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,958
That's an understatement.

296
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,666
No wonder you aren't
gettin' any sleep.

297
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,875
What'd you say?

298
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,083
No, no, no!

299
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,166
You got it all wrong, Mari.

300
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,750
Now quit bein' so nosey
and fix me somethin' to eat.

301
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,708
Tadaaa!

302
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,250
Forget it,
I'll pick something.

303
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,166
Wait here for a sec.

304
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,458
I'm sorry but we don't carry
a cup size that large here.

305
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,791
Well, I guess
I'll have to go without one.

306
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,958
No way!

307
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:35,958
They'll sag.

308
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,458
Ooh, can I get this?
Please?

309
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,458
Put it back.

310
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,958
I'm pooped.

311
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,000
I totally forgot
to buy aprons!

312
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,166
I'll be right back.

313
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,875
Where do kids find
all that energy?

314
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,291
Hey there, want some?

315
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,250
Wha-- Whaddaya think
you're doing--

316
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,500
Yusuke Tozawa.

317
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,333
I'm a freelance journalist.

318
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,625
Well, I haven't exactly
been published yet.

319
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,000
But that's why I'm here--

320
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,583
the scoop I'm workin' on's
gonna be my meal ticket.

321
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,125
So why bug me?

322
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,583
I don't have
any "scoop" for you.

323
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,916
'Zat right?

324
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know what that is.

325
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,625
So then you did see it.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,958
You wanna tell me
'bout this monster?

327
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,250
Monster, huh?

328
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,708
C'mon, you were there
that night,

329
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,041
you had to have seen it.

330
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,708
Am I wrong?

331
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,625
How long you gonna play
the quiet game?

332
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,708
C'mon, lady,
throw me a bone 'ere.

333
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,958
I already told you,

334
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,750
I don't know anything.

335
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,583
But hey,
thanks for the coffee.

336
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,583
Melony, wait!

337
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,208
It's Masane!
Get it straight!

338
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,416
My bad.

339
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,541
Now leave me alone
and quit following us!

340
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,916
Hey, Mom!

341
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,083
Is Mr. Tozawa
gonna go shopping with us?

342
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,583
No, I just ran into him!

343
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,750
Funny, huh?

344
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,833
C'mon, let's go.

345
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
I bought us
matching aprons.

346
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,041
Oh yeah?

347
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,166
Does that mean I have to...

348
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,500
This ain't the last
you've seen of me.

349
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,375
So, Director.

350
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,625
Why are you attending
this charity function?

351
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,625
Typically, Doji doesn't send you
to these kinds of events.

352
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,750
I pulled the short straw
at the director's meeting today.

353
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,166
I imagine
you'll be quite popular

354
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,416
with the female stockholders.

355
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,458
Nonsense.

356
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,875
I see.

357
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,166
So you made contact with
the Witchblade's new bearer.

358
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,500
Anything else?

359
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,041
It seems Doji is involved.

360
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,333
Tell me about the woman.

361
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,791
Is she capable
of handling herself?

362
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,791
Honestly, I was
rather unimpressed.

363
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,708
You'll understand why
when you see her in action.

364
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,666
How unfortunate.

365
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,791
I heard another one of
the sisters has gone missing.

366
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,083
Do you think
it was an X-Con again?

367
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,291
Probably so,
although Doji is claiming

368
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,958
it was an accident
the X-Con escaped.

369
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,541
Regardless, I want you
to continue your research

370
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,041
on the Witchblade.

371
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,625
Isn't there a party tonight?

372
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,041
Some charity function?

373
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,208
Yes, sir,

374
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,708
but you are not
scheduled to attend.

375
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,500
No.

376
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,125
I will make an appearance.

377
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,375
Mr. Takayama!

378
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,458
We never see you
at these functions anymore.

379
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,750
It's been a while.

380
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,083
I'd like to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

381
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,875
The President
of FB Pharmaceuticals.

382
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,666
He's created a new hair
re-growth pill

383
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,958
that's bound to
double his stocks.

384
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,958
Riko, we finally have
a place to call our own.

385
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,916
Yes?

386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,125
This is Ota
from the retrieval unit.

387
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,666
We've just spotted an X-Con!

388
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,458
On my way.

389
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,375
I'll be right back.

390
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,375
Mr. Takayama?

391
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,000
Mr. Furumizu
would like to see you.

392
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,583
If you'd like to follow me,
I'll take you--

393
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm his assistant, you'll need
to schedule that with me.

394
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Excuse me?

395
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,500
I'll speak with him.

396
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,875
Director?

397
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,041
I've obtained
a very rare vintage.

398
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,541
Would you care for a glass?

399
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,000
Thank you, but not tonight.

400
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,708
It's been six years.

401
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,583
Six long years

402
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,250
since the Witchblade
disappeared from underneath us.

403
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,708
Your daughter brought about
that course of events.

404
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,791
True, but it's in your
control now, isn't it?

405
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,875
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

406
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,583
Let's stop beating
around the bush, Takayama.

407
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,416
You are aware
that the Cloneblade

408
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,750
and I-Weapon are both products
of our collaboration

409
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,458
six years ago.

410
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,000
The NSWF should have no need
for the Witchblade.

411
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,000
Then you still insist
the gauntlet belongs to you.

412
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,708
Yes.

413
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,458
It is Doji Group property.

414
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,000
It's close.

415
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,583
The Witchblade can
only be worn by one woman.

416
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,791
Furthermore,
it is the Witchblade itself

417
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,291
which chooses its host.

418
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,166
As you may recall,
not long ago,

419
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,541
my daughter was the first
to be selected for this honor.

420
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,041
With all due respect,

421
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,583
the Witchblade has changed
hands many times in the past.

422
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,791
Changing hands.

423
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,750
Is that what you're afraid of?

424
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,750
The reason
you built the X-Cons?

425
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,958
That's a rather extreme
accusation.

426
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,458
Regardless.

427
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,833
The crown will always return
to the head of the deserving.

428
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,916
That may be true...

429
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,875
but only after
the current ruler is slain.

430
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,041
For the first time,
I'm satisfied.

431
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,541
Is that a fact?

432
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,666
Wish I could say the same!

433
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,958
She's really not as powerful
as we thought.

434
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,166
That's because
the host is weak.

435
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,958
Please.
Allow me.

436
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,458
Come on, Witchblade.

437
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,875
Why don't you show me
what you've got!

438
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,583
Are you sure
you can handle it?

439
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,708
No friggin' way!

440
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,625
Melony is the monster!

441
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,416
[Music]

442
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,916
I'm sorry, Riko.

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,375
I know you must be
worried about me.

444
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,333
I want nothing more
than to be home with you.

445
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,458
I'm just so busy with work.

446
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,416
I can't even enjoy myself
on this luxury yacht.

447
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,916
For the record, your cooking
is so much better

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,958
than anything I've had here.

449
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,166
I miss you like crazy,
but I have to make money.

450
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,208
For our future.

451
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,541
Make sure you keep
the doors locked.

452
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,583
I'll be home soon.
