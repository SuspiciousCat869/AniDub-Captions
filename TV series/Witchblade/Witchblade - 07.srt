1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,916
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,791
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,625
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,041
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,041
Righteous Sword of God,
or Hand of the Devil himself?

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,291
A new Bearer finds out,

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,375
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

8
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,416
[Music]

9
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,250
Shiori!

10
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,083
Doctor, I...

11
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,625
Retract your Blade
this instant!

12
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,041
No!

13
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,666
I don't know how it...

14
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,958
I... Doctor!

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,000
Doctor, please help me!

16
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,375
I'm scared - I don't know
what's wrong with me!

17
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,833
Calm down, Shiori, it's okay.

18
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,833
Your body is simply
going through some changes.

19
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,250
Changes?

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,625
Don't worry.

21
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,708
I'll take care of you.

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,041
I... I know you will, Doctor.

23
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,375
Please, you have to believe me,

24
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,000
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,250
I just thought
it might feel nice.

26
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,083
I see.
So that was your reason?

27
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,875
Well, then...

28
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,833
why don't we
discuss this later.

29
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,625
When the time is right.

30
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,916
It felt so good.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,041
I wish I could show you.

32
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,083
Shiori.

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,125
Hey, I'm lookin' for
this cabin cruiser.

34
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,041
Ya seen it?

35
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,041
Can't help ya, dude.

36
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,458
Hey, guys!

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,750
Ya got a minute?

38
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,000
You seen this boat around?

39
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,083
I've seen plenty of cruisers
like this out at sea.

40
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,333
Chances are I've even run
across this one at some point.

41
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,291
But I couldn't tell ya
where I saw it

42
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,625
or where it's docked.

43
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,375
Any information
you can give me would be great.

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,625
Okay.

45
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,625
Well, a boat like this
can go out pretty far,

46
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,541
so it could be anywhere.

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,791
I mean, it's not necessarily
docked here in Tokyo.

48
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,625
You could check
Yokohama or Chiba,

49
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,000
but it may be
even farther out than that.

50
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
It'll be difficult
to track down.

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,041
Just my luck.

52
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,583
Hey, thanks for your help.

53
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,750
Startin' to think I ain't
gonna find this thing on my own.

54
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,125
Yes, come in.

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,125
When were you gonna
tell me about this?

56
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,541
I can't believe you.

57
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,500
You treat me like
I'm the enemy!

58
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,500
Are you working together?

59
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,125
Trying to trick me?

60
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,500
That is that
"Lady" chick, isn't it?

61
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,916
Explain it now,
and make it good.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,166
'Cause if you don't,
I quit doin' your dirty work.

63
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
Fine, whatever you say.

64
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,416
You remember when I told you
that at one time,

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,083
Doji Group Industries
and the NSWF

66
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,625
collaborated to conduct
research on the Witchblade.

67
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,875
And?

68
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,250
During that period,
a young woman

69
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,791
was sent over
from the NSWF to assist us.

70
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,958
You know her as Lady.

71
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,083
On behalf of the NSWF,
I look forward

72
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,250
to the advancement
of our research.

73
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,958
Doctor Reina Soho.

74
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,291
Reiji Takayama.

75
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,291
A pleasure to meet you.

76
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,875
She was a brilliant scientist.

77
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,500
Intelligent, refined,
and beautiful.

78
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Everything about her
was breathtaking.

79
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,625
I was amazed that the NSWF's
Neogene experiments

80
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,000
could produce
such a perfect woman.

81
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,250
So, you really
cared about her, huh?

82
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,875
You make it sound
like a bad movie.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,416
Geez, ya don't have to try and
be so damn macho all the time.

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,750
I just never thought of you
as the type to fall in love.

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,666
I don't know that you'd call
what we had "love."

86
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,708
Huh?

87
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,000
What do you mean?

88
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:35,083
One day she just disappeared
without a trace.

89
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,833
Disappeared?

90
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,875
About the time our research
had reached its climax,

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,958
Reina stole the Witchblade
and ran off.

92
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,416
The Witchblade is gone!

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,125
Could - could it have
been Doctor Soho?

94
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,750
At first, I thought she was
under orders from the NSWF.

95
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,291
But when we contacted them,

96
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,416
they were just as surprised
by her disappearance as I was.

97
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,041
Then why'd she do it?

98
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,958
Reina could be quite arrogant
and selfish at times.

99
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,208
I'm certain she wanted

100
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,500
the Witchblade's power
for herself.

101
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,708
But you told me
the Witchblade itself

102
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,750
had to choose its bearer.

103
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,000
That's correct.

104
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,333
However, Reina
was a suitable host,

105
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,541
and she knew it.

106
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,583
You're kiddin' me.

107
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,791
Something we discovered
during our research.

108
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,791
But the Doji Group
wouldn't hear of allowing

109
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,416
someone from NSWF
to have it.

110
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,333
Much of the staff favored
dropping her from the project.

111
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,125
But before we even
had the chance to talk to her,

112
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,583
Reina and the Witchblade
disappeared.

113
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Betrayed by someone
you trusted.

114
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,541
Trusting each other was
never really our strong suit.

115
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,750
Damn, you two
have a hell of a history.

116
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,375
Father kept the Neogenes
fairly well sheltered.

117
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,333
Romantic feelings
were a new experience for her.

118
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,125
Reina was simply curious.

119
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,416
But how did you
feel about her?

120
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,791
It's all in the past.

121
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,666
She's showing increased
activity in the limbic lobe;

122
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,000
and particularly
in the cortical column.

123
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,708
This activity
directly correlates

124
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,375
to the activation of her Blade.

125
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,750
This must be what's bringing
out the animalistic instincts

126
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,125
and her desire to fight.

127
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,500
It's almost as if the subject
is in some sort of trance.

128
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,583
It's fascinating.

129
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:35,166
I don't wanna wear
this stupid outfit!

130
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,208
Aw, come on, Naomi, you don't
have to be shy around us!

131
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,208
Besides, I think
you look great!

132
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,625
Please come out, Naomi!

133
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,291
It looks really cute!

134
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,541
I don't care!
You guys don't understand,

135
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,375
this is gonna bring me
bad luck for years!

136
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,875
Why'd ya go and make her
put on that crazy get-up?

137
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,458
You know
she's a sensitive young thing.

138
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,083
She woulda been fine
if you hadn't laughed at her.

139
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,750
So it's my fault, huh?

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,250
Hey, Mr. Cho.
What's up?

141
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,833
Don't even bother askin'.

142
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,458
I don't have any money.

143
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Chill, dude!

144
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
I wanna help ya.

145
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,833
Massage parlor.

146
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,166
Lady friends.

147
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,208
Really?

148
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,875
You better not be
pullin' my leg.

149
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,708
So what do ya need, huh?

150
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,375
We got a deal, old man?

151
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,833
You got it, kid!

152
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,500
Well, let's get goin'!

153
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,666
Right this way, young one!

154
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,500
Step into my office.

155
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,875
This is horrible.

156
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,666
I can sense it.

157
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,333
My aura is ruined.

158
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,875
Nice decor.

159
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,708
Hey! Get over here!

160
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,708
I need to scan that photo.

161
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,875
Bring it here.

162
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,666
So...
what do you wanna know?

163
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,208
Oh. Uh...

164
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,791
well, the owner,
and maybe where it's docked?

165
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,166
No prob.

166
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,583
But before I do,
I just wanna make sure

167
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,208
that you're gonna follow up
on your end of the bargain.

168
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,875
Look at this face -
would I lie to you?

169
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,875
I'll call 'em later,
I promise!

170
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,250
Or right now!

171
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,000
This can't be good.

172
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,916
All right.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,041
Let's try to access
the worldwide network

174
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,666
and see if we can
get ya some info.

175
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,291
Check, check, 1, 2.

176
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,416
Anybody out there?

177
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
Mr. Cho! What up, yo?

178
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,541
Not a lot these days!

179
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,125
But I could use your help if--

180
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,708
Wow, Mr. Cho's
a computer genius.

181
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,625
Wow, Mr. Cho's a nerd.

182
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,833
Just as I thought.

183
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,125
It's trying to destroy her.

184
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,625
And it's succeeding.

185
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,833
Right now, Shiori
is no different than an X-Con.

186
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,958
Constantly seeking pleasure.

187
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,000
This can't continue.

188
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
If it does...

189
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,333
In order to fully understand
what's happening to the subject,

190
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,500
I need to run more tests.

191
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,666
It's imperative that we locate
and secure Shiori immediately

192
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,333
so we may obtain
the necessary data.

193
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,416
That's all for now.

194
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,333
Still not satisfied.

195
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,333
I need more.

196
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,791
Yes, her.

197
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,708
She can fill my needs.

198
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,458
Kahlua and milk.

199
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,166
Sorry, it's the only cocktail
I know how to make.

200
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,000
Too sweet.

201
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,791
I guess it's not
your kind of drink.

202
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,833
What're you doing?

203
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, there's an empty spot
on the shelf here -

204
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,041
I'm filling it in.

205
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,791
I'm uh, a little OCD
about stuff like that.

206
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,166
So, if Lady ran off
with the Witchblade

207
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,750
and she was a compatible host,

208
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,291
how did I end up with it?

209
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,916
I don't know the reason.

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,833
All we do know
is that somehow,

211
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,666
during the Great Quake,
the Witchblade chose you.

212
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,583
That day...

213
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,125
we finally got word
of Reina's whereabouts.

214
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,583
Armed with I-Weapons,

215
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,125
we attempted to take back
the Witchblade.

216
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:13,250
But the NSWF had the same idea,
and sent in Cloneblade Sisters.

217
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,375
I'd hoped to avoid
a public confrontation,

218
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,708
but there was too much
on the line.

219
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,208
The outcome was worse
than I could have imagined.

220
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,916
The Witchblade
was supposed to be dormant

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,791
but somehow it awakened.

222
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,541
The resulting power surge
is what caused the Great Quake.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,208
So I just happened to be

224
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,000
in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

225
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,666
As far as we can tell, yes.

226
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,333
Some destiny.
Dumb luck!

227
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,125
Wait a minute, why didn't
Reina bond with the Witchblade

228
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,625
when she had the chance?

229
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,041
I mean, if she had--

230
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,458
Who can say?

231
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,458
At any rate, Reina was allowed
to return to the NSWF

232
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,125
and was given a Cloneblade.

233
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,416
But, wasn't that Father guy
upset with her?

234
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,958
It's quite rare
to find a woman

235
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,750
who's compatible
with the Witchblade.

236
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,958
Even if he was angry,

237
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,250
he'd never let her go
that easily.

238
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,708
Well, this thing
has hardly been a blessing.

239
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,041
Its immense power is a blessing
in and of itself.

240
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,500
Men, always trying
to rationalize!

241
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,958
Wearing this thing
scares the hell outta me.

242
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,708
And you'll never understand.

243
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,583
Director?

244
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,666
30 minutes 'til we reach
the Marina.

245
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,708
Thank you.

246
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
It'll be nice to get home.

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,666
Damn straight.

248
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,916
S'felt like forever.

249
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,916
Gotta hand it to ol' Cho
and his buddies.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,083
Can't believe they found it
in just 10 minutes!

251
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,500
Ashina Marina, huh?

252
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,833
Well, all right.

253
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
Now all I gotta do
is try and figure out

254
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
who owns that damn boat.

255
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,375
And then what?

256
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,375
Whoa!
What're you doin' here?

257
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,166
Figured you were after
my mom again, Don Juan!

258
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,291
Wait, what did you
just call me?

259
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,208
Listen, kiddo,
I'm not chasing after your ma.

260
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,375
Well, I'm gonna keep
an eye on you just in case.

261
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,833
No way! No kids!

262
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,083
Too bad.
'Cause I'm not leavin'!

263
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,083
Gimme a break!

264
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,500
Man, I've gotta be
somewhere right now!

265
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,750
Just give it up.

266
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,958
My mom is so not into
loser guys like you.

267
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,083
Ya got it all wrong!

268
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,958
I told ya, I'm not into her!

269
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,208
Whatever you say.

270
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,125
Now, can we go?

271
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
All right, fine!

272
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,125
Have it your way!

273
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
It must be close.

274
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,625
I can sense its presence.

275
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,291
But this feeling is different.

276
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,250
I've got to hurry.

277
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,875
Now, before I lose my patience,
tell me where she is!

278
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,083
Sorry to keep you waiting.

279
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:18,916
Miss me?

280
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,375
I need your power.

281
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,916
Satisfy me.

282
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,958
Director,
we have to do something!

283
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,708
Masane is still recovering
from--

284
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,958
Back her up!

285
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,000
Right!

286
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,458
This is what I want.

287
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,708
Finally.

288
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,583
Takayama.

289
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,333
Reiji.

290
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,041
The Doctor's lover.

291
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,041
Your fight is with me!

292
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,041
Come on!

293
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,458
Sorry, not feeling it.

294
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,958
You just don't
do it for me anymore.

295
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,625
Kind of disappointing.

296
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,833
Director!

297
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,166
You can't escape.

298
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,250
Please.

299
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,041
I'm begging you.

300
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,000
What the hell?

301
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,416
It's all over.

302
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,000
Where is she?

303
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,583
I was told
Shiori came to see you.

304
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,333
She did.

305
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,583
Director?

306
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,208
What should I do
with the Cloneblade?

307
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,125
My God, that's...

308
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,291
I see, I'm too late.

309
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,833
Please,
I'd like to examine the body.

310
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
There is no body.

311
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,041
That's impossible!

312
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,583
This is all that's left.

313
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,083
She crystallized,
then disintegrated.

314
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,000
May I take her remains
back with me?

315
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,083
Take this.

316
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,000
We're not handing
over anything else.

317
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,333
But Shiori was my assistant!

318
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,125
And?

319
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,041
Give it to me.

320
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,291
Hi, Mom!

321
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,083
Riko!

322
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,833
What are you doing here?

323
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,250
Did I surprise you?

324
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
I came with Mr. Tozawa!

325
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,125
Tozawa's here too?

326
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,250
Hey. What's up?

327
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,541
Okay, what do you want?

328
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,666
So, is that the guy
who owns the cruiser?

329
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,375
Introduce me, will ya?

330
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,000
Just so you know, I saw
what happened on that overpass.

331
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
Whatever.

332
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,666
We're not having
this discussion here.

333
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,666
Now, will you please
just take Riko and me home.

334
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,666
Fine, f'you say so.

335
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,083
We'll talk later.

336
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,083
That little girl.

337
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,958
Reiji, listen.

338
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,041
Shiori's death
was caused by the unstable power

339
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,583
of her Cloneblade.

340
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,666
As I assumed.

341
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,125
If I'm not careful,
I could end up like her someday.

342
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
But don't forget,
the same applies

343
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,333
to the Witchblade itself.

344
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,791
After all, the Cloneblade

345
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,208
is nothing more than a copy
of the original artifact.

346
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,000
You and I stumbled across
ancient data

347
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,166
during our research years ago.

348
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,125
Do you remember it?

349
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,250
How could I forget?

350
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,250
As the Witchblade's power
increases,

351
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,125
so too does the risk
of its host being consumed.

352
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,583
But we had no way
to test the theory.

353
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,333
I think Shiori's death
is proof enough.

354
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,125
Eventually, the Witchblade
will consume its host.

355
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,583
Reiji, the Witchblade
will not let go of that woman.

356
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,625
Not until she is dead.

357
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,541
I only wonder which one's
going to break first.

358
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,208
In any case, I'll be keeping
a lower profile from now on.

359
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,625
[Music]

360
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,750
I gotta say, Riko,
you were right all along!

361
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,333
It looks like Tozawa
really is after me.

362
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,583
Only in a different way
than you're thinking.

363
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,500
Man, that guy's a creep!

364
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,041
He's tryin' to sell a photo
I don't want anyone to see!

365
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,250
Can you believe him?

366
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,250
Why can't he
just leave me alone?

367
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,708
See if I'm ever nice
to that jerk again.

368
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,291
You know, Mariko told me

369
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,416
he actually used to be
a decent photographer.

370
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,833
Maybe so.

371
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,208
But I find it hard to believe
"Tozawa" and "decent"

372
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,000
could ever be used
in the same sentence.
