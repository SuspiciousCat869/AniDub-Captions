1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,833
Long sought
by the greed of men,

2
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,541
but bestowed
only upon the women

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,625
whose fate
it forever scars.

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,041
The Witchblade.

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,750
Righteous Sword of God,
or Hand of the Devil himself?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,083
A new Bearer finds out,

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,541
seeking balance between
ecstasy and ruin.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,333
[Music]

9
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,250
Wha-- Who?

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,541
I have a request.

11
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,291
Repeat after me.

12
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,375
I need to hear you say it.

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,833
"Star light, star bright,

14
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,125
let my love
quicken your heart tonight!"

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,916
Will you please say it?

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,208
That's all I'm asking.

17
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,083
What's the matter, Miss?

18
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,916
Can't you just say it once?

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,291
"Star light, star bright,

20
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,750
let my love
quicken your heart tonight!"

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,166
What the hell is this!

22
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,208
What kind of
crazy pervert are you?

23
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,083
Please, Miss.
Hurry and say it.

24
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,750
Say it!

25
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,000
Not again!

26
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,250
No, please.

27
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,583
No more!

28
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,791
Nooooo!

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Dammit!

30
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,875
We've got three homicides
in a row!

31
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,291
And they're all young women

32
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,750
that are completely
unrelated to the NSWF.

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,666
What the hell's goin' on here?

34
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,166
Yeah, seriously.

35
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,666
Tozawa!

36
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
Stay right there!

37
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,416
I'm done playin',
you damn hyena!

38
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,250
Time to go.

39
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
Hey, if you're lookin'
for someone to blame here,

40
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,375
how 'bout, like,
the killer?

41
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,875
Assuming you can find 'im,
of course!

42
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,833
You! Good point.

43
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,708
All right!

44
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,541
Another toast, boys!

45
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,000
Cheers!

46
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,958
You sure can toss 'em back,
Melony!

47
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,541
I don't know
if I can keep up wit ya!

48
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, Tozawa!

49
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
Come have a drink with us!

50
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
We're celebratin'!
Join us!

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,791
Michael got a job today -

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,791
first one he's had
since he moved in!

53
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,208
You got a job, huh?

54
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,250
Doin' what?

55
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,500
I see it.

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,041
There's a dark shadow
hanging over Michael's head.

57
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,458
Sorry, guys,
I'll have to take a rain check.

58
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,583
Been so busy lately
I need some rest.

59
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,375
Oh, n-no!

60
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,416
Don't you run out on me, jerk!

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,291
Uh! S'cuse me?

62
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,166
I thought we were gonna be
working together as a team.

63
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,583
You better not
leave me in the dark!

64
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,875
Nuh! No.

65
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,166
It's not like that.

66
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,583
Oh! Now I get it!

67
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,958
You're afraid of me.

68
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,833
You saw me lookin' like that
and you can't handle it.

69
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,875
Please.
I'm not afraid of you.

70
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:27,916
Ooh! What'd you see?

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,416
Did one of 'em pop out?

72
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,666
Hey!
You wanna see?

73
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,125
Ha-hah!
This is awesome.

74
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,958
Hey, quit it!

75
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,500
Melony!
Take it easy!

76
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,375
Mom, don't you think
you've had enough already?

77
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,208
I think you should
call it a night.

78
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,416
Oh, Mom!

79
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,625
So, what did you see, kid?

80
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,416
Uh, it was this.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,791
Yeah, I saw her pass out.

82
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,166
Oh, she does this a lot?

83
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,083
Hey, Mom,
do you want some water?

84
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,041
No, I'm fine.

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,125
Riko.
Gimme a kiss.

86
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,583
Wow, you're really drunk.

87
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,541
Okay kiddo,
make sure and tell your ma

88
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,083
we're getting back to work
first thing tomorrow morning.

89
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,375
Ok, fine.

90
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,458
I'll make sure and tell her,
Mr. Tozawa,

91
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,875
but you remember,
I'm keeping my eye on you.

92
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,208
Whatever you say.

93
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,708
Look at me!

94
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,625
I'm riding a whale!

95
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,958
It's Mr. Whale!

96
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,333
Oh honey, are you all right?

97
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,666
Everything's gonna be okay.

98
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,208
Please don't cry.

99
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,333
Excuse me.

100
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,541
More coffee, please.

101
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,000
No problem, ma'am.

102
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,416
Ugh, my achin' head.

103
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,666
I don't doubt it.

104
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,250
You do realize
you're on your 15th cup.

105
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,000
Have you even been
listening to me?

106
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,875
Yeah, of course I have!

107
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,916
What were we
talkin' about, again?

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,208
We were talking about
the recent murders.

109
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,041
There've been
three victims so far.

110
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,625
Now we know the second one
had a guy with her.

111
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,375
But for some reason,
he was left unharmed.

112
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,166
Which means there's a witness
we can talk to.

113
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,291
You think the killer is--

114
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,583
Sure looks that way.

115
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,708
But let's see what this guy
has to say first.

116
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,291
What was it?

117
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
I felt something different.

118
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,458
But what?

119
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,166
So how's it taste?

120
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,833
This is the first time I've ever
tried making my own white sauce.

121
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,791
Oh! It's delicious!

122
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,250
Like there's a flavor party
in my mouth!

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,750
Well, there's still plenty left

124
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,833
so you guys can have
as much as you want!

125
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,916
Somethin' wrong,
Rihoko, darlin'?

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
A sale's about to start
at the market!

127
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,125
I gotta go!

128
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,583
So it was 11:45 PM?

129
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,250
You're absolutely
sure about that?

130
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,500
Yes. I remember
checking my watch

131
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,666
to see if we could still catch
the late-night bus home.

132
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,166
But then--

133
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,250
You saw the killer's face,
didn't you?

134
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,250
I did.

135
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,083
I can never forget that face.

136
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,750
Never.

137
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,208
That's all I ask.

138
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,916
Please just say it.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,833
I need to hear it.

140
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,583
"Star light, star bright,

141
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,166
let my love quicken your heart
tonight!"

142
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,375
It wasn't human!

143
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,541
That thing.

144
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,916
It wasn't human!

145
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,041
What does that even mean?

146
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,291
"Star light, star bright,

147
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,625
let my love quicken your heart
tonight!"

148
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,791
I got no clue.

149
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,333
And that's not the only thing
that's buggin' me.

150
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,583
Yeah?

151
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,541
Yeah, the time of the attacks,
11:45 at night.

152
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,583
All three were killed
at the same time.

153
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,333
Got any ideas?

154
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,875
That is weird.

155
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,666
Could it be a coincidence?

156
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,958
Wow!
Paprika's pretty cheap!

157
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,833
You know,
I always run into you.

158
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,125
Tell me something.

159
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,583
Do you always go
shopping by yourself?

160
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,208
Where's your mom?

161
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,041
Well, she's been kind of busy
with her work lately.

162
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,166
So, you like your mother,
right?

163
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,791
And why is that?

164
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,625
Duh!
Why wouldn't I like my mom?

165
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,083
She's family!

166
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,375
Um, I gotta go.

167
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,708
My street is this way.

168
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,500
Good to see you.

169
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,833
Bye-bye!

170
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,625
Oh!

171
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,291
Thank you so much, Mister!

172
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,666
No!

173
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,666
Please, wait!

174
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,041
This feeling.

175
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,000
It's different.

176
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,041
What is it?

177
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,250
What is it?

178
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,250
Mister,
is there something wrong?

179
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,458
It's incredible.

180
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,416
No, I'm fine.

181
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,041
Would you like to
have a cracker?

182
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
Sump'm wrong?

183
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,041
It's nothin'.

184
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,125
I'm fine.

185
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,041
Not to be nosey,
but is that all

186
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,125
you're gonna have
for lunch, Mister?

187
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,333
Yes.
Why do you ask?

188
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,791
Don't ya have
a girlfriend or someone

189
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,875
who can make your lunch?

190
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,791
Well, I guess
I could ask my girlfriend,

191
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,625
but I hardly get to see her
anymore.

192
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,625
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately,

193
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,500
and I think
I may buy a house.

194
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,250
If I did, then she and I
could live together.

195
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,458
Then I would be
able to see her everyday

196
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,541
and she wouldn't have to be
lonely ever again.

197
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,500
Wow! A house?

198
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,208
I would love to live in a house.

199
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,958
I hope my mom and I
can get one someday.

200
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,541
Hey, have you thought about

201
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,708
what you want your house
to look like?

202
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,791
It's got a big living room
with hardwood floors.

203
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,375
It should have a fireplace
right here.

204
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,083
Y'know, so we can relax
in front of it

205
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,750
after we have our dinner.

206
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,083
That's nice.

207
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,333
You like your girlfriend a lot.
Don't ya, Mister?

208
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,875
I'm very lucky.

209
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,916
She's incredibly beautiful.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,500
And she's the nicest girl
I've ever met.

211
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,500
No one could ever
compare to her.

212
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,166
That means my break time's over.

213
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,458
Sorry, but I have to
get back to work now.

214
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,375
Mister,
you gonna be here tomorrow?

215
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,875
Yep, every afternoon.

216
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,458
In that case,
let's meet up tomorrow

217
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,583
and I'll bring you lunch!

218
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,208
That sounds great, thank you!

219
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,083
Director Takayama,

220
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,250
would you care to explain
why you have ignored

221
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,333
our repeated requests
for a progress report?

222
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,083
I believe we deserve
an explanation.

223
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,916
You're well aware
that the Special Section's work

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,375
is top-secret.

225
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,750
And must remain so to keep
sensitive information

226
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,541
from being leaked.

227
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,875
While quoting corporate policy
may provide you

228
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,458
a convenient excuse,

229
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,333
if you cannot prove your
section is obtaining results,

230
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,750
while it bleeds
the company's coffers dry;

231
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,375
its very existence
must be called into question.

232
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,083
Come now,
can't you give us anything?

233
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,708
We're not exaggerating
when we say

234
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,125
this company's future
depends on the Witchblade.

235
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,333
Let me put it this way.

236
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,125
We have uncovered
a veritable treasure chest.

237
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,291
All we need do is open it.

238
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,791
Why can't you be
any more specific, Takayama?

239
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,541
Because I have
yet to look inside, Wado.

240
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,500
I would hate to disappoint
you gentlemen if our findings

241
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,208
are less than stellar.

242
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,958
Another lame excuse.

243
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,666
I realize the boardroom is
no place to bring up the past,

244
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,541
but I feel it should be noted
that back in college,

245
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,333
when Takayama and I were
in the rowing club together,

246
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,125
he was always
in the position behind me.

247
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,458
He stared at my back
the entire time.

248
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,041
That may be.

249
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,375
But when rowing,
competitors face backwards.

250
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,583
In other words, Wado,

251
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,250
I was always closer
to the goal than you.

252
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,916
I was referring to rowing.

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,208
And nothing further.

254
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,750
All of these more recent murders
have taken place

255
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,250
near this radio station.

256
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,541
And they all happened
at exactly 11:45.

257
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,375
So unless it's all
one big coincidence,

258
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,000
we should see him soon.

259
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,208
Yeah, right.

260
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,583
Hey! Melony!

261
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,666
No! Get back!

262
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,666
What the hell are you!

263
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,041
Please Miss,
just say it once.

264
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,916
"Star light, star bright,

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,791
let my love quicken your heart
tonight!"

266
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,333
Hurry, run!
Go on, get outta here!

267
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,458
All righty.

268
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
Now that we know
who we're dealin' with,

269
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,041
we can find all the info
we need on him right here!

270
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,416
Is this legal?

271
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,208
I woulda thought the Police
Database was off limits.

272
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,458
This article.

273
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,541
"Honorable death
in the line of duty."

274
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,083
He was a cop?

275
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,375
It's dated the year
before the Great Quake.

276
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,208
Tozawa!

277
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,375
You've got some real stones.

278
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,375
You think you can just waltz
right into my station house?

279
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,166
Come to get your ass kicked,
huh? Huh?

280
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,000
Whoa, whoa, chill out!

281
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,625
Last time I checked,
the general public

282
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,375
was welcome
at all police stations.

283
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,916
The "general public" refers
to honest, upright citizens!

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,583
Not the likes of--

285
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,041
That's Muraki.

286
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,041
Muraki?

287
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,541
All right, you bastard!

288
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,041
What's the meaning of this?

289
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,750
Well, sir, you know
all those unsolved murders?

290
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,875
He's the guy behind 'em all.

291
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,416
Like hell he is!

292
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,458
You better tell me
what you're up to right now!

293
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,250
C'mon! Spill!

294
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,333
Easy, big guy!

295
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,416
There's no reason
for you to freak!

296
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,958
And now the kitchen.

297
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Custom designed just for her.

298
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,958
My girlfriend
is an amazing cook.

299
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,458
And there.

300
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,291
So, who makes a better lunch,
me or your girlfriend?

301
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,291
Ah, good question.

302
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,625
I'd say you're
both equally good.

303
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,541
Oh no, looks like it's time
to get back to work.

304
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,250
Well, I'll be back tomorrow
with another lunch for you!

305
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,833
You haven't finished
drawing your house yet

306
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,166
and I wanna see it!

307
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,791
How is this even possible?

308
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,333
How can a dead man
go on a killing spree?

309
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,541
Maybe the killer
just looks a lot like him.

310
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,166
Mom!

311
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,166
Hey, you!

312
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,083
Guess what?
I made a new friend!

313
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,666
He's really cool!

314
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,625
You met a boy?

315
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,000
That's great!

316
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,375
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call him a "boy".

317
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,958
He's real nice!
I even made lunch for him.

318
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,416
Yeah? Then you'll have to
introduce me to him someday.

319
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,875
Yeah!
So, how's work going?

320
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,750
You guys figure it out yet?

321
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,291
No, no luck yet.

322
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,833
But a bunch of the same clues
keep poppin' up.

323
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,916
Like this phrase
we keep hearing:

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,291
"Star light, star bright.

325
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,583
Let my love quicken your heart
tonight."

326
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,750
Hey, now that brings back
memories!

327
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,916
"Sakura's Twinkle Date"!

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was a huge fan
of that radio show,

329
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,625
I listened all the time.

330
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,625
Radio?

331
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,666
It was the best show
on the air.

332
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,916
Every night, 11:45.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,083
S-A-K-U-R-A--

334
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,541
Wait, it aired at 11:45?

335
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,750
S-A-K-U-R-A,
Sakura! Sakura.

336
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,416
Dah! Detective Nakata!

337
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,250
Look, I'm sorry I got
so worked up earlier.

338
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,791
But what you're tryin'
to do here is just wrong.

339
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,416
What're ya talkin' about?

340
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,375
Don't play dumb!

341
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,166
I know what you're up to!

342
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,416
You wanna expose the cover-up
we did on Muraki's death.

343
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,833
Well, that's never
gonna happen!

344
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,166
So just give it up!

345
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,166
Just leave it in the past.

346
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,500
What?

347
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:53,041
Yusuke, I'm askin' you,
please, let this go.

348
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,541
Muraki was
one of my best officers.

349
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,250
He was a devoted cop,
and sincere to a fault.

350
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,000
But that ethic
led him to suicide.

351
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,250
I lied and said
he died in the line of duty,

352
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,833
to preserve his honor.

353
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,500
What! Suicide?

354
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,958
Are you serious?

355
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,458
I told ya to quit
playin' dumb with me!

356
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,083
Sir, do you know if Muraki
was a fan of a radio show?

357
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,708
It was called,
"Sakura's Twinkle Date".

358
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,125
Damn, where the hell'd you
get all your information?

359
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,416
Muraki told us
he was trying to protect

360
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,291
some radio DJ named Sakura
from a dangerous fan.

361
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,375
But somehow
it backfired on him

362
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,791
and he wound up
being sued for stalking her.

363
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,083
And that's when...

364
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,541
Well, you know how it ends.

365
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,083
He was a victim
of his own emotions.

366
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,208
Then I heard
that Sakura girl was killed

367
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,125
during the Great Quake.

368
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,583
After talking to Nakata,

369
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,625
I'd say
there's no doubt about it.

370
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,333
Yeah, the person responsible
for these murders

371
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,375
has to be
the deceased Officer Muraki.

372
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,625
But why is someone
who's supposed to be dead...

373
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,958
I dunno.

374
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,416
All I do know is
there's gotta be

375
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,166
one helluva secret
bein' kept under wraps.

376
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,125
Our best bet now is to
try to talk to Muraki himself.

377
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,250
Please no more.

378
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,000
Make it stop!

379
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,416
I can't take any more of this!

380
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,875
Well, that's convenient.

381
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,833
What the hell are you?

382
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,250
What are you doing here?

383
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,958
I never should have
come back to life!

384
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,458
Please, set me free!

385
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,250
Destroy this cursed body!

386
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,791
Please!

387
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,166
I don't understand.

388
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,291
Is that what I...

389
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,708
Oh, God.

390
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,375
What the hell are they?

391
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
What are the X-Cons?

392
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,416
Maybe he's runnin' late.

393
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,625
Riko!

394
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, hi, Mom!

395
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,583
What's the matter?

396
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,625
Your friend couldn't make it?

397
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,375
I guess not because
he's never been late like this.

398
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,416
He's probably really busy
with work or something.

399
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,208
Yeah.

400
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,708
Hey, you want me
to walk you home now?

401
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,791
[Music]

402
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,958
What do I do?

403
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:34,250
All of a sudden,
I have to go to a stupid party!

404
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,666
And with Takayama,
of all people!

405
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,291
Yuck!

406
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,916
I bet it'll be nothing but
a bunch of high-class snobs.

407
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,875
How boring!

408
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,583
I'm no good
at that kinda stuff.

409
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,958
I can't make small-talk!

410
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,791
I'd rather be drinkin'
with everyone at Mariko's!

411
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,833
Man, I wanna go home!

412
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,875
Let's hit the baths
as soon I get back, okay?
