1
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,583
[Music]

2
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,833
Now look at these shots
we're getting

3
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,416
and you see what we're
dealing with: I-Weapons!

4
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,416
Hordes of I-Weapons,
descending on Tokyo!

5
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,333
We have enough room
for all of you!

6
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,583
Let the children
and the elderly through first!

7
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,625
Please, people!

8
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,666
The thoroughfare is blocked!

9
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,625
Do not attempt
to evacuate by car!

10
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,708
Are we sure there's really
any need for all this?

11
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,916
The whole city's empty.

12
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,541
We better hurry.

13
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,625
Yeah.

14
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,833
Hey! What're you all
still doing here?

15
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,333
The I-Weapons
are comin'--

16
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,875
Tozawa!

17
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
What're you idiots up to?

18
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,708
Don't you know there's reports
of an X-Con in this area?

19
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,166
Y'gotta be more careful.

20
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,958
Dammit.

21
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,583
I-Weapons this, X-Cons that.

22
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,875
Tokyo's full o' monsters!

23
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,375
You're wrong.

24
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,333
She ain't a monster, Nakata.

25
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,833
Huh?

26
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,166
I said, she ain't
no friggin' monster!

27
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,583
Tozawa!

28
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,083
I'd ask
what you're talkin' about,

29
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,250
but I don't care,
just get movin'!

30
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,708
There's somethin'
I gotta go do.

31
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,958
Take care of Rihoko.

32
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,083
Tozawa!

33
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,708
Dammit!

34
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,458
I can't let this end with her
being treated like a monster!

35
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,291
It's overflowing.

36
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,083
Something inside me--
it's incredible!

37
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,958
The Witchblade.

38
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,041
It's close!

39
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,666
Miss Maria...

40
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,458
I'm gonna go
way out on a limb here,

41
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,333
and guess
that's who's after us.

42
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,333
It appears so.

43
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,416
These pathetic little things
dare to get in my way.

44
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,791
I will not allow it!

45
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,958
Neither will we!

46
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,083
High-strung much?

47
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,625
Maria!

48
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,416
Where'd she go?

49
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,125
Chief Nishida!

50
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,125
Ah, ma'am!
Maria's gone!

51
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,458
She took Aoi and Asagi
to fight the I-Weapons!

52
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,750
I see.

53
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,291
So they are drawn
toward each other.

54
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,375
Go!

55
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,166
Get the car--
and ready the equipment!

56
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,333
Yes, ma'am!

57
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,958
Such a rare opportunity!

58
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,166
And flames, everywhere,
climbing into the night sky!

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,625
Now, can you folks see this?

60
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,333
A number of rogue I-Weapons,
clashing with an X-Con.

61
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,166
And neither side shows
any signs of surrender!

62
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,541
Oh! There!

63
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,583
A clear shot of the X-Con!

64
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,666
And now, coming in
at Number Three--

65
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,875
What the hell you think
you're doing, old man?

66
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,250
Hey, I'm a big fan o' hers,
I never miss an episo--

67
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,166
Frickin' dumbass,
turn it back!

68
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Oh my!

69
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,458
Another explosion!

70
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,375
Huge flames continue to
rise from the street!

71
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,041
Columns of fire, spiraling up
one after another!

72
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,291
How long will these
I-Weapons and this X-Con

73
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,208
continue to run amok?

74
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,250
Mom.

75
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,250
It's burning up.

76
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,708
My body.

77
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm burning!

78
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,625
Well, we know where it is.

79
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,958
Time to get moving!

80
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,041
Right!

81
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,666
Yeah, okay,
but what're you gonna do

82
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,083
once you've gotten it?

83
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,416
"Do?"

84
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,916
Well, yeah.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,916
Power is only a means,
not an end, right?

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,250
Ask yourself
what you really want, Maria.

87
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,125
Asagi!

88
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,333
You're being rude!

89
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,333
God, I was just askin'.

90
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,708
Let's go.

91
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,875
I like breaking stuff.

92
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,833
Ask yourself
what you really want, Maria.

93
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,791
Yeah, fine!

94
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,000
Whatever, just find out
what happened in there!

95
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,208
We're not a newspaper,

96
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,708
you don't have to
report to me in real-time!

97
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,291
Just stick close to Doji!

98
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,166
Now get on it!

99
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,708
Okay.

100
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,041
What's up?

101
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,958
Got a great scoop for ya.

102
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,166
Sorry.

103
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,458
If it's not about an X-Con,
I don't need it.

104
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,708
It's bigger than that.

105
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,875
Content guaranteed.

106
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,541
But I need your help
on this one--

107
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,500
for a friend.

108
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,500
The X-Con is on the move!

109
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,750
The battlefield keeps changing,
but the fighting continues!

110
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,375
Where's Rihoko?

111
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,500
I thought she went to
the restroom with you.

112
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,666
Not with me.

113
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,083
She musta gone after Melony!

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,416
Hold up!
Where are you going?

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,625
A little girl is missing!

116
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,916
Have y'seen her?

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A little girl?

118
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,375
Yes!

119
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,916
We got this!

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,833
Now you folks get back inside
where it's safe, while we--

121
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,083
Screw leaving it to you guys!

122
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,833
Rihoko!

123
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,875
Wait!
It's not safe out there!

124
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,791
You're obstructing
police duties!

125
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,875
Then get out of our way!

126
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,125
Our Masane, really?

127
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,458
You've sat on it
for so long.

129
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,250
Yeah, well, what good is
sittin' on it gonna do me now?

130
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,125
Good point.

131
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,583
How many have we got left?

132
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,791
Fifty-six.

133
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,666
Strike that, make it 52.

134
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,375
The next wave of I-Weapons
is about to make landfall.

135
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,916
Rough count, 800.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,458
Against our 50?
We're screwed.

137
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,500
Sir, it's no use!
Let's pull back!

138
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,916
No.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,583
Ota, have our remaining
I-Weapons rush the enemy!

140
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,083
Take out as many as we can!

141
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,291
Yes, sir!

142
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,333
At last, I've found it.

143
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,458
The Witchblade.

144
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll take it now.

145
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,166
I'm a little busy
at the moment.

146
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,666
But taking you on
does sound like fun.

147
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,875
Pull over!

148
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,750
Doctor!

149
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,750
We're not safe here!

150
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,791
Do not move this car.

151
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,458
We'll never get
another chance like this!

152
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,291
This is madness!

153
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,125
Oh, Mom.

154
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, yeah!

155
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,000
Thirteen--

156
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,000
Twelve--

157
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,000
Eleven--

158
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,000
Ten--

159
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,000
Nine--

160
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,083
Eight--

161
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,083
Seven--

162
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,083
Six--

163
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,083
Five--

164
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,083
Four--

165
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,083
Three--

166
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,083
Two--

167
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,125
One--

168
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,708
All units have self-destructed.

169
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,583
Opposing I-Weapons sustained
25 percent damage, sir!

170
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,166
They're proceeding as before.

171
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,583
North-northwest.

172
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,875
Approximately 550 units.

173
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,875
So, this is it.

174
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,125
Hi!

175
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,375
What're--

176
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,291
Hello?

177
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm sorry for calling you.

178
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,500
But um,
I'm looking for my mom,

179
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,375
do you know where she is!

180
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,625
What?

181
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,625
You know,
where she's fighting.

182
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,916
Where is she?

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,875
You don't want to go there?

184
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,291
Rihoko!

185
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,583
Don't do anything foolish!

186
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,375
Do you know
how dangerous it is?

187
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,625
You absolutely cannot go!

188
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,666
Where are you now!

189
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,583
Is anyone with you?

190
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,041
Are you outside?

191
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,000
No, go back!

192
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,041
Rihoko!

193
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,083
Rihoko!

194
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,083
Rihoko!

195
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:18,916
Ri--!

196
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,875
Godspeed, Takayama.

197
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,958
Please...

198
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,166
Please be okay.

199
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,708
What happened
to all your vigor?

200
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,000
Thought you could go
all night.

201
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm just gettin' started!

202
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
What?

203
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,958
You're already breaking up.

204
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,458
That may be so.

205
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,125
But I gotta tell ya,
it feels incredible!

206
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,166
Oh yeah.

207
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,541
How was that for you?

208
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,458
Muh-Miss Mariaaaa!

209
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,041
Damn you!

210
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,833
Damn you!

211
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,708
You stupid, filthy nothing!

212
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,875
Damn you!

213
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,208
Aoi!

214
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,416
Awww.

215
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,916
Couldn't keep herself
together.

216
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,416
Aoi.

217
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,833
Miss Maria...

218
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,000
It's all right.

219
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,875
Please go on.

220
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,416
Finish what you started.

221
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,875
Take the Witchblade.

222
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,416
You're the one most worthy.

223
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,958
So once you've taken it...

224
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,666
what are you planning
to do with it?

225
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,625
The tough girl act
doesn't fool me.

226
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,958
I can feel you.

227
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,166
You're empty too.

228
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,708
Enough!

229
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,125
What I seek
is for me and me alone!

230
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,541
No!

231
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,833
This girl is as savage

232
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,666
as the Witchblade
and the I-Weapons.

233
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,125
I can't leave it
for Riko to deal with.

234
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,666
Only one choice.

235
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,500
Take her with me.

236
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

237
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,041
That seems appropriate.

238
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,458
Damn it!

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,916
Mommy!

240
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,500
What am I seeing?

241
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,666
This is beyond incredible!

242
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,333
It could level
all of Tokyo if--

243
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,958
That's right,
over here, guys!

244
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,000
Focus on me!

245
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,375
All that power,
and you use it for this.

246
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,833
It's incomprehensible.

247
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,958
Yeah.

248
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,791
I bet it would be, for you.

249
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,541
Not that it really matters.

250
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,458
I don't need to comprehend,
I just need the Witchblade!

251
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,750
No chance!
I won't allow it!

252
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,208
Up there, of course!

253
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,958
I don't know if you can tell
what you're seeing here.

254
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,708
But literally
hundreds of I-Weapons

255
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,000
have converged
upon Tokyo Tower!

256
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,208
Meanwhile, the figure

257
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
previously reported
to be an X-Con

258
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,208
appears to be fighting
atop the tower!

259
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,041
The other combatant
is a so-called "Neo-Gene"

260
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,583
created by the world-famous
welfare group, NSWF!

261
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,791
But, ladies and gentlemen,
we have exclusive breaking news.

262
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,458
These bizarre figures
are not monsters or machines!

263
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,000
They're human beings!

264
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,791
Additionally, we've learned
that the "Neo-Genes,"

265
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,875
also known as the "Sisters,"

266
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,916
were created by
the NSWF's Mr. Furumizu

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,041
through a process of
bio-technology and inbreeding!

268
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,000
We've also received evidence
that the I-Weapons

269
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,708
are in fact constructed
by Doji Industries,

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,916
using the bodies
of the deceased.

271
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,416
Detailed investigations
of these reports are expected.

272
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,208
Row, row, row your boat!

273
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,416
Good, Takayama!

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,333
This monster, previously
thought to be an X-Con--

275
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,500
No! Stop right there!

276
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,125
Don't say that!

277
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,625
She's not a monster!

278
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
She's a real person.

279
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,000
A mother,
with people who love her!

280
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,625
Admit it,
you're beaten!

281
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,333
Just hand over the Witchblade!

282
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,000
It belongs to me!

283
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,666
I deserve it!

284
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,875
Once it's mine, I'll--

285
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,666
You'll do what, Maria?

286
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,125
Mom.

287
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,750
I see.

288
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,875
That's all you really wanted.

289
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,291
A mother's love.

290
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,041
Tell me, Mom.

291
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,333
Tell me you love me.

292
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,791
A mother's love.

293
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,583
Is that it?

294
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,875
What all of you are--?

295
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,375
All right, then.

296
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,875
I suppose it's for the best.

297
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,041
Mommy!

298
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
Riko.

299
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,708
I will always be
by your side.

300
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,000
But this life...

301
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,625
this isn't where
you're supposed to be.

302
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,875
It's there.

303
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,458
Right beside you.

304
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,458
Rihoko!

305
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,125
Oh, thank God!

306
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,791
Mister Reiji.

307
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:25,916
It's Mom, she's--

308
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,541
Riko.

309
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,416
[Music]

310
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,208
Mom...
