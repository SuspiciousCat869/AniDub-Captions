1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,440
‐ [Narrator] Everyone
returned to the Nadesico.

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,059
As had I, they all realized
that this was their place to be.

3
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,359
We should’ve known that
from the beginning,

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,191
but instead we had to think
about it long and hard

5
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,027
until the truth came up
and hit us in the face.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,663
What can I say,
we’re all idiots.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,197
(upbeat trumpet music)

8
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,053
‐ I sure hope this was
the right thing to do.

9
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,967
‐ You can’t have doubts Eurika.

10
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,386
‐ We’ve got to believe that we
can bring an end to this war.

11
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,645
‐ That’s right.

12
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,188
If we asked for
both sides to show

13
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,021
they’re some of the blame,
that should be adequate.

14
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,146
‐ That’s not what’s
been worrying me.

15
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
I mean, there’s a
lot of water that’s

16
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,226
passed beneath the bridge.

17
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,528
Will the Earth and
Jupiter really be

18
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,403
able to forgive and forget?

19
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,908
I don’t know.

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,869
‐ You don’t think we made
the wrong choice, do you?

21
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,661
‐ Do you think we’d be
better off as virtual

22
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,955
prisoners back on Earth?

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,746
‐ No, but on the other hand,

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,409
I’m really not
that confident that

25
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,668
we’ll be able to convince
the people on either side

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,380
to believe in peace.

27
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,842
‐ Well I believe in myself

28
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,086
and in Mr. Shiratori.

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,761
‐ Why do you keep
trying to stop me?

30
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,346
‐ If you were only
leaving to be an

31
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:05,273
ambassador to the Earth slugs
I wouldn’t have to however,

32
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,266
I can’t believe
that you’ve fallen

33
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,228
prey to that earth
woman’s witchery.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,780
How can you forsake
our ideal of womanhood?

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,822
The beautiful Miss Nanako.

36
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,124
‐ Miss Nanako is a wonderful
model of womanhood, but still.

37
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:23,703
‐ But what?

38
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:23,999
Just say it!

39
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,538
‐ She’s a cartoon you idiot!

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,036
(loud gasp)

41
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,046
Skumu!

42
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,299
(man growling)

43
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,225
‐ Bows and junk
detected off our bow.

44
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,813
It’s a Jovian
gekigen type captain.

45
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,980
‐ I’m Lieutenant
Commander Skomo Shiratori

46
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,939
of the Jovian Federation
Superior Male Forces

47
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,482
here to discuss
possible peace talks.

48
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,365
Requesting permission to
board the Nadesico ma’am.

49
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:54,863
‐ Permission is granted.

50
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,566
‐ Brother.

51
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,123
Big brother.

52
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,951
Big brother!

53
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,909
‐ Oh hi Yukina.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,459
How’s the weather down here?

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,583
‐ Fine.

56
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,039
(brother and sister giggle)

57
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:18,088
‐ So, would you mind telling
me your name this time?

58
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,549
‐ Akito Tenkowa, Estivalis
pilot and ship’s cook.

59
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,216
‐ I brought you a little
something I’d like to show you.

60
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,096
‐ To show me?

61
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,274
Oh wow!

62
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,100
It’s the complete series
in octophonic sound!

63
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,517
‐ A videotape in
this day and age?

64
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,065
Unbelievable!

65
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,728
If it wasn’t for my
collection of obsolete decks,

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,027
you wouldn’t be
able to watch this.

67
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,740
You owe me big time.

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,950
‐ Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,780
‐ Why do all of us have
to watch this stupid show?

70
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,120
‐ What can you do?

71
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,954
He’s a VIP so the
whole crew has to

72
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,538
join in to make this special.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
‐ [Male Voice] Alright
then, power on, switch on.

74
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,219
(upbeat rock music)

75
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,317
‐ They’re idiots!

76
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,281
A bunch of grown ups all
watching a stupid cartoon.

77
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,364
It’s so idiotic!

78
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,621
What’s with you?

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,120
‐ Not a thing.

80
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,463
‐ Oh Akito, I finally
understand now.

81
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,215
Gekiganger is the answer.

82
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,182
I was so worried about who would

83
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,890
be willing to accept peace!

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,761
But now I see that
unlike the Earth,

85
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,927
the people of
Jupiter understand!

86
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,675
I know they must believe!

87
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,189
They must because
truth and honor

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,270
is the very essence
of Gekiganger!

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
‐ Now wait just a second here.

90
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,819
‐ She’s right!

91
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,529
Love, courage, and
passion are a thing

92
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,031
that will bring a true
peace to this universe,

93
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,901
and Gekiganger we
find the way to

94
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,069
achieve the true
potential of humanity!

95
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,329
(everyone cheers)

96
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,539
‐ I’m so ashamed of myself!

97
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,039
I call the show a cartoon for
little kids, but I was wrong!

98
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,214
‐ After all my years
in the industry,

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,793
I’ve never seen a show with such

100
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,537
respect for human feelings.

101
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,418
‐ It deserves to be
praised for it’s humanity.

102
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,758
‐ It touched my heart and
made me feel like a child.

103
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,055
‐ That’s it!

104
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,097
In order to find
the path to peace,

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,970
we have to set it Gekiganger!

106
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,055
(everyone cheers)

107
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,193
‐ I guess I never
thought of it that way.

108
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,649
‐ I need to know everything
about Gekiganger immediately!

109
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,860
‐ You want models, I got models.

110
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,480
‐ And here are the
production model sheets.

111
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,147
‐ No!

112
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,534
That’s not enough!

113
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,651
I want to live, slave,
and breathe Gekiganger!

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,162
‐ Oh boy.

115
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,918
‐ [Photographer] Give
me the sign Hikaru!

116
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:03,916
‐ Here!

117
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,879
‐ One inch scale aquamarines!

118
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,927
We made a special limited run
of 50 units for this show.

119
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,314
‐ Behold the mighty king
of garage kid heaven!

120
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,061
Pour a mold, pour a
mold, pour a mold!

121
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,104
(man laughing evilly)

122
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,636
‐ [Actor] Listen to
me foolish earthlings!

123
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,940
This room has been taken over
by the dark string universe!

124
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,774
‐ Not so fast Typerian!

125
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,107
Come on everyone!

126
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,942
Let’s fight in
the name of peace!

127
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,777
Let’s all Gekiganger!

128
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,528
‐ Well, we’re finally ready
to start our marathon.

129
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,077
‐ And tell them what
that means Akito.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,660
‐ That’s right.

131
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,207
It’s time for the most eagerly
awaited event of Genkifest.

132
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,919
‐ We’re going to
screen the entire

133
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,539
Gekiganger series
from front to back!

134
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,127
(crowd cheers)

135
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,675
‐ Guy sure would
be happy right now

136
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,302
if he were still with us.

137
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,058
‐ So just exactly how does
Gekiganger end anyway Akito?

138
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,850
‐ Most giant robot
animes end with a

139
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,136
big fight and a happy ending.

140
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,728
‐ And peace and justice
triumph in the end.

141
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,153
That’s absolutely wonderful!

142
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,192
‐ Actually, I really
don’t know how it ends.

143
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,069
I’ve seen the whole series
except the last one.

144
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,946
‐ Really?

145
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,532
But why not?

146
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,739
‐ I was always afraid that
seeing the last episode

147
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,498
might somehow change the
way I feel about the show,

148
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,672
but this time I’m going to
watch it all the way through.

149
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,922
I’m going to finally
watch the last episode

150
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,713
and then we’re going to
make peace with the Jovians.

151
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,338
‐ Right.

152
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,796
‐ [Everyone] Let’s
go Gekiganger, speed!

153
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,854
‐ [Akito] Do you see the hand?

154
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,642
‐ Not yet.

155
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,096
‐ I wish people wouldn’t
play with my Gekiganger.

156
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,845
‐ [Female Voice] Maybe
you should keep it

157
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,899
attached with string.

158
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,312
‐ We have to find it first.

159
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,364
‐ Good.

160
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,363
There’s no one here.

161
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,413
At last, we’re finally alone.

162
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,622
‐ [Male Voice] Could
you step back a little?

163
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,834
‐ [Female Voice] Nope.

164
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,253
‐ Please, I’m not used to
being in situations like this

165
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,214
and although it’s not
completely unpleasurable,

166
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,253
I just find it a
little unsettling.

167
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,422
‐ You’re so cute!

168
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,007
‐ The male force
has rarely had the

169
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,720
opportunity to be in
contact with women

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,220
and I really don’t
know what to do next.

171
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,263
‐ You mean you’ve never
even kissed a girl?

172
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,969
‐ No ma’am.

173
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,808
‐ Would you like
me to teach you?

174
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:22,232
Was that a no?

175
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,817
Make up your mind please.

176
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,319
‐ I’m not against it.

177
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,189
‐ Then let me show you how.

178
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,318
First, close your eyes.

179
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,655
‐ [Male Voice] Okay.

180
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,200
‐ [Female Voice] Now,
tip your head forward.

181
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,783
‐ [Male Voice] Like this?

182
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,410
‐ [Female Voice] Yes, and
put your arms here and here.

183
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,576
‐ [Male Voice] There?

184
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,745
‐ [Female Voice]
Don’t open your eyes.

185
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,793
‐ [Male Voice] I’m sorry.

186
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,286
‐ [Female Voice] Don’t move.

187
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,379
Is your heart pounding?

188
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,212
‐ [Male Voice] Uh huh.

189
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,256
‐ Same here.

190
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,352
How do you feel?

191
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,456
‐ Hey, why are you
just standing there?

192
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,292
‐ Because this is the
door to my room Akito.

193
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,589
‐ Oh I guess it is, isn’t it?

194
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,802
Well, see ya!

195
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,631
‐ Akito.

196
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,055
I was just thinking that maybe

197
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,847
if you were ready to watch
the last episode of Gekiganger

198
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,274
that maybe you were ready
to make a decision about me.

199
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,987
(throat clears)

200
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:57,995
(yelping)

201
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,334
Why hello Yukino.

202
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,619
What are you doing here?

203
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,332
‐ I’m looking for
my big brother.

204
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,332
He hasn’t come back to our room.

205
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,214
‐ I think he’s in the cafeteria.

206
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,252
‐ No, wait, don’t!

207
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,293
‐ Oh is he now?

208
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,836
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

209
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,999
‐ Hey, now wait a second.

210
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,087
‐ Now that you mention it,

211
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,672
maybe you should
wait a little bit.

212
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,836
‐ Why is that?

213
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,679
‐ Oh, hi big brother!

214
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,552
‐ Yo!

215
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,425
‐ We’ll be back after the break.

216
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,979
‐ [Male Voice] You mean,
we’ve finally found it sir?

217
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,437
‐ That’s right.

218
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,947
At last, the lost city is
finally within our grasp.

219
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,781
Now not only will our dwindling

220
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,955
suppcivilization’s

221
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,665
artifacts be replenished,

222
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,295
but our original plans for the

223
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,371
ongoing war against
Earth can continue.

224
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,207
‐ And how is that
going to affect

225
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,174
the peace talks with Earth?

226
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,882
‐ The supreme war council is
debating that as we speak,

227
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,216
however this timely
discovery will no doubt

228
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,682
undermine the efforts of those

229
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,550
pushing for a peace settlement.

230
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,853
I will be conducting the
peace negotiations personally.

231
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,063
Commander, I have a very
special assignment for you.

232
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,727
‐ A special assignment sir?

233
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,226
‐ [Male Voice] Tomorrow’s
the last day of Gekifest.

234
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,740
I sure am gonna miss it.

235
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,451
‐ But the Gekiganger
festival doesn’t end here.

236
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,072
The way I see it, the peace
talks are a continuation,

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,778
another part of the same whole.

238
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,580
‐ I’ve gotta agree
with you there.

239
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,083
All hearts that long
for peace beat alike.

240
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,417
I’m planning on proposing to a

241
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,593
certain special person
when Gekifest is over.

242
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,763
So tell me, have you
given any thought

243
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,972
to what you’re gonna
do after the war?

244
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,183
‐ I haven’t thought that
far into the future.

245
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,562
‐ I wanna start raising a
family with the woman I love.

246
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,810
‐ You sound so sure of yourself.

247
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,484
‐ Someday you’ll
understand what it’s like.

248
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,443
No matter how
nebulous or difficult

249
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,483
the course to your
dreams may seem,

250
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,776
once you’ve discovered
your true love,

251
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,570
the path to happiness
is easy to follow.

252
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,406
‐ Once I’ve discovered
my true love?

253
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,496
(upbeat theme song music)

254
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,002
‐ [Female Voice] Well, it’s
the last episode Akito.

255
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,128
‐ Yeah.

256
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,802
(upbeat these song music)

257
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,644
‐ Emergency alert!

258
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,523
There’s a Jovian
fleet approaching!

259
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,438
‐ [Female Voice]
Incoming message from
the Jovian flagship.

260
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,980
‐ Patch it through please.

261
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,773
‐ I am Admiral Kusakare,
Jovian Federation.

262
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,818
‐ And I’m captain
Misumaru of the Nadesico.

263
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,784
‐ In the interest of
moving things forward,

264
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,033
I have been authorized to
begin peace negotiations.

265
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,118
‐ [Misumaru] Really?

266
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
‐ I would like to start
the talks in one hour.

267
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,078
We will forward you the details.

268
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,044
‐ Understood Admiral.

269
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:52,505
We are ready when you are.

270
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,222
I can’t believe
they were willing

271
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,593
to start peace
negotiations so quickly.

272
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,098
‐ We’re so lucky that
we’ve got Mr. Shiratori

273
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,601
acting as a go‐between.

274
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,232
‐ Let’s not let our
guard down just yet.

275
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,602
‐ Do I detect jealousy?

276
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,056
‐ I don’t mix business
with pleasure.

277
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,939
‐ Oh is that so Mr. Hori?

278
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,614
So you wouldn’t
tell someone that

279
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,362
you have been intimate with to
get off the ship, would you?

280
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,615
‐ What happened has
nothing to do with this.

281
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,657
‐ I’m not feeling very
comfortable right now.

282
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,449
‐ And so it begins.

283
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,168
‐ You make me proud big brother.

284
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,141
‐ What are these documents for?

285
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,395
‐ Just some preliminary
paperwork we prepared

286
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,147
in the interest of
expediting things.

287
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,440
‐ This isn’t a peace treaty.

288
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,404
It’s a terms of surrender.

289
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,533
You’re asking for a full
disarmament of Earth

290
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,860
and control of our
major industries.

291
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,316
There’s no way we
can agree to this.

292
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,407
‐ And all of these
are unnegotiable?

293
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,454
‐ That’s right.

294
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,286
‐ No.

295
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,541
No way.

296
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,250
‐ I demand these
terms be withdrawn!

297
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,543
‐ Shiratori.

298
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,594
‐ And why should we
withdraw them commander?

299
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,170
‐ Because they love
Gekiganger also.

300
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,885
Can’t you see sir?

301
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,225
‐ Shiratori.

302
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,219
‐ In Gekiganger, I’ve
discovered a common thread

303
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,352
that binds all men as brothers.

304
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,010
It’s the values we share,

305
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,638
courage; perseverance;
friendship; and love.

306
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,808
Together we’ve
watched Gekiganger

307
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,107
and embraced these
ideas that we share.

308
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,939
These people have
come seeking peace

309
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,784
because they’ve
learned the truth!

310
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,861
There is only one
true righteous path!

311
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,446
‐ I agree.

312
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,661
There is only one
true righteous path!

313
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,283
(loud gunshot)

314
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,910
(loud gasps)

315
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,046
‐ [Female Voice] Skomo!

316
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,047
‐ Damn, both of my
legs fell asleep.

317
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,756
‐ You bastard!

318
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,347
Why did you shoot him?

319
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,524
‐ The evil empire must be
destroyed by righteousness.

320
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,935
That is the central
theme of Gekiganger.

321
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,979
Gekiganger teaches
us that those who

322
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,487
would oppress others
must be destroyed.

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,240
Therefore, the
oppressive Earth regime

324
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,663
that banished us to
Jupiter must be vanquished!

325
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,203
‐ You’re crazy!

326
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,618
‐ Are you trying to say
that we’re the evil empire?

327
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,155
‐ Of course.

328
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,620
There is only one true righteous
path and that is our path.

329
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,498
‐ Who cares who’s
right and who’s wrong?

330
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,377
Please help him!

331
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,805
Can’t you see Skomo’s dying?

332
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,840
‐ Tenkowa!

333
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,642
(man yelling)

334
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,019
‐ Why are they shooting at us

335
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,692
while the diplomatic
team is on board?

336
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,112
‐ We’ve got to get
them out of there!

337
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,150
‐ Get out of here!

338
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,903
‐ [Male Voice] Right!

339
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,948
(loud explosion)

340
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,662
‐ Our shields can’t stand this!

341
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,202
Can’t we pull back?

342
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,867
‐ That would mean deserting
the captain and the away team.

343
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,166
(loud explosion)

344
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,540
‐ Damaged engineering!

345
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,086
We can’t continue
evasive action sir.

346
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,382
(loud explosions)

347
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,554
‐ Eureka.

348
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,682
(loud explosion)

349
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,555
‐ [Female Voice] It’s
Akito and the away team!

350
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,600
‐ [Robot] Okay, here we go!

351
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,103
(loud gunshots)

352
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,347
‐ Big brother!

353
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,396
‐ Protect that shuttle!

354
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,399
(loud explosions)

355
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,074
‐ This is bad.

356
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,411
(loud gunshots)

357
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,451
‐ Dammit!

358
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,254
‐ Well what goes
around, comes around.

359
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,759
It’s a good thing that
we’re here to bail you out.

360
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,590
‐ [Commander] You mean,
you’re going to help us?

361
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,758
‐ Like it or not,
we’re on the same side.

362
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,315
We’ll cover you while you
go retrieve your shuttle.

363
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,481
‐ Big brother!

364
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,562
Don’t die big brother!

365
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,104
‐ That’s right.

366
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,979
Prep for surgery and have the
anesthetic waiting for us.

367
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,146
‐ Big brother, big brother,
please hold on big brother!

368
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,896
Hold on!

369
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,776
‐ Arm the PT canon Rory.

370
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,704
‐ But if we use the PT canon,

371
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,451
all hopes for peace
will be destroyed.

372
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,736
‐ It’s too late.

373
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,947
‐ Are you sure?

374
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
Are you absolutely sure captain?

375
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,915
‐ [Radio] Recalling
all estovalis units.

376
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,915
‐ Big brother,

377
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,135
I brought you your favorite
Gekiganger model big brother.

378
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,256
If you get well,

379
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,013
I swear I will never
make fun of it again.

380
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,926
‐ I know you won’t Yukina.

381
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:00,847
Minato.

382
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,810
This is for you.

383
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,318
‐ The answer is yes.

384
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,026
‐ Hey Tenkowa.

385
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,155
I guess this means
I’m gonna miss

386
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,489
seeing the last
episode with you.

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,005
Please have faith.

388
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,170
Someone’s got to
keep up the flight.

389
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,546
‐ [Sister] Big brother!

390
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,435
‐ [Female Voice] No!

391
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,856
‐ [Male Voice] Do not
mourn Skomo Shiratori.

392
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,324
He was a spy and
Earth sympathizer.

393
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,656
‐ [Male Voice] Yes sir.

394
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,870
‐ However, his death
will be reported as

395
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,581
an assassination
planned by Earth.

396
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,753
That should ensure
that there will

397
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,120
be no further calls
for peace talks.

398
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,706
It seems that Shiratori
will serve our cause

399
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,462
better dead than alive.

400
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,714
Thank you for killing him.

401
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,005
‐ Right.

402
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,919
‐ Now that we’ve found
what we were looking for,

403
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,219
I’ll be damned if I
let peace stop us.

404
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,223
‐ Dammit all!

405
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:21,925
Dammit!

406
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,724
Stupid robots!

407
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,467
Go to hell!

408
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:24,847
I’m so blind.

409
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,063
Why didn’t I see?

410
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,309
It was always there
in front of me.

411
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,396
Idiot!

412
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,450
I saw what I liked and
ignored the rest of it.

413
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,161
I never thought about
how others might see it.

414
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,291
‐ Akito.

415
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,934
(upbeat dreamy music)

416
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,193
‐ [Narrator] Wind, fire,
tidal waves, explosions!

417
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,358
It’s been a real
rollercoaster of excitement

418
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,157
but now they’re
only two episodes

419
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,239
of Nadesico left to go!

420
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,204
Will all the
mysteries be revealed?

421
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,156
Will the romances
be consummated?

422
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,656
Will the war between Earth
and Jupiter come to an end?

423
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,877
Will sale figures on our
merchandise continue to climb?

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Don’t miss out on the
action and thrills,

425
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,586
the tears and laughter,
the agony and the ecstasy,

426
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,092
The good, the bad, and the ugly

427
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,133
as the riders go berserk to
try to wrap everything up!
