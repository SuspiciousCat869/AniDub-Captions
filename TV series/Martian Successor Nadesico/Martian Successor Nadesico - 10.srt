1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,689
‐ Well, the Nadesico has
joined the United Earth Forces,

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,020
but either they don’t want us

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,773
or they don’t know
what to do with us.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,305
We’ve had two new arrivals,

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,188
both of whom are clueless
and extremely annoying.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,686
Very irritating people.

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,449
And what began as
a love triangle

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,360
is now a septagon by my count.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,618
It’s really getting hopeless.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,410
(upbeat jazz music
in foreign language)

11
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,957
(space ship flying)

12
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,839
‐ Chulip detected entering
Earth defense sphere.

13
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,258
Chulip now entering second
defensive line airspace.

14
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,266
(rockets launching)

15
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,808
(explosions)

16
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,778
(explosion)

17
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,178
The Nadesico has been
selected to investigate

18
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,934
a new type of Chulip
that apparently

19
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,426
landed on Tunisian Island.

20
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,438
And why was that?
Because of my leadership!

21
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,901
That’s right, the Supreme
Commander has finally

22
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,773
noticed how I’ve turned
this ship around.

23
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,858
So where the hell is my crew?

24
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,525
Why hasn’t anyone
come to the bridge

25
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,864
to listen to my
brilliant orders?

26
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,407
What’s going on here?

27
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,412
‐ Well, as a wild guess it
might be because it’s two am.

28
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,505
That’s the middle of the night
in case you didn’t know, sir.

29
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,419
Everybody who has any
sense is probably asleep!

30
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,831
(Admiral yelling)

31
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,627
‐ The Nadesico is
a combat vessel!

32
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,381
You can’t just shut it down!

33
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,462
Hey, wait a minute,
you’re the helmswoman!

34
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,298
You’ve got to stay at your post

35
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,762
untirelieved you!

36
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,723
‐ Sorry, but it’s
the end of my shift.

37
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,474
‐ [Admiral] What!?
Come back here!

38
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,684
I’m an admiral, damn it!

39
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,183
Listen to me when
I’m talking to you!

40
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,735
I’ll report you to the captain
for insubordination, damn it!

41
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,391
‐ [Erina] We’re going
to Tunisian Island?

42
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,017
Hmm, on the Equator.
White sand beaches.

43
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,896
I’m afraid this place sounds
entirely too appealing.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,071
‐ [Yurika] Doesn’t
that look good?

45
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,703
But we all know what
boys like, right?

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,199
If that Migumi is
gonna play dirty

47
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,991
then I’ll fight fire with fire!

48
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,244
After all the way to a man’s
heart is through his stomach!

49
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,738
‐ I wondered why
she wanted to use

50
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,948
the kitchen, but now I see.

51
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,539
‐ Ahh, yes.

52
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,535
(jazzy lounge music)

53
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:20,636
Bon appetite, Akito!

54
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,681
‐ Wow!

55
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,516
(Akito yelling)

56
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,149
‐ My tongue has died
and gone to heaven!

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,612
‐ (laughing) You like it?

58
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,900
‐ It was perfect. Only one thing
might taste more wonderful.

59
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,446
‐ I’m willing to cook
anything you want, Akito.

60
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,622
‐ That one thing is the
taste of your sweet lips.

61
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,542
‐ Oh, Akito.

62
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,249
(food burning)

63
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,079
‐ [Yurika] (screaming)
Oh, no! It’s burning!

64
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,675
Fire! What’s going on?

65
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,792
‐ Tenkawa sure is unlucky.

66
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,957
(microwave beeping)

67
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,012
(slurping)

68
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,721
‐ How depressing.

69
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,184
There’s nothing more
lonely than eating

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,635
instant noodles by yourself
for sixteen days. Huh?

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,476
No, could it be? Do I see a
special meal baked with love?

72
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,976
Could it possibly be for me?

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,650
‐ Goodnight, Jun.

74
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,645
‐ Y‐Y‐Yurika.

75
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,701
‐ They’re all idiots.

76
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,994
‐ My gosh, are you okay, miss?

77
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,036
Do you have any idea
what happened to you?

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,000
‐ I don’t know. I
don’t know anything.

79
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,621
I don’t even know who I am!

80
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,416
‐ Huh? Now what? Right when
it’s getting good, too. Coming!

81
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,133
‐ Oh, Akito, how are you?

82
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,723
I was cooking and wondered
if you wanted to share it!

83
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,631
‐ I guess I could.

84
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,799
‐ Are you watching anime again?

85
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,096
‐ Yeah.
‐ This is the first time that

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,680
I’ve ever worn
clothing like this.

87
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,677
‐ [Yurika] Okay, so what’s
the story on this one, Akito?

88
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,849
‐ [Akito] Well, this is
episode thirty three,

89
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,108
"The Smile of Holy
Maiden Aquamarine."

90
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,360
That young girl is
really Aquamarine,

91
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,902
one of the twin
pilots of the enemies

92
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,897
Gemini robot, but
she gets amnesia

93
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,699
after a crash
landing, and winds up

94
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,911
falling in love with Ken.

95
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,702
Anyway, it turns
out that Aquamarine

96
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,244
is almost a perfect girl.

97
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,619
She’s pretty, great
at cooking, and‐‐

98
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,294
‐ You mean you like girls
who can cook, Akito?

99
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,169
Well, I made this just for you!

100
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,541
Please, try some!
‐ Um, well.

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,130
‐ Come on! Well,
go on, just dig in!

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,760
I’m sure you’ll love
it! Pretty please?

103
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,428
(Akito gagging)

104
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,774
(Akito struggling)

105
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,649
(Akito yelling)

106
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,405
‐ Oh, my gosh, Akito!

107
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,907
(coughing)

108
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,740
Akito, are you alright?

109
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,777
‐ Water! (grunting)

110
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,700
‐ Oh, my goodness! Akito!

111
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,036
‐ Water!

112
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,751
‐ Try this special
stamina drink I just made!

113
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,043
So what happened in here?

114
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,044
It smells like a
poison gas attack!

115
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,837
(Akito yelling)

116
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,382
‐ [Yurika] Just what in the
heck was in that stamina juice?

117
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,935
‐ Milk, water, vinegar,
Tabasco sauce, cod liver oil,

118
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,762
bourrignuesse, oatmeal
powdered mushrooms,

119
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,425
and a couple of different
energy drinks as a base.

120
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,603
(Akito yelling)
‐ Get out!

121
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,977
(girls screaming)

122
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,943
‐ [Doctor] What
did this idiot eat?

123
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,773
Get him to sick
bay on the double!

124
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,990
And incinerate that pan!

125
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,610
Is this some kind of new attack

126
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,277
the Jovians are trying out?

127
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,945
‐ I think it’s the
fatal poison of love.

128
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,623
‐ Oh, wow, oh, wow!
This is delicious!

129
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,334
You know, I always told
myself that the girl

130
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,624
I was gonna marry had
to be a great cook!

131
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,956
‐ [Aquamarine] Really?

132
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,712
‐ Please, Akito,
this time it really

133
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,134
does taste good, I’ve tested it!

134
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,712
‐ Don’t try hers, try mine!

135
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,884
‐ Akito, Akito!
‐ Just one bite, Akito!

136
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,716
(girls yelling)

137
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,893
(Akito yelling)

138
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,484
‐ (laughing) Die,
Geki Ganga Three.

139
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,728
‐ Akito?
‐ Is he dead?

140
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,114
‐ [TV Character] Aquamarine!
‐ [Ken] Aquamarine!

141
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,150
‐ Ken, my time
with you was great,

142
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,744
but I was so happy
while it lasted.

143
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,321
‐ Aquamarine, don’t do it!

144
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,737
‐ I must do this
because I love you!

145
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,995
Goodbye, Ken!

146
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,578
(yelling and explosions)

147
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,622
‐ [Ken] Aquamarine!

148
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,465
‐ Aquamarine.

149
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,419
‐ [Ken] Aquamarine!
‐ Oh, Ken!

150
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,999
‐ Man, wouldn’t it be great if

151
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,844
there really were
girls like her?

152
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,171
(spaceship humming)

153
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,304
‐ Land the Nadesico
by those reefs.

154
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,264
Are the landing parties
ready to go ashore?

155
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,474
‐ [Girls] Yes, sir.

156
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,064
‐ But before that,
Ruri Ruri, you’d better

157
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,970
take this special UV
blocker the lab made up.

158
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,518
‐ This is for me? How odd.

159
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,734
I’ve never been to
the ocean before.

160
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,700
(group celebrating)

161
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,367
‐ Take the beach, men!
‐ [Men] Yeah!

162
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,003
‐ Now wait just a
minute all of you!

163
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,499
Do you have any idea
what you’re doing?

164
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,541
You’re all still employees
of Nergal Heavy Industries.

165
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,835
And that means that the
time you spend playing

166
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,089
will be deducted from your pay.

167
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,883
I made these
brochures explaining

168
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,005
how to have fun at the beach.

169
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,011
Never go into deep water alone.

170
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,763
Always wear sandals
on rocky surfaces.

171
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,257
Don’t use sun tan lotions that
aren’t biodegradable, also‐‐

172
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,232
Oh, they could have
at least read it!

173
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,863
(group laughing)

174
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,120
‐ Come on, step right up!

175
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,581
What’s a trip to
the beach without

176
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,409
the ever popular greasy hot dog,

177
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,665
soggy ramen noodles,
and melted snowcones?

178
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,327
Fortunately for you I’m here
to continue that tradition!

179
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,246
Uribatake’s beachside deli
is now open for business!

180
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,706
‐ Ramen, please.
‐ You betcha!

181
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,127
(yelling)

182
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,176
Swish and swirl,
swish and swirl, swish
and swirl and rinse!

183
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,430
Now eat it!

184
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,521
‐ That’s nasty.

185
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,229
‐ That’s the tradition, kiddo.

186
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,937
‐ Mr. Tenkawa. I have a few
things I’d like to ask you.

187
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,445
You were born on
Mars, weren’t you?

188
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,785
‐ Yeah, that’s right.

189
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,611
‐ Oh, excuse me.
Would you like some?

190
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,410
‐ I’m sorry, but‐‐ (yelling)

191
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,281
‐ Are you alright, Mr. Tenkawa?

192
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,578
(slurping)

193
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,124
That sucks.

194
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,209
‐ Where am I?

195
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,291
(grunting)

196
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,457
Oh, I’m really sorry, ma’am.

197
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,972
‐ At long last I’ve found you!

198
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,722
My prince charming!

199
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,012
(laughing)

200
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,310
‐ Aquamarine?

201
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,524
(theme music)

202
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,356
‐ What in the
hell? What is this?

203
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,573
Don’t you realize that
we’re on a special mission?

204
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,492
We’re supposed to be
searching for that new Chulip.

205
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,161
Don’t you know that? I wanna
know what we’re doing about it!

206
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,280
Hey, you, I just
asked you a question!

207
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,327
Why aren’t any of
you answering me?

208
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,922
Alright, I’ve had just
about enough of‐‐ (yelling)

209
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,169
‐ Alright! Let’s bury him!

210
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,342
(group cheering)

211
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,012
‐ Do you think you’ll
get away with this?

212
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,512
I’m an admiral, damn it!

213
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,183
I have powerful friends!
You can’t do this,

214
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,052
you cannot do this
to me you just‐‐

215
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,259
(yelling)

216
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,557
(gagging)

217
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,518
Okay, okay, okay you’ve had
your fun, now dig me out.

218
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,945
Hey, wait, come back here,
what do you think you’re doing?

219
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,155
(yelling)

220
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,065
(relaxing music)

221
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,296
‐ By the way, my name’s
Akito Tenkawa. What’s yours?

222
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,853
‐ Aqua. My name is Aqua Crimson.

223
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,313
‐ Aqua?

224
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,729
(laughing)

225
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,980
‐ I wonder where
Akito disappeared to?

226
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,563
‐ [Megumi] Akito!

227
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,988
(electric static)

228
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,116
‐ Hey, it’s a hat!

229
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,202
‐ And it’s a woman’s beach hat!

230
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,825
‐ [Both] A woman?

231
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,582
‐ [Aqua] This is all I could
cook up on such short notice.

232
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,673
Please, help yourself!

233
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,591
‐ Everything looks so wonderful!

234
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,469
Hey, that’s good!

235
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,920
‐ I’m so glad you like it!

236
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,602
Is something wrong, Akito?

237
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,931
‐ Oh, no, it’s nothing
at all, really.

238
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,267
But, Ms. Aqua?

239
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,102
‐ Please, it’s just Aqua.

240
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,936
‐ Okay, are you all
alone here, Aqua?

241
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,612
Where are your folks?

242
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,322
‐ My father and
mother are both dead.

243
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,113
I’m just an orphan all
alone in this world.

244
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,158
All alone by myself.

245
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,572
‐ Oh, I’m sorry.

246
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,738
‐ No, don’t be. I’m not!

247
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,619
(Aqua laughing)

248
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,876
‐ Alright! It’s time to
find that Chulip, pilots!

249
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,634
‐ Nag, nag, nag!

250
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,178
‐ Hey, you’re not leaving
without me, are you?

251
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,064
You wouldn’t do that, would you?

252
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,060
(yelling)

253
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,522
‐ Has anyone seen the captain?

254
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,153
You don’t suppose
she drowned, do you?

255
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,730
‐ Come to think of it, Akito
and Megumi are missing, too.

256
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,396
Now wait just a darned second!

257
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,904
‐ Well, there’s
nothing to be worried

258
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,316
about with those three,
unless it’s very continental.

259
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,947
‐ It appears that the
deed to this island

260
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,702
was recently sold
to a private owner.

261
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,196
The title is now held
by the Crimson estate,

262
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,959
a large Australian conglomerate.

263
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,169
‐ The Crimsons?
I know that name!

264
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,501
Aren’t they the
multi‐billionaires

265
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,544
who rented Monte Carlo
for their daughters debut?

266
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,708
It was the social
event of the decade!

267
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,457
‐ Crimson? They’re one
of the top manufacturers

268
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,587
of barrier shield
systems, right?

269
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,465
Satellites for the big
barrier are their specialty.

270
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,012
However, if I recall
things correctly

271
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,848
their daughter has proven
to be a real problem child.

272
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,982
‐ Problem child?

273
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,269
‐ For example, she
added a paralyzing agent

274
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,023
to the entrees at
a formal reception,

275
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,024
and kidnapped a noted
artist so that she

276
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,856
could draw a romance
comic featuring herself.

277
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,154
She’d gotten so bad that the
Crimsons’ had practically

278
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,696
dropped out of proper society.

279
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,034
‐ Well, that’s definitely
the new Chulip.

280
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,158
Let’s blow it up and
get back to the beach.

281
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,665
‐ Hey, wait a second! That’s
a force field generator!

282
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,209
What’s that doing here?

283
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,212
(computer beeping)

284
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,706
‐ The Crimson family crest?

285
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,127
‐ A force field?
What’s going on here?

286
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,055
‐ Who cares? Let’s just
blow everything up.

287
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,185
‐ [Nagare] What’s going on?

288
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,049
Why would the Crimson’s
build a barrier here?

289
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,679
(harp music)

290
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,733
‐ I’ve been all alone ever
since my father and mother died.

291
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,232
Its been lonely, but
somehow I’ve managed.

292
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,065
‐ Aqua, I‐‐

293
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,569
‐ Butloneliness is over now.

294
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,742
I think you’re the
knight in shining armor

295
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,411
that I’ve been waiting
my whole life for.

296
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,412
‐ I understand. It’s strange,

297
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,533
but I feel as if
I’ve known you‐‐

298
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,655
‐ Oh, Akito, I don’t ever
wanna leave your side.

299
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,749
‐ But, Aqua.

300
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,461
‐ I want you to stay
with me forever.

301
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,129
‐ [Megumi] Akito!
‐ [Yurika] Akito!

302
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,719
(panting)

303
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,257
‐ Who are you?

304
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,181
‐ Yurika Misumaru, and you?

305
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,596
‐ That’s not what’s important!

306
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,225
Who in the heck is this person?

307
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,311
‐ Well, I, actually‐‐

308
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,109
‐ It’s time to end this chapter.

309
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,409
‐ The force field
barrier is down!

310
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,450
(explosion)

311
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,745
‐ What is that thing?

312
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,583
‐ Ah! That’s a giant spider!

313
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,287
‐ It would appear
that this Chulip isn’t

314
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,798
another transdimensional
gate for Boson Jumping,

315
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,472
but a large transport
vessel instead.

316
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,590
The enemy is obviously
trying a new tactic.

317
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,797
‐ Well, at least
it doesn’t appear

318
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,548
to be fully operational
yet, whatever it is.

319
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,968
Neutralize it immediately.

320
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,731
(metallic clanging)

321
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,849
(rockets launching)

322
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,860
‐ Akito, just who
is that floozy?

323
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,442
That’s right, get away
from our Akito, you tramp!

324
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,566
‐ Wait a minute! You
don’t understand!

325
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,572
This girl is as
precious and important

326
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,605
to me as Aquamarine was to Ken!

327
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,078
(explosion)

328
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,750
(group yelling)

329
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,788
Aqua, are you alright?

330
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,376
‐ Oh, I’m so excited. Maybe
we’re all going to die now!

331
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,215
Wouldn’t that be so romantic?

332
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,099
(rocket launching)

333
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,679
(explosions)

334
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,846
At long last my
dream will come true.

335
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,355
I shall be consumed in
the flames of battle,

336
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,147
perishing with my one true love.

337
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,232
‐ Are you sure you’re
feeling alright, Aqua?

338
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,779
‐ I’ve never felt better in
my entire long dreary life!

339
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,452
In love and in death I
shall attain fulfillment!

340
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,122
Yes, at long last I will be
the perfect tragic heroine!

341
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,202
(explosion)

342
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,619
‐ Akito, get away from
that girl this instant!

343
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,206
Can’t you see that she’s crazy?

344
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,711
‐ That’s right! Let go
of Akito you nutcase!

345
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,924
(grunting)

346
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,508
‐ Oh, don’t worry, darling.
That’s just the paralyzing

347
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,222
powder I put in
your beef brochette.

348
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,052
‐ What!?

349
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,636
(gunfire)

350
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,101
(explosion)

351
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,321
‐ Akito!

352
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,779
‐ Why are you doing such
a horrible thing anyway?

353
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,491
If you want to die why don’t
you do it all by yourself?

354
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,911
‐ Ever since I was
a child I’ve been

355
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,529
given everything I ever wanted.

356
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,035
Everything except the one
thing I wanted most; misery!

357
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,329
I love to experience true
sadness, to be a tragic heroine!

358
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,255
‐ A tragic...?
‐ Heroine?

359
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,043
‐ Being too happy with the
cause of my unhappiness,

360
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,424
but in dying with my lover I
shall experience true anguish.

361
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,089
God wanted me to suffer so
he sent that Chulip to me!

362
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,599
‐ Let go of me you
out‐of‐your‐mind‐crazy‐person!

363
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,930
‐ Oh, no, my sweet,
I’ll never let go!

364
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,937
We shall become ashes on
the pyre of true love!

365
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,099
‐ Akito!
‐ Let go of him!

366
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,275
‐ Akito!
‐ Akito!

367
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,910
‐ [Ryoko] No way,
bug! He’s mine!

368
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,128
Are you alright, Akito?

369
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,513
Hey, just what the
heck is going on here?

370
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,216
‐ Ryoko! Behind you!

371
00:18:59,305 --> 00:18:59,815
‐ I know, I know!

372
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,601
‐ Yeah, do it! Knock him dead!

373
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,645
‐ Beat the living crap
out of him please!

374
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,479
(gunfire)
‐ Die!

375
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,779
‐ Oh, mama.

376
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,317
(fire venting)

377
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,500
(upbeat music)

378
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,841
(spaceship humming)

379
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,011
‐ Akito, come back!
You can’t leave!

380
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,007
Life is a tragic play,
and we were meant

381
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:42,184
to leave the stage together!

382
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,979
‐ You ate that crazy
girls’ cooking, didn’t you?

383
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,560
‐ If you ate hers you aught to
be able to try mine at least!

384
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,358
‐ Please, I just want to live.

385
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,359
‐ Akito. I just thought I’d
try my hand at cooking as well.

386
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,531
‐ Please, somebody help me!

387
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,198
‐ Akito!
‐ Tenkawa!

388
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,464
‐ Please try my cooking
just one more time, okay?

389
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,462
‐ Akito!

390
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,553
‐ Leave me alone! Can’t you
see I’m the tragic protagonist?

391
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,973
‐ Lucky bastard.

392
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,719
‐ They say that
one persons’ misery

393
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,893
can be another ones paradise.

394
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,061
At least we can
savor his suffering.

395
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,889
‐ Well, I still envy him.

396
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,524
‐ Akito!

397
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,902
(Akito screaming)

398
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,729
‐ For God’s sake! Don’t leave!

399
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,574
You can’t just leave
me here like this,

400
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,571
I’m your admiral!

401
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,903
‐ Soon the tide will come in

402
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,237
and both of us will be
underwater, my new love.

403
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,202
(Aqua laughing)

404
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,283
‐ What are you
giggling like that for?

405
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,660
Someone come back and help
me! This girl is crazy!

406
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,866
‐ Doesn’t the ocean make
you feel so happy, darling?

407
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:54,957
‐ I’m definitely not
happy! (screaming)

408
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,919
(ending theme)

409
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,399
‐ Get ready for grand excitement

410
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,324
in the tradition of the
Battle of the Bulge,

411
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,074
Kelly’s Heroes, and
the ever popular

412
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,664
an idiot in a tank.

413
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,581
Yes, that’s right, the next
episode will feature tanks!

414
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,699
Big armored plated things
that go vroom‐vroom‐vroom!

415
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,159
With a squeal of grindy metal,

416
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,827
and the clackity‐clack
of armored tracks,

417
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,327
these armored backs from
a bygone era live again!

418
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,127
Oh yeah, and some
old friendships

419
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,711
are rekindled in the flames
of passion burn bright, too!

420
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,469
It’s the next episode of
Martian Successor Nadesico!

421
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,010
"Finding Yourself
in a Routine Plot!"
