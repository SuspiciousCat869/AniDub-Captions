1
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,938
‐ [Narrator] We tried, we were
willing to do almost anything

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,019
to end the war, and we
believed that the Jovians

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,685
were more righteous than
the people of Earth.

4
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,155
But in the end, we found out

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,535
that they weren’t what
we thought they were.

6
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,164
It seems there are as many forms

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,319
of righteousness as
there are people.

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,004
(uptempo mysterious music)

9
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,098
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,930
(high‐pitched whirring)

11
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,805
‐ [Announcer] And now, in
honor of our slain hero,

12
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,273
Captain Tsukomo Shiratori,
the Commander of

13
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,064
the Jovian Federation,
Superior Male Forces,

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,068
Vice Admiral Hiruki Kusakabe
would like to say a few words.

15
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,322
(applause)

16
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,659
‐ [Hiruki] My
friends, our mission

17
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,835
is to bring about
peace in the universe.

18
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,754
And build a prosperous
future for all of humanity.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,383
We do not seek war;
there is no sense

20
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,423
in killing each other when
there are more peaceful ways

21
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,006
to achieve a resolution.

22
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,592
But when the United
Earth government

23
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,636
answered our proposal for peace

24
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,929
with the cowardly murder
of our ambassador,

25
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,473
Captain Tsukomo
Shiratori, then the time

26
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,347
for talking is past!

27
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,524
Let us never forget,
that there is only

28
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,195
one true righteous path!

29
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,024
‐ [Crowd] Yeah!

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,191
(cheering)

31
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,935
‐ We must not lose,
we must defeat

32
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,447
the evil Earth and
our oppressors.

33
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,910
In Episode 39, Hot‐blooded
Robot Gekiganger 3,

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,874
we saw what happens when
good and evil collide.

35
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,585
Righteousness will prevail!

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,588
Now, let’s recite together
our slogan for justice,

37
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,552
let’s (speaking
foreign language)

38
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,554
(machines whirring)

39
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,178
‐ Hey, what the big deal?

40
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,855
You invited us to
your ship, dammit,

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,943
so why the hell isn’t
someone here to meet us?

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,560
‐ What am I, chopped liver?

43
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,847
‐ [Ryoko] Chopped liver?

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,188
‐ I’d apologize, but we
don’t have much time.

45
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,024
‐ We don’t?

46
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,068
‐ We’d better begin immediately.

47
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:55,692
‐ Huh?

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,357
‐ Akito, Captain.

49
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,356
I’ll explain the why
and how part later.

50
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,278
I want the two of your to
focus your thoughts on Mars.

51
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,619
(air rushing)

52
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,044
(shimmering chimes)

53
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,463
‐ [Ruri] The Kakitsubata has
created a boson jump field.

54
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,174
‐ [All] What?

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,922
‐ [Officer] They’re trying
to jump their entire ship?

56
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,415
‐ Boson readings increasing.

57
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,165
‐ No way, there are
hundreds of people on board!

58
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,638
‐ Kakitsubata, come in,
Kakitsubata, do you read me?

59
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,643
‐ Huh? What is this? Ms. Versa?

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,016
‐ I want you to think back.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,601
‐ [Akito] What the...?

62
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,936
‐ Do you remember how
it was, Akito, Captain?

63
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,443
What Mars was like,
remember growing up

64
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,276
inside the Utopia Colony?

65
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,324
‐ Huh?

66
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,365
‐ [Yurika] Akito?

67
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,946
I’m getting all sparkly!

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,203
‐ Yurika!

69
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,827
‐ Boson readings
on the Kakitsubata.

70
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,615
‐ No response, they
still won’t answer!

71
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,789
Mr. Akatsuki, Mr. Akatsuki!

72
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,666
Hey, pick up the
radio, you jerks!

73
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,966
(shimmery transmissions)

74
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,590
‐ All three test subjects
remain unaccounted for, sir!

75
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,086
‐ Keep monitoring your screens.

76
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,308
This is a major event.

77
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,098
I’m counting on you, Tenkawa.

78
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,928
‐ [Officer] They’re back!

79
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,478
‐ Huh, what, where?

80
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,524
‐ We’re inside the Observation
Dome of the Kakitsubata.

81
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,319
‐ It seems that even
while boson jumping,

82
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,991
people instinctively
want to look

83
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,950
at the scenery when they travel.

84
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
Or have you forgotten
how the three of us

85
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,534
all found ourselves in the
Nadesico’s observation room

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,750
after we boson jumped
from Mars to the moon?

87
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,369
‐ You mean when I woke up and
you were there with Akito?

88
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,498
Well, of course,
how could I forget

89
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,633
how everyone was saying all
kinds of mean things about us?

90
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,001
But, what really happened?

91
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,339
‐ We’re going to find
the answer right now.

92
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,843
Let’s try again; concentrate
and visualize Mars

93
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:44,969
and the Utopia Colony.

94
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:50,023
‐ On Mars, Utopia
Colony...concentrate...

95
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,360
On Mars, on Mars!

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,070
(dramatic music)

97
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,325
Ah!

98
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,078
(dramatic music)

99
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,658
‐ [All] Whoa!

100
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,707
‐ Yes!

101
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,710
‐ They made it!

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,131
‐ Here we go!

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,169
(shimmery static)

104
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,968
‐ [All] Whoa!

105
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,179
‐ The Kakitsubata has
‐ Mr. Akatsuki, Akito‐‐!

106
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,259
‐ completed making
the boson jump.

107
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,545
‐ Captain Misumaru, Ryoko!

108
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,886
‐ They must have made
the jump to Mars!

109
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,223
‐ Huh?

110
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,556
‐ This all began on
Mars, and I’m certain

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,890
it will end there as well.

112
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,235
‐ Lay in a course
for Mars, Mr. Ayowi.

113
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,522
That’s where we’ll
find the Kakitsubata.

114
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,365
‐ [Ayowi] Right!

115
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,164
(lightening and thunder)

116
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,251
‐ Boson jump completed,
we’ve arrived

117
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,837
at the former Utopia Colony

118
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,092
on the central plateau.

119
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,173
‐ So this is where
they remember.

120
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,677
You know, I don’t
think you’re going

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,180
to get between the two
of them now, Erina, dear.

122
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,012
‐ Oh, are you
trying to insult me!

123
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,677
(laughs)

124
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,846
‐ [Loudspeaker] Boson jump
successfully completed.

125
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,815
All crew in full
operations mode.

126
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,056
‐ The ship just boson jumped?

127
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,435
I guess they’ll
remember me eventually.

128
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,152
‐ It’s inexcusable!

129
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,858
If that boson jump
hadn’t worked,

130
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,907
your crew would’ve been killed!

131
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,740
‐ Oh, don’t worry about it.

132
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,785
My crew knew what we
were attempting and
accepted the risk.

133
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,332
‐ That’s beside the point!

134
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,205
‐ And anyway, this is a
moment for celebration.

135
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,631
This ship’s boson jump
was a major step forward

136
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,632
for humanity; of course, you
can scold me in private later.

137
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,716
‐ Hm!

138
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,879
(chuckles)

139
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,377
‐ [Akatsuki] And
your verdict, Doctor?

140
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,258
‐ I believe we’ve discovered
the secret to boson jumping.

141
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,475
But, one thing bothers me.

142
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,595
‐ [Akatsuki] Oh?

143
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,222
‐ If boson jumping
is truly a form

144
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,058
of instantaneous movement
between points in space,

145
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,354
then it goes against the
theory of relativity.

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,520
And our concept of the speed
of light as an absolute limit.

147
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,900
It seems that our laws
of physics are wrong.

148
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,566
‐ So what does that mean to us?

149
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,954
‐ [Doctor] I don’t know.

150
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,870
At the moment, it all depends.

151
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,531
‐ Hm, I guess we’ll know once

152
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,619
we’ve examined the
ruins, won’t we?

153
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,243
‐ [Yurika] Ruins?

154
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,698
‐ Yes, at the pole.

155
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,209
(winds howling)

156
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,384
‐ [Chef] It was only by
chance that we discovered it.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,420
Nergal was drilling a mine
in Mars’s polar ice cap,

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,218
when we stumbled onto a
vast, underground complex.

159
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,015
The remnants of some long
forgotten Martian civilization.

160
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,519
(slurping)

161
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,142
Everything was composed
of the material

162
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,188
that the chulip
crystals are made of.

163
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,322
And most amazing
of all, some parts

164
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,899
of it were still active.

165
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,186
‐ One question,
is there some kind

166
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,148
of new weapon in this
ruin, why is it so‐‐hey!

167
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,118
‐ It was a great deal
more than just a weapon.

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,830
The truth is, that
everything we’ve learned

169
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,960
about the ancient technology
came from these ruins.

170
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,539
Including the fact that every
time a boson jump occurs,

171
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,415
there is a surge of
increased activity

172
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,264
inside the ruins’
center, in other words‐‐

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,970
‐ It’s a system designed
to control boson jumping.

174
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,720
That’s why everyone wants it.

175
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,353
‐ If we can just learn
how boson jumping works,

176
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,309
then we can dominate the
future of transportation.

177
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,140
More importantly, by securing
the secrets of this ruin,

178
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,225
we’d not only be
able to stop the war,

179
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,023
but we’d also be
holding the gateway

180
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,645
to the stars in our hands.

181
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,232
It would do nothing less than
change the future of mankind.

182
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,528
‐ And maybe get you a
promotion, right, Erina?

183
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,823
‐ Is something wrong with that?

184
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,446
‐ Not if you like being
a blood‐sucking reptile.

185
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,711
This is where you were
born, isn’t it, Akito.

186
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,631
‐ Mm.

187
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,422
‐ The Utopia Colony;
I’m a little jealous.

188
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,126
‐ Huh?

189
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,916
‐ It bonds you with the captain.

190
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,430
‐ Shared memories.

191
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,351
‐ Huh? (screams) Hold on!

192
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,679
Just what are you two
trying to imply here?

193
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,395
It isn’t like that!

194
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,605
No, no, no, no, no, there’s
nothing going on here!

195
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,806
(punching)

196
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,858
Oof!

197
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,569
‐ Ugh, stop sitting on
the fence and admit it!

198
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,779
‐ Yeah, wake up and smell the
coffee for crying out loud!

199
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,941
(Akito whimpering)

200
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,989
‐ My god, what an idiot.

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,913
‐ We’re all idiots.

202
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,239
(laughs)

203
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,789
‐ The Nadesico is approaching
our position, Ms. Wan!

204
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,951
And the Jovian fleet is
also starting to mobilize.

205
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,250
‐ This is it!

206
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,621
‐ So, we’re finally there!

207
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,457
‐ Huh?

208
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,746
‐ [Yurika] Are you
all right, Akito?

209
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,916
‐ Er, I’m fine.

210
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,003
‐ So, what now?

211
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,510
‐ [Akatsuki] We follow the plan.

212
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,881
‐ Which means, our two
ships will secure the ruins

213
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,337
in an cooperative effort!

214
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,798
‐ That’s exactly right,
and from this point forth,

215
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,009
we’re all going to have
to work together closely.

216
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,600
So for your own good, I want you

217
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,273
to stick to the plan, Yurika.

218
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,981
It’s time to pull
the carpet from under

219
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,813
both the Earth and Jupiter.

220
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,438
But there’s no point
if we’re not still here

221
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,823
to enjoy it, right?

222
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,106
‐ Hm, I know just what you mean.

223
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,445
I wouldn’t have agreed
to work with you

224
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,240
if I still couldn’t be myself.

225
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,373
Everything will be just fine.

226
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,330
(bright music)

227
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,332
‐ So this is going to
be a joint operation.

228
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,384
‐ Oh that’s great.

229
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,674
‐ It’s not as if we have
any other choice right now.

230
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,218
‐ Ruri, display the
size and position

231
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,221
of the Earth and Jovian
forces in the area.

232
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,553
‐ Right.

233
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,348
The UEAF has amassed all
of its remaining forces

234
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,851
and left the Moon’s orbit.

235
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,434
They will reach Mars’
orbit in about half a day.

236
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,808
As for the Jovians and
their space citadels.

237
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,766
(all gasp)

238
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,945
According to Ms.
Shiratori, this size

239
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,734
is not an exaggeration.

240
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,399
‐ [Yurika] That thing’s not
a space station, it’s a moon!

241
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,988
‐ The Jovian convoy,
whose aim is to restablish

242
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,492
their Mars colony, is also about
half a day’s distance away.

243
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,946
What that means is that‐‐

244
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,326
‐ [Yurika] That Mars will be
a battlefield in 12 hours!

245
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,623
‐ That’s right Ma’am.

246
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,206
‐ Configure for the PT cannon!

247
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,384
‐ [Loudspeaker] All
hands, battle stations!

248
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,420
All hands to your
battle stations!

249
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,625
‐ The gravity may be
weaker, but it’s still

250
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,713
a big ball of dust, make sure

251
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,257
that everything’s
protected from dirt!

252
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,053
‐ Geez, yesterday
it’s the Jovians,

253
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,335
today it’s Nergal!

254
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,218
‐ Yeah, and I’m
not sure what it is

255
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,887
that we’re fighting for anymore.

256
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,733
‐ Ask me why I fight
and I’ll answer:

257
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,018
that I fight for our
selves and souls.

258
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,612
I fight against despair, for
without hope, there is no life.

259
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,571
‐ Oh wow Izumi, that’s good!

260
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,241
‐ I’m a poet, but I
don’t even know it.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,280
That was bad, but
it could be verse.

262
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,066
(laughs)

263
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,238
(all groan)

264
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,406
‐ She doesn’t make
any sense at all,

265
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,115
but I’m glad that
Izumi’s with us.

266
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,406
Um, where’s Minato?

267
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,117
‐ Don’t worry about her.

268
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,079
Mr. Ayowi and I ought to be able

269
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,037
to cover Ms. Haruka’s position.

270
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,377
‐ Hm, I wish there
were something that
we could do for her.

271
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,593
‐ [Loudspeaker] Prepare
for deployment of Y Unit.

272
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,678
All hands, brace for impact!

273
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,392
After firing of the phase
transition canon, we will‐‐

274
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,143
‐ Stand by on PT
canon, prepare to fire!

275
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,978
‐ Expanding the Y Unit, Captain.

276
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,443
Sarutahiko connected.

277
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,771
‐ [Loudspeaker] Raise
power output to maximum.

278
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,858
Repeat, raise power
output to maxiumum!

279
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,283
‐ Where are you Tenkawa?

280
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,611
Can’t you see the
fighting’s going

281
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,156
to start any minute?

282
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,111
Get in your aestivalis!

283
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,158
‐ No way.

284
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:03,993
‐ Oh?

285
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,367
‐ I won’t do it!

286
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,621
I won’t, why in the hell
should I go out there

287
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,624
and fight for Akatsuki and all

288
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,405
of those other jerks at Nergal?

289
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,407
‐ I’ll tell ya why!

290
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,628
’Cause we go no choice!

291
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,340
‐ What if I prefer to die!

292
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,840
‐ Will you stop
whining like a baby!

293
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:16,842
‐ I’m not whining!

294
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,133
(growling)

295
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,178
‐ I think you need to
have a little faith

296
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,802
in your captain, Akito.

297
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,926
You of all people should
know being herself means.

298
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,435
‐ Herself?

299
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,306
(joints articulating)

300
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,194
(dramatic music)

301
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,443
(explosion)

302
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,236
‐ They’re attacking
the ruin site?

303
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,071
Send in reinforcements
immediately.

304
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,316
‐ [Soldiers] Sir!

305
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,829
‐ We can’t let the Earth
take those artifacts!

306
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,155
(laughter)

307
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,707
‐ The enemy units defending
the ruins have been wiped out.

308
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,043
‐ [Captain] Wonderful,
wonderful, that’ll be just fine.

309
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,339
Ah, Captain, that was
excellent work, oh!

310
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,550
‐ That’s what
teamwork’s all about.

311
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,973
With the Kakitsubata
drawing their attention,

312
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,051
we were able to catch
them off guard easily.

313
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,928
‐ Yes, yes, now don’t forget

314
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,273
that I want to be the
first to enter the ruin.

315
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,019
No tricks behind
my back (laughs).

316
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,562
Got that?

317
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,606
(electric charge)

318
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,650
(lasers firing

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,860
‐ [All] Wow!

320
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,358
‐ The Kakitsubata has broken
through the enemy perimeter.

321
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,280
It’s now continuing to
advance to the front.

322
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,238
‐ They are quite
agile, aren’t they?

323
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,160
‐ The Kakitsubata is some ship!

324
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,406
‐ Yes, but they’re also going up

325
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,669
against all the
Jovian forces on Mars.

326
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,960
Shouldn’t we help them?

327
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,503
‐ Well, first, aim the
PT canon at those ruins!

328
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,747
‐ [All] Huh?

329
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,170
‐ You heard me,
maximum power, Ruri!

330
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,007
‐ Aye aye. Ma’am.

331
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,302
‐ Wait a second!

332
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,185
Are you out of your
mind, Misumaru?

333
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,761
‐ If those ruins are destroyed,

334
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,178
then there won’t be anything
to fight over, will there?

335
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,925
Get ready to fire, Ruri!

336
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:53,559
‐ [Ruri] Aye aye.

337
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,233
‐ No! Don’t do it!

338
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,900
(lasers charging)

339
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,362
‐ The ruin is
projecting a barrier.

340
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,403
‐ All canons fire!

341
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,239
(lasers firing)

342
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,333
‐ Huh, huh, huh?

343
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,622
‐ The ruins’
barrier has absorbed

344
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,616
the blast from our PT canon.

345
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,078
‐ Impossible!

346
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,578
(laughter)

347
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,631
‐ Oh, I knew it, I
knew it all along!

348
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,086
I just knew it, those
ruins are buried

349
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,297
under a million tons of ice,

350
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,927
and a hundred distortion fields.

351
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,931
I knew the PT canon
wouldn’t hurt it.

352
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,433
‐ Oh yeah, sure.

353
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,267
‐ Hm!

354
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,479
‐ Going somewhere?

355
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,310
‐ To talk to our dear captain.

356
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,766
‐ Fire PT canon again!

357
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,564
(lasers firing)

358
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,728
No way!

359
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,226
‐ So what now, Captain?

360
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,227
‐ Keep firing at it!

361
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,028
‐ [Ruri] We can’t.

362
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,361
‐ Huh?

363
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,486
‐ [Ruri] There’s
not enough energy.

364
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,373
The PT engines are
much less efficient

365
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,949
inside an atmosphere, Captain.

366
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,413
It will take twenty
minutes to recharge.

367
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,254
‐ What? Isn’t there
anything you can do?

368
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,539
‐ Not a thing, Captain.

369
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,502
(cries out)

370
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,753
The Kakitsubata is approaching.

371
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,964
‐ Captain, the Kakitsubata is
launching aestivalis units.

372
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,587
‐ [Officer] Captain,
what should we do?

373
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,802
‐ [Officer 2] Yurika!

374
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,423
‐ [Officer 3] We
need orders, Captain!

375
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,298
‐ Launch aestivalis
units, intercept!

376
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,058
(dramatic music)

377
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,730
Your job will be to
keep their fighters

378
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,230
away from the Nadesico
until we can fire.

379
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,773
We’re counting on you.

380
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,816
‐ No problem, that’s what
we’re here for, Captain.

381
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,570
‐ Yahoo, here they come!

382
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,652
‐ Including Pretty Boy himself.

383
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,357
‐ All right, let’s
give ’em hell!

384
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,410
‐ Ya!

385
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,744
‐ Back off, Akatsuki!

386
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,368
‐ Shame on you, Captain.

387
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,247
You know those
ruins are priceless.

388
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,332
‐ Can’t you see that
if we destroy the ruins

389
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,577
we can end this war right now?

390
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,838
‐ Is this what being
yourself means?

391
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,632
Ha! You’re as deluded as
the Gekigengar fanboy!

392
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,876
‐ The hell you say!

393
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,339
I’ve given up all
that Gekigengar stuff!

394
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,638
‐ Oh?

395
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,061
‐ Meeting the Jovians
made me understand!

396
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,181
‐ Meaning?

397
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,345
‐ That the simplicity
that attracted me

398
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,563
was exactly what allows them

399
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,644
to justify their
own monstrous acts!

400
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,597
‐ You see, I told you
you needed to look

401
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,188
at things from every angle.

402
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,363
One man’s justice is
another man’s evil.

403
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,194
Get the picture?

404
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,697
‐ By the way, in the
anime shows that I like,

405
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,071
both sides had good
reasons for fighting.

406
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,619
I guess you should have tried
varying your viewing habits.

407
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,871
‐ Enough! This isn’t
about anime anymore.

408
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,655
This about people
suffering and dying

409
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,247
on both sides, it’s time
to end this madness!

410
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,255
(electric sparking)

411
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,760
‐ Let’s finish this, fanboy!

412
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,721
I’m ordering my
wingmen to stand back.

413
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,341
‐ Ryoko, I’m
handling this myself!

414
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,637
(fighting grunts)

415
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,060
‐ That’s what comes
from testosterone!

416
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,310
What should we do now, Ma’am?

417
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,692
‐ It looks like there’s
nothing that we can do.

418
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:43,805
(gasping)

419
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,146
(Akito screams)

420
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,822
‐ So you’re gonna end this
war for the sake of mankind?

421
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,691
Well, no one asked
you to be a hero!

422
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,108
(screaming)

423
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,408
(electric firing)

424
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,451
‐ For people and country,
for the blue planet Earth,

425
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,955
it’s nothing but a scam!

426
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,746
All of this noble crap
just makes me want to puke!

427
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,208
‐ He’s got missile lock!

428
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,170
‐ Oh no!

429
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,289
‐ Ms. Subaru, cover him!

430
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,087
‐ [Subaru] We’re a
little busy here, dammit!

431
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,460
‐ [Amano] I thought
these guys were supposed

432
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,758
to just sit back and watch.

433
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,090
‐ This is the one real truth!

434
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,546
In the end, the
strong are the ones

435
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,514
who fight for themselves.

436
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,435
You know it’s true, admit it!

437
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,645
‐ Ah, no way!

438
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,934
‐ Visualize yourself
boson jumping, Akito!

439
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,388
‐ Huh?

440
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,346
(electric charging)

441
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,727
‐ What? He just boson jumped!

442
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,273
‐ And without a CC.

443
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,607
‐ It must be the ruins.

444
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,482
‐ [Doctor] Correct.

445
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,400
‐ Huh?

446
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,445
(party crackers popping)

447
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,779
‐ [Both] Kaboom!

448
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,954
(campy music)

449
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,204
‐ [Doctor] It’s time to
get to know the Nadesico.

450
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,544
‐ Hello, it’s time for
Ms. Firsange explains.

451
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,790
This will be the last episode

452
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,122
in our continuing
series of explanations.

453
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,076
Today, I will be
explaining the causes

454
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,457
and theory behind the
boson jumping process.

455
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,054
This will be a tough
one, so listen carefully.

456
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,300
‐ Oh boy!

457
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,633
‐ [Megumi] She’s transmitting
from inside the ruins!

458
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,836
‐ Huh?

459
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,137
‐ [Officer] It’s coming
from approximately

460
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,508
14 kilometers below
the surface, Ma’am.

461
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,467
‐ Inside the ruin?

462
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,846
How did she get down there?

463
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,602
‐ According to Richard
Feynman and John Wheeler,

464
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,813
when an electromagnetic
wave is emitted,

465
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,854
two waves are actually sent out.

466
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,859
One is called the retarded wave,

467
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,571
and the other is called
the advanced wave.

468
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,741
The retarded travels
along with time

469
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,279
like a television signal,
but the advanced wave

470
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,284
travels against time, being
emitted into the past.

471
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,327
Normally, this advanced
wave is absorbed

472
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,830
by the retarded wave.

473
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,003
However, what if there was
a form of unknown particle

474
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,633
that was not influenced
by the retarded wave?

475
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,669
‐ So, matter affected
by such a particle

476
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,555
would go back in time?

477
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,962
‐ Yes, and I have
decided to name

478
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,838
such a particle: the retrospect.

479
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,015
‐ If you think in these terms,

480
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,553
then we can surmise
that boson jumping

481
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,259
is not a form of spacial travel,

482
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,017
but rather in fact a
form of time travel.

483
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,851
If that assumption is correct,

484
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,395
we might further assume that

485
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,810
this ruin is in fact making all
of the time‐lag adjustments.

486
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,817
All of these movements
in time are space

487
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,989
are brought about by
retrospect particles

488
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,239
moving from the present to
the past, then back again.

489
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,374
Buried here in the ruin
is the massive computer

490
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,869
that keeps track of everything,
calculating away endlessly.

491
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,454
If this computer didn’t exist,

492
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,538
then boson jumping would
probably no longer be possible.

493
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,174
One of the reasons I came here

494
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,551
was to test that hypothesis,
but I also have another reason.

495
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,382
It’s you, Akito.

496
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,216
‐ Huh?

497
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,837
‐ There’s someone that I
think your should meet.

498
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,728
(shimmery charging)

499
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,599
From Utopia Colony’s
Rainbow Elementary.

500
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,899
From first grade
class number five.

501
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,362
Her favorite person
was her mommy.

502
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,953
Her very favorite food:
Spaghetti and meatballs.

503
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,410
And her favorite bedtime
story: Cinderella.

504
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,282
(sobbing)

505
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,410
It’s all right.

506
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,326
There’s no reason
to cry anymore.

507
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,463
Welcome home.

508
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,261
(singing in foreign language)

509
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,227
‐ I was taught that violence
was wrong, and I believed it.

510
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,148
When I punched someone, the
pain wasn’t only in my fist,

511
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,068
but I felt good about
protecting friends

512
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,066
who weren’t as big
and strong as others.

513
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,448
And the books I read
said that this was good.

514
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,536
It didn’t make sense,
how could something

515
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,963
be both good and evil?

516
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,499
Maybe that’s why
I was so reluctant

517
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,004
to get involved in the war.

518
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,504
And then every time I thought
I knew what was right,

519
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,796
something would happen to make
me doubt everything again.

520
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,760
But now I’m going
to have to make

521
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,380
that decision once and for all.

522
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,388
Don’t miss the final episode
of Martian Successor Nadesico!
