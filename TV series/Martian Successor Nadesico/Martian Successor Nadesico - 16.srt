1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,640
‐ [Narrator] Most people believe

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,225
that there is only
one time continuum.

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,523
That was what we believed.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,524
That history was the
same for all of us.

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,646
We never imagined that it might
be possible for someone else

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,694
to be living with a different
history from our own

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,779
until we learned that the
Jovians were doing exactly that.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
(upbeat music in
foreign language)

9
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,763
‐ You certainly
do have a weakness

10
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,011
for these blushing
wallflower types, Megumi.

11
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,675
Is that your maternal side?

12
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,433
‐ Huh? I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

13
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,393
But that doesn’t mean you
can’t come and sit next to us.

14
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,024
‐ Sit between you two ladies?

15
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,562
Oh, I couldn’t do that.

16
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,644
It’s not proper, you know?

17
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,858
‐ Oh, so rigid.

18
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,020
Come on.
(yelps)

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,438
‐ But I might
accidentally touch you

20
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,534
and that’s not proper.

21
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,822
‐ You’re adorable.

22
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,363
‐ No, please don’t stop.

23
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,908
‐ Menato.

24
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,819
‐ [Menato] Why don’t we all
three sit comfortably together?

25
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,658
‐ Please do not sit...

26
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,082
Oh, don’t touch that.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
‐ [Menato] What about this?
‐ [Megumi] Menato.

28
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,372
(giggling)

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,669
(light orchestral music)

30
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,344
‐ That ship is moving
extremely strangely.

31
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,842
‐ Megumi and Menato
must be fighting back.

32
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,512
Can’t we establish a com link?

33
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,632
‐ I’ll try.

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,376
Hey, lizard lover.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,510
Leave those two women alone.

36
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,047
‐ Huh? What the
heck is going on?

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,520
That ugly boy’s face
just appeared in mid‐air.

38
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,681
(screaming)

39
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,639
‐ What did you call me?

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,226
(growling)

41
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,523
(yelling)

42
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,687
‐ Magumi.

43
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,115
Hold on, we’ll be there
as soon as we can.

44
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,031
(screaming)

45
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:12,979
Someone’s attacking us.

46
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,188
‐ Well, what did you expect?

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,359
We’re entering Jovian
controlled space.

48
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,528
There’s no way this
shuttle could make it.

49
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,735
‐ But we can’t
just abandon them.

50
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,116
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right.

51
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,451
Then hang on

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,446
’cause we’re going in.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,997
(ship engine roaring)

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,498
‐ [Nagare] So you were saying?

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,924
‐ [Ryoko] Oh, shut up.

56
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,504
‐ [Yurika] Hey, I
was just thinking.

57
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,127
Did that Jovian spy remind
any of you of somebody we used

58
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:35,835
to know?

59
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,224
‐ [Akito] Huh?

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,550
‐ The pilot who collects
Gekiganger merchandise.

61
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,385
Hmm.

62
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,471
That’s it!

63
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,144
He reminded me of Jiro Yamada!

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,392
And he even looked like him!

65
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,643
‐ Huh?

66
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,815
‐ I thought he was
like Mr. Yamada too.

67
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,103
‐ Maybe he just
pretended to be dead

68
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,478
and then joined the enemy.

69
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,363
Maybe he was a spy all along.

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,650
That’s the kind of plot
twist he’d be into.

71
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,114
‐ You’re blocking my
view screen, Jeno!

72
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,985
‐ The bullet was stopped by the
silver dollar in his pocket?

73
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,621
‐ The bible and metal
lighters are also options.

74
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,201
‐ That’s enough
of this nonsense!

75
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,084
Gai wouldn’t do
something like this.

76
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,911
He liked Gekiganger,
and he liked to show up.

77
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,248
He wouldn’t let
innocent people be hurt.

78
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,132
‐ You mean the Jovians are
actually human beings like us?

79
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,844
‐ Now that the Jovians
have found a way

80
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,592
to send living creatures
through a Chulip,

81
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,514
they can infiltrate us at will.

82
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,643
‐ And the human spies
make it even easier.

83
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,933
‐ Confirming signal!

84
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,602
Descending into
underground docking bay.

85
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,599
Control online.

86
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,610
‐ Good work.

87
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,939
Initiate docking sequence.

88
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,105
‐ Preparing to land.

89
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,152
‐ There’s no way
it could be Gai.

90
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,249
‐ So this is the famous
Shakuyaku, is it?

91
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,584
‐ [Man] Yes.

92
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,088
And from the way they’re
focusing on our PT engine

93
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,631
and job research labs, it
would appear that the enemy

94
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,045
knows exactly what we’re up to.

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,300
‐ Yes, that’s true.

96
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,756
With their human
spies, they’d like

97
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,846
to know our infrastructure.

98
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,473
‐ We can’t afford to
waste time wondering.

99
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,688
Our immediate concern
should be for the Shakuyaku

100
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,851
and its mission.

101
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,558
‐ Do you mean the third
reclamation of Mars?

102
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,979
‐ As cooperating

103
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,278
with the military has yielded
unsatisfactory results,

104
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,281
the chairman has decided to
return to our original plan

105
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:22,914
of action.

106
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,449
What that means is

107
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,623
that the company will require
massive amounts of CCs

108
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,791
from Boson Jumping experiments!

109
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,830
‐ The company, the
company, the company.

110
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,044
Do you think that’s
what the rest

111
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,825
of the human race
really wants, Erina?

112
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:34,827
‐ Well, of course!

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,420
Don’t you want to retake Mars?

114
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,963
Even this crew of lame
brains, blackwoods,

115
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,586
and ne’er‐do‐wells has
bought into that bit

116
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,684
of Nergal propaganda.

117
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,179
‐ Perhaps.

118
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,262
But will they still
follow us once they start

119
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,216
to realize that they’re
being used again?

120
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,678
‐ Shakuyaku will
launch in total secrecy

121
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,849
with a handpicked crew.

122
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,847
The Nedesico will act as a decoy

123
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,109
and draw the enemy’s attention.

124
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,399
The operation will
commence in 12‐‐

125
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,194
(wild laughter)

126
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,527
‐ Ms. Won, do
something with him!

127
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,782
Please!

128
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,532
He demands that
you speak with him!

129
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,034
‐ So what sort of evil scheme
are you brewing up this time?

130
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,699
I sure would love to hear
about it before it happens,

131
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,037
Miss Won.

132
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,872
(wild laughter)

133
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,327
‐ [Man] Admiral,
control yourself!

134
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,497
‐ Fine.

135
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,135
If you really think
you can handle it,

136
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,881
I’ll show you evil.

137
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,546
‐ All right.

138
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,052
Lock the cockpit and close
the breast plate panel.

139
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,022
All the basics are the
same except a lot bigger.

140
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,519
That means it takes more
time to do everything

141
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,142
so no rushing!

142
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,558
Treat her like your
sister, not a girlfriend!

143
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,189
‐ [Men] Yes, sir!

144
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,031
‐ Man, once you figure it
out, it’s really not all

145
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,362
that complex.

146
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,737
‐ Why are their jump
patterns so simple?

147
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,704
‐ It’s like sex.

148
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,083
Only so many ways to do it.

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,910
‐ What’s going on here?

150
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,576
Why do you know so much?

151
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,004
How did Nergal know we
were fighting other humans

152
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,921
when I didn’t?

153
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,081
I demand to know the answers!

154
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,878
Why did the military
tell you and not me?

155
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,211
Why didn’t they trust me?

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,630
You little!

157
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,466
‐ Behave yourself, Admiral.

158
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,814
Dragging a female officer into
your quarters is bad form.

159
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,471
‐ This is none of your business!

160
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,599
‐ You are a dim
bulb, aren’t you?

161
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,772
‐ What you don’t
know is (whispering).

162
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,690
‐ You mean you’re?

163
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,365
‐ Yes, I’m afraid I am.

164
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,738
‐ Oh darn.

165
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,782
These modern security systems
are getting to be too much

166
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,659
for an old packer like me.

167
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,906
‐ Actually, there is a way

168
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,075
to bypass the privacy
lockout circuit.

169
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,464
‐ Ooh, these kids
are so technical.

170
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,503
We can’t allow there to be any
secrets on this ship, can we?

171
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,839
‐ You know what?

172
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,214
You’re right.

173
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,177
‐ Huh?

174
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,314
‐ My, you do have a
way with machines.

175
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,443
‐ What are you doing with
the security system, Ruri?

176
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,150
‐ I just did it.

177
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,476
‐ I’ll get right to the point.

178
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,527
The Jovian lizards were
banished 100 years ago.

179
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,238
‐ Banished?

180
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,204
‐ From the planet Earth.

181
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,237
‐ Gazeta net!

182
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,627
‐ It’s too flexible for
our net to catch it!

183
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,001
‐ That monster keeps
stretching like a rice cake.

184
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,880
‐ Rice cake?

185
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,006
Wait a second!

186
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,670
That’s it!
‐ Do you have an idea?

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,220
‐ Remember back when Junpei

188
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,853
and Miss Manako were eating
rice cakes the other day?

189
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,024
The rice cakes
were soft while hot

190
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,559
but once they cool, they
become firm and solid.

191
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,645
‐ Brilliant plan!

192
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,228
If we can freeze
that monster solid,

193
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,774
‐ Then he won’t be able to
stretch out of our way anymore!

194
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,857
I’m taking the lead!

195
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:45,733
All right!

196
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,819
Let’s Geki in!

197
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,691
Changer!

198
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,360
‐ I hope I’m not interrupting.

199
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,909
If there’s anything
that you are needing,

200
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,914
please don’t hesitate to ask.

201
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:56,866
‐ We’re fine.

202
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,205
‐ Hold on.

203
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,368
I thought we were
your prisoners.

204
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,247
‐ But you’re women
before you’re prisoners

205
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,924
and women should be treated
like delicate flowers.

206
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,838
‐ I see.
‐ I see.

207
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,717
‐ We are not like those ignorant
barbarians back on Earth.

208
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,895
The youth of the Jovian
federation are taught

209
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,182
to conduct themselves properly
in the presence of women.

210
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,187
(screaming)

211
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,690
‐ You’re all fans of
Gekiganger, aren’t you?

212
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,153
‐ It’s the blueprint
of our society.

213
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,573
‐ Wait.

214
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,191
If you’re the captain of
this ship, why were you

215
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,358
in the Daimajin?

216
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,986
Why pilot it yourself?

217
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,493
‐ Surely you must
be joking with me!

218
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,655
Only our finest warriors
can become commanders.

219
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,005
We all must train
in every aspect

220
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,790
of the ship’s mighty functions.

221
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,135
But to truly be a leader, one
must be an ace pilot as well.

222
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:45,421
‐ Hmm?

223
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,755
(screaming)

224
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,508
‐ Oh, don’t worry.

225
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,009
Fluffy’s just a harmless pet.

226
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,341
Come on, I’ll show you.

227
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,926
As you can see, they also
double as computational units

228
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,265
inside the ship.

229
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,268
We’re rather short on
manpower so we make do.

230
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,061
‐ So only a small number
of your people can go

231
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:04,935
through a Chulip?

232
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,563
‐ Yes.

233
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,938
We, the superior male forces,
are the glorious culmination

234
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,277
of 100 years of experiments.

235
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,571
‐ Megumi, are you all right?

236
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,455
‐ I’m okay.

237
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,161
‐ How inconsiderate of me!

238
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,372
I’ll have a medic
summoned at once!

239
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,450
‐ No, I’m fine.

240
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,786
It’s just realizing it’s true,

241
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,039
that they’re really
the Jovian lizards.

242
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,632
How could people who seem so
nice do such horrible things?

243
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,788
‐ Your people have
done even worse things!

244
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,799
‐ Di‐na‐chee‐ro!

245
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,802
You’re all right!

246
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,761
We thought you were dead!

247
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,091
‐ Well, I’m not.

248
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,425
Although things did
get a little hairy

249
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,970
when I was transported to
the moon two weeks ago.

250
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,604
‐ Well, serves you right.

251
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,971
You’re the ones who started
this by dropping Chulips

252
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:42,728
onto Mars.

253
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,139
‐ Chulips?

254
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,647
‐ She means the
dimensional leak gates.

255
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,188
‐ Then say so!

256
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,823
Don’t use such strange
words, you nincompoop!

257
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,899
‐ The words I use aren’t
half as strange as you are.

258
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,316
‐ In any case,

259
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,324
the reason we attacked
Mars two years ago was

260
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,157
because your people were
planning to attack Jupiter.

261
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,744
‐ Planning to do what?

262
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,539
(upbeat music)

263
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,336
‐ 100 years ago a
certain incident occurred

264
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,635
that’s been wiped from the
pages of our history textbooks.

265
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,049
‐ [Man] You see, there were
certain districts on the moon

266
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,640
that sought to
become independent,

267
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,853
so the UE infiltrated
both the separatists

268
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,735
and the moderates and aggravated
the friction between them.

269
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,693
This led to a series of
violent purges now referred

270
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,862
to as the war for
lunar autonomy.

271
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,404
‐ Wait.

272
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,317
I thought the Earth had
nothing to do with the war

273
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,033
for lunar autonomy.

274
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,573
(laughing)

275
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,119
‐ Yes, but you only know the
things that they taught you

276
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,452
to know.

277
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,366
‐ In fact, the Earth was
not only deeply involved

278
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,375
in the Civil War.

279
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,116
It was the UEA of space fleets

280
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,328
that drove the rebel groups out

281
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,537
at gunpoint.

282
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,377
The scattered
remnants disappeared.

283
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,343
First to Mars, then
to the astroid belt

284
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,212
in Jupiter.

285
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,380
End of story.

286
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,217
Or so we thought.

287
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,091
‐ The UE government
eliminated all records

288
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,810
of their existence as if
they’d never even existed.

289
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,350
‐ Why did they have

290
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,563
to erase all the
records concerning them?

291
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,604
‐ To cover up their own role
in fermenting the rebellion.

292
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:12,978
‐ Yes.

293
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,896
And for other reasons as well.

294
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,396
‐ The truth is

295
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,237
that your dirty Earth scum
comrades justified the theft

296
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,613
of our homes in the name

297
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,869
of pacifying an unstable
political situation!

298
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,411
The survivors of the
purge had settled on Mars

299
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,415
when the UEAF attacked again!

300
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,578
They used nuclear warheads
to destroy our new colony.

301
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:36,048
‐ It was all part of a plan
to keep the Earth profitable

302
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,260
and under control.

303
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,510
In the end, Jupiter

304
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,341
and its satellites were
the only place left

305
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,596
for our ancestors
to go, and that was

306
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,760
when we found the artifact.

307
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,097
‐ What artifact?

308
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,484
(suspenseful music)

309
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,108
‐ A factory?

310
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,115
‐ Yes, for the construction
of phase transition engines.

311
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,736
‐ Phase transition engines
and unmanned weapons such

312
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,704
as the Grasshoppers and Jeros.

313
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,454
The Chulips.

314
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,116
‐ Discovering the plant

315
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,463
in Jupiter orbit gave the
separatists the technical base

316
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,080
they needed to survive.

317
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,165
It also gave them the
ability to build the weapons

318
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,423
for their revenge.

319
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,172
‐ This is unbelievable.

320
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,166
If the public ever finds out.

321
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,838
‐ [Erina] Oh, but they won’t.

322
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,176
‐ Yes, they will!

323
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,051
‐ [Erina] You were spying on us?

324
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,305
What kind of captain are you?

325
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,097
‐ [Yurika] One who
cares about her crew!

326
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,770
One who believes that they
have the right to know

327
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,389
why they’re really fighting!

328
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,225
How dare you keep something
like this a secret?

329
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,312
‐ [Erina] It won’t
make a difference!

330
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,476
We’re still at war!

331
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,524
‐ Do you really believe that?

332
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,228
How could you sit there
and watch people go

333
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,608
into battle knowing
that everything

334
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,534
the UEAF has told us for the
last 100 years has been a lie?

335
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,497
‐ Opening Infinity
Cannon Barrels, sir.

336
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,424
May we extrude the Mega
Mass Projector, sir?

337
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,626
‐ You may extend
the Infinity Cannon.

338
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,600
‐ Daimaijin One is
ready for launch!

339
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,099
‐ Break a leg, Gi‐na‐ji‐ro.

340
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,351
‐ I’ll destroy their Contortion
Bomber from the inside.

341
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,016
(laughing)

342
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,524
‐ Wait a second!

343
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,364
What’s going to happen to
our ship, The Nadesico?

344
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,231
‐ Unfortunately,
we have no choice.

345
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,148
‐ It will be destroyed.

346
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,194
‐ [Messenger] Excuse me, ma’am.

347
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,609
Here are your tapes.

348
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,355
‐ They’re just copies.

349
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,448
You can keep them.

350
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,240
‐ Oh no.

351
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,785
We wouldn’t dare.

352
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,196
‐ So you completed duplicating
the long lost episode,

353
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,196
have you?

354
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,447
‐ Yes, sir!

355
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,826
And the condition was
as superb as you said!

356
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,123
‐ What was that?

357
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,496
Are you talking about the
legendary lost 13th episode

358
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,083
of Gekiganger?

359
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,050
‐ Not only that but copies of
episode nine and 33 as well.

360
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:40,921
‐ What?

361
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:41,587
Are you serious?

362
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,014
(exclamations)

363
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,762
(exciting music)

364
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,814
‐ No matter how
powerful our foe may be,

365
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,139
‐ [Group] The superior male
force will never be defeated!

366
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,355
Our fists and shields
shall shatter our enemy!

367
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,765
‐ Daimaijin, go!

368
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,154
‐ Remember, Earth is our home!

369
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,574
‐ Our blue planet Earth.

370
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,533
‐ [Group] We will protect it!

371
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,238
Geki gun out!

372
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,950
‐ [Ruri] The colonies distortion
field is starting to fail.

373
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,999
‐ That’s not good.

374
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
‐ Raise the fields
to full power!

375
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,835
‐ How’s the Shakayaku?

376
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,326
‐ It doesn’t look promising.

377
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,048
They’re still in the process
of attaching the last module.

378
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,549
‐ Fire!

379
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,551
(explosion)

380
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,097
‐ The Shakuyaku!

381
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,972
‐ If only the Earthlings
appreciated life as we do,

382
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
I would not have to
kill so many of them.

383
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,606
(blasts and explosions)

384
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,035
‐ We’ve got a limited supply
of inner ship missiles

385
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:45,691
so make ’em count!

386
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,738
‐ I understand!

387
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,275
We’ve got your
jump pattern code.

388
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,290
Now you’re mine.

389
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,619
‐ Move! We’ve gotta hurry, men!

390
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,156
There’s no reason why (yelling).

391
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,295
‐ [Men] Yes, sir!

392
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,917
‐ Are you really sure you
wanna try this, Captain?

393
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,305
The Nadesico

394
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,261
and the Shakayaku use
different electrical systems.

395
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,301
We might explode!

396
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,126
‐ That’s fine.

397
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,050
Don’t worry.

398
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,756
I believe in you.

399
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,314
‐ Then I’ll try not
to screw up then.

400
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,983
Wait three minutes.

401
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,601
‐ Are you really sure we
can attach the Y unit?

402
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,186
The Nadesico’s main
power grid is different

403
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,364
from the Shakayaku’s.

404
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,072
‐ I’m aware of that, Miss Won,

405
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,990
but the Shakayaku has been
crushed and it’s such a waste

406
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,239
to leave it.

407
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,741
We should conserve our
resources whenever possible.

408
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,834
Ruri, have the factory people
evacuated onto The Nadesico?

409
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,002
‐ Aye.

410
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,249
‐ Damn it!

411
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,831
If we could use the catapult,
we could help Tinkawa.

412
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,328
‐ Yes.

413
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,298
But it’s not the same now that
we’re fighting other humans.

414
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,709
(blasts)

415
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,299
‐ Justice will always prevail!

416
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,353
‐ Will you shut up
and die already?

417
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,563
‐ Akito!

418
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,732
‐ They’re not what
you think they are!

419
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,980
‐ They’re forcing
you to say that!

420
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,890
‐ [Megumi] You’re wrong, Akito!

421
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,479
Please stop attacking them!

422
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,523
‐ [Minato] I wanna make it clear

423
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,357
so this man’s honor
is not questioned.

424
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,652
We are not hostages, Akito.

425
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,775
‐ We’ve all been
tricked and lied to!

426
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,912
These people are
humans just like us!

427
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,281
‐ [Akito] We know that!

428
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,696
They’re descendants of people
banished from the moon!

429
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,195
‐ Please move out of the way.

430
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,905
Our only target is the
battleship equipped

431
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,207
with the phase
transition power plant.

432
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,461
‐ I know!

433
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,581
And you’ll never
touch The Nadesico!

434
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,288
‐ Why are we fighting
a war based on lies?

435
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,877
‐ Don’t you understand at all?

436
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,013
It’s too late to argue about
whose fault this war is!

437
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,089
It’s too late for forgiveness!

438
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:30,966
‐ [Megumi] Akito!

439
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,140
(screaming)
(exciting music)

440
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,137
‐ It’s a distortion field!

441
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,692
‐ It’s The Nadesico.

442
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,732
I don’t believe it.

443
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,451
‐ [Ruri] The enemy robot is
trapped inside our field.

444
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,701
‐ That certainly ought to
bring the odds against Akito

445
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,281
down a little bit.

446
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,658
‐ Except Akito can’t Boson
Jump and that Jovian spy can.

447
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,913
‐ He won’t.

448
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,415
‐ And what makes
you so sure of that?

449
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,456
‐ Because both Megumi and
Minato are onboard that robot

450
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,332
with him.

451
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,826
‐ That’s right.

452
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,337
Normal humans can’t
survive being Boson Jumped.

453
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,590
‐ So why should he care?

454
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,461
That man is our enemy.

455
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,010
He’ll sacrifice them both.

456
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,259
‐ I’m afraid I have greater
faith in the good in people.

457
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,175
‐ Hurry!

458
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,353
You’ve got to leave now!

459
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,771
‐ I can’t do that.

460
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,479
‐ I’ve never seen
such treachery.

461
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,312
How could you involve women
in a fight between men?

462
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,858
‐ Well, I’m a woman!

463
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,769
‐ What’s happening?

464
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,235
‐ This is for the
people on the moon!

465
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,949
And that’s for the people
you killed attacking Mars!

466
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,860
‐ Please, Akito,
you’ve got to stop!

467
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,367
‐ I’m not done with you!

468
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,619
‐ That Daimajin no longer
has the ability to fight!

469
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,755
I’ll let these two
off and then you

470
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,039
and I will settle this
on the field of battle.

471
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,834
‐ No!

472
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,418
Please, please stop this!

473
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,961
What’s the sense in doing
something senseless like this!

474
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,457
Akito!

475
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,467
‐ [Akito] I’m doing this to
protect the Earth, Megumi!

476
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,011
‐ And does doing it

477
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,224
to protect the Earth make
you incapable of being wrong?

478
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,473
Please listen to me!

479
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,095
If killing each other is the
only way to end this madness,

480
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,143
why are we all fighting
a war nobody wants?

481
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,307
Why can’t we all go home
and watch Gekiganger

482
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,516
for our space battles?

483
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,518
Please, Akito.

484
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,819
Stop fighting.

485
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,440
What happened to
the Akito I knew?

486
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,318
The Akito who hated war?

487
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,235
‐ Megumi, you know I never
wanted to be a soldier,

488
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:26,458
but I can’t ignore the
horrible things I see anymore.

489
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,960
It’s not like it seemed

490
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,792
when I was a kid watching
Gekiganger and dreaming

491
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,917
of being a pilot.

492
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,213
‐ The UEAF fleet is
approaching lunar orbit.

493
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,505
‐ Looks like they were watching
to see the outcome first.

494
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,724
‐ So, once again, blind
luck hands you the victory,

495
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,176
Captain.

496
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,556
But do you really
believe that you can keep

497
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,103
from dirtying your
hands forever?

498
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,639
‐ [Akito] Go.

499
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,438
‐ Thank you.

500
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,442
Could you tell me your name?

501
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,944
My name is‐‐
‐ No.

502
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,395
I don’t wanna learn the name
of the man I’m trying to kill.

503
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,398
‐ [Man] I see.

504
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,199
Then farewell.

505
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,452
‐ You know that I
did what I had to do.

506
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,328
‐ I know that you did.

507
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,545
I think that your passion
is what attracted me to you

508
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,127
in the first place.

509
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,420
It’s like that time you
had to rescue the captain

510
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,805
and me when we were
adrift in outer space.

511
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,051
You were more worried
about her than me,

512
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,554
but you were willing to
sacrifice her until you figured

513
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,547
out a better way.

514
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,273
‐ It’s not that simple.

515
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,391
‐ No.

516
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,055
If you weren’t the
kind of person you are,

517
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,354
I wouldn’t have fallen for you.

518
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,188
I’m sorry we ever met.

519
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:33,864
‐ Megumi!

520
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,941
‐ Don’t worry, kid.

521
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,567
There’s lots of other
fish in the sea.

522
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,863
‐ This isn’t some kind of
a game we’re talking about!

523
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,618
And I just let her go.

524
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,199
‐ [Ruri] Permission
has been granted

525
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,786
to transfer the evacuated
personnel, changing heading

526
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,503
to the specified colony.

527
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:52,961
We’re all idiots.

528
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,222
(foreign pop music)

529
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,227
(exciting music)

530
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,068
‐ Hello!

531
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,362
Admiral Nu‐mi‐ta‐ki here.

532
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,857
My head is about to
explode with everything

533
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,318
that’s been happening!

534
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,196
Can you believe that the
top brass is blaming me

535
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,905
for The Nadesico crew
finding out the truth

536
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,203
about the Jovians?

537
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,618
How could I when
they never told me?

538
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,214
The only thing that can save
my career is a brand new robot!

539
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
What?

540
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,999
No, not a plastic
metal kit, you idiot!

541
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,876
It’s the next episode
of Martian Nadesico!

542
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,875
It was a reunion
that came too late!

543
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,507
I’ve got a bad
feeling about this!
