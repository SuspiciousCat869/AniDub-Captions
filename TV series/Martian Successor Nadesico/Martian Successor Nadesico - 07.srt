1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,690
‐ Perhaps our biggest
mistake was assuming that

2
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,019
we could actually win,
however, as the Jovian ships

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,267
unleash their ambush,
it was obvious that

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,148
we were hopelessly outmatched.

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,325
If we could’ve saved the
lives of the survivors

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,363
in exchange for our own, we
would’ve fought to the death

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,620
but such was not to be.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,370
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,389
(sings in foreign language)

10
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,339
‐ Three, two, one!
(yells)

11
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,845
(laughs)

12
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,796
‐ Time to get to know Nadesico.

13
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,136
Hi kids, this is Miss Ruri.

14
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,642
She’s going to tell you
all about the Nadesico!

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,847
‐ Whatever.

16
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,886
(playful music)

17
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,107
To begin with, do you know
what makes the Nadesico

18
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,323
fly through space?
‐ Huh?

19
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,573
‐ No I don’t Miss
Ruri, what makes‐‐

20
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,486
‐ Oh, she’s so cute.
‐ Go, go, go!

21
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,026
‐ No, I must resist.

22
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,489
‐ Ruri looks so cute
in those coveralls.

23
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,158
‐ The sad thing is, I used
to do shows just like this,

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,287
only worse.

25
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,334
‐ Okay, miss rabbit
person, since you asked,

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,497
let’s talk about the Nadesico’s
space transition engine.

27
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,959
Here, follow me please.

28
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,176
(laughs evilly)

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,680
To drive this mill, which
tank of water has the greatest

30
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,313
amount of potential energy?

31
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,769
‐ Well, I really don’t
know Miss Ruri, I mean,

32
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,349
I’m just a rabbit, you know.
‐ I see.

33
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,807
‐ [Ruri] Well, it’s this one,
the one with the greatest

34
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,726
amount of kinetic potential.

35
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,316
This represents the
greater degree‐‐

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
‐ Cut!

37
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,526
Hold it, Ruri, this
program is being made

38
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,203
for little children.

39
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,911
Now, read from the script
like you’re supposed to do

40
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,121
and face the camera and,
for goodness sakes, smile!

41
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,951
‐ Smile?
‐ That’s right, Ruri.

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,536
‐ Just relax and pretend
like you’re a normal kid.

43
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,372
‐ Alright, let’s start
with the water tanks again.

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
‐ What is going on here, just
want is the meaning of this

45
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,546
ridiculous stunt, Ms. Versange?

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,510
The barrage from the enemy’s
gravity cannons has left us

47
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,891
in dire circumstances, our
distortion field is unstable

48
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,221
and our engines can’t generate
enough thrust to achieve

49
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,887
escape velocity from
Mars’ gravity well.

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,485
Is producing this video
your idea of a sick joke?

51
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,901
‐ No, my idea of a sick
joke was your so‐called

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,230
rescue mission.

53
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,614
‐ Please, Ms. Versange
is producing this video

54
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,284
to explain what happened.

55
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,322
I know I can’t ever be forgiven
for such a horrible mistake

56
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,325
but at least I can try to
keep it from happening again.

57
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,578
Please, let us film.

58
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,042
‐ Hideous.
‐ Huh?

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,960
‐ There’s nothing to forgive
since you were operating under

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,830
information that was inaccurate.

61
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,575
If anything, the blame
belongs to Nergal.

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,168
(sighs)

63
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,753
But, of course, I forget that
I feel a little different

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,550
from most people.
‐ Mm‐hm.

65
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,051
‐ In my heart, that is.

66
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,303
‐ Yes, even I find you strange.

67
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,467
‐ Well, I am.

68
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,555
You see, I have no
memories from before I was

69
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,928
eight years old, at least,
we think I was eight.

70
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,098
I was found alone and abandoned
in the deserts of Mars.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,058
Maybe that’s the reason
I find it so hard to be

72
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,557
attached to anything.

73
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,108
It may sound rather callous,
but who’s dead and who’s alive

74
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,033
really doesn’t mean
that much to me.

75
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,821
Alright, if you’re all
ready, let’s continue

76
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,316
with the filming, shall we?

77
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,295
‐ I just want something.

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,251
That means there’s
still hope, so...

79
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,505
Just take me now, Akito.

80
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,877
(yells)

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,670
(grunts)

82
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,546
‐ Why the heck did dream that?

83
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,131
This is nuts!

84
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,546
There’s no way I’m interested
in that female nutcase!

85
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,015
Isn’t that right, Guy?

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,970
Huh?

87
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,228
(yells)

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,519
Where’s my little guy,
somebody took my solid metal

89
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,945
casting limited collector’s
edition Ganga three, ahh!

90
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,903
(grunts)

91
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,645
Oh, Admiral, I’m sorry, sir.

92
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,740
Are you alright?

93
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,323
(groans)

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,489
‐ Why the vacuum that
existed immediately after

95
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,328
the big bang contained a
very high energy potential.

96
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,662
‐ So, do you like it?
‐ Yes, sir.

97
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,290
‐ But it’s‐‐

98
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,675
‐ Yes, there may be a little
non regulation stimulant

99
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,094
in that iced tea.

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,050
‐ Both the military and
Nergal might frown on that.

101
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,633
(slurps)
‐ Hmm.

102
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,007
‐ In this example, the
balloon is trapping water

103
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,676
from the tank, therefore,
its energy rating is lower

104
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,684
than that of the water tank
itself; do you understand?

105
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,269
So if there was a vacuum that
had even less potential energy

106
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,864
then by phase transitional
the vacuum surround the ship

107
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,402
into a state where it can hold‐‐

108
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,945
‐ What does this guy want;
am I in trouble again?

109
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,397
‐ Does that bother you?
‐ Huh?

110
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,530
‐ Yeah, I guess.

111
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,244
‐ Well, I’ll just
leave this here then.

112
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,616
Since you’re off duty,
you can enjoy it.

113
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,412
‐ Oh, thanks.

114
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,947
(shrieks)

115
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,248
My Ganga!

116
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,464
No, no, don’t touch it,
it’s a collector’s...

117
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,463
(groans)

118
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,054
(screams)

119
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,379
I’m coming, Guy, my little guy!

120
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,717
‐ Didn’t you just shoot
that off with your finger?

121
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,141
‐ [Versange] Don’t let
details like that bother you.

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,810
‐ Dang it, where did
the little arm piece go?

123
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,220
I can’t believe you lost it!

124
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,348
‐ Hey, Akito, I’m feeling much
better; I’m just telling you

125
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,346
because I know you’re worried.

126
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,648
‐ Incidentally, who was it
that came up with the idea

127
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,572
of phase transitioning
vacuum anyway, was it you?

128
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,323
‐ Well actually, the truth
is that no one invented

129
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,574
any of it, Nergal just found it.

130
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,866
‐ You found it?

131
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,329
Just what does that mean.
‐ Bravo, bravo, magnificent.

132
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,331
‐ What a wonderful idea,
what a wonderful program.

133
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,084
You were just brilliant, Gote.

134
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,706
‐ Uh, well, actually‐‐

135
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,592
‐ However, I’m afraid I’m
going to have to ask you

136
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,421
to stop now, we have to
ration our electricity.

137
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,008
‐ [Girls] Bye, see you again.

138
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,892
‐ Oh.

139
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,799
Did you understand
that at all, Izumi?

140
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,430
Ew, creepy, you’re sleeping
with your eyes open again!

141
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,768
(groans)

142
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,353
‐ Well, time to
get back to work.

143
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,015
‐ Thanks for returning
this, Tinkawa, do you mind

144
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,027
if I try some?
‐ No, go ahead.

145
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,819
‐ Your family name is Tinkawa,

146
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,035
of the Utopia colony Tinkawas?

147
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,073
‐ Uh, yeah.
‐ Really?

148
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,527
‐ [Versange] I’m amazed
they managed to get you

149
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,287
to serve on this ship.
‐ Huh, why’s that?

150
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,871
(gasps)

151
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,965
‐ Uh...

152
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,419
‐ This is very strange.
‐ What is?

153
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,790
‐ Well, when I look at you,
it feels as if I’ve known you

154
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,547
for a long time.
(screen buzzes)

155
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,299
‐ Excuse me, aren’t you two
getting a little too close?

156
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,302
‐ Oh, did you want something?
‐ Uh‐huh.

157
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,644
‐ Oh yes, that’s right, I
need the two of you to come up

158
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,139
to the bridge for a
very important briefing.

159
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,808
‐ Well, let’s go.
‐ Can I ask?

160
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,812
‐ Ask what?

161
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,233
‐ [Tiso surprised that I was

162
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,561
on this ship?
‐ Hm.

163
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,729
‐ [Man] Status report.

164
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,155
‐ [Yurica] The friend or
foe recognition signal

165
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,323
just came back.

166
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,151
It matches records, sir.
‐ Did it; I see.

167
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,858
‐ Then I guess there’s no doubt.

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,820
‐ But why, it makes no sense.

169
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,158
The crocus was sucked into
a chulup back on earth,

170
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,794
so how can it be here on Mars?

171
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,620
And we destroyed the chulup
that swallowed the crocus

172
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,496
and that pansy.

173
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,172
It just doesn’t make sense.
‐ Of course, it does.

174
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,552
‐ A chulup isn’t so much
a ship as it is a gate.

175
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,132
The inside of a chulup is an
opening that passes underneath

176
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,796
normal space like a tunnel.

177
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,804
Thus, an object that goes in
one side comes out wherever

178
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,307
the other side of the chulup is.

179
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,849
‐ Are you saying that all the
lizard ships that come out

180
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,853
of the chulups attacking earth
are coming from here on Mars?

181
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,187
(somber music)

182
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,533
‐ No, at least not just
from here on Mars anyway.

183
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,031
I mean, that other ship that
was sucked into the chulup

184
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,781
at the same time, um.
‐ The pansy.

185
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,335
‐ Yes, there’s no sign of
the pansy which means that

186
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,739
one chulup may go to
many different locations.

187
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,700
‐ [All] Ah.

188
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,997
‐ [Yurica] Let’s prepare
a boarding party.

189
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,331
‐ I’m afraid there’s
not time for that,

190
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,456
we must continue onward.

191
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,173
‐ Are you sure, there may
still be survivors on the ship,

192
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,514
right, sir?

193
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,679
‐ Let’s follow Nergal’s
guidelines for now.

194
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,389
‐ Hold on a second.

195
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,390
I have some questions
for you Admiral.

196
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,521
‐ You’re late Tinkawa, I
trust you have a good excuse.

197
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,904
‐ Tell me, Admiral, is it true
that you led the earth fleet

198
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,480
during the first battle of Mars?

199
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,315
‐ Well, you can listen to
war stories later, can’t you?

200
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,951
‐ What are you talking about,
everybody knows the Admiral

201
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,411
was in charge during the battle.

202
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,029
You did know that, didn’t you?
‐ You’re wrong, I didn’t know.

203
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,577
‐ Mr. Prospector never told me
that our leader was the hero

204
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,834
who caused a chulup to fall
on top of the Utopia colony.

205
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,206
(dramatic music)

206
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,173
‐ All hands aboard the ship!
(yells)

207
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,514
(screams)

208
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,683
‐ You’re the one,
you killed them all!

209
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,894
(screams)

210
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,348
‐ It’s no use struggling, I
can’t believe you actually

211
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,807
attacked the admiral.

212
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,359
‐ It’s time to mellow out
and think happy thoughts.

213
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,106
‐ Still, you gotta admire
someone with that kind of guts.

214
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,495
‐ In a bizarre,
suicidal way, I guess.

215
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,374
‐ I don’t care what
the circumstances were,

216
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,369
it’s unforgivable for
a member of this crew

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,911
to assault the admiral.

218
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,794
Yurica, I mean, Captain,
you’ve got to punish him.

219
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,124
‐ I know, June, but
what kind of punishment

220
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,828
would be appropriate?

221
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,290
I’ll think it over, okay?

222
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,458
‐ Well, we can discuss
that later, Captain.

223
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,717
In the meantime, let’s
all look at this.

224
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,259
This is our destination,
a research facility

225
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,803
at Mars North Pole.

226
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,256
With luck, we may be able
to obtain a spare face

227
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,677
transition engine there.

228
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,807
‐ Admiral?

229
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,983
‐ Let’s send Tavalis
ahead to scout it out.

230
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,903
(somber violin music)

231
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,651
(muffled grunts)

232
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,823
(upbeat music)

233
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,833
(wind howls)

234
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,869
‐ Man, I can’t believe how
slow this land frame is.

235
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,255
‐ [Woman] You’re the one who
wanted to pile up weapons.

236
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,960
‐ Yeah!
‐ Oh shut up you make me sick!

237
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,382
‐ Man, this snow is abominable.

238
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,967
Abominable snowman.
(snickers)

239
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,389
‐ So, just where is
this laboratory anyway?

240
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,680
‐ Well, I’ve been cross
referencing it on all the maps

241
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,144
but I haven’t been able to
find it listed on any of them.

242
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,103
‐ Huh, wait a second,
this isn’t right!

243
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,485
‐ You mean, it’s
to the left, Izumi?

244
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,151
You said it so seriously
that I thought you meant‐‐

245
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,069
(screams)

246
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,941
Izumi, can you see anything?

247
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,736
‐ Only subjectively, if it’s
not where we can see it,

248
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,032
then that means‐‐

249
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,665
(suspenseful music)

250
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,831
(lasers fire)

251
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,989
‐ Rioko, it’s coming
your way, look out!

252
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,037
‐ Huh?
(crashes)

253
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,371
(screams)

254
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,128
‐ Oh this sucks, I can’t even
dodge in this piece of junk.

255
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,341
(gasps)
(drill whirs)

256
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,052
‐ Hey, that thing’s
got a drill, no way.

257
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,093
No freakin’ way!

258
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,049
Izumi, Ituro, Tinkawa, please!

259
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,388
(crashes)

260
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,523
(suspenseful music)

261
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,414
(sighs)
Thanks guys.

262
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,085
‐ So, whose name
did you just yell?

263
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,003
(giggles)

264
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,331
‐ Yes, I heard it too, Izumi.

265
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,665
‐ Uh, no, you guys
just misunderstood.

266
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,881
I just forgot that he
wasn’t here, that’s all.

267
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,882
‐ Tinkawa.
(sighs)

268
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,185
‐ [Rioko] Alright, name your
price, you blackmailers.

269
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
‐ [Ituro] Banana
pudding for a month.

270
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,506
‐ [Izumi] And there’s
this cute little tea set

271
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,045
I’ve been admiring.

272
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,598
‐ [Admiral] There are five
chulups surround the perimeter

273
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,563
of the lab.
‐ This doesn’t look good.

274
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,602
‐ [Man] No, but it is the sworn
duty of all Nergal employees

275
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,767
to retake that
facility at any cost,

276
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,895
that’s section 22
of your contract.

277
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,533
‐ Why don’t you just order
us into an obvious trap?

278
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,900
‐ I’d really prefer not to
subject the lives or our crew

279
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,408
to danger so recklessly.

280
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,199
‐ We’ll use the elder ship?
‐ What ship?

281
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,914
‐ [Admiral] The crocus.

282
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,204
‐ [Man] Come on you‐‐

283
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,287
‐ I really think you should
reconsider this, Admiral.

284
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,624
It’s far too dangerous,
let me go instead.

285
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,458
‐ No, I’m afraid you don’t
have the proper training,

286
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,003
Mr. Hori, besides, all
we’re doing right now

287
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,629
is taking a survey.

288
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,554
‐ Well if that’s the case, why
are you making me come along?

289
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,893
‐ [Admiral] Consider
it your punishment.

290
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,049
(giggles)

291
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,307
‐ Yes, I do believe
he will, right, Akito?

292
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:32,099
(wind blows)
(door whirs)

293
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,232
I was told that the crocus
disappeared from earth

294
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,318
about two months ago but this
ship appears to have been

295
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,414
buried in ice for
at least that long.

296
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,659
It takes the Nadesico
six weeks to get to Mars

297
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,412
with her engines at full power.

298
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,873
Obviously, it took the
crocus far less time.

299
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,366
‐ Are you saying that
chulups can send things

300
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,667
through space instantaneously?

301
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,671
That sounds like something
from that Ganga cartoon.

302
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,303
‐ It sounds a little fantastic,
but I think the fact that

303
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,420
the crocus somehow got to Mars
months before the Nadesico,

304
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,008
speaks for itself.

305
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,805
In my research on the enemy
vessels, I’ve noticed that

306
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,808
when ships emerge from the
chulups, there’s a recognizable

307
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,231
emission of both photo
gravitron and bose particles.

308
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,353
(yawns)
In other words‐‐

309
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,859
‐ Look out!
(grunts)

310
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,364
Oh crap.
(yells)

311
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,026
(lasers fire)

312
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,576
(sighs)

313
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,540
‐ Why did you bother
trying to save me?

314
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,499
I don’t deserve your protection.

315
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,749
‐ I acted before I
could think, that’s why.

316
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,050
(buttons beep)

317
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,420
‐ The propulsion nozzle
seem to be clogged with ice.

318
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,129
Someone will have
to clean them out.

319
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,798
‐ You mean me.

320
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,966
‐ Yes, though I believe Miss
Versange will have to show you

321
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,065
how to do it properly.
‐ Alright.

322
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,599
‐ [Versange] That’s strange,
the nozzles look like they’re

323
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,519
clear enough to‐‐
‐ What the hell!

324
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,862
‐ [Admiral] Get back,
the ship is taking off.

325
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,903
(gasps)

326
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,739
‐ [Woman] The crocus appears
to be lifting off, Captain.

327
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,253
‐ Well, it certainly
seems to be operational.

328
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,291
‐ The admiral really did it!

329
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,375
(mechanical whirring)

330
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,378
‐ Greetings, Captain, as you
can see, I’ve armed my guns

331
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,262
and aimed them at
the Nadesico’s home.

332
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,471
‐ Say what?

333
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,340
‐ The enemy is the
other way, Admiral.

334
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,466
‐ [Admiral] Change your course.

335
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,013
‐ The admiral wants us
to enter the open chulup

336
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,685
in front of us.
‐ Enter the chulup?

337
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,184
‐ Are you mad, sir?
‐ Please, Admiral.

338
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,227
‐ Just look at the damage
the crocus sustained.

339
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,600
The Nadesico won’t fair any
better inside the chulup.

340
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,439
‐ Are you saying that
the admiral wants to

341
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,903
destroy the Nadesico?
‐ It doesn’t make sense.

342
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,284
‐ Oh, yes it does, he’s
trying to cover his mistakes.

343
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,323
Can’t you see that’s why he’s
going to destroy the Nadesico

344
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,737
and all of the evidence?

345
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,083
‐ If that was true, you’re
the first one that he’d kill.

346
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,788
(gun fires)

347
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,661
‐ Dammit, he’s shooting at us.

348
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,790
Huh?
‐ It’s the Jovians.

349
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,706
‐ Enemy fleet approaching,
145 degrees to fort.

350
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,804
Elevation 80 degrees.
‐ Oh great.

351
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,260
‐ [Tinkawa] As if we weren’t
having enough problems.

352
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,509
‐ [Man] So we can either fight
the crocus and the Jovians

353
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,133
or plunge into the chulup.

354
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,220
‐ [Woman] Between the two, I
think I’ll take the chulup.

355
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,303
‐ [Murray] What, are you
crazy, you know how much

356
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,720
this ship cost; we can’t just
throw away down some wormhole.

357
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,308
‐ Murray, pull back and
recover Akito’s estavalis.

358
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,444
Minato, plot out the entry
vector for that chulup,

359
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
on the double!

360
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,016
‐ Captain, it specifically
says in your contract

361
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,360
that in this situation, we
have to stand and fight.

362
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,486
Now, if you maneuver to a
better location, you can destroy

363
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,872
the crocus and‐‐
(yells)

364
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,781
‐ Don’t you have any faith in
the judgment of the admiral

365
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:38,708
that you selected?
(grunts)

366
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,791
‐ Dammit, dammit!
‐ Wait, Tinkawa!

367
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,801
‐ Don’t do it, Yurica,
what in the hell

368
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,089
are you thinking about?

369
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,683
(engines roar)

370
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,266
‐ Very good, Captain, I knew
that you would figure it out.

371
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,309
(suspenseful music)

372
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,483
‐ [Woman] We are not
entering the chulup, Captain.

373
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,312
‐ Um, are you sure
about this Captain,

374
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,767
I’ve got a bad feeling.

375
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,687
‐ [Woman] The crocus is
following directly behind us.

376
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,032
‐ What the hell are you doing?

377
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,195
Are you insane, you’ve
got to turn back.

378
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,412
Yurica, please, didn’t you
hear us say that every single

379
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,496
person on the crocus was dead?

380
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,369
Do you want us to end
up just like them?

381
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,416
‐ That might not happen, Akito,
we have the distortion field

382
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,883
to protect us.

383
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,211
‐ [Woman] Steady as she goes,
maintaining the stable field

384
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,836
is our highest priority.

385
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,633
‐ Are you out of your mind?
‐ Don’t you understand yet?

386
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,507
‐ The admiral did this
all to give us a chance

387
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,804
at escaping Mars.
‐ That can’t be!

388
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,678
‐ [Tinkawa] That’s impossible,
this isn’t making any sense.

389
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,226
‐ [Woman] Captain, the
crocus has turned around

390
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,350
and is now blocking the
front of the chulup.

391
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,937
‐ [Man] There’s no way he can
fight in that piece of junk.

392
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,685
Is there?
(crashes)

393
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,236
‐ What’s he’ doing?

394
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,821
‐ If the crocus were to
self‐destruct, the Jovians

395
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,164
would be unable to
get to the Nadesico.

396
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,080
‐ Why are you all trying to
make this look so honorable?

397
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,079
‐ Admiral, don’t do this,
the Nadesico still needs you

398
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,124
to guide us with your
strength and wisdom.

399
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,498
There’s so much I don’t
know yet, so many things

400
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,094
I still need you to teach me.

401
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,338
‐ No, I’m afraid there’s
really nothing left for me

402
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,711
to show you, my dear.

403
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,167
I believe that this course
is the best way left

404
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,298
to protect the ones I care
about and to make amends.

405
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,968
‐ What’s that mean?
‐ I cannot tell you.

406
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,677
‐ I can only hope that someday
each and every one of you

407
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,186
will come to understand
what’s truly important.

408
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,900
(lasers fire)

409
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,650
I was not a good admiral.

410
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,355
I probably was no better a man.

411
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,415
Here I am spending my last
minutes forcing others

412
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,949
to abide by my wishes
but let me just say this,

413
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,156
that Nadesico is your
ship, it belongs to you.

414
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,038
All of the anger, the
hatred, and the passion,

415
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,594
all of what you feel is yours
and can never be taken‐‐

416
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,339
‐ Admiral!

417
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,843
(explodes)

418
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,970
‐ Turn back.
‐ I can’t.

419
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,635
‐ It’s as if some invisible
force is pulling us in.

420
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,813
‐ The chulup’s opening
has been destroyed.

421
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,193
‐ Dammit, why couldn’t have
saved yourself, old fool?

422
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,035
Don’t you know that
I’m lost without you?

423
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,151
‐ Um, does anyone know
where we’re going?

424
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,488
You know, there’s an episode
of Ganga that’s just like this.

425
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,825
One of the heroes dies
protecting his friends,

426
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,042
it seemed so cool.

427
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,833
I never thought something
like that can happen to me.

428
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,590
(sighs)
And why did we have to be

429
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,799
saved by a lowlife
murderer like him?

430
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,550
He only did it because he
had run out of options,

431
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,015
it wasn’t courage.
‐ Tinkawa.

432
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,391
‐ I found this in the
tea server you returned.

433
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,928
He wrote this to you
even before you found out

434
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,477
about his past.

435
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,940
You’re the only person he let
something behind for, Tinkawa.

436
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,982
He never intended to
leave this planet alive.

437
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,359
‐ And what does that mean?

438
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,204
Should I just forgive him?

439
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,451
Why the hell do I have
to owe him anything?

440
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,582
He took the coward’s way
out by dying like that.

441
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,831
How can one life pay for all
those who were slaughtered

442
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,041
because of him?

443
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,081
‐ Since when has
death been fair?

444
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,294
‐ Do your really thing he
came all the way to Mars

445
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,537
just to kill himself?

446
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,958
‐ Doing something stupid to
make up for something else

447
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,467
you’ve done is pretty
idiotic anyway.

448
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,260
At some point you have
to accept responsibility.

449
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,886
‐ I know, but who’s going
to guide us from now on?

450
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,683
I relied on his wisdom
and his experience.

451
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,017
I don’t know if I
can do it on my own.

452
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,942
(toy clatters)

453
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,725
‐ [Man] Well, you look
lovely as usual, Irena.

454
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,950
‐ [Irena] The Nadesico
has left Mars, sir.

455
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,570
But they have suffered
tremendous losses.

456
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,488
‐ Well, that’s pretty much
what we expected, wasn’t it?

457
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,906
I suppose it can’t be helped.

458
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,504
Let’s move on to plan B.

459
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,209
‐ Hmm, maybe I should
board the Nadesico as well.

460
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,541
‐ [Man] Get me the commander
of the United Earth Forces,

461
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,376
tell them I’ve decided it’s
time to kiss and make up.

462
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,600
(sings in foreign language)

463
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,188
