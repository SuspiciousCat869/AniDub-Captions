1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,353
‐ [Woman] I’d rather not
talk about what happened

2
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,729
in the last episode.

3
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,855
At the moment we’re on
patrol around the moon.

4
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,192
There’s supposed to
be something up here,

5
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,947
but so far it’s been
really uneventful.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,620
This could be good, but
it could also be bad.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,700
(bouncy pop music)

8
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,717
(woman singing in
foreign language)

9
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,737
(woman singing in
foreign language)

10
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,127
(woman singing in
foreign language)

11
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,812
(woman singing in
foreign language)

12
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,948
(woman singing in
foreign language)

13
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,005
(whooshing)

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,377
‐ I see the first
star, look, Dad!

15
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,756
‐ That’s good, Rioko.

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,432
Now I want you to
find that special star

17
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,390
that shines inside yourself.

18
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,471
‐ The what?

19
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,135
‐ Everyone has a star inside,

20
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,143
a special talent,
something you’re best at.

21
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,635
The person who knows
what her special star is

22
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,768
will have a life
filled with happiness.

23
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,605
‐ What’s my star?

24
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,985
What is it, Papa?

25
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,122
(woman mumbles, groans)

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,000
‐ Stupid memories.

27
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,093
(whimsical music)

28
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,338
‐ Be a star.

29
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,177
Be a star.

30
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,259
Be a star!

31
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,434
Be a star!

32
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,142
These stupid Be a Star
posters are everywhere.

33
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,023
Hm?

34
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,519
What’s going on here?

35
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,985
‐ Oh yeah, a beauty contest.

36
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,404
Heels and swimsuits.

37
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,364
‐ Did you order all these
posters special delivery?

38
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,282
‐ So are you two ladies
going to enter the contest?

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,112
‐ Huh?

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,196
‐ Just what is going on here?

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,531
What are these?

42
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,488
‐ Posters.

43
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:21,986
‐ And what’s on them?

44
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,873
‐ A girl.

45
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,037
And the young lady
who wins the contest

46
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,916
will also get a
recording contract!

47
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,133
You could be an idol singer!

48
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,462
‐ Oh!

49
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,467
‐ So why wasn’t I told
about this beauty contest?

50
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,009
I’m the captain.

51
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,052
People are supposed to tell
me what happens on my ship.

52
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,547
‐ Oh, but we’re
thinking beyond that.

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,010
‐ Huh?

54
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,768
‐ The crew with the Nadesico
are mostly young people

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,851
with long and promising futures.

56
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,395
It’s only right we
should promote thought

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,980
on what they might do in
their post‐military careers.

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,436
For when the war is over.

59
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,238
‐ When the war is over?

60
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,489
‐ Yes.

61
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,241
There will come a time
when all this will be over.

62
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,493
Our crew needs to
start thinking now

63
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,616
about what they want to
do once there’s no need

64
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,455
for soldiers.

65
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,699
‐ That makes sense.

66
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,368
It’s kind of like
that old saying that

67
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,667
happiness won’t deliver a
package to your address.

68
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,791
You have to go looking for it.

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,248
In that case, I think
it’s a great idea!

70
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,746
‐ Good, and I was thinking
of making the winner

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
the captain of the Nadesico.

72
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,344
‐ It’s so exciting,
maybe I’ll enter it too!

73
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,725
Huh?

74
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,761
‐ Oh, nothing, it was just a
silly little idea that I had.

75
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,096
‐ That’s great.

76
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,642
If pop stars can become
police chiefs and mayors

77
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,976
for a day all the time,
then why can’t our winner

78
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,851
get to be the captain for a day?

79
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,266
What a wonderful gimmick.

80
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,614
So to all of you
would‐be superstars

81
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,860
that want to become idol singers

82
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,941
after the war with
the Jovians is over,

83
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,607
not to mention all
those space cadets

84
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,605
who’d like to try being
the captain of the Nadesico

85
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,947
for a day, enter the First
Star beauty contest now.

86
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,784
‐ And the winner gets
to be the captain.

87
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,038
Isn’t that amazing?

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,499
Who do you think it will be?

89
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,961
‐ I bet I could spy
out the new (mumbles)

90
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,538
‐ Punning in Japanese now?

91
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,247
‐ Yes, it’s a little dated.

92
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,957
The Japanese word for
captain is the same

93
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,417
as the old word for spy.

94
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,587
‐ Who says this show
isn’t educational?

95
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,545
‐ Who are you talking to?

96
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,475
‐ The fourth wall.

97
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,394
‐ So what are you gonna do
in the talent competition,

98
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,105
Rioko?

99
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,064
I’m gonna sing a song.

100
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,393
‐ I’m not entering.

101
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,688
‐ Huh, you’re not?

102
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,903
But it’s a chance to be an
idol singer and get famous.

103
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,820
Come on, Rioko, everyone
else is entering,

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,400
so why not you, too?

105
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,365
‐ I don’t want to.

106
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,646
(munching)

107
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:25,157
‐ So tell me, then,
after this war is over...

108
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:25,953
(slurps)

109
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,834
...do you have plans?

110
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,833
What are you going to do, huh?

111
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,584
‐ Mm, not bad.

112
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,826
(both whine)

113
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,839
‐ It’s none of your business!

114
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,171
‐ I bet I know what she wants.

115
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,674
‐ And I bet I know
where she wants it.

116
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,424
‐ Bug off!

117
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,258
(pop music)

118
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,142
(singing in foreign language)

119
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,693
‐ Thank you very much.

120
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,561
Well, man, what do you think?

121
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,570
‐ Huh?

122
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,981
(girls giggling)

123
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,027
(excited crosstalk)

124
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,201
‐ Wow, look at ’em go.

125
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,069
Looks like pageant
fever’s catching on.

126
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,738
‐ [Man] Everyone wants an
excuse to stop thinking

127
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,038
about what’s been happening.

128
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,039
Even if it’s just for a day.

129
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,419
(beeps)

130
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,001
‐ Yes, definitely.

131
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,544
No, absolutely not.

132
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,877
My god, what were you
thinking with that outfit?

133
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,385
‐ How’s it coming, Prospector?

134
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,626
You do understand how
important this is, don’t you?

135
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,888
‐ Don’t worry, I understand.

136
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,219
Ever since our little
breach of security

137
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,256
there’s been a steady
surge of malcontentism.

138
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,309
You’re looking for
someone who will leave

139
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,232
the crew’s minds like
putty in your hands.

140
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,562
‐ We’re counting
on you, Prospector.

141
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,856
Don’t let us down.

142
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,019
The Nadesico needs
a super idol captain

143
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,398
to make them happy.

144
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,066
Someone who will make
the crew so happy,

145
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,783
happy, happy, they’ll
all forget all the...

146
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,241
(sighs)

147
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,157
‐ Even for us this is
sinking pretty low.

148
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,695
‐ Mr. Prospector.

149
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,118
‐ Oh!

150
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,828
‐ There seems to be some
misinformation going around.

151
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,877
People are thinking
this is a contest

152
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,130
for a new captain.

153
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,003
‐ Oh, I still have
applicants to process.

154
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,758
‐ Don’t you think it
would be a good idea

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,590
to clarify things for them?

156
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,547
‐ What for?

157
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,265
‐ Well, we don’t want
everyone to think

158
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,555
that they’ll be the new captain

159
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,218
instead of captain
for a day, do we?

160
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,216
‐ Oh, there’s no
cause for alarm.

161
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,520
Why, isn’t it obvious, Captain,

162
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,614
with your dad’s lame
looks and intelligence,

163
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,771
you’re a shoo‐in!

164
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,477
You’ll win without a doubt.

165
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,359
‐ Oh!

166
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,778
‐ Ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,745
welcome to the first Star of
the Nadesico Beauty Pageant

168
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,954
and our search for the
next captain of tomorrow.

169
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,156
Tonight’s stellar
assortment of beauties

170
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,118
begins with Icaro Amano singing

171
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,839
the opening theme for
Get Me (mumbles) 5!

172
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,091
(singing in foreign language)

173
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,591
‐ The battle to be the
next captain has begun.

174
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,847
Together with our
audience, we will be

175
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,351
watching this event very closely

176
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,722
while analyzing the results
compared to the polls

177
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,728
we took earlier today.

178
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,439
Here now is my co‐commentator,

179
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,939
former champion
playboy Nigari Okaski.

180
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,191
‐ Nice to be here.

181
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,944
But what’s that
about former playboy?

182
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,485
‐ Um, Nigumi?

183
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,028
What are you wearing
that nurse’s costume for?

184
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,744
‐ Well, actually I’m
going to demonstrate

185
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,823
how to give a vitamin injection

186
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,990
for the talent competition.

187
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,866
You’re giving somebody
a shot on stage?

188
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,835
‐ That’s right.

189
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,332
‐ Are you certified for that?

190
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,495
‐ Now, don’t move, Mr, Kitcat.

191
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,292
I think I just pierced
Mr. Kitcat’s lower lip.

192
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,167
‐ ♪ Tiptoe through the tulips ♪

193
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,715
♪ In my (mumbles) ♪

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,670
♪ Oh come with me ♪

195
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,760
(both groan)

196
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,763
(singing in foreign language)

197
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,143
‐ [Man] And next Miss
Bonato with her performance

198
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,015
(mumbles) sumo swimsuit!

199
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:39,312
‐ Yoosh!

200
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,649
(harmonica playing)

201
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,193
(guitar plays)

202
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,857
‐ [Woman] Rotting
maggots of death.

203
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,696
(both vocalizing)

204
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,449
‐ ♪ Oh baby, tiptoe ♪

205
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,371
(mumbles)

206
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,200
‐ Things are looking
mighty grim for Azumi.

207
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,536
So who would you rate to
be the main contenders

208
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,250
at this point?

209
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,121
‐ Hey, I’m easy.

210
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,035
So who’s up next?

211
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,254
‐ I lost my needle.

212
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,745
So if anyone finds
it, let me know.

213
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,498
Hold still.

214
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,878
‐ [Man] Wow, Miss Nigumi
can nurse me anytime.

215
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,837
Who’s next?

216
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,304
‐ It’s the Halmay girls.

217
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,844
They do everything together,

218
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,597
but that will make judging
them rather difficult.

219
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,061
‐ It would be shame to break
up such a nicely matched set.

220
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,062
(pop music)

221
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,772
‐ Just look at them.

222
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,944
They’re great.

223
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,562
They’re all so talented.

224
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,856
Could you imagine being a Jovian

225
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,530
and never learning to do
anything well except fight?

226
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,702
‐ And here she is,
ladies and gentlemen,

227
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,955
the star of the evening,
entry number 1578,

228
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
Miss Yurika Misumara.

229
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,457
‐ We don’t have 1500 entries.

230
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,832
‐ Such a combination
of beauty and talent

231
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,338
has never been seen before.

232
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,549
The fire maiden of Mars,
the queen of outer space,

233
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,170
now here she is!

234
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,296
(mellow pop music)

235
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,432
(singing in foreign language)

236
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,736
(singing in foreign language)

237
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,832
(singing in foreign language)

238
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,757
(singing in foreign language)

239
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,018
‐ L‐O‐V‐E,

240
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,017
lovely Yurika!

241
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,989
(singing in foreign language)

242
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,868
(singing in foreign language)

243
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,513
(Yurika singing in
foreign language)

244
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,056
‐ So what is it
that I’m good at?

245
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,478
What is my special star?

246
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,280
Oh!

247
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,530
Bridge!

248
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,533
(singing in foreign language)

249
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,210
‐ Thank you, thank you!

250
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,500
‐ Applaud!

251
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,786
‐ Huh?

252
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,457
(alarm blaring)

253
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,383
(rousing music)

254
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,644
‐ Excuse me but
I’d like to sing.

255
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,983
(soft music)

256
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,400
(singing in foreign language)

257
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,420
(singing in foreign language)

258
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,101
(singing in foreign language)

259
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,952
(singing in foreign language)

260
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,118
‐ She’s good.

261
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,747
‐ Not to mention cute.

262
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,422
There goes the fanboy vote.

263
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,964
(singing in foreign language)

264
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,142
(singing in foreign language)

265
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,414
(young woman singing
in foreign language)

266
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,580
‐ Maybe I was just
seeing things.

267
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,747
(whirs)

268
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Something is out there.

269
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,785
Something that can’t be picked
up by Nadesico’s sensors.

270
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:56,957
I can feel it.

271
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,013
(whooshing)

272
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,972
(young woman singing
in foreign language)

273
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,443
(pop music)

274
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,534
‐ I saw an act like
this in Vegas once.

275
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,069
‐ And where did she get
the dry ice machine?

276
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,532
(pop music)

277
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,207
(singing in foreign language)

278
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,805
(singing in foreign language)

279
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,061
(singing in foreign language)

280
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,318
‐ Way to go, Rory!

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,690
‐ So much for breakdancing.

282
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,276
‐ I’m sorry for interrupting.

283
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,240
‐ Now I have no
idea who will win.

284
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,285
What a development.

285
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,408
‐ You’re drooling on the mic.

286
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,084
‐ That was wonderful, Rory.

287
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,381
‐ Well, I guess it
was nothing after all.

288
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,634
‐ [Man] Could you
imagine being a Jovian

289
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,218
and never learning to do
anything well except fight?

290
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,063
‐ But what?

291
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,270
What else am I good for?

292
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,270
(gasps)

293
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,311
Missiles!

294
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,319
(suspenseful music)

295
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,321
It’s some kind of ship!

296
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,030
Damn it!

297
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,244
(explosion)

298
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,624
‐ There’s been an explosion
directly ahead of the ship.

299
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,833
(mumbles) has already deployed.

300
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,754
‐ Damn, how could they
have slipped through

301
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,171
our defenses like this?

302
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,171
‐ Hang on (mumbles)

303
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,843
(whooshing)

304
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,961
‐ What in the hell
are these things?

305
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,137
They’re like missiles,
with people on board.

306
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,051
‐ [Woman] It appears that
the enemy is conducting

307
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,098
experiments with (mumbles)
jumping missile carriers.

308
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,852
By jumping directly
above a target

309
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,885
before unleashing their
missiles they greatly reduce

310
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,767
the chance of interception.

311
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,314
This system leaves us
as exposed as I am now.

312
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,188
(men shudder)

313
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,687
‐ Wow, there’s nothing
like a highly detailed

314
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,648
technical explanation
from a lady in a swimsuit.

315
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,487
‐ No details uncovered.

316
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,282
Trust Miss Versanche
to reveal it all.

317
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,365
‐ [Man] Hey, shouldn’t you
be with the other pilots?

318
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,083
‐ [Man] Um, well...

319
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,682
(whooshing)

320
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,011
‐ Here they come.

321
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,717
‐ Rioko, why did you
take off like that?

322
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,057
‐ It’s my job!

323
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,862
Fighting and killing are
the only things I do well.

324
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,689
Yahh!

325
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,324
Another one.

326
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,283
‐ When it comes to fighting,
you’re our first star.

327
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,374
If you’re good at
something then what’s wrong

328
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,161
with doing it?

329
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,202
‐ Everything.

330
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,544
These are other humans
that I’m killing now.

331
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,172
In the end the only
thing that I’m good at

332
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,460
is killing other people.

333
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,963
‐ Three remaining
units have arrived

334
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,254
into the combat air space.

335
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,959
Don’t give up now.

336
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,337
‐ [Rioko] What am I supposed
to do when this war is over,

337
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,394
if the only thing that I’m
good at is something horrible?

338
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,681
If this is what I’m best at,

339
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,642
then I’d be better
off not living at all.

340
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,023
‐ You’re wrong.

341
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,140
We need you.

342
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,306
You’re the glue that
holds the fabric

343
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,394
of this team together.

344
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,980
We’d be lost without you.

345
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:44,653
‐ I would.

346
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,980
‐ Me too.

347
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,315
‐ Me three.

348
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
‐ You’re our best pilot.

349
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,026
You’re the star we follow.

350
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,861
‐ [Man] More humanoid
fighters moving to intercept.

351
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,107
That makes four total.

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,490
Should we alter
our mission, sir?

353
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,085
‐ No, we will continue
on as planned.

354
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,751
It is imperative that we
retrieve the test data.

355
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,749
Don’t engage unless you have to.

356
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,582
But I want those
missiles dropped.

357
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,828
‐ [Men] Aye‐aye, sir!

358
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,714
‐ I fight because I cannot
accept the alternative,

359
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,546
and it does not bother me

360
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,721
because I know that
my cause is just.

361
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,929
‐ Yeah, well, what
bothers me is the fact

362
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,602
that we’re stuck behind
this stupid desk.

363
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,641
‐ There’s nothing
wrong in fighting

364
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,346
if you’re fighting for friends.

365
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,565
‐ And family.

366
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,314
‐ You’ll find
something else someday.

367
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,437
But until then...

368
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,110
‐ [Rioko] Alright,
team, let’s get ’em.

369
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,117
‐ [Man] Operations,
request retrieval, sir.

370
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,833
‐ [Man] Alright, just hold on.

371
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,865
‐ [Woman] And don’t you
dare come back again.

372
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,627
‐ [Rioko] There must be
something else I can do.

373
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,042
But for now...

374
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,474
‐ Hey, are you alright, Rioko?

375
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,471
‐ Hey!

376
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,472
Let go, you idiot.

377
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,801
I can do just fine on my own.

378
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,346
‐ Your SD looks pretty beaten.

379
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,891
‐ Yeah, says you.

380
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,562
‐ Can’t you take a
hand from a friend?

381
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,392
‐ Maybe.

382
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,846
‐ Oh, and incidentally,

383
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,397
that’s some really
cute lingerie that

384
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,729
you’ve been fighting in.

385
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,403
Maybe you should have
entered the contest.

386
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,442
‐ What?!

387
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,364
You take that back!

388
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,945
‐ I was just joking!

389
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,870
‐ Well, there he goes again.

390
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,334
Ain’t got no star.

391
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,872
I’ll just make one.

392
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,674
♪ Twinkle, twinkle,
little star ♪

393
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,504
‐ [Man] That’s not funny!

394
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,919
‐ And now at long last,

395
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,125
the moment you’ve
all been waiting for,

396
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,305
the final results
of our contest.

397
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,433
‐ Okay now, forgive us
as only those that were

398
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,431
in the top tier of both
winners will be announced.

399
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,563
Ho ho, just look at
those vote numbers climb.

400
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,729
‐ How much longer until
they announce the winner?

401
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,192
‐ Well, factoring
in the time delay,

402
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,900
it should be any minute
now, I would think.

403
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,022
I just hope that
the next captain

404
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,317
will be a young,
cute and ditzy idol

405
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,031
that will get the
crew’s attention

406
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,531
off our recent security leaks.

407
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,862
‐ Setting aside the
question of being a ditz,

408
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,487
that Yurika Misumara
may affiliate herself

409
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,865
with the pacifist movement.

410
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,872
‐ Let’s use thus
time to figure out

411
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,914
our new campaign
image and slogan.

412
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,369
‐ How about showing the captain

413
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,329
with her fingers together
like this saying,

414
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,958
naughty kids who won’t
fight will get it

415
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,344
from Captain Enema.

416
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,051
‐ [Man] You’re fired!

417
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,631
‐ Love love (mumbles) girl.

418
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,756
‐ Ooh, I like that one.

419
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,553
‐ Nadesico, do you
remember the (mumbles)

420
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,047
‐ (mumbles) or lead me.

421
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,678
‐ We could (mumbles) spank you.

422
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,013
‐ [Group] Huh?

423
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,893
(dramatic music)

424
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,477
‐ That word is so adorable.

425
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,902
‐ [Man] With first‐place winner
Rory Hershino abstaining,

426
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,822
the award goes to the winner

427
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,990
of the Rock, Paper
and Scissors match

428
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,659
conducted among the
second‐place winners.

429
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,569
The winner, Yurika Misumara,

430
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,577
will be made the captain again.

431
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,079
‐ [Group] No way!

432
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,792
‐ ♪ Please let me
be your number one ♪

433
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:53,884
♪ Make me the one you
keep in your heart ♪

434
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:59,677
Whatever.

435
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,889
(woman singing in
foreign language)

436
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,227
(woman singing in
foreign language)

437
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,996
(woman singing in
foreign language)

438
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,972
(woman singing in
foreign language)

439
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,984
‐ [Woman] Ahem.

440
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,727
Let me do some explaining
in the time we have left.

441
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,028
As you know, the
popular anime show

442
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,493
Get (mumbles) 3 was originally
produced 100 years ago.

443
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,492
As it happens, the
dissidents who were banished

444
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,494
to Jupiter took copies
of this show with them

445
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,368
on video and subsequently
became infatuated with it.

446
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,616
However over the course of
time the Jovians’ masters

447
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,166
degraded and some of
the episodes were lost.

448
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,042
This sets up an
interesting situation

449
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,169
that I’ll try to explain
in a later broadcast.

450
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,714
In the meantime don’t
miss the next episode

451
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,760
of Martian Successor Nadesico.

452
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,132
I’ll have lots more
explanations then.
