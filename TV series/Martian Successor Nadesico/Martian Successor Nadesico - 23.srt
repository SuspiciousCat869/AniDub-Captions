1
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,854
‐ [Narrator] It has been
written that justice

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:18,855
is nothing more than
that which is in

3
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,556
the greatest
self‐interest of the

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,647
largest portion
of the population.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,031
Similarly, history is
merely a written record

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,188
from the point‐of‐view
of the winners.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,949
With that in mind, perhaps
we were being optimistic

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,530
in thinking we
could leave the ship

9
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,835
without suffering
the consequences.

10
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,288
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,933
(singing in foreign language)

12
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
‐ It will take three
day days to finish

13
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,343
overhauling the engine
block in the PT cannon.

14
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,966
But the new replacement crew
will need 10 days training.

15
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,803
So it’s going to be
another two weeks.

16
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,258
‐ Then let’s just
skip the training

17
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,257
and launch as soon
as the ship’s ready.

18
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,808
‐ I really don’t
think that’s advisable

19
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,142
with our existing
crew, just look.

20
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,147
‐ Yes, most of the
good ones mutinied.

21
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,269
But we hired
replacements, right?

22
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,357
‐ Well, we hired
a replacement crew

23
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,574
but none of them are
as good at their jobs

24
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,363
as the people that
they’re replacing.

25
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,778
‐ Well, at least we know
they won’t mutiny on us.

26
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,325
And our new battleship
is almost ready.

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,712
‐ As our forces continue
to drive the Jubie Musers

28
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,791
back beyond the earth’s
Le Grance point,

29
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,875
the UEAF appears to
be in high spirits.

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,422
A word yesterday is the
UEAF’s Admiral Misumaru.

31
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,166
As commander of the‐‐

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,839
‐ Cut off, are you going
to spend all your time

33
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,387
just sitting in front of the TV?

34
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,852
‐ But my father was on.

35
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,471
‐ Are you skipping work?

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,846
‐ No, I’m coming, okay?

37
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,604
‐ Sweet and sour pork here.
‐ Miso ramen.

38
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,636
‐ Salt ramen.
‐ And pork.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,018
‐ Fried dumplings.
‐ Chow mein.

40
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,155
‐ Make mine extra large.
‐ I want soy sauce.

41
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,521
‐ Fried noodles
‐ Combo platter, please.

42
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,526
‐ Let’s see, I got it.

43
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,821
Sweet and sour, misu ramen,
salt ramen with pork,

44
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,777
dumplings, chow
mein, extra large,

45
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,697
soy sauce, rice
noodle, combo platter.

46
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:26,208
Plus 10 teas, will
that be all, gentlemen?

47
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,041
‐ Hey, she’s good.

48
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,635
‐ Well, she did graduate from
the Strategic SIM program

49
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,211
at the top of her class.

50
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,375
‐ You know, that’s
the first time

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,013
I’ve seen her actually
being helpful.

52
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,760
‐ Hey, Eureka
performed honorably

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,223
as the captain as the Nadesico.

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,303
‐ And look how we
honorably ended up.

55
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,017
Of course we all made some
really dumb moves in the end.

56
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,227
We tried to do what was right,

57
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,020
only to find out that’s
not what earth wants.

58
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,065
Ow.

59
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:51,859
‐ Wake up, why are
you just sitting there

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,730
staring at the soup?

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,818
Start getting the ramen ready.

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,190
‐ Right.

63
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,487
‐ And you’re supposed to
be washing the dishes,

64
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,740
not gossiping, and while
you’re at it wash this.

65
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,743
‐ Yes sir.

66
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,784
‐ Sweet and sour pork’s ready.

67
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,406
‐ Right.

68
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,331
‐ [Boss] Move it, we can’t
keep our customers waiting.

69
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,239
‐ [Staff] Yes, sir.

70
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,753
‐ Feel that sunshine,

71
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,499
there’s nothing like
doing laundry outside.

72
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,831
‐ There isn’t?

73
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,035
‐ I keep forgetting
that you’ve never lived

74
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,545
on a real planet before.

75
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,496
On the Nadesico we had
to use electric dryers,

76
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,757
but it’s so much better
when you can do it

77
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,299
with the sun and wind.

78
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,094
It makes the clothes feel
and smell so much nicer.

79
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,007
See?

80
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,973
All soft.

81
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,386
And nothing feels better

82
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,386
than standing in
the sunshine, right?

83
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,271
(sniffing)

84
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,817
‐ Maybe I could stand
living with you.

85
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,111
‐ Huh?

86
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,911
‐ Well, I’m still not
happy about it, but

87
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,949
I guess that some
earthlings are all right.

88
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,958
‐ But there are a
lot of jerks, too.

89
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,419
I just wish there
was some kind of way

90
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,252
for us to contact
everybody else.

91
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,968
(birds chirping)

92
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,810
‐ Do we have to file this
stupid report, Arena?

93
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,019
I’m really not in
the mood right now.

94
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,310
‐ Well, that’s what you
have me for, isn’t it?

95
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,603
And the UEAF wants a report
so we’ll give them one.

96
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,187
And the only thing I’m
asking you to do is review it

97
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,066
and make a few little notes
and revisions, Mr. Chairman.

98
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,818
‐ And I guess we’ll
have to figure out

99
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,197
what to do with Mr. Jorge, here.

100
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,326
Well, I’ll think of something.

101
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,292
And what about our
runaway crew members?

102
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,713
Haven’t our field agents
tracked all of them down yet?

103
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,844
‐ Of the 115 who left the
Nadesico in the confusion,

104
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,002
there are four still missing.

105
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,718
Of the remainder,
20 have returned

106
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,051
to their former occupations,

107
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,465
13 have asked to be
reinstated on the Nadesico,

108
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,603
and the rest are under
constant surveillance.

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
‐ It seems like you have
the situation well in hand.

110
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,982
How convenient that the
most dangerous group

111
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,519
are all together.

112
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,104
Hard to believe that
these are the same people.

113
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,808
But if push comes to shove,

114
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,268
don’t hesitate to
have them neutralized.

115
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,858
‐ Hmm, when they’re that
casual about being ruthless

116
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,106
it’s a bad sign.

117
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,815
‐ Mr. Prospector, where
does this book go?

118
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,566
‐ I’m confused too,
where’s the shelf

119
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,200
for books about the 1990s?

120
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,616
‐ I found some comic books
in the Nogau bulletin file.

121
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,875
‐ Not even these girls
deserve a demotion like this.

122
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,708
‐ Just leave it to me,
magical princess Angela.

123
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,627
‐ Thank you for coming.

124
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,724
‐ [Angela] Remember my words.

125
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,971
‐ Hey, I know that voice.

126
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,180
‐ That’s Maguni.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,550
‐ Evil will wait forever.

128
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,142
‐ You’re evil, I will get you.

129
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,734
‐ The Jovan will rule
the earth forever.

130
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,693
(laughing)

131
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,232
‐ [Director] That’s a wrap.

132
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,027
‐ [Actresses] Thank
you for directing us.

133
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,239
‐ [Director] Thank you.

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,150
‐ Nagumi, darling.
‐ Miss Kobiashi.

135
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,736
‐ I’m so glad you’re back.

136
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,363
‐ Thank you.

137
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,908
‐ Your portrayal of Ramuten
is absolutely wonderful.

138
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,122
‐ It’s really good.

139
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,083
‐ Thank you, but‐‐

140
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,452
‐ You were great today, Magumi.

141
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,959
‐ Excellent show, Mari,
thank you so much.

142
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,750
‐ Mari, can we talk?

143
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,082
‐ Huh?

144
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,838
What, you want to
quit Natural Lychee?

145
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,671
‐ I can’t thank
Miss Kobiashi enough

146
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,666
for giving me such a big role,

147
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,218
even though I just came back

148
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,851
after being gone from
the industry for so long.

149
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,469
‐ But Natural Lychee’s changed.

150
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,767
All the characters seem
to do is fight each other.

151
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,101
‐ Well I know there’s a war

152
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,685
but the show is supposed
to be for children.

153
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,270
And then there’s the villains,

154
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,315
why did they name
them the Jovan?

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,860
It’s so obvious that they’re
supposed to represent

156
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:26,362
the Jovenes, like we’re training
kids to hate them on sight.

157
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,866
‐ But the change in focus has
pluses, like new characters.

158
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,241
I think what you’re
doing with Ramutan

159
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,247
is absolutely wonderful.

160
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,289
Why don’t you just
concentrate on your acting

161
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,373
and go with the flow, Magumi?

162
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,458
‐ I can’t.

163
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,172
‐ It would be best
in the long run.

164
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,134
Isn’t that what
you’d say, Arena?

165
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,089
‐ It’s been awhile, Magumi.

166
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,224
Thanks for calling.

167
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,091
‐ I was so surprised to
learn that the two of you

168
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,848
already knew each other.

169
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,222
‐ Wait a second, you called her?

170
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,603
‐ Of course.

171
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,481
‐ Have you seen the ratings
for the Jovan season

172
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,402
of magical princess
Lychee yet, Magumi?

173
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,992
They’re absolutely fantastic,
Nergall will be glad

174
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,739
to continue furthering
your acting career

175
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,821
just as long as you limit
your public speaking

176
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,076
to playing Ramutan and
keeping your ips‐lay ut‐shay

177
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,119
about you know where
and you know who.

178
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,873
Do we have a deal?

179
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,287
You’re not going to get anywhere
by running away from us.

180
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,215
You and those other traders
are nothing more than criminals

181
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,455
and we will hunt you down.

182
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,514
(suspenseful music)

183
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,260
‐ Oh my god.

184
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,718
I’m such a fool.

185
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:41,347
‐ Magumi.

186
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,571
Magumi, I’ve been
looking for you.

187
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,203
Looks like I’ll have to
clear this interference.

188
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,569
I want to speak
to her privately.

189
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,199
(yelling)

190
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,449
‐ Over here, over here.

191
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,538
‐ [Magumi] So I’ve been under
surveillance all this time?

192
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,049
‐ It’s not just you,
Nergall has watch dogs

193
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,220
on every ex‐Nadesico
crew member,

194
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,879
at least on the ones they can.

195
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,179
‐ What’s that mean?

196
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,890
‐ From what I hear
there are still a few

197
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,352
they haven’t located yet.

198
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,810
They’re still searching for them

199
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,310
but it’s like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

200
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,726
‐ We ran out of filters

201
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,193
so I strained the tea out
of a copy of Shakespeare.

202
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,441
Now I have the
Tempest in a teapot.

203
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,646
That’s trouble brewing.

204
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,905
‐ She’s finally
gone over the edge.

205
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,199
‐ Way over.

206
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,240
‐ If our communicators
were still working

207
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,865
we could talk to everybody else,

208
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,540
but unfortunately it seems
that Nergall’s done something

209
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,250
to the Nadesico’s computer.

210
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,920
They probably had a
Moikane software rewritten.

211
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,881
I know it sounds like
something our Ruri would say,

212
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,710
but I’m afraid that the
Nadesico probably isn’t

213
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,967
the Nadesico we knew
anymore, and that leaves us‐‐

214
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,551
‐ Separated and alone.

215
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,265
‐ Well I suppose we oughta be
glad that we’re still free,

216
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,966
even if we are
under surveillance.

217
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,929
‐ And how long will this last?

218
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,097
‐ Oh, probably until the secret

219
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,266
about the Jovian lizards
really being humans

220
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,856
isn’t a secret any
longer would be my guess.

221
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,281
Until we all learn to
live in peace and harmony.

222
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,940
‐ When will that be?

223
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,278
‐ As soon as the fighting
ends and the earthlings

224
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,704
and the Jovians learn to
work together as comrades

225
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,953
towards building a
better future for us all.

226
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,577
When pigs grow wings.

227
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,372
‐ That soon.

228
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,825
‐ [Akido] It’s ready, sir.

229
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,577
‐ It doesn’t look too bad.

230
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,005
Mmm.

231
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,298
Mmm.

232
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,546
Let me think.

233
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,137
I really oughta make you
train for another 10 years

234
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,895
but this is better
than you can get

235
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,775
in most restaurants these days.

236
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,312
Congratulations kid.

237
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,405
‐ You mean I passed, sir?

238
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,859
‐ With flying colors.

239
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,651
‐ You don’t know how
much this means to me.

240
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,482
‐ Looks like you
stopped running.

241
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,029
‐ Huh, actually I’m
still on the run, sir.

242
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,954
‐ Not that way, I meant

243
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,280
you stopped running
from your own problems.

244
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,406
And what’s more, you’ve
obviously been studying

245
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,583
under one hell of a chef.

246
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,832
‐ Yes.

247
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,835
‐ [Chef] So what restaurant
you been studying at?

248
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,212
‐ You’re a peculiar one,
why did you stay on?

249
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,917
‐ My contract wasn’t up yet

250
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,086
and anyway, there’s work to do.

251
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,837
‐ Still taking care
of that kitten?

252
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,048
‐ That’s right.

253
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,693
(gentle music)

254
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,962
‐ Nagumi, it’s Reynard.

255
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,327
Hi, it’s Ruri, meow.

256
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,667
(upbeat music)

257
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,932
‐ I don’t believe it.

258
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,053
‐ [Ruri] Yes, it’s me,
I hope you’re well.

259
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:02,968
‐ It’s Ruri.

260
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,216
‐ What’s a Ruri?

261
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,019
‐ The audio and visual
signals I’m sending

262
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,980
have been specially coded so
that only you can receive them.

263
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,942
There may be some
degradation because of this.

264
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,905
I apologize for not having
contacted you before now,

265
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,994
but I’ve been having
trouble teaching all my kane

266
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,451
how to imitate the personality

267
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,782
of Nergall’s
replacement program.

268
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,698
‐ You mean the
computer was acting?

269
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,835
‐ That’s right, but all
my kane doesn’t like

270
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,712
pretending to be someone
else, so it’s been difficult.

271
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,870
‐ How weird.

272
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,248
‐ In any case, I’m very
glad to tell you that

273
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,917
the Nadesico is still alive.

274
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,166
‐ Isn’t it cold hiding in
that refrigerator, Ruri?

275
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,377
‐ Yes, but since I borrowed
this outfit from Miss Halme

276
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,548
I’ve been fine, I’m much
tougher than you think.

277
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,642
‐ Ruri smiled, she smiled.

278
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,306
‐ A long time ago,
the admiral told us

279
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,145
that the Nadesico was our ship

280
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,691
and despite everything that’s
still how I feel today.

281
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,444
This ship is ours, and
it’s time to take it back.

282
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,285
‐ Looks like I’m gonna have
to get ready for company.

283
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,498
‐ All right girls,
time to change aprons.

284
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,040
‐ Change them why?

285
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,212
‐ Stat.

286
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,500
‐ Let’s warm up the SDs.

287
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,705
‐ Yes, Lance.

288
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,173
‐ Now where are my SD and motor?

289
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,126
‐ So Akido, are you ready to go?

290
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,054
‐ You bet.

291
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,722
‐ I’m coming, too.

292
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:24,802
‐ Well so long, Akido.

293
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,007
You really surprised
me, you know.

294
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,350
Coming back like this after
disappearing for a year,

295
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,345
and with four women
with you, no less.

296
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,148
‐ [Akido] Actually I’m a man.

297
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,150
‐ Right, I sure hope that I’ll
get to see all of you again.

298
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,653
My place won’t do as well

299
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,066
without these lovely
ladies waiting the tables.

300
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,784
Goodbye girls, you take care.

301
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,455
‐ You too.

302
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,322
‐ Bye sir.

303
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,828
‐ Take care of the shop.

304
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,661
‐ I guess the shot looked
better without me in the frame.

305
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,497
‐ Thanks for
everything, Mr. Saiso.

306
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,551
Here we go, into the breach.

307
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,970
This time there’ll be
no more running away.

308
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,110
(cart rattling)

309
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,692
‐ Hold it, what is this?

310
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,107
‐ What does it look like?

311
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,325
I got a special noodle
delivery for the Nadesico.

312
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,275
Will you please let me through?

313
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,197
Or are you going
to be difficult?

314
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,446
‐ Looks like it’s time for us

315
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,657
to get a little
rough on Waikane.

316
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,458
(buzzing)

317
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,093
‐ Well come along, ladies.

318
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,052
‐ [Women] Charge.

319
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,209
‐ [Delivery Man]
I’m terribly sorry,

320
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,628
gentlemen, but you did insist.

321
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,386
‐ Huh, what the heck?

322
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,471
‐ Attention all
Nergall personnel.

323
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,476
I am very sorry, however
I have to do this.

324
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,399
‐ All the inside
shutters are closing.

325
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,361
I can’t control any of them.

326
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,519
‐ Oh damn, the doors won’t open.

327
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,938
Hey, open this now.

328
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,108
(yelling)

329
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,277
‐ All right, let’s
do it, ladies.

330
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,118
‐ [Women] Yes, ma’am.

331
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,083
‐ They broke into the
Nadesico, but what could

332
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,621
that ship possibly do
without its master key?

333
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,787
‐ The Nadesico’s computer
hacked into the security system

334
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,576
and several ex‐crew members

335
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,879
have infiltrated the
dock in the confusion.

336
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,262
‐ The confusion
will be temporary.

337
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,049
In any case, they can’t launch.

338
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,763
We have the master key.

339
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,889
(dramatic music)

340
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,516
‐ Faster, June, we’ve got
to get to the Nadesico.

341
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,982
‐ Hey captain, do
you need a lift?

342
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,476
(yelling)

343
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,937
‐ Is, is, is, is
everybody all right?

344
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,737
‐ Oh sure, we’re just peachy.

345
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,914
‐ Get on board, captain,
Tenkaw, cover us.

346
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:52,743
‐ Huh?

347
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,287
‐ Look at your radar, you idiot.

348
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,660
‐ [Tenkaw] Yikes.

349
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,078
‐ [Ryoko] That’s
yikes times six.

350
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,795
(laughing)

351
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,635
‐ Exactly what is so funny?

352
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,210
‐ I never even saw it
coming, that Godhori.

353
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,467
I thought he was just
another boring yes man

354
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,469
but it seems that
still waters run deep.

355
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,723
‐ Meaning?

356
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,642
‐ He took our master
key and split.

357
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,682
‐ Right, battery in.

358
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,732
‐ What a charge.

359
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,481
‐ [Red Haired Woman]
Geez, just when

360
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,903
is Rioko going to get here?

361
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,151
(slurping)

362
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,486
‐ The hard part
is just beginning.

363
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,913
We’re going to have to
retrieve crew members

364
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,159
from all over the planet.

365
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,371
But first we’ll need to set
up a pick up priority charge.

366
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,334
‐ Hold on, another bowl first.

367
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,163
‐ That’s right, we’re starving.

368
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,380
(yelling)

369
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,882
‐ Those jerks don’t seem to care

370
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,753
that we’re not shooting
at them, do they?

371
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,048
‐ Oh, don’t worry about
those meanies, Ryoko.

372
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,344
It’s only a little further
till we get to Hirozuka.

373
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,048
‐ Please don’t interfere
with my mood swings, captain.

374
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,309
‐ Oh, you know,
wouldn’t this area

375
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,679
make a lovely place to
open a little restaurant?

376
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,767
Akido would be the
head cook, of course.

377
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,192
And I could be the pretty,
mysterious waitress

378
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,023
that’s the talk of the town.

379
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,938
It would be hard at first,
but we’d get popular quickly.

380
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,026
That’s what we could do
once this war is over.

381
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,910
But in the end I don’t think
that would really be enough

382
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,036
for Akido now, the Nadesico
has come to mean so much to him

383
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,424
and to everyone
who’s flown on her.

384
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,674
‐ Right, let’s do it, captain.

385
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,714
‐ [Captain] Right.

386
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,051
‐ [Officer] I repeat,
give yourselves up

387
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,796
and we will guarantee
your safety.

388
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,386
‐ Why do I have
trouble believing that?

389
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,061
‐ Liars, liars, liars, liars.

390
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,019
‐ They don’t seem to
be very trustworthy.

391
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,390
‐ Don’t stop.

392
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,728
‐ [Driver] I’m not going to.

393
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,901
‐ [Officer] We will
guarantee your safety.

394
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,856
‐ I can’t believe they’re
shooting over a city.

395
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,324
We’re almost there, hang on.

396
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,415
‐ Damn the torpedoes.

397
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,741
‐ Good day, Ryoko.

398
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,405
‐ It’s too late, baby,
now, it’s too late.

399
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,705
‐ Have no fear.

400
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,196
‐ The captain’s here.

401
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,078
‐ Prepare for launch, everyone
to your duty stations.

402
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,170
(upbeat music)

403
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,764
‐ All auxiliary engines
are online, captain.

404
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,341
Raising distortion fields.

405
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,725
‐ Sorry I’m late, opening
communication channels.

406
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,933
‐ Thanks, Nagumi.

407
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,845
Let’s begin by retrieving
the rest of our crew.

408
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,023
Set course for
Akido’s Estovales.

409
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,685
‐ Private Estovales
is currently outside

410
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,323
our gravitron wave envelope.

411
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,160
‐ Damn them, they know that
we’re not shooting back.

412
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,033
‐ They’re bad guys, shoot
them down, shoot them down.

413
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,908
‐ I’m not shooting anyone.

414
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,665
Our estobalis only has
30 minutes of power

415
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,999
left in its batteries.

416
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,044
‐ Wait a second, our
battery’s recharging.

417
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:47,916
‐ Huh?

418
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,916
‐ I’m sorry, are we late?

419
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,796
‐ Actually that was pretty fast.

420
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,974
‐ I accelerated the
schedule for you.

421
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,219
‐ I knew it, are you
going to go running off

422
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,428
to chase other
women again, Saya?

423
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,978
‐ I have no choice, I have
friends waiting for me,

424
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:11,153
friends whose lives depend on
my expertise as a mechanic.

425
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,685
‐ And when will
you be coming back?

426
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,108
‐ I don’t know, it
might be tomorrow,

427
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,406
it might be 10 years from now.

428
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,950
But I swear I’ll return.

429
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,165
‐ Take care of yourself.

430
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,117
‐ Oh man, just look how
you’ve abused my babies.

431
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,418
‐ We’re sorry.

432
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,751
‐ He was joking, I knew we
could count on you, Saya.

433
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,415
‐ [Saya] And I’ll
be counting on you.

434
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,965
‐ [Akido] Altitude 200.

435
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,218
‐ All right, let’s prepare to
leave the earth’s atmosphere.

436
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,182
‐ We still have to get
past the big barrier.

437
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,852
‐ Yes, but defense
systems have a thing

438
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,179
called a cancel
code, here we go.

439
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,136
‐ We are now hacking
into the defense system

440
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,105
via the communication
satellites.

441
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,269
‐ [Evil Leader]
What’s happening,

442
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,857
why aren’t the
missiles being fired?

443
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,443
‐ They won’t fire
sir, the fire sequence

444
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,487
has been locked out.

445
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,449
‐ [Evil Leader] What?

446
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,779
‐ [Evil Worker] It’s the
space station Zakara,

447
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,873
we’re unable to
launch any definium.

448
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,740
‐ [Evil Worker] The Nadesico
have reached an altitude

449
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,197
of 30,000 kilometers.

450
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,367
The big barrier system
is not responding.

451
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,458
‐ We’ve got our crew, now we
need a destination, captain?

452
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,504
‐ Our first objective will be

453
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,376
to locate Yukina’s big brother.

454
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,513
‐ Oh big brother, your lovely
sister will be there soon.

455
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,471
‐ Coordinates, please.

456
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,851
‐ Head to Jupiter and
I’m sure we’ll find him.

457
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,428
‐ Of course.

458
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,729
‐ [Arena] The Nadesico
got away again.

459
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,323
‐ Well, when we asked for the
best crew to ever crew a ship

460
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,239
we got what we asked
for, I’m afraid.

461
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,200
Unfortunately they are a
little difficult to control,

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,570
what a shame, so are we ready?

463
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,988
‐ Yes.

464
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,326
‐ [Chairman] It should prove
quite interesting to see

465
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,912
how our new ship fares
against the Nadesico,

466
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,538
won’t it, doctor?

467
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,225
(singing in a foreign language)

468
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,281
‐ [Announcer] This is
an emergency bulletin.

469
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,649
‐ [Announcer] A
special Gaki Ganger

470
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,067
event is coming your way.

471
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,113
The Gaki Ganger
appreciation convention.

472
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,777
‐ But we just call it Gaki Fest.

473
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,985
For a complete list of events,

474
