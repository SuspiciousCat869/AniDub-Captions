00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,976
‐ [Female Speaker]
It may seem like

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,350
we weren’t taking
the war seriously.

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,147
In truth, most of our actions

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,861
were those of people
trying desperately

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,111
to forget something
that wouldn’t go away.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,453
Like children who try to keep
playing after the sun sets,

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,530
we kept finding ourselves
surrounded by the darkness.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,287
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,718
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,841
‐ Okay, they’re all ready to go.

11
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,626
‐ Are you sure that
this will be safe?

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,890
‐ The rubber bicycle tires

13
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,429
should keep you
completely insulated

14
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,812
from the high voltage that’s
running through the corridors.

15
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,180
I’ve also installed an
independent gyro inside them

16
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,939
so if the gravity control goes
dead, you’ll still be okay.

17
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,150
‐ We have to regain control
over the Y‐Unit in 20 minutes.

18
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,153
Otherwise, the entire
operation will be in jeopardy.

19
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:31,994
‐ Right.

20
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,240
Let’s all go kick some ass!

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,026
‐ Spooks be gone,
spooks be gone.

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,118
Nevermore to bother me.

23
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,502
Spooks be gone, spooks be gone.

24
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,409
‐ Why is Izumi doing that?

25
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,458
‐ She says that she saw a ghost.

26
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,631
‐ You’re kidding, right?

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,209
‐ Spooks be gone!

28
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,424
‐ Brother, it can’t be.

29
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,796
I thought you were dead.

30
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,471
‐ What are these things?

31
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,597
It’s a mahjong tile.

32
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,025
‐ But it’s also a memory.

33
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,366
(dramatic orchestral music)

34
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,076
‐ Two Gekiganger type
units approaching.

35
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,245
All estobolus
launching to intercept.

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,840
‐ Aren’t we supposed
to rendezvous

37
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,709
with the lunar service
forces, commander?

38
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,206
‐ Don’t be ridiculous!

39
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,009
Not when that accursed
battleship is in my sight.

40
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,432
Let the young man force his
hand on the lunar surface.

41
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,313
This task group will
destroy the Nadesico.

42
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,259
‐ Aye aye, commander.

43
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,564
‐ Here they come!

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,070
What the?

45
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,028
We missed two!

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,568
‐ The Gekiganger type units

47
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,868
are compromising the integrity
of our distortion field.

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,910
‐ Ever since these
Gekiganger types appeared,

49
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,584
the protective value
of our distortion field

50
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,164
has been greatly diminished.

51
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,037
‐ Stop calling them
Gekiganger types, damn it!

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,005
(loud explosions)

53
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,554
‐ I’ve got him!

54
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,889
‐ [Female Speaker] Got him?
Isn’t that where Batman lives?

55
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,521
‐ Enemy vessel is accelerating.

56
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,066
‐ Are they in cannon range yet?

57
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,109
‐ We’re still outside their
firing range, Captain,

58
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,944
but they’re closing
the gap quickly.

59
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,238
‐ If we change our heading,

60
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,611
we won’t be able to
reach the position

61
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,739
for firing the cannon.

62
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,783
What should we do, Captain?

63
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,487
‐ Keep the Nadesico
advancing, Captain.

64
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,039
We’ll stop these Jovians.

65
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,210
‐ Alright, let’s begin the
briefing for this operation.

66
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,342
The second fleet
employing massive numbers

67
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,751
of lunar surface frames
and other vessels

68
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,588
is currently staging
a final offensive

69
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,923
on the dark side of the moon.

70
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,128
Our task is to lure

71
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,928
the Jovian’s boson
cannon equipped vessels

72
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,312
and robot forces here
and wipe them out.

73
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,639
‐ But if our distortion fields

74
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,854
can’t stop their boson cannon,

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,685
then what are we
gonna hit them with?

76
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,691
‐ Our PT cannon.

77
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,022
‐ [Everyone] PT cannon?!

78
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,606
‐ That’s right!

79
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,229
We’ll use the Y‐Unit, which
gives us three phase transition.

80
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,317
(yelling)

81
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,571
‐ We will use the
Y‐Unit’s PT engines

82
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,204
to project two opposed space
vault on the same point.

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,123
The resulting warp will cause
space to collapse on itself.

84
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,951
‐ If our PT cannon can eliminate

85
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,656
the Jovian vessels
in near lunar space,

86
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,039
the moon will be ours again.

87
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,875
And only the Nadesico can
complete this mission.

88
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,001
‐ The real question is
whether we’ll make it

89
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,956
to the intersection
point on time.

90
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,467
We have to be in position

91
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,679
and ready to fire the PT
cannon in less than 80 minutes!

92
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,302
‐ Tenkawa, wait!

93
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,427
I need you.

94
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,933
‐ An artificial
boson jump test?!

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,564
‐ We can create a
jump field using CC,

96
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,025
so all that we need is‐‐

97
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,023
‐ Someone who can survive
the jump process, right?

98
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,856
I’d like to be a part of
this experiment as well.

99
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,032
‐ Um.
‐ Let’s do it.

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
‐ The jump field appears
to be stable enough

101
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,038
for you to jump now,

102
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,041
but be advised that
chronological linearity

103
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,964
can be compromised if the
field’s integrity is violated‐‐

104
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,252
‐ If you’re having
second thoughts,

105
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,997
all you have to do is
say so and we’ll stop.

106
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,877
‐ Don’t push it
too hard, Tenkawa.

107
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,224
‐ Enemy vessels approaching.

108
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,839
Detecting phase transitions.

109
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,715
Boson cannon ready to fire.

110
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,934
‐ Right.

111
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:27,763
‐ [Female Speaker]
Visualize your target.

112
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,848
Think of the enemy battleships.

113
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,271
(growling)

114
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,726
(gasping)

115
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,938
‐ I did it! Fire!

116
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:45,066
(loud explosions)
(dramatic music)

117
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,873
(yelling)

118
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,544
‐ Damn those evil earthlings.

119
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,713
Our precious leaf cannon
has been destroyed.

120
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,461
Prepare the Diomogen!

121
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,505
I go to fight!

122
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,746
‐ Hold it, (mumbling).

123
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,799
Pull back your forces.

124
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,632
‐ But Tsukumo, we can’t retreat!

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,797
‐ That was an order!

126
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,141
‐ Has anyone else noticed

127
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,431
that Akito hasn’t been
acting like himself lately?

128
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,103
‐ His success at boson jumping
seems to have unleashed

129
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,063
a repressed portion
of his personality.

130
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,693
Every little boy has dreams
of being a great hero

131
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,691
when he grows up,

132
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,232
and it seems Akito’s fantasies

133
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,445
were even stronger than usual.

134
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,185
However, for most of his life,

135
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,527
he has repressed
this part of himself.

136
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,453
This is why he keeps insisting
that he is just a cook

137
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,084
and has such a phobia about
accepting responsibilities.

138
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,499
‐ Stop peeking at
my memory tiles!

139
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,371
‐ It’s hard not to do that
when they’re all laid out

140
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,956
on the table in front of you.

141
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,581
Just look at them.

142
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,248
They’re just begging to
be examined and explained.

143
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,297
Which brings us back
to the original point.

144
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,934
Being the first earth human

145
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,679
to successfully
boson jump on his own

146
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,603
has paradoxically
made you a real hero.

147
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,851
‐ A hero, huh?

148
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,234
‐ You do seem to have gotten
more resilient, Tenkawa.

149
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,769
‐ I suppose I have,

150
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,022
but I don’t think that’s
what’s required to be a hero.

151
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,187
I’ve always thought a real hero

152
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,565
is someone who’s willing
to sacrifice everything

153
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,162
in order to keep other people
safe, somebody like Gai.

154
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,831
But if you’re going
to call me a hero

155
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,451
for doing what I did,

156
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,906
then I guess I just don’t
know what a hero really is.

157
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,157
‐ So I guess that you’ve got

158
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,669
what you always
wanted now, right?

159
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,209
Isn’t being a hero and
fighting alien monsters

160
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,495
like Gekiganger

161
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,878
the kind of life you’ve
always dreamed about?

162
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,805
‐ Except the enemy are humans.

163
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,801
(suspenseful music)

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,140
(yelling)

165
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:33,971
‐ In there too?

166
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,555
‐ It’s everywhere.

167
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,022
There’s no way we can get
through all that stuff.

168
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,440
(groaning)

169
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,022
‐ You’re saying
something’s wrong

170
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,655
with the connection
to the Y‐Unit?

171
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,652
‐ To be specific, the Y‐Unit’s
weapons control computer

172
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,285
is no longer responding to
the commands that I give it.

173
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,992
Also, the software
diagnostics have been blocked.

174
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,743
‐ Is this a hardware issue?

175
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,947
There must be a solution.

176
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,795
‐ We’re completely
screwed down here!

177
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,830
All passageways leading
from the Nadesico

178
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,373
to the Y‐Unit either have high
voltage flowing through them

179
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,918
or non‐functioning
gravity control.

180
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,884
It’s as if the Y‐Unit doesn’t
want to let anyone in!

181
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,675
‐ Will we be able to fire
the phase transition cannon

182
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,678
in 30 minutes?

183
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,129
‐ It won’t be
possible if the Y‐Unit

184
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,008
doesn’t start responding
to our commands.

185
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,175
‐ I think today’s
lesson might be

186
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,813
to not try to do
everything at once.

187
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,981
‐ We’ll have to send
a team into the Y‐Unit

188
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,690
to make it operational again.

189
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,980
‐ But our pilots
aren’t doing too well.

190
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,024
‐ Just what does that mean?

191
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,687
‐ They claim to
be seeing ghosts.

192
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,363
(gasping)

193
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,736
‐ Spooks be gone.

194
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,074
(gasping)

195
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,159
‐ Mister Yamada?

196
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,832
‐ Did you just say Yamada?

197
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,451
Are you sure?

198
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,619
‐ There are others
too, but who are they?

199
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,289
(ominous music)

200
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,933
‐ I never thought I’d
be leading an attack

201
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,802
inside a ship on a bicycle!

202
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,389
Come on, pump those pedals!

203
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,432
‐ I wish you were pumping
something besides those pedals.

204
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,848
‐ Hey, let’s have a
race, and the person

205
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,275
who gets to the computer
first wins a prize, okay?

206
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,234
You want to, huh?

207
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,233
‐ Why the hell not?

208
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,444
I could use a laugh.

209
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,855
‐ And the person
who gets there first

210
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,232
gets to claim his prize
from the losers, okay, okay?

211
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,448
‐ Okay, but what
if there’s a tie?

212
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,110
‐ There’s enough of me
to go around, you know.

213
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,948
‐ If I win, I get
to have the captain.

214
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,623
‐ Now, wait just a second there.

215
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,953
She’s not mine to give out
anyway, you little weenie.

216
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,249
Hey, come back here!

217
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,916
‐ These men sure
have strange tastes.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,460
‐ You can sure say that again.

219
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,555
‐ This is all completely
inappropriate.

220
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,010
‐ I think someone’s jealous.

221
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,592
‐ Don’t be ridiculous!

222
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,725
That was simply my professional
opinion of the situation.

223
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,352
‐ What I’m worried
about right now

224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,720
is how their personalities
seem to be changing.

225
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,886
‐ That is a point.

226
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,814
Akito seems much more
assertive than usual.

227
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,517
‐ I don’t think we should be
doing something this dangerous,

228
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,977
but I guess we have to.

229
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,975
‐ Um.

230
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,147
‐ (laughing) Don’t
worry, ladies.

231
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,149
I’ve got it.

232
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,908
(gunshots blasting)

233
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,660
(yelling)

234
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,781
(laughing)

235
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,198
Come on, get on your
bicycles, girls.

236
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,907
Right, there’s 100
obstacles up ahead

237
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,996
and I can’t wait for an
excuse to blow them all away!

238
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,422
(laughing)

239
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,963
(triumphant orchestral music)

240
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,100
‐ [Tsukumo] I thought
our goal was to establish

241
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,523
a true and lasting peace.

242
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,352
‐ [Male Speaker] Exactly.

243
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,686
That is why we fight.

244
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,942
‐ Then in that case,
isn’t it imperative

245
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,033
that we at least consider
a negotiated peace?

246
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,279
(groaning)

247
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,490
Of course, the earth
government must first apologize

248
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,361
for their past injustices.

249
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,199
‐ Our ancient phase transition
core fabrication plant

250
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,914
is on the verge
of breaking down,

251
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:43,866
and our excavations on Mars

252
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,293
havethe desired results.

253
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,832
Is peace possible?

254
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,876
‐ I have a plan that
should work, sir.

255
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,458
‐ Now!

256
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,665
Let’s (mumbling) in!

257
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,895
(thunder clapping)
(dramatic music)

258
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,892
‐ Darn you, Tsukumo!

259
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,398
Why did you pull me out when
victory was almost mine?

260
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,231
‐ To save your life.

261
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,978
‐ Big brother!

262
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,858
‐ Yukina!

263
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,705
What are you doing here?

264
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,700
‐ I heard what
you’ve been doing!

265
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,203
(yelling)

266
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,874
‐ [Male Speaker]
Miss, Miss Manoko.

267
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,203
Are you alright?

268
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,457
‐ [Female Speaker]
Ken would be alright

269
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,460
if it wasn’t for the mackerel
sushi I made for him.

270
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,671
I’ve got to pull through.

271
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,750
(yelling)

272
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,586
‐ Brother!

273
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,093
‐ Where are your manners?

274
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,144
I can’t believe you’re so rude
as to interrupt Gekiganger.

275
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,301
‐ I hate that cartoon.

276
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,548
Now, what’s this
I hear about you

277
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,138
and some stupid peace treaty?

278
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,525
‐ A peace treaty, Tsukumo?

279
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,139
‐ Well, actually,
I was gonna tell‐‐

280
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,598
‐ What is the meaning of this?

281
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,597
How can you think of forgiving
those subhuman brutes?

282
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,398
‐ If peace is truly
our objective,

283
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,191
then we’ve got to
try every path!

284
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,235
‐ It’s a bunch of bull!

285
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,778
The real truth is
that my big brother

286
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,571
has a thing for an earth woman.

287
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,986
Ew!

288
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,537
You disgust me, big brother!

289
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,500
‐ It appears that our memories

290
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,214
have somehow become
interconnected.

291
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,923
‐ Do you mean this isn’t all
just a really strange dream?

292
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,264
‐ If it was a dream, we couldn’t
see each other’s memories.

293
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,759
For example, you were a bed
wetter until you were 10.

294
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,183
‐ (gasping) But I’m
not one anymore.

295
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,814
(nervous giggling)

296
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,098
‐ Idiots.

297
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,721
‐ Bit if our personalities
are all here, Miss Fressange,

298
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,938
then who or what
is in our bodies?

299
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,399
‐ Other facets of our
personalities, I’m afraid.

300
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,609
The parts we normally repress.

301
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,188
‐ Keep pedaling!

302
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,148
(mumbling)

303
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,148
‐ Lookie, look.

304
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,317
It’s the hatch to the Y‐Unit!

305
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,068
‐ Come on, you wussies!

306
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,738
We’ve got a computer to blow!

307
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,408
‐ Estobolus has appeared in
front of the enemy flagship.

308
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,917
Mister Tenkawa has
successfully boson jumped.

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,290
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

310
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,336
‐ Alright, Irena.

311
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,459
It’s my turn to try it.

312
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,415
‐ Not yet.

313
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,714
‐ Just shut up and do it.

314
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,799
I can handle this baby
just as well as he can.

315
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,892
(mumbling)

316
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,768
(growling)

317
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,902
(yelling)

318
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,481
(heavy breathing)

319
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,528
What happened?

320
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,532
‐ It was obviously going to fail

321
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,203
so I aborted your jump attempt.

322
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,203
‐ But why?!

323
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,324
‐ But why?!

324
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,738
Look at yourself.

325
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,503
‐ Damn it.

326
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,461
Why can’t I jump?

327
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,830
Brother.

328
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,627
‐ Your brother was so
much older than you.

329
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,460
Your father was grooming him
as his successor, wasn’t he?

330
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,256
‐ So what does that have
to do with anything?

331
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,592
‐ He died.

332
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,626
‐ He was killed on the
way back from Mars.

333
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,257
‐ And you never wanted
the responsibility

334
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,547
your brother’s death put on you.

335
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,808
‐ What does it
matter what I want?!

336
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,269
‐ It’s not possible
for you to be here.

337
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,227
‐ Brother? It can’t be.

338
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,607
I thought you were dead.

339
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,526
‐ [Akito] Gai.

340
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,985
‐ What’s going on?

341
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,408
Why are they just
standing there?

342
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,286
‐ Pilots Tenkawa,
Izumi, Nakotski,

343
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,465
please respond to our
communications immediately.

344
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,673
Hello?

345
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,591
‐ Everyone’s acting
so strangely.

346
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,920
‐ Yes, you’re right.

347
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,093
‐ I’m afraid to ask
about the second team.

348
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,591
‐ (laughing) I love
to shoot things!

349
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,595
‐ (yelling) Somebody help me!

350
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,929
‐ So exactly what
is happening here?

351
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,515
The personalities of
our pilots have changed

352
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,179
and they’re all
acting very strangely.

353
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,938
‐ And Miss Fressange isn’t
here to explain everything.

354
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,315
(giggling)

355
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,692
‐ Gai, you’re dead.

356
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,567
(struggling)

357
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,782
But why?

358
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,326
Why are you trying to keep us

359
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,873
from reaching the computer, Gai?

360
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,745
Is there something
you’re trying to tell us?

361
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,462
‐ The dead aren’t trying
to tell you anything.

362
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,005
There are no such things
as ghosts in this world.

363
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,339
The phantoms you are seeing
are probably old memories

364
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,885
that are emotionally attached

365
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,466
to the suppressed portions
of your personality

366
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,843
that are resurfacing.

367
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,349
In short, it is yourself
that holds you back.

368
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,477
‐ When will you stop
pulling me back?

369
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,650
When will you finally
leave me in peace?

370
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,944
I’m not afraid, not anymore.

371
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:26,647
‐ Hey, Izumi.

372
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,447
Who is this a picture of?

373
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,069
‐ He’s one of your
fiances, isn’t he?

374
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,317
I know that you had two,

375
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,738
and both of them died pretty
tragically, didn’t they?

376
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,618
‐ One lost to disease,
the other in an accident.

377
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,706
Everyone who’s ever been
close to me has died.

378
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,005
Please tell me that the time’s
come for me to join you.

379
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,668
It’s alright, I’ve
been waiting for this.

380
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,338
There’s nothing left
to keep me here.

381
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,259
(melancholy music)

382
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,676
Don’t go.

383
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,728
Please don’t abandon me again.

384
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,859
Please.

385
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,069
‐ For Izumi and Nakotski, it
isn’t death itself they fear.

386
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,481
It’s the separation it’s
brought with their loved ones

387
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,188
that fills them
with such terror.

388
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,028
On the other hand, Akito’s
fear is much more direct.

389
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,454
You still haven’t come to terms

390
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,033
with the death of Jiro Yamada

391
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,539
because that would mean coming
to terms with your own fears.

392
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,160
‐ But I’m not afraid
of dying, I’m not!

393
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,288
‐ Oh really?

394
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,334
Are you sure?

395
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,877
‐ Well, maybe I am scared,
but I keep fighting.

396
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,134
I never give up when
it’s important anyway.

397
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,506
That’s why I fight,
’cause if I don’t‐‐

398
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,643
‐ (sighing) There you go getting
all full of yourself again.

399
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,561
There’s no rhyme or
reason for any of this.

400
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,733
‐ No reason?

401
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,778
It’s all like that time we
took our first bicycle ride.

402
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,401
We didn’t think, we just did it.

403
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,447
(gasping) And now I understand.

404
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,203
There are no reasons!

405
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:55,993
I understand.

406
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,735
Everything makes sense now, Gai!

407
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,462
‐ We’re approaching
the large enemy fleet

408
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,714
assembling behind the moon.

409
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,423
‐ Is the Y‐Unit online?

410
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,592
(heavy breathing)

411
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,725
(static screeching)

412
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,771
‐ Get off our ship,
you damn (mumbling)!

413
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,943
‐ [Captain] Standby
on the PT cannon.

414
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,106
‐ [Ruri] Expanding Y‐Unit.

415
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,025
‐ Y‐Unit phase
transition engines.

416
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,242
Raise power output
to maximum load.

417
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,534
‐ Maximum power.

418
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,277
Locking on enemy
fleet coordinates.

419
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,490
‐ Fire!

420
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,250
(loud explosion)

421
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,129
It’s actually destroying
the fabric of space itself.

422
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,134
‐ I’ve never seen
anything like it.

423
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,796
‐ We can’t use a weapon
like this against humans.

424
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,304
‐ Not unless all we want
to do is vaporize them.

425
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,645
‐ As you know, the
nanomachine devices

426
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,227
implanted in our pilots

427
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,942
create an auxiliary memory
storage area near the brain.

428
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,903
Apparently, the
Jovian hacker crab

429
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,653
mistook those storage areas
for a form of computer memory

430
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,318
and hacked into them.

431
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,494
‐ So how did our minds all get
stuck talking to each other?

432
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,163
‐ Through our communicators.

433
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,991
Since our personal communicators
are all interconnected,

434
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,658
the hacker crab perceived them

435
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,208
to be part of a larger network.

436
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,421
By downloading the
entire network,

437
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,790
the hermit crab linked
all our minds together.

438
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,497
‐ But what kind of
data was the enemy

439
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,379
looking to obtain from us?

440
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,416
‐ I don’t know yet.

441
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,047
‐ Oh, but you and I
have never gone through

442
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,545
nanomachine treatment,
have we, Miss Fressange?

443
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,008
‐ I can’t explain that either.

444
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,556
‐ Well, that’s
certainly unusual.

445
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,232
‐ [Tsukumo] What?! You’ve
already sent a peace emissary?!

446
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,481
‐ [Male Speaker] Yes, I
have sent the emissary

447
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,151
you suggested to this Nadesico.

448
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,690
‐ What are you talking about?!

449
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,113
Who did you send
to the Nadesico?!

450
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,532
‐ Oh, haven’t you figured
out that plot twist, yet?

451
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,030
‐ You tricked my big
brother, earth woman.

452
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,077
And for that treachery,
I swear you will pay!

453
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,792
‐ What do you mean you won’t
participate in the experiments?

454
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,461
You’re the only
person who can do it,

455
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,960
the only one who can
protect the Nadesico!

456
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,002
It’s just like that
cartoon Gekiganger.

457
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,957
You’re the only one who can
protect the blue planet earth!

458
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,508
‐ You can make it sound
as noble as you want,

459
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,722
but I don’t think you even know
what a real hero is, Irena.

460
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,565
This isn’t a game, you know?

461
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,480
I think knowing what to fight
for is what makes a real hero.

462
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,735
That’s weird.

463
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,896
What is this picture
of I doing here?

464
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,566
‐ Look at this wonderful memory

465
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,245
that Akito and I both share!

466
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,114
Look!

467
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,078
(relaxing music)

468
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,261

Don’t miss our next exciting
episode, Protect The Visitor.

481
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,005
Hey, get a room you two!
