00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,685
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,348
‐ I still can’t believe
I actually entered

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,558
that idiotic contest.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,727
So, let’s not dwell
on it anymore.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,526
At least I’m not the only
one who embarrassed herself.

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,861
We tried to forget about
the enemy for a while,

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,156
but now it’s back to
business as usual.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,699
I wonder if we’ll
ever stop fighting.

17
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,492
‐ It’s dreams!

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,110
Dreams not drapes.

19
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,657
And why are you singing
at a time like this?

20
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,533
We are in battle, remember?

21
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,830
‐ But we’re just a rear guard,

22
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,161
and it’s not like
anyone’s waiting

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,907
for us to do anything
important, you know.

24
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,497
‐ That’s because they
know we’re undependable,

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,715
just look at us.

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,504
This isn’t a crew,
it’s a collection

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,796
of social misfits, who
don’t have the ambition

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,340
to be street people.

29
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,843
But our days of life
behind the scenes are over.

30
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,685
First, we rid the earth
of the Jovian Lizards

31
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,013
and trample their chulips.

32
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,426
Then we’ll re‐invade
Mars with the Nadesico

33
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,685
‐ Abnormal increase in
boson particle readings

34
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,517
occurring in the
rear hanger, captain.

35
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,522
(screams)

36
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,905
(suspenseful music)

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,614
‐ We’re receiving
word from the front

38
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,403
that a large enemy battleship
has emerged from a chulip.

39
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,699
Apparently, it’s heading
directly towards the Nadesico.

40
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,573
‐ Boson reaction
increases now originating

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
from the front of the Y unit.

42
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,407
Explosion detected
in Y unit, captain.

43
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,658
‐ [Captain] What’s the
extent of the damage?

44
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,668
‐ The rear hanger, and Y unit,
block 3 have been devastated,

45
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,341
but this is extremely strange.

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,130
I’m detecting a ship just
inside our sensor range.

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,173
‐ What in the hell is going on?

48
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,467
What’s been causing all
of these explosions?

49
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,051
If it wasn’t for our
new distortion blocks,

50
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,887
we’d all be dead as disco.

51
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,972
‐ [Women] What’s a
distortion block?

52
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,846
‐ Thank you for
asking. (chuckles)

53
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,773
I thought something
like this might happen,

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,813
so I designed a system
of distortion fields

55
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,855
that compartmentalize
all blast damage

56
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,069
that occurs inside the ship.

57
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,609
(laughs)

58
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,074
I thought this might happen,

59
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,153
but they all said
that I was mad,

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,446
now vindication
is mine. (laughs)

61
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,663
Well, look who’s laughing
now, thanks to my genius.

62
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,992
‐ Ha, aren’t you
supposed to be repairing

63
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,497
the Y unit right now?

64
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,249
(laughs)

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,580
‐ What’s the status of
the enemy vessel, Ruri?

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,876
‐ Distance: 42 kilometers,
approaching rapidly.

67
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,342
‐ What are you going
to do now captain?

68
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,508
‐ Let’s run for it.

69
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,096
‐ [Crew] Huh?

70
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,771
‐ [Captain] Manato, all
ahead, full at maximum rate

71
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,979
of climb, please.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,430
‐ But we’ll go
straight into space

73
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,188
if we do that captain.

74
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,899
‐ [Captain] That’ll be fine.

75
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,229
‐ Aye, aye.

76
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,944
‐ Boson reactions
increasing again.

77
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,015
This time just below the bridge.

78
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,938
Engines at full.

79
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,954
‐ Take us up at maximum power.

80
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,547
‐ [Ruri] Enemy ship is pursuing

81
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,307
at an increased rate of speed.

82
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,637
‐ He’s persistent isn’t he?

83
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,927
‐ Why are we running?

84
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,978
Let’s turn around
and hit him back.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,152
‐ Right, and then
their new weapon

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,730
would make us all go ka‐bang.

87
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,035
‐ Someone here would be happy
with any kind of banging,

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,320
‐ [Hikaru and
Izumi] wouldn’t she?

89
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,321
Talk about touchy,
feely. (laughing)

90
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,775
‐ [Ryoko] Come back
here, you damn jerks!

91
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,946
‐ Are you ready to
explain the cause

92
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,084
of the explosion
yet, Ms. Fressange?

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,540
‐ Oh, I can explain
everything, captain.

94
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,663
And I’ll be serving
refreshments as well.

95
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,209
Our analysis has shown
that the explosives found

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,297
in the rect. sections of
the ship are identical

97
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,341
to ones used in Jovian missiles.

98
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,594
Apparently, these new
devices are being adapted

99
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,007
from an existing weapon systems.

100
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,176
‐ Now, wait a second,
are you saying

101
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,683
that this wasn’t some
new kind of missile?

102
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,925
‐ That is correct.

103
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,346
It would appear
to be an outgrowth

104
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,936
of their giant robot
propulsion systems.

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,480
Now, if you’ll observe closely,

106
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,615
as you know each of
the Daimajin types

107
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,192
have a phased transition engine.

108
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,938
This allows the
robot to boson jump

109
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,488
out of danger.

110
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,412
Some models can jump
almost as far as a chulip,

111
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,082
and now the Jovians
are using them

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
to deliver a different
kind of payload.

113
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,746
‐ In other words, you’re saying

114
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,291
that if their
robots can teleport

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,872
without the aid of a chulip‐‐

116
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,579
‐ Then they might also be able

117
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,379
to teleport a bomb that way.

118
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,092
‐ Exactly, and the
abnormal influx

119
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,053
of boson particles we
detected before each

120
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,512
of the explosions is identical

121
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,052
to the rise observed
when a Daimajin jumps.

122
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,386
Therefore, there is only
one logical conclusion

123
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,763
that can be drawn.

124
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,470
The Jovians now have the ability

125
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,688
to teleport bombs directly
inside the Nadesico itself.

126
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,729
‐ Wait, can’t our
distortion fields stop it?

127
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,275
‐ I’m afraid they can’t.

128
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,268
Since the explosives
are teleported

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,780
they can appear within
our distortion field
without warning.

130
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,403
And if their aim
is accurate enough

131
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,357
to target our bridge
or the engine room

132
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,658
with a direct hit, we probably
wouldn’t know what hit us.

133
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,543
‐ Boson cannon.

134
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,830
‐ [Crew] A boson cannon?

135
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,003
‐ Oh, I was just
thinking of a fancy name

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,250
to call it in my
official diaries.

137
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,455
‐ Feminine artillery,
boson cannons. (chuckles)

138
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,418
(laughing)

139
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,428
‐ Did you see how those
cowardly earthlings ran

140
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,138
from our mighty
leap cannon attack?

141
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,800
These UEAF scum have
no spines at all.

142
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,600
‐ Think again, running like
that was the only thing

143
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,774
that saved them from our
leap cannon’s third shot.

144
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,561
That’s a very wise and
able captain out there.

145
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,516
‐ Aren’t you giving them
too much credit, sir?

146
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,686
‐ Far better too
much than too little.

147
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,575
While hunting the rabbit,
the lion may meet the tiger.

148
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,953
Have the Denjin ready
for launch just in case.

149
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,612
‐ [Jovian Official] Yessir!

150
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,618
‐ [Nadesico Crew Member] Man,
there’s no way out of this.

151
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,029
‐ No, this system
does have a weakness.

152
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,867
Since the enemy is
attempting to close in

153
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,084
and hasn’t tried to fire,

154
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,833
that would indicate
that the boson cannon

155
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,957
must be quite limited.

156
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,133
‐ You’re talking
about it’s range?

157
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,170
‐ Correct, since the enemy had

158
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,634
to be in sensor range in order

159
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,382
to launch its attack,
it would appear

160
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,844
that that’s its maximum range.

161
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,176
‐ That makes sense.

162
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,590
‐ Considering the
distance from which

163
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,217
the enemy shot the
first two rounds

164
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,143
into the Nadesico,
their targeting range

165
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,432
must be less than
100 kilometers.

166
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,476
‐ Can we use the
Aestivalis against them?

167
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,641
‐ Well, chances are
we get blown apart

168
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,148
before we got close.

169
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,190
‐ And since our Aestis
don’t pack enough firepower

170
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,145
to crack their distortion field,

171
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,153
it would be a waste of lives.

172
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,195
Like I said, there’s no way out.

173
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,609
‐ [Ryoko] Says you, you
long‐haired showoff!

174
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,317
‐ Now, let’s just
assess the situation

175
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,238
quietly and professionally.

176
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,155
Why don’t we all listen to
what our captain has to say?

177
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,667
(doubtful music)

178
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,883
‐ Oh, please don’t
tell me you’re going

179
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,135
to start snoring and then make

180
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,474
that lame old joke
about falling asleep.

181
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,433
You’re not, right?

182
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,801
Captain Misumaru?

183
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,258
(laughs)

184
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,178
‐ Don’t be ridiculous,
you don’t really think

185
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,347
I’d be using such an old joke.

186
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,436
(laughs)

187
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,399
‐ She was thinkin’ about it.

188
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,021
‐ [Crew Member] Well, why
don’t we take a short break

189
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,356
and think about it?

190
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,531
Hopefully, someone can
think of something.

191
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,861
‐ Hey, take it from that
side that you figured out

192
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,858
it’s a lost cause as well.

193
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,408
‐ No, it’s not about that.

194
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,493
Since we were out
over the ocean,

195
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,036
Ms. Howmei was going
to teach me how to fish

196
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,370
after the fighting was over.

197
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,965
‐ Please tell me you’re kidding.

198
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,170
How can you be
thinking of fishing

199
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,669
at a time like this?

200
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,631
‐ Well, there aren’t any
oceans or fish on Mars,

201
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,172
so I was really looking
forward to fishing.

202
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,546
‐ Fishing!

203
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,882
Akito, did you just say
what I thought you said?

204
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,800
That’s it, that’s it!

205
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,967
You’re so brilliant, Akito.

206
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,806
So, say that thing
you just said again.

207
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,351
‐ Huh, about Ms. Howmei?

208
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,314
‐ No, no, I mean the other part.

209
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,694
‐ You mean fishing?

210
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,311
‐ That’s it, that’s
the answer, fishing!

211
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,165
‐ Keep it moving!

212
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,454
Reconfigure those
Aestis for zero gravity.

213
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,080
‐ Chief are we really
resetting our missiles

214
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,425
for time detonation?

215
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,830
‐ That’s what the captain said,

216
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,588
and I ain’t arguing with her.

217
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,749
‐ Uh, but sir‐‐

218
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,087
‐ Just do as you’re
told and finish it!

219
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,304
‐ Okay, okay!

220
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,093
‐ [Akito] Hey, what’s
with the spear?

221
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,015
‐ Oh, it’s another
of the chief’s toys.

222
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,684
He says it can
neutralize a field

223
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,852
for a few seconds.

224
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,810
‐ So, I can do a pass and slash?

225
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,392
‐ Oh, yeah, sure.

226
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,437
‐ Come on girls, let’s hurry.

227
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,442
Our pilots are going
to need all the energy

228
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,443
they can for the
captain’s plan to work.

229
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,285
Let’s make sure they eat well.

230
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,570
‐ [Aides] Yes, ma’am.

231
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,993
‐ We’ve got to get
these box lunches

232
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:13,863
out to the catapult deck

233
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,157
before they take off.

234
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,991
‐ I’ll take them there, ma’am.

235
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,237
‐ Wait, I want to take them too.

236
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,947
‐ I want to take the
one for Mr. Akatsuki.

237
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,617
‐ I’ll take the one for Akito.

238
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,915
‐ [Aides] I don’t think
that’s such a good idea.

239
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,959
‐ I’m not worried, the
captain doesn’t scare me.

240
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,246
‐ I’d like the
one for Ms. Ryoko.

241
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,418
(gasping and giggling)

242
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,837
‐ [Ms. Howmei Voiceover]
I just hope this isn’t

243
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,757
someone’s last meal.

244
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,474
‐ [Megumi] All
Aestivalis pilots report

245
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,755
they are ready to launch.

246
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,807
‐ Everything’s been
completed as scheduled.

247
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,310
All missiles reset and
ready exactly as ordered.

248
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,273
‐ The fires in the galley
have been shut down,

249
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,653
we’re all ready here.

250
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,309
‐ And I went around
the ship and shut down

251
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,688
all unnecessary
power consumption.

252
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,487
‐ All preparations for the
operation are complete, captain.

253
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,320
‐ Ms. Haruka, please shut down
the phase transition engines.

254
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,316
‐ Initiating engine shutdown.

255
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,959
‐ The Jovian ship’s
sensors shouldn’t be able

256
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,499
to track us with
our engines off.

257
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,294
On the other hand,
without our shields

258
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,626
we’ll be completely
vulnerable to their attacks.

259
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,922
You better know
what you’re doing.

260
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,006
‐ Oh, I have faith.

261
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,088
I know we’re fighting
other people now.

262
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,637
I know how they think.

263
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,641
(upbeat music)

264
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,018
‐ [Crew Member] Captain,
our sensors have lost track

265
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,187
of the enemy vessel.

266
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,363
What?
‐ All of the enemy ship’s

267
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,942
electronic, infrared,
and graviton signals

268
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,277
simply just disappeared.

269
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,741
‐ They’ve gone to silent running

270
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,533
to keep us from targeting
them, impressive.

271
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,026
‐ But wouldn’t that
leave their ship

272
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,077
without a contortion buffer

273
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,702
from our weapons, sir?

274
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,959
‐ Nothing they have could
stop the leap cannon,

275
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,420
but now they have a
deadly advantage over us.

276
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,752
‐ What’s that?

277
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,837
‐ Simply put, we have no
idea where they are now,

278
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,301
while our engines and sensors
make us one big target.

279
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,882
We are going to have to
play this one carefully.

280
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,180
Cease acceleration, let’s
review the situation.

281
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,603
‐ [Ruri] Enemy has
ceased accelerating.

282
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,393
Now, moving at a velocity
roughly equal to ours.

283
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,516
‐ Strange, I expected
them to close in.

284
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,364
‐ Looks like they’re playing
it really cautious. (screams)

285
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,819
‐ Blowing starboard ballast,

286
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,859
heading changed five
degrees to port.

287
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:15,823
Down, minus two degrees.

288
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,742
‐ All systems are
responding normally.

289
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,320
(screams)
‐ You really should wear

290
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,195
your seatbelt in
zero G, captain.

291
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,492
‐ Why didn’t you mention that

292
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,325
before we shut off
the gravity. (screams)

293
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,201
‐ I must say I’m very impressed

294
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
by your idea of
using pressurized air

295
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:29,922
to move the ship.

296
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,538
‐ It looks like all the
Aestivalis are ready

297
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,878
to launch, captain.

298
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,423
‐ Then please have them
deployed immediately!

299
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,047
‐ All Aestivalis prepare
for manual launch mode!

300
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,934
‐ [Pilots] Roger!

301
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,505
‐ I still feel like
an idiot doing this.

302
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,017
‐ [Mr. Uribatake] Who
cares, keep running or

303
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,099
you’ll cause a pileup.

304
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,315
‐ [Akito] Oh, all right.

305
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
‐ [Pilots] This is really dorky!

306
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,560
Hey, keep your distance.

307
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,113
Oh, man what an undignified way

308
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,153
to take off.

309
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,486
‐ Well, what are
you waiting for!

310
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,280
‐ Okay, okay.

311
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,113
(upbeat music)

312
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,831
‐ Have fun fishing, Akito!

313
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,503
‐ I sure hope this works
out like you think it will.

314
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,712
This is gonna be pretty bad

315
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,000
if they start shooting at us.

316
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,965
‐ Don’t worry, Akito.

317
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,503
Those people are human
beings just like us.

318
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,459
I just know this’ll
work out, Akito dear.

319
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,129
Yeah, yeah.
‐ Oh, my God, I’m gonna vomit.

320
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,639
‐ Prepare to fire
gravity wave cannon!

321
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,150
‐ Enemy gravity blast
cannon has missed

322
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,023
by 75 meters.

323
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,650
‐ That was close.

324
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,905
‐ It looks like the gravity
wave cannon didn’t hit anything

325
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,147
that time, captain.

326
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,368
‐ How did they change headings
without their engines?

327
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,120
‐ Just what are they up to?

328
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,160
They don’t have enough firepower

329
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,455
for a surprise attack.

330
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,446
I know that.

331
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,578
‐ It feels strange to just sit

332
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,576
out here and wait.

333
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,207
‐ Yeah.
(snoring)

334
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,797
‐ Now, I lay me down to sleep.

335
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,090
‐ But in space there is no down.

336
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,434
In order to lay down,
you’ve got to get a duck.

337
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,339
‐ [Ruri] Still no change
in enemy vessel speed

338
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,548
and direction.

339
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,759
‐ Release all missiles
in the direction

340
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,557
of the enemy’s
estimated heading.

341
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,106
‐ Did you really have to launch
all our missiles, captain?

342
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,691
Those missiles are expensive,

343
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,397
and we are operating on
an extremely tight budget.

344
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,488
‐ I know, but you have
to have a lot of faith

345
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,952
if you’re going to
catch a big one.

346
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,203
‐ Enough fishing analogies,
we’re not fighting fish,

347
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,577
we’re fighting human being.

348
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,543
‐ And because of that,
they can be counted on

349
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,252
to react in a certain manner,

350
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,964
that’s the essence of strategy.

351
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,423
Now then, it’s time
for us to return

352
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,674
to our original course.

353
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,674
Minato?
‐ Yes?

354
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,466
‐ Change our heading now.

355
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,549
‐ Aye, aye, ma’am.

356
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,689
‐ [Jovians] Whoa!

357
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,232
‐ [Ruri] Enemy vessel has come
into contact with missiles.

358
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,278
‐ Go ahead and
blow them up then.

359
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,532
‐ No, not yet.

360
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,281
‐ What, but wasn’t that
your strategy, captain?

361
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,276
‐ If we fire at
gravity blast now,

362
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,618
all the missiles will detonate.

363
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,912
‐ That won’t work.

364
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,453
Their distortion
field is too powerful.

365
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,409
What is your plan, captain?

366
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,538
‐ Fishing is about
patience and waiting.

367
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,425
‐ How can those damn
earthlings be doing this to us?

368
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,674
Where are those
missiles coming from?

369
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,005
‐ [Crew Member] No
single point of origin

370
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,130
can be established.

371
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,138
‐ Calm down, our ships
can withstand punishment

372
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,351
like this with ease.

373
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,509
‐ Analyze their
missile dispersion.

374
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,716
Track that back to
a probable source.

375
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
‐ [Crew Member]
Probable position of
the enemy calculated.

376
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,345
‐ Right, change heading
to estimated position.

377
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,688
‐ Wait, this is a trap.

378
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,273
Do not change heading.

379
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,780
‐ I’m aware of the trap.

380
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,321
They may be waiting behind
that missile screen,

381
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,575
but now we know where they are

382
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,114
and their shields are down.

383
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,619
‐ Do you really expect them
to be in the same place?

384
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,240
If we go chasing after them now,

385
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,866
we’ll jump straight into the
enemy’s swarm of missiles.

386
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,374
And if they were to fire
their gravity wave cannon,

387
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,827
all of those missiles
would detonate,

388
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
and even our reliant space
time contortion buffer

389
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,804
would be overwhelmed.

390
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,419
‐ So then where is he hiding?

391
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,875
‐ I don’t have to know that.

392
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,465
We’ll make him come to us.

393
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,800
Current heading, all
engines ahead full!

394
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,636
‐ Enemy has not changed heading.

395
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,142
They’re passing by
the missile screen

396
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,012
and accelerating, captain.

397
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,480
‐ I guess that we
misjudged them.

398
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,139
‐ What are we going
to do now, captain?

399
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,397
Since the missile field
trick didn’t work,

400
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,150
maybe we should
raise our shields.

401
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,651
‐ Don’t worry about it.

402
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,993
Akito and the others will
handle the rest just fine.

403
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,398
‐ All I can say is
that this better work.

404
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,698
I don’t want to find
myself all alone

405
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,072
when it’s time to go
charging at the enemy.

406
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,368
♪ Catching fishes ♪

407

00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,513
‐ All Aestivalis,

416
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,604
fall into attack
formation, come on!

417
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,350
Here we go!

418
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,643
(enthusiastic music)

419
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,192
‐ This is Akatsuki,

420
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,272
come in Nadesico.

421
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,655
We got the big one.

422
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,691
Repeat, we got the big one!
‐ Charge!

423
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,995
‐ Bring the PT
engines back on line.

424
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,202
Power distortion field
to maximum strength.

425
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,454
Establish graviton wave
beam link to all Aestivalis.

426
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,196
‐ [Crew Member]
Just leave it to me.

427
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,618
Aye, aye.

428
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,544
‐ Five enemy humanoid
fighters approaching

429
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,083
rapidly from directly
above and below.

430
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,539
Bogey on scope, the enemy
vessel is dead ahead.

431
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,708
What?
‐ He’s good.

432
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,338
The enemy’s aim was to draw us

433
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,303
into the effective range
of their humanoid fighters,

434
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,845
but we can counter that.

435
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,388
Launch interceptors!

436
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,478
‐ For someone who keeps saying

437
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,850
that she doesn’t like to fight,

438
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,186
you certainly seem to be
rather good at it, captain.

439
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,322
‐ A captain’s job
is to win battles,

440
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,729
so I’m just doing what
I’m supposed to do.

441
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,818
And besides, the Nadesico
is where my Akito is.

442
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,914
‐ Akito again, just what do
you see in a loser like that?

443
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,662
‐ Akito always gives his
best, no matter what.

444
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,084
It’s so inspiring, and
when I see how hard

445
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,825
he pushes himself, it
just makes me wanna

446
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,205
work even harder.

447
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,298
‐ Maintain maximum field screen.

448
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,722
All units, target the center
of the boson emissions.

449
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,589
Got it?

450
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:12,845
‐ [Pilots] Roger!

451
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:21,266
(enthusiastic music moves
into dramatic music)

452
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,442
‐ We’re losing control
of the contortion buffer.

453
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,729
Collapse is imminent, captain.

454
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,942
‐ [Crew Member]
They’re all over us.

455
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,773
Damage reported
from all sections.

456
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,817
Captain!
‐ Calm down,

457
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,321
let the drone
interceptors handle

458
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,824
the enemy robots.

459
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,895
‐ [Crew Member] Locked onto
to enemy vessel position.

460
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,068
‐ Prepare to fire the
leap cannon on my mark!

461
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,119
‐ Boson rings, I’ve got ’em.

462
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,753
‐ [Crew Member] Hostile craft
has breached the buffer!

463
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,206
‐ Keep it away from
the leap cannon.

464
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:51,797
‐ [Saburota] Damn it!

465
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,421
‐ Saburota!

466
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,177
‐ I’m going to attack them
in the Denjin, captain!

467
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,391
(screams)

468
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,064
‐ Wait a second, boson
reaction’s increasing.

469
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,523
‐ [Ryoko] All units disperse.

470
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:05,815
‐ [Pilots] Roger!

471
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,320
‐ Come back here,
come back and fight.

472
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,481
(screams)

473
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,699
[Ryoko] Our Aestis are
always better, you jerk!

474
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,361
‐ [Pilots] Did you
just say we are better?

475
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,870
That’s right, sure we are.

476
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,160
Look out!

477
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,793
‐ Righteousness will
always prevail. (screams)

478
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,673
‐ Oh, no, you don’t, Jovian.

479
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,751
Looks like your weak
spot is your backside.

480
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,415
(screams)

481
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,765
I gotta remember that spot.

482
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,549
‐ Fall back, maximum speed.

483
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,836
‐ [Saburota]
Forgive me, captain.

484
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,797
Emergency leap!

485
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,927
‐ Saburota!

486
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,899
That hotshot, he leapt
to save the ship.

487
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,189
‐ Captain, I’m picking
up a light pod out there.

488
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,776
‐ What?

489
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,451
‐ [Saburota] Captain,
I am currently adrift

490
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,240
inside a light pod.

491
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,875
I would be most grateful
if you could retrieve me.

492
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,451
‐ Well, let’s go get him.

493
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,826
‐ [Crew Member] Aye, sir.

494
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,412
‐ Our executive officer
is certainly a handful.

495
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,120
(laughing)

496
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,998
‐ [Ruri] Enemy vessel is
withdrawing from combat

497
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,045
while laying down a cover fire.

498
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,628
All Aestivalis
pilots accounted for,

499
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,054
no damage or losses reported.

500
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,673
‐ Retrieve the Aestivalis wing

501
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,508
and chart a new
course back to earth.

502
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,303
And keep an eye out for
enemy stragglers as well.

503
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,727
‐ Catching fishies,
catching fishies

504
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,939
on a hook, on a hook.

505
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,480
‐ Captain, I’ve just
received a communication

506
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,863
from the enemy ship:

507
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,982
"I would like to pay my respects

508
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,726
"to your bold and
courageous leadership

509
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,988
"of your vessel.

510
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,529
"Hopefully, the
next time we meet

511
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,492
"this cursed war will be over.

512
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,873
"I look forward to being able

513
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,909
"to greet a dashing
man of action

514
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,333
"such as yourself
with a proper toast."

515
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,672
‐ Say what, a dashing
man of action?

516
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,919
I’m a cute and
adorable young woman!

517
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,548
(Being Myself by
Houko Kuwashima)

518
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,395
‐ [Man] Say, let me talk
about my older brother.

519
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,574
‐ [Woman] Oh, no,
that’s my brother,

520
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,203
and these are my pannys.

521
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,451
‐ [Man] I think it was back

522
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,821
when I was in
junior high school,

523
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,029
my brother had an accident

524
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,328
on his way from Mars to the‐‐

525
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,829
‐ [Woman] My brother
had an accident

526
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,911
when he was six, in
front of all the guests.

527
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,826
After that, he
wore rubber pants.

528
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,215
‐ [Man] After that,
father put all

529
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,923
his expectations on me.

530
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,051
Needless, to say it
wasn’t an easy transition.

531
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,920
‐ [Woman] And here’s an
even rougher transition.

532
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,295
The next episode of
Martian Successor Nadesico:

533
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,013
The Meadows We Once Ran Across.

534
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,303
‐ [Man] Would you mind?
