1
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,852
‐ [Narrator] Well, after
a whole lot of stumbling

2
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,984
and fussing about,
everyone seems to have

3
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,191
finally figured
out why they fight.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,231
Actually, I’m not too clear
on why this is important.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,938
But nobody asked me.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,316
Whatever.

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,112
On the other hand, I
would like to know why we

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,816
keep getting stuck with all
these annoying hot shots.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,370
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,683
(sings in a foreign language)

11
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,746
(peaceful guitar music)

12
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,634
(soft crying)

13
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,796
‐ Akito?

14
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:14,764
What’s wrong?

15
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,473
Does your tummy hurt, Akito?

16
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,853
‐ Shut up.

17
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,061
‐ [Yurika] Were you in a fight?

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,679
‐ Shut up.

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,096
Go away.

20
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,813
(breeze blowing)

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,400
‐ Hey, Akito.

22
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,482
Do you want to see a magic trick

23
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,976
that’ll turn you back to normal?

24
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,529
(gasps)
Close your eyes, Akito.

25
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,499
(smacking)
(Akito moaning)

26
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,539
‐ Ew, gross!

27
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,334
What did you do that for?

28
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,616
‐ (laughs)

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,747
I told you it’d turn
you back to normal.

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,423
‐ Don’t you ever do
that to me again!

31
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,302
(laughs)

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,630
(smacking)

33
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,125
(screaming)

34
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,181
Not again.

35
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,983
But why?

36
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,979
That was over 10 years ago.

37
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,939
‐ The Admiral is waiting.

38
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,985
Why are you still
in your room, pilot?

39
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,529
‐ I’ll pass, thank you.

40
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,742
I’m not comfortable
around that little creep.

41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,034
‐ You still think
he was involved

42
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,157
with Lieutenant Yamada’s death?

43
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,832
Weren’t you aware
that one of the

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,000
Admiral’s subordinates
has already

45
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,869
confessed and is
court‐martialed for that crime?

46
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,037
‐ Uh‐huh, yeah, sure.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,286
‐ Well, if you don’t show,
the Captain might think

48
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,837
you were trying to
get her attention.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
‐ What’s that mean?

50
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,756
‐ Oh, nothing.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
Nothing at all.

52
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,216
‐ May I have your attention.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,890
I have new orders
for you people.

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,050
‐ [Yurika] Excuse me, sir.

55
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,217
‐ Yes?

56
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,144
‐ Although Nergal
may have signed an

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,512
alliance with the armed forces,

58
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,598
our contract gives us the
right to refuse orders

59
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,056
that we deem to be unacceptable.

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,135
‐ Well, yes, technically.

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,058
‐ Then please submit
all new orders

62
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,898
directly to me so
I can determine

63
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,073
whether or not these
orders are in the

64
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,571
collective best
interests of the crew.

65
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,863
Is that clear?

66
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,654
‐ In other words,
you won’t be treated

67
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,158
like pawns in a war game.

68
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,949
Well, I don’t think
you’ll have anything

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,735
to complain about this
time since we’re not

70
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,828
asking you to fight.

71
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,162
‐ What?

72
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,117
‐ Our mission is to
elude enemy detection

73
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,329
and conduct a daring rescue.

74
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,128
‐ It’s a rescue mission?
‐ It’s a rescue mission?

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,923
‐ Yes, though I’m afraid
this assignment may

76
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,916
lack the glamor of
your attempt to rescue

77
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,547
the Martian settlers.

78
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,593
Still, it should be noble
enough for you, correct?

79
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,968
(pinging)

80
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,216
Our data indicates that
there are now 26,037 chulips

81
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,017
scattered across the
surface of the Earth.

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,850
As you know, their
presence has made standard

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,895
methods of transport
extremely vulnerable.

84
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,769
But the Nadesico will
be a match for them.

85
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,266
This is our destination.

86
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,777
Uchatsurawatosk Island
in the Bering Straits.

87
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,572
That’s where we’re going
to be making our pickup.

88
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,493
‐ A question please.

89
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,663
‐ Now what?

90
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,611
‐ Just how did this person get

91
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,118
left behind in the first place?

92
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,121
‐ Let’s just say
that our investigator

93
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,873
was sniffing around when
a fleet of Grasshoppers

94
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,503
attacked and eliminated
his support team.

95
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,874
Very messy.

96
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,168
‐ Oh.

97
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,543
At this time of year,
the straights are nearly

98
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,498
impassable with
snowstorms and blizzards.

99
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,260
The Nadesico is the
only ship available

100
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,090
that may be able to
slip in undetected and

101
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,635
rescue our investigator.

102
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,354
‐ There’s trouble
with the old flame.

103
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,603
‐ Their childhood friendship
has certainly gotten chilly.

104
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,643
‐ And since his relationship
with the chanteuse

105
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,229
has hit a sour note.

106
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,312
‐ Here’s your
chance, lover girl.

107
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,977
‐ Will you females stop
the romantic chit‐chat?

108
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,317
If we can’t rescue the
investigator in the

109
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,453
next two days we may
lose him to the enemy!

110
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,529
Time is of the essence!

111
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,825
Don’t you agree, Captain?

112
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:23,818
‐ Absolutely.

113
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,817
Let’s do it!

114
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,038
(engines roaring)

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,750
‐ [Narrator] And so the
Nadesico headed off toward

116
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,959
Uchatsurawatosk
Island in Destiny.

117
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,673
‐ There’s not much
for pilots to do

118
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,133
on this mission is there?

119
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,461
‐ I guess we’re supposed to
save our strength for later.

120
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,007
‐ Saving our strength
and wasting our time.

121
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,342
(laughs)
(groans)

122
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,847
‐ I think you need
some discipline.

123
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,472
You heard me, come on.

124
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,678
And it’s not for the reason
you perverts are thinking.

125
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,978
(snickering)

126
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,061
(rapid gunshots)

127
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,646
There’s something
I’ve been meaning to

128
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,983
ask you about, Akito.

129
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,568
‐ Ask me about what?

130
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,745
‐ About the Captain.

131
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,533
I need to know more about her.

132
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,284
‐ What about her?

133
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,615
‐ So, are you and she an item?

134
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
‐ Huh?

135
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,655
Are you kidding?

136
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,367
And anyway why do
you want to know?

137
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,497
‐ Because of something
she said to me.

138
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,332
‐ I’m sorry, but my
heart already belongs

139
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,378
to someone else.

140
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,752
He’s been my knight
in shining armor

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,709
ever since I was really small.

142
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,629
‐ She’s a nut ball.

143
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,176
‐ So you’re not interested.

144
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,299
Well, that works
out well for me.

145
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,176
‐ Huh?

146
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,346
Oh crap!

147
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,602
‐ Then she is mine
for the taking!

148
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,726
(laughs)

149
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,107
(mechanical whirring)

150
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,939
‐ What was that?

151
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,238
Since when was clubbing allowed?

152
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,741
‐ In real combat,
there are no rules.

153
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,862
‐ Oh is that so?

154
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,068
Well, let’s just
go another round,

155
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,528
no holds barred
then, you cheater!

156
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,238
‐ Yeah, all righty then.

157
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,115
(screams)

158
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,669
‐ Eat this.
(laughter)

159
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,751
You still have much to learn.

160
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,126
‐ [Yurika] We’re now
approaching the Bering Strait.

161
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,415
The blizzard has reduced
our visibility to zero.

162
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,877
‐ But still, this
means conditions for

163
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,967
the enemy are also horrible.

164
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,603
That is not necessarily
a bad thing.

165
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,721
‐ Optical scanning indicates
there are few reefs

166
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,346
that pose a danger to us.

167
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,023
We oughta be able to make it
through with a little luck.

168
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,101
‐ All right, let’s
go in low and slow.

169
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,816
‐ Oh, Miss Nanako,
you’re prettier than
a prairie dog’s ear.

170
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,574
‐ Oh, Cowboy Johnny!

171
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,574
‐ How dare he touch
Nanako that way.

172
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,067
‐ Geez, what a show off.

173
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,078
‐ You’re worried ’cause
Nanako likes him.

174
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,451
Shut up, Chupe!

175
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,789
What’s a brat like you know?
‐ Hello, Akito.

176
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,465
I have a surprise for you.

177
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,751
(door whirring)

178
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,594
Okay, here we are!

179
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,710
(groaning)

180
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,006
‐ Shouldn’t you be at your post?

181
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,920
‐ The weather
conditions are so bad

182
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,757
that the radio is
pretty much useless.

183
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,432
I don’t have much to do now.

184
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,471
‐ Oh, I see.

185
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,215
‐ And for that matter
I understand that

186
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,515
Izumi could handle any
piloting assignments

187
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,641
all by herself.

188
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,767
‐ Well, assuming the
Jovians don’t show up.

189
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,732
(mechanical whirring)

190
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,692
‐ Let’s see.

191
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,233
How century high school?

192
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,815
That sounds interesting.

193
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,152
Let’s leave the clothing at

194
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,745
the default settings
for now, okay?

195
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,740
‐ What?

196
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,776
‐ Welcome to the virtual
recreation center.

197
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,196
This room was created to relieve

198
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,286
the crew’s stress
while in space.

199
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,370
Each person’s brain waves
are automatically analyzed

200
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,668
in an appropriate scenario
for psychological‐

201
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,292
(computer buzzing)
‐ So are you ready to find out

202
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,457
what going to school
together might’ve been like?

203
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,836
Let’s go.

204
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:30,134
(machine beep)
(Akito screaming)

205
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,388
(children yelling)

206
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,552
‐ Whoa.

207
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,850
(giggling)

208
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,353
‐ Oh, Mr. Tenkawa.

209
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,642
So what do you think?

210
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,847
Do you like it?

211
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,766
(sputtering)

212
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,194
‐ Where’s the rest of it?

213
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,902
Yes, the skirts
were pretty short

214
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,404
back in those days.

215
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,025
Hey, you’ve never
been here before,

216
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,152
have you, Akito?

217
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,066
‐ Not really.

218
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,775
Well you see, in this scenario,

219
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,034
you’re my student advisor

220
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,197
for after‐school activities.

221
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,786
Oh, come on.

222
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,869
It’s time to relax.

223
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,874
How are we going to relieve
all that stress of yours

224
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,618
if you get all tensed up?

225
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,707
How am I not supposed to
be tense in this situation?

226
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,208
‐ Oh, Mr. Akito,

227
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,879
isn’t there something you
want to get off your chest?

228
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,337
‐ Off my chest?

229
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,564
I’m glad I tweaked the setting
to be a little more adult.

230
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,728
‐ Where has our
communications officer gone?

231
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,896
Are you sure you’re old
enough to know that, Ruri?

232
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,185
I think so.

233
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,738
‐ Are you certain?
‐ Are you certain?

234
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,371
I think she’s in the virtual
reality room with Akito.

235
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,779
‐ Are they on a date?

236
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,869
Yes, all alone together,
getting a head job,

237
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,833
so to speak (snickers).

238
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,374
That sounded dirty, didn’t it?

239
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,617
‐ Yeah.
(giggling)

240
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,630
‐ Captain!

241
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,881
Captain Misumaru!

242
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,040
‐ Huh?

243
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,298
‐ Why are you just
staring into space?

244
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,011
Don’t you have duties
to attend to right now?

245
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,260
‐ Yeah.

246
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,472
‐ If this is how
you normally act,

247
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,182
It’s no wonder you can’t
keep your boyfriend.

248
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,510
(gasping)

249
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,351
‐ You know, Erina’s pretty bossy

250
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,932
for someone who’s
just a houndswoman.

251
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,599
‐ Well, she used to be that
chairman of Nergal’s secretary.

252
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,938
And she’s also a bit of a‐
‐ You two.

253
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,611
Return to your places at once.

254
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,069
‐ Yes, ma’am.
‐ Yes, ma’am.

255
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,819
‐ And you two belong
at your stations.

256
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,363
‐ Right.
‐ Right.

257
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,784
Someone’s got to install some
order around here, captain.

258
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,783
(sighs)

259
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,026
Oh, Akito.

260
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,576
Do you really like
Megumi more than me?

261
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,450
(lock clicks)

262
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,116
‐ Huh?

263
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:20,953
Hey.

264
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,909
Hey, wait a minute.

265
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,456
Why did you just lock the door?

266
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,211
I thought you wanted to
talk to me about something.

267
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,711
‐ Yes, something very private.

268
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,964
‐ Something private?

269
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,207
‐ I know that you’re entering
the upcoming art competition.

270
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,797
‐ I am?

271
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,974
‐ And I was hoping that
you’d use me as your subject.

272
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,011
‐ Oh, okay.

273
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,006
Since this is all make believe,

274
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,547
I guess I can swallow that.

275
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,598
Well, I’m very
flattered by your offer.

276
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,143
‐ You know...

277
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,888
(clothes ruffling)

278
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,558
(bells chiming)

279
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,645
(gasping)

280
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,653
I wouldn’t do this
for anyone but you.

281
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,567
(gasps)

282
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,613
‐ No, you can’t do that, Megumi.

283
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,197
I mean, we’re still
high school students.

284
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,453
And we’re just not
old enough yet.

285
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,504
(wind harshly blowing)

286
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,789
‐ [Ruri] We’re all
clear, Captain.

287
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,912
No obstacles ahead.

288
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,368
Switching to Autopilot.

289
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,790
Um, Captain?

290
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,627
‐ Huh?
‐ Everyone’s gone to lunch.

291
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,252
Aren’t you feeling hungry, yet?

292
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,008
‐ Oh, I’m fine.

293
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,010
Why don’t you go ahead, Ruri.

294
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,011
‐ Sure.

295
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,018
‐ Akito, do you love her too?

296
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,353
‐ Stop it.

297
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,438
‐ Why are you so angry at me?

298
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,573
I know that you like me.

299
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,151
You took my first kiss.

300
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,614
‐ That’s just a
little different.

301
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,864
Will you please put
your clothes back on?

302
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,316
‐ Don’t you care about
me anymore, Akito?

303
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,157
‐ Huh?

304
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:41,952
Well...

305
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,295
I of course.

306
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,749
‐ Because the truth is
that I love you, Akito.

307
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,622
I do.

308
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,461
‐ Oh, Megumi...

309
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,042
‐ If the two of them...

310
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,047
If Akito and Megumi are...

311
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,009
If they...

312
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,719
(gasps)
I won’t believe it.

313
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,679
(machine beep)

314
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,299
(computer alarms)
(Captain gasps)

315
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,136
Oops.

316
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,971
(ship whirring)

317
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,059
‐ Please kiss me.

318
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:11,479
‐ Megumi, I...

319
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,823
‐ I just want something that
means there’s still hope.

320
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,863
‐ Yurika?
‐ Huh?

321
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,896
(Akito yells)

322
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,700
(alarms blaring)

323
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,656
‐ It’s a full squadron alert.

324
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,454
That means we must
be under attack!

325
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,499
(lasers blasting)

326
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
‐ Maintain our
shields and retreat.

327
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,088
‐ The distortion field
is holding steady.

328
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
‐ 10 more seconds ’till
we’re out of their range.

329
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,126
‐ [Ruri] Gravity
sensors indicate

330
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,007
numerous high
mobile enemy units.

331
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,092
‐ How far are we going
to pull back, Captain?

332
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,259
‐ Weigh our options.

333
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,637
(overlapping chatter)

334
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,445
(happy fanfare music)

335
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,057
(ships whirring)

336
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,478
(wind harshly blowing)

337
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,281
‐ [Rori] These are the
enemy numbers and positions

338
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,656
as indicated by our
magnetic resonance scan.

339
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,445
‐ Of course, they all know
where we are now, too.

340
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,787
Thanks to the captain

341
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,461
and that stupidity with
the gravity cannon.

342
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,290
‐ Well, there’s no sense
crying over spilled milk.

343
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,747
(scoffs)

344
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,095
‐ What was that?
‐ Why worry about something

345
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,049
you can’t change (chuckles)?

346
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,259
‐ Sysis my responsibility.

347
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,800
If someone is to be
help responsible,

348
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,143
it would be me for
leaving my post.

349
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,139
I apologize.

350
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,390
(guffaws)

351
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,261
‐ Could it be that
cool and logical Ruri

352
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,428
is actually covering
for the captain?

353
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,426
‐ Has she discovered
her human feelings?

354
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,808
‐ Idiots.

355
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,484
‐ Since we were detected
in the Western Passage,

356
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,234
we’ll have to try to sneak in

357
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,275
through the Eastern
Island Straits.

358
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,188
We’ll have to fly in
at a low altitude,

359
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,819
at a 72% chance of
running aground.

360
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,446
Unfortunately, I’m afraid
that that’s our best option.

361
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,332
‐ The Nadesico will
embark in 10 minutes

362
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,199
and will proceed through
the Eastern Passage.

363
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,328
Aestivalis units are to
stand by at alert status.

364
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,674
That’s all.

365
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,669
‐ I wonder what
happened to the Captain?

366
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,631
‐ Maybe she snuck off
some place to cry.

367
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,512
‐ I’ll be right back!

368
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,299
‐ Hey, wait up, Tenkawa!

369
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:01,592
Sheesh.

370
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,352
(solemn piano music)

371
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,512
‐ Yurika...

372
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,226
(groans)

373
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,141
(machine whirring)
(gasps)

374
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,098
‐ Akito!

375
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,058
‐ Yurika...

376
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,688
(buzzing)

377
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,122
This might sound kinda
strange coming from me,

378
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,378
but I get worried when
you’re not all spastic.

379
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,880
It’s just not like you to be
acting serious and responsible.

380
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,883
‐ Akito.

381
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,014
Help me.

382
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:43,881
‐ Huh?

383
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,889
‐ Help me, please.

384
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,392
I don’t know who else
to turn to anymore

385
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,272
except you, Akito.

386
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,931
I’m such a clutz

387
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,269
and I keep messing this
up for everyone else.

388
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,690
Or do you hate me now too?

389
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,856
(crying)
I’m sorry.

390
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,196
I shouldn’t.

391
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,820
‐ I just want something that
means there’s still hope.

392
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,212
(gasps)

393
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,290
‐ I’m...

394
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,248
I know a trick that’ll help.

395
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,246
Yurika...

396
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,303
‐ Hold it.

397
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,548
You’re not doing this

398
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,507
because you feel
sorry for me, are you?

399
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,767
‐ Excuse me?

400
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,019
‐ I know that when
we were on Mars,

401
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,190
I asked for a kiss to
help me keep going.

402
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,689
But you didn’t kiss me

403
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,860
because you knew I had to
find the strength myself.

404
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,939
‐ Huh?

405
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,523
‐ At the time, I
didn’t understand why.

406
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,608
But afterwards,
it all made sense.

407
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,204
You know me better
than I know myself.

408
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,069
And I know you’d never waste
something this precious.

409
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,204
‐ Um, waste what?

410
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,702
‐ Oh, Akito.

411
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,249
I know you know I’ve
never been kissed before.

412
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,331
(gasps)
(bell chimes)

413
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,669
‐ Wait a second.

414
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,293
What do you mean,
"Never been kissed?"

415
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,287
‐ Mm‐hmm.

416
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,590
I’m waiting for true love.

417
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,381
‐ You don’t remember?

418
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,805
(gasps)
(alarms blaring)

419
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,644
‐ It’s another enemy attack!

420
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,839
I guess that means

421
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,680
we’ll have to continue
some other time.

422
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,644
Won’t we, Akito?

423
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,352
‐ Yeah, sure, whatever.

424
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:19,314
(ships roaring)
(tense music)

425
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,345
(lasers blasting)

426
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,810
‐ Well, look who’s back.

427
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,820
‐ I’m sorry I’m late.

428
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,281
May I have the status
report, please?

429
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,569
‐ We are currently passing
through the Island Reefs.

430
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,113
‐ You know, it
would be very nice

431
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,817
if you could just hurry
up and get on with it

432
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,948
so our investigator
won’t starve to death.

433
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,414
‐ So that he won’t
starve to death?

434
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,704
‐ But wouldn’t he be more
likely to freeze to death

435
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,789
under these kind of
weather conditions?

436
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,252
‐ No, not with all that
insulating body fat.

437
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,253
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

438
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,592
‐ Look, just hurry
up and get him.

439
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,379
(screams)

440
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,964
(rapid explosions)

441
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,468
‐ Yurika, can you give
me the coordinates

442
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,969
where the investigator’s
supposed to be?

443
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:50,761
‐ Coordinates?

444
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,393
‐ [Akito] Yurika, come on.

445
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,892
Proceed to map coordinates A‐13.

446
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,274
Ryoko, you and the others
will form a defensive screen.

447
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,140
‐ Rodger.

448
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,146
(machines blasting)

449
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,032
‐ Hey, try not to steal
all the good scenes, okay?

450
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,278
‐ If you’re so hung
up on the captain,

451
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,150
you should welcome escort duty.

452
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,697
(chuckles)

453
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,450
(heroic music)
(lasers blasting)

454
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,294
(machines whirring)
(gun fire)

455
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,332
‐ Here we go.

456
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,004
Buttercup formation.

457
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,377
(waves crashing)

458
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,757
(yelling)

459
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,017
(machine beeping)

460
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,680
‐ All right.

461
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,637
Where is he?

462
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,806
(gasps)

463
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,234
(ship engines roaring)

464
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,820
Damn it.

465
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,070
I’m almost at the edge of
the Nadesico’s energy range.

466
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,322
Oh, crap.

467
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,074
The blizzard must be
blocking the transmission.

468
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,405
(engine roaring)

469
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,870
(gun fire)

470
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,540
Man, I can’t see a thing

471
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,873
with all this snow
blowing around.

472
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,378
Hey, wait a second.

473
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,709
Let’s try something that
doesn’t have to be aimed.

474
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,457
Eat this!

475
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,879
(gun fire)

476
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:20,807
Flare!

477
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,273
(loud explosion)

478
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,107
‐ Akito?

479
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,489
‐ Akito...

480
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,403
‐ He’ll be back.

481
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,738
I’m sure of it.

482
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,453
(loud machine whirring)

483
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,455
‐ Where’s Tinkawa?

484
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,704
‐ He’s taking his sweet time.

485
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:40,946
He’ll be back.

486
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,501
‐ I see.

487
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,631
‐ Ryoko.
‐ Don’t give up yet, Ryoko.

488
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,002
‐ I won’t.

489
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,378
I know he wouldn’t dare
break this girl’s heart.

490
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,799
‐ I’m afraid that it’s hopeless.

491
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,145
‐ Even at full power,

492
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,759
he should be able to fly
for another 15 seconds.

493
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,716
‐ Electromagnetic
static lifting,

494
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,426
radio transmission
is now possible.

495
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,190
(wind howling)

496
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,490
‐ No Aestivalis I
dentification signal detected.

497
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,149
‐ No incoming transmissions.

498
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:15,987
‐ Akito.

499
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,535
‐ Oh, our poor investigator.

500
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,293
Oh well.

501
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,456
‐ He’s gone.

502
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,039
And it’s all my fault.

503
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,166
I sent him out to a
cold, lonely death!

504
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,711
‐ [Akito] Um, not really.
(Yurika gasps)

505
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,668
‐ Akito!

506
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,718
‐ [Akito] Can you come get me?

507
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,510
‐ But just where are you?

508
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,474
‐ [Akito] Down here.

509
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,761
(gasps)

510
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,514
(heroic music)

511
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,272
(Yurika giggles)

512
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,020
‐ You really are okay!

513
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,523
‐ [Akito] Well, I’m
in one piece, anyway.

514
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,944
But admiral,

515
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,572
please don’t tell me this
is the special investigator

516
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,531
you were talking about.

517
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,361
(bear roars)

518
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,114
‐ Well, I suppose you’re
wondering about that.

519
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,027
You see, the military
spent a lot of money

520
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,446
equipping that bear with all
those sensitive instruments.

521
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,955
But we knew that no one
would risk their life

522
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,206
to rescue a bear so we
named him, "Ambassador."

523
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,961
It was just a little white
lie, Captain (laughs).

524
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,341
(elevator whirring)

525
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,592
‐ Oh, that God, Akito.

526
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,515
I’m so glad you’re all right.

527
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,551
I was so worried about
what might’ve happened.

528
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,137
‐ I’m sorry,

529
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,970
but I need to report back
to the Captain first.

530
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,684
(footsteps)

531
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,886
(scoffs)

532
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,572
‐ Pilot Tenkawa
reporting, Captain.

533
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,156
‐ Well done, pilot.

534
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,489
(giggles)

535
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,704
I mean thank you, Akito, dear.

536
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,794
(gasps)

537
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,081
‐ Has she really
forgotten our first kiss?

538
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,575
‐ Hmm?

539
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,377
‐ Oh, nothing (chuckles).

540
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,629
(laughter)

541
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,143
(bright music in
foreign language)

542
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,651
‐ [Narrator] They say that
man cannot live on bread alone

543
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,067
But Akito may have to

544
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,703
if he wants to keep
his stomach in tact.

545
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,322
In the old days, men were
men and women were women.

546
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,579
But all this equality
of the sexes stuff

547
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,910
has really screwed things up.

548
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,544
Fortunately, there’s
plenty of the old Tabasco.

549
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,624
As we venture onto the meat

550
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,616
for our first swimsuit episode.

551
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,338
But our young hero may not
live long enough to enjoy it

552
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,921
when yet another mysterious
lady enters his life.

553
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,545
What is it with this guy?

554
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,554
It’s the next episode of
Martian Successor Nadesico,

555
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,007
the Dangers of Femininity.
