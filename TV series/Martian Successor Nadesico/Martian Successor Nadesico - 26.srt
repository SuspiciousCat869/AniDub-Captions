1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,852
(gentle music)

2
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,944
‐ [Ruri] Everything
started on Mars,

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,479
and now it looks like everything
may end on Mars as well.

4
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,694
Whatever the case, it looks
like we’ll be fumbling about,

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,487
making a lot of noise
until the very end.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,650
However, when you
think about it,

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,698
I guess that’s rather
appropriate for us.

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,695
("You Get to Burning"
by Yumi Matsuzawa)

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,850
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,092
(ominous music)

11
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,143
‐ Hey, what in the
heck is going on here?

12
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,103
Why are these guys
all retreating?

13
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,562
‐ Well, there’s not much point

14
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,102
in fighting at the
moment, is there?

15
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,155
I doubt that you’ll
keep firing on the ruins

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,808
with both Akito and Ms.
Fressange down there.

17
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,768
So, I guess we’ll
just have to wait

18
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,988
and see how this works out.

19
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:32,819
‐ Akito.

20
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,664
‐ Just how deep is
this thing, anyway?

21
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,451
‐ Well, according to
our research, it’s
about 10 kilometers

22
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,745
deep, with distortion fields
in place every 800 meters.

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,500
But who does the doctor
plan on greeting?

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,335
‐ [Akito] I don’t know.

25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,210
(gasping)

26
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,166
‐ Could it be Ai?

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,125
‐ Huh?

28
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:51,753
‐ Of course!

29
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,798
‐ Of course!

30
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,421
‐ We of course.

31
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,048
‐ If it’s Ai, that explains why

32
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,136
the doctor was acting
a little strange.

33
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,430
‐ What I don’t understand is how

34
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,513
you can say it’s Ai so easily.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,020
‐ Could the Ais have it?

36
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,061
‐ Now, wait just a darn second!

37
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,055
Would someone care
to explain just who

38
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,017
this Ai is that you’re
all talking about?

39
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,937
‐ Did you say explanation?

40
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,694
Since the explanation lady
has shut off her transmission,

41
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,237
I’ll act as her substitute.

42
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,533
Ai is a young girl Mr. Tenkawa
met in the utopia colony

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,156
shortly before he Boson
Jumped from Mars to Earth,

44
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,584
and whose apparent
death caused Mr. Tenkawa

45
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,335
a great deal of
personal anguish.

46
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,545
However, it would appear
that Ai is not dead.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,288
‐ [Ai] Isn’t he here yet?

48
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,458
‐ [Inez] Hold on,
he’ll be here soon.

49
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,917
‐ [Ai] Okay.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,088
‐ Unfortunately, with all
those distortion fields

51
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,047
blocking his path I’m
afraid that it’s going to be

52
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,546
difficult for him to get here.

53
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,349
(Ai giggling)

54
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,471
Is something wrong?

55
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,927
‐ You smell nice, old lady.

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,728
(laughing)
‐ Do I seem that old to you?

57
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,392
‐ Just like mommy.

58
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,188
‐ Huh?

59
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,521
‐ You smell just like my mommy.

60
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,185
But mommy went to sleep
and wouldn’t wake up

61
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,365
and then there
was this big boom,

62
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,744
and it was dark.

63
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,612
Then Mr. Akito started
shining really bright,

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,990
and there was this crazy
sound and I started running.

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,865
Wait for me, wait for me!

66
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,082
Mr. Akito, wait for me!

67
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,914
‐ There’s a free falling object

68
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,749
approaching from above, captain.

69
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,585
(wind whistling)

70
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,588
(object crashing)

71
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,712
‐ What the heck was that?

72
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,416
‐ [Man] Analyzing.

73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,546
(computers beeping)

74
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,512
‐ Mam, object is
a Jovian Chulip.

75
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,723
(gasping)

76
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,592
(object crashing)
(woman screaming)

77
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,758
Damage to our starboard engine.

78
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,098
Field shrink down 20%.

79
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,232
We were hit with
a gravity blast!

80
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:27,929
‐ What?

81
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,978
(dramatic music)

82
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,904
‐ [Man] Completed
analyzing enemy strike.

83
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,691
Two phase transition
core powered battleships,

84
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,026
one of which is the Nadesico!

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,440
‐ It’s the Nadesico?

86
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,528
Did you hear that captain?

87
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,533
At last, we’re finally
going to get a rematch.

88
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,705
‐ So it seems.

89
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,123
Well, let’s see
what that dashing

90
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,491
man of action will do this time.

91
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,950
(dramatic music)

92
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,659
‐ [Man] The Kannazuki
is advancing, captain.

93
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,330
‐ [Tsukiomi] Hail the Kannazuki.

94
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,128
‐ [Man] Yes sir.

95
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,289
‐ Tell them to deploy all robots

96
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,668
for combat deployment
immediately.

97
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,956
(dramatic music)

98
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:57,797
‐ I’m scared!

99
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,433
‐ It’s going to be fine.

100
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,679
What’s going on?

101
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,432
‐ Ms. Fressange, a Jovian
Chulip just came out of nowhere,

102
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,643
and started launching
battleships and gyros at us.

103
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,393
‐ So, the close proximity
of the Jovian Boson Jump

104
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,436
must be what caused the ruins
to accelerate their activity.

105
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,481
‐ [Ai] Huh?

106
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,313
‐ It really is Ai!

107
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,567
‐ Ms. Fressange, are you there?

108
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,071
Ms. Fressange!

109
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,202
‐ Multiple mobile enemies
weapons approaching.

110
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,871
‐ We’ll have to handle the
ones who are closest first.

111
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,700
Ryoko?

112
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,835
‐ I got you, captain.

113
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,161
Just let me at ’em.

114
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,664
‐ Prepare the gravity
blast cannon, Jun.

115
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,905
‐ [Jun] Yes mam.

116
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,366
‐ I’m detecting
enemy Gekigan type

117
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,708
units approaching
via Boson Jump.

118
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,504
(dramatic music)

119
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,339
(Ai gasping)

120
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,845
‐ [Inez] Akito, please hurry.

121
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,297
(dramatic music)

122
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,637
‐ [Akatsuki] This
is the last barrier.

123
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,851
Keep pushing forward.

124
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,181
‐ Right, I’m coming
as fast as I can Ai!

125
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,017
Hold on!

126
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,561
‐ Hurry, hurry Mr. Akito, hurry!

127
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,607
Oh, I don’t wanna go lady!

128
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,820
I wanna stay!

129
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,689
I wanna see Akito!

130
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,068
‐ You will.

131
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,324
Maybe not now, but you
will someday, trust me.

132
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,656
You’re a strong girl,
Ai, I know you are.

133
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,201
That’s why you need to believe,

134
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,116
why you can never forget
his face, his voice.

135
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,544
No matter what happens you
can’t forget those things.

136
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,085
Please don’t forget,
promise me you won’t, Ai.

137
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,499
‐ Uh huh, I won’t, I promise!

138
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,877
I won’t ever, ever
forget Mr. Akito, lady.

139
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,635
(gasping)
Oh, I forgot!

140
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,087
When I got here, I was
supposed to give you this.

141
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,049
They asked me to
give this to you.

142
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,719
(electricity buzzing)
(metal clanking)

143
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,560
(ominous music)

144
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,395
‐ [Inez] The gift.

145
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,243
(men screaming)

146
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,571
‐ Ai!

147
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,742
Ms. Fressange, where’s Ai?

148
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,079
‐ You just missed her.

149
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,373
That’s why I told you to hurry.

150
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,616
But, maybe it was
meant to be like this.

151
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,250
‐ What’s that mean?

152
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,465
‐ The first letter
in Inez is I, Akito.

153
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,378
‐ Huh?

154
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,464
(Inez chuckling)

155
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,130
‐ She was thinking of
you when she jumped,

156
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,928
but because you were
Boson Jumping to the earth

157
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,930
she got lost.

158
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,471
‐ [Akito] What?

159
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,846
‐ She ended up on ancient
Mars and the people who built

160
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,431
this ruin sent her back, and
thanks to everything that

161
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,268
just happened, she just
jumped again, and ended up

162
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,733
in the middle of
the Martian desert

163
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,312
where she was found
wandering 20 years ago.

164
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,360
You know what
happened after that.

165
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,942
You saw it when all of our
memories were joined together,

166
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,568
when you saw my memories.

167
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,825
‐ Are you saying...

168
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,615
‐ [Inez] You saw it
too, right Akatsuki?

169
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,120
‐ That’s right.

170
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,793
‐ And of course all of the
other pilots, the captain,

171
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,372
and Ruri saw it as well.

172
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,745
‐ I see, and that incident
must have been when

173
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,962
you started to recover
your memory, am I correct?

174
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,554
‐ That’s right.

175
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,419
The little girl lost all of
her memory from the shock

176
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,046
of being left in the desert.

177
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,472
Fortunately, she was
found and rescued by some

178
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,553
Nergal researchers, and
eventually she was‐‐

179
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,677
‐ Wait, I know that!

180
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,315
I know all of this!

181
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,560
But I just never put all
the pieces together before.

182
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,352
I’m so sorry, Ai, I
should have saved you.

183
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,148
(Inez sniffling)
‐ It’s so wonderful

184
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,731
to see you again, mister.

185
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,316
(wind whistling)

186
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,864
‐ Okay, okay, I
understand, I got it!

187
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,869
It’s a time thing, some kind
of chronological paradox

188
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,492
or whatever you call it, right?

189
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,078
Now, if I could tear you
away from your soap opera,

190
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,172
the Kakitsubata really
needs some cover here!

191
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,169
‐ [Yurika] That’s true,
it’s as if the Kakitsubata

192
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,542
was being attacked
by rabid octopi.

193
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,840
(dramatic music)

194
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,265
(shots firing)

195
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,511
‐ It’s said that he who
hunts two hares loses both.

196
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,433
Therefore, we shall deal
with this other ship

197
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,852
before focusing our attention

198
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,680
on the more formidable Nadesico.

199
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,847
Saburota!

200
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,733
‐ I know what you mean, sir.

201
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,852
Gekigan punch!

202
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,560
‐ Erina, abandon ship!

203
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,270
‐ What, but‐‐

204
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,857
‐ Just do it, damn it!

205
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,694
(dramatic music)

206
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,198
(explosions detonating)

207
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,026
‐ [Saburota] Gekigan beam!

208
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,790
(explosion detonating)

209
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,911
‐ The Kakitsubata!

210
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,539
‐ It exploded!

211
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,875
‐ Erina Won, blown to bits
along with her ambitions.

212
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,212
‐ I was not blown up!

213
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,055
‐ Let’s pray.
(sobbing)

214
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,672
‐ Hey, I said I wasn’t dead!

215
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,337
‐ [Izumi] Yes, you are.

216
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,804
‐ [Erina] No, I’m not!

217
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,935
‐ [Akito] It’s all my fault.

218
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:13,893
‐ You’re wrong!

219
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,562
You mustn’t blame yourself!

220
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,098
‐ The Ai that I met two
years ago was a sweet

221
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,774
and innocent little girl.

222
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,853
But when I jumped she was
somehow sent back in time

223
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,017
and lost her memory.

224
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,645
She grew up to be a dried out,

225
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,942
walking encyclopedia
because of me.

226
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,108
‐ [Girl] But you didn’t know,

227
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,065
and you can’t
change anything now.

228
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,614
‐ [Woman] That’s right.

229
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,949
‐ [Woman] Come on, Mr. Akito,
have an nice a rice bowl.

230
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,074
(women chattering)

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,370
‐ [Akito] No, I’m not‐‐
(women chattering)

232
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,622
‐ [Girl] Eat it, eat it!

233
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,705
(Akito mumbling)
(women chattering)

234
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,158
(bell chiming)

235
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,328
‐ I’ve got to go
now, big brother.

236
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,337
There are too many things
that need doing right now

237
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,879
and I’ve got to help.

238
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,262
But I swear, I’ll make
your dream come true.

239
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,720
(wind whistling)

240
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,512
‐ [Tsukiomi] What’s the
status of the enemy ship?

241
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,845
‐ [Man] No movement detected.

242
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,390
They’ve gone completely silent

243
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,393
since they descended
into the ruin excavation.

244
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,855
‐ Hail the enemy vessel.

245
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,025
‐ [Man] Yes sir.

246
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,103
‐ Tell them to abandon the ruin

247
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,859
and surrender their
ship to us immediately.

248
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,899
‐ If you surrender within
30 minutes you have my word

249
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,493
as the commander of this battle
group that I will guarantee

250
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,991
the safety of your crew,
sincerely, The Jovians.

251
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,665
‐ [Group] Hmm.

252
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,743
‐ It certainly looks like
we’re completely cornered.

253
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,947
So, what now, Captain?

254
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,538
‐ Well, we can’t surrender,

255
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,421
and we can’t let other side
take those ruins either.

256
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,789
So, it’s time to
drop the big one.

257
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,586
(explosion detonating)

258
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,380
‐ [Joe] Ken, are you all right?

259
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,923
‐ [Ken] But we can’t fight
against this many of them!

260
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,337
‐ After fighting for
so long it appears that

261
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,348
this moon will be where you
meet your final reckoning!

262
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,311
Die Gekigangar!

263
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,270
(dramatic music)

264
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,806
(robot crashing)

265
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,688
(dramatic music)

266
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,856
(man screaming)

267
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,745
(man groaning)

268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,990
(man screaming)

269
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,995
‐ [Joe] Gekigan sword!

270
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,334
(explosion detonating)

271
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,879
(dramatic music)

272
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,881
‐ This is nothing
compared to the real hell.

273
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,923
Pulls yourselves together!

274
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,635
Ken, Akira.

275
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,845
‐ Joe?

276
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,934
‐ Joe Umitsubame, so
you’re still alive?

277
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,760
‐ Joe!

278
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,684
(chu‐ Let’s do it partners!

279
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,393
That’s right, if
all your passions‐‐

280
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,016
‐ So convenient, dying
and resurrecting.

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,523
‐ [Joe] Use this, Gekigangar V!

282
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,818
‐ [Group] Gegikan sword!

283
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,323
‐ Now, hyper passion slash!

284
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,406
‐ [Minato] I can’t
believe that you saw

285
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,030
so much in someone
that’s so shallow.

286
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,196
‐ Mmm‐hmm.

287
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,494
‐ Did you want
something, Yukina?

288
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,248
‐ I’d like you stop blubbering

289
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,211
and act like an adult
with responsibilities.

290
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,040
‐ I can act this
way if I want to.

291
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,075
‐ No, you can’t!

292
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,710
You said, you promised

293
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,956
you’d marry my brother
and be my family!

294
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,508
(bell chiming)

295
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,472
(upbeat music)

296
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,515
‐ Huh?

297
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,563
‐ [Ruri] To self destruct?

298
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,937
‐ We’ll overload the ship’s
phase transition engines

299
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,526
and turn it into a bomb.

300
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,989
That ought to
destroy those ruins!

301
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,569
‐ Now, wait just a second!

302
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,815
Are you asking us to
sacrifice ourselves?

303
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,156
‐ Of course not!

304
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,081
The only person who will still
be on the ship will be me.

305
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,080
‐ Wait a sec‐‐

306
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,251
(group screaming)

307
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,079
What’s wrong with you?

308
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,584
Are you trying to get killed?

309
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,377
‐ Don’t worry,
I’ll be just fine.

310
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,039
‐ You idiot!

311
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,247
Can’t you see how many things
can go wrong with your plan?

312
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,458
You’ll die, nut bar!

313
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,089
‐ Don’t be stupid, I won’t die!

314
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,085
‐ Will!

315
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:40,886
‐ Will not!

316
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,259
‐ Will too!

317
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,105
‐ Will not, will not,
will not, will not!

318
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,770
‐ Yes, you will, you ditz!

319
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,937
What’s that look mean?

320
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,152
(sighing)

321
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,652
‐ [Men] You made her cry!

322
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,523
‐ Yeah, well, better
crying than dying!

323
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,938
‐ All I wanna do is destroy
those ruins, and end the war.

324
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,618
‐ But would self destructing
the ship even work, captain?

325
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,779
‐ Huh?

326
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,618
‐ If you’ll just turn
the ship over to Nergal,

327
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,452
we’ll take care of everything.

328
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,747
‐ Yes, you can trust us.

329
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,250
‐ Nevermind that their own high

330
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,041
mobile battleship
was just blown up.

331
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,385
(group gasping)

332
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,459
Oh, don’t pay any
attention to what

333
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,384
the precocious child is saying.

334
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,302
‐ In any case, you
can’t blow the ship up!

335
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,303
‐ [Yurika] And why not?

336
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,632
‐ Because I said so!

337
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,718
‐ But it would be worth it!

338
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,221
Think of the people
we would save.

339
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,224
Isn’t it worth
risking my life to end

340
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,426
this stupid war
once and for all?

341
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,305
‐ But if you do it,
you’ll be killed.

342
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,773
‐ Well, that might
not be exactly right.

343
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,814
‐ Huh?

344
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,398
‐ According to Ms.
Fressange’s explanation,

345
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,531
these ruins are like
a huge time machine.

346
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,990
So if we blow the ruins
up, then it’s possible

347
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,111
that all the Boson Jumping
that ever took place

348
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,736
in the past, present, and
future will all be voided.

349
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,084
‐ Huh, I wonder just how
much would be changed.

350
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,081
‐ Huh?

351
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,412
(strumming guitar)

352
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,326
‐ Huh?

353
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,174
Well, that can’t be me.

354
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,582
‐ [Girl] Then who is it?

355
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,498
(strumming guitar)

356
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,838
‐ [Group] Huh?

357
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,047
‐ It’s impossible!

358
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,145
(strumming guitar)

359
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,179
♪ Being my own self ♪

360
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,183
♪ That’s just what I be ♪

361
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,387
♪ Looking for a future ♪

362
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,686
♪ That’s only for me ♪

363
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,269
‐ [Admiral] You really
shouldn’t be thinking

364
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,944
about self destruction, V.

365
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,023
(explosion detonating)

366
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,278
‐ [Group] Admiral!

367
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,860
‐ But we thought
you died months ago!

368
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,704
‐ [Admiral] Are you disappointed
that I’m still alive?

369
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,035
‐ I found him inside the ruins.

370
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,616
He was saved by the
grasshopper units

371
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,371
and was being held
as a prisoner of war.

372
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,333
‐ [Group] Oh!

373
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,542
‐ V!

374
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,252
‐ But I don’t
understand, admiral.

375
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,424
Why can’t we self destruct?

376
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,671
‐ [Admiral] Because
self destruction

377
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,341
is really, really stupid!

378
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,419
‐ But sir, you were willing to

379
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,546
sacrifice yourself
once, weren’t you?

380
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:43,666
Huh?

381
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,221
Ruri?

382
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,216
‐ We can’t self
destruct, captain.

383
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,427
‐ [Yurika] But why?

384
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,096
‐ If we were to destroy
the ruin then all

385
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,695
of our recent history would
be rewritten as a result.

386
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,599
That means that the war
would never have happened

387
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,689
but we’d also lose
something important.

388
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,651
(dramatic music)

389
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,605
Two minutes until retrieval
of ruin unit will be complete.

390
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,618
‐ Will it still work after
we have it on the Nadesico?

391
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,371
‐ Theoretically,
time and space have

392
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,991
no meaning to the
jump controller.

393
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,198
‐ Hmm, could you
say that in English?

394
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,828
(giggling)
‐ It means

395
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,165
we’re never farther away
than we are in our hearts.

396
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,251
(gasping)

397
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,125
‐ [Girls] Minato!

398
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,553
(giggling)
‐ I’m sorry that

399
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,669
I had you so worried.

400
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,705
‐ Are you okay now?

401
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,178
(giggling)
‐ Thanks to Yukina.

402
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,929
‐ [Girls] Huh?

403
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,012
‐ She said that if
Tsukumo couldn’t marry
me that she would.

404
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,386
‐ What?

405
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,722
‐ I think it’s the
thought that counts,

406
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,887
so I guess I’ve got to hold
it together for her sake.

407
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,186
‐ Or vice versa.

408
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,019
‐ I think we’ll be ready
to start in a minute, Ruri.

409
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,115
‐ Of course.

410
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,569
If we destroyed the
ruins we would have lost

411
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,690
the thing that’s
most precious to me.

412
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,817
The year of my life I’ve spent
here onboard the Nadesico.

413
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,197
In the end, that’s all
we really have, memories,

414
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,874
memories of the people
who have become my friends

415
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,163
and family, memories that we
earned by living through them,

416
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,420
memories I wouldn’t
sacrifice for any price.

417
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,631
Tell me captain,
aren’t those memories

418
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,753
just as important to you?

419
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,298
‐ Why did you give
them 30 minutes?

420
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,172
You’re too soft, Tsukiomi.

421
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,800
‐ [Tforce may be weak,

422
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,796
but they have taken possession
of the city’s interior.

423
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,298
‐ You must attack immediately!

424
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,890
(dramatic music)

425
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,313
‐ You know, I’m really not very
comfortable in this outfit.

426
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,894
(laughing)

427
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,647
‐ But you’ve never looked
more dashing, captain!

428
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,149
‐ You be quiet!

429
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,652
‐ [Yurika] Five enemy Gekigan
type units approaching.

430
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,153
‐ Oh, we’ll take
care of ’em somehow.

431
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,324
You just take care of
things on your end.

432
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,453
‐ Don’t worry.

433
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
Are you two ready
to get started now?

434
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,244
‐ [Akito] Are you
sure we’ll be able

435
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,164
to make the Nadesico Boson Jump?

436
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,542
‐ Theoretically, yes.

437
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,000
‐ As expected the ruin
is made entirely from

438
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,329
the same material as
the Chulip crystals.

439
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,615
‐ And are you ready, Ruri?

440
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,828
‐ [Ruri] Yes.

441
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,208
‐ Okay, Erina,
start the sequence.

442
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,336
‐ Choosing our memories
over world peace.

443
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,974
I guess this just
proves everyone has
their own priorities,

444
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,721
and what we have now is the
most precious thing of all.

445
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,755
(dramatic music)

446
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,098
(electricity zapping)

447
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,357
‐ The Boson Jump field
was unable to stabilize.

448
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,361
‐ Hmm.

449
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,406
Okay, you two have
to kiss each other.

450
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,871
‐ What?
‐ What?

451
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,329
‐ Since there isn’t a Chulip
with an open field nearby,

452
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,829
it’s obvious that we’re going
to have to create a field

453
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,412
large enough to accommodate a
ship the size of the Nadesico.

454
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,710
In order to do that, we’ll
need to have a membrane

455
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,713
to membrane contact
among ourselves,

456
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,214
and the simplest way
of doing that is to‐‐

457
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,625
‐ Is, is kissing?

458
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,213
‐ [Inez] Right.

459
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
‐ We’ll all be in big trouble
unless the two of you hurry.

460
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,335
‐ No!

461
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,466
‐ But, Yurika‐‐

462
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,103
‐ I won’t do it, I
won’t, I won’t, I won’t!

463
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,312
‐ This is no time to
act petulant, captain.

464
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,391
‐ Yeah, let’s just grit
our teeth and endure it.

465
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,936
‐ Endure it?

466
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,811
If that’s all you feel you
could just kiss Ms. Fressange!

467
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,727
‐ [Man] Gekigan beam!

468
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,535
‐ You gotta be a lot faster
than that, snail boy.

469
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,702
(man groaning)

470
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,241
‐ Wait a second, so only
those individuals who

471
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,698
are born on Mars are
capable of Boson Jumping?

472
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,577
Tenkawa, the doctor,
and the captain,

473
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,327
which means that the
ruins must have caused

474
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,837
the nano machines to
rewrite their DNA structure.

475
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,419
That’s why they can withstand
the jumping process.

476
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,587
‐ That’s the size of it.

477
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,265
(sighing)

478
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,433
And now one of those martians
is jumping all over the ship

479
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,802
while the other chases her.

480
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,718
‐ It figures.

481
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,064
(laughing)

482
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,599
‐ [Erina] They’re
crazy, but amusing.

483
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,982
(dramatic music)

484
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,061
‐ I’ve made up my
mind, big brother.

485
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,815
I’m going to Earth with Minato.

486
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,358
That way you can watch
both of us at once.

487
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,442
‐ Hey, stop that!

488
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,608
Get out of there captain!

489
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,356
Are you listening to me?

490
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,606
‐ [Akito] Yurika!

491
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,407
‐ Oh, it’s about
time you got here!

492
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,659
Why in the hell is the captain

493
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,492
trying to take your Aestivalis?

494
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,618
‐ Please, Yurika!

495
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,622
Get down from there!

496
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,045
You can’t pilot that!

497
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,161
‐ [Man] Yeah, you
don’t have the implant!

498
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,077
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

499
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,087
‐ How the heck did the
captain get an IFS implant?

500
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:51,842
‐ Beats me.

501
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,474
‐ You can still jump, Akito.

502
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,721
‐ Huh?

503
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,510
‐ [Inez] Visualize the
inside of Aestivalis.

504
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:56,926
‐ Visualize.

505
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:00,812
‐ [Group] Whoa!

506
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,641
‐ Oh!
(screaming)

507
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,477
‐ [Akito] Stop it, Yurika!

508
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,483
‐ [Yurika] Go away!

509
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,314
‐ [Akito] Go away where?

510
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,606
‐ [Yurika] (Mumbles).

511
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,399
‐ [Akito] Ow, you
hit me, my eye!

512
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,482
(both chattering)

513
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,647
‐ [Yurika] Get out of my way!

514
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,155
‐ And what was that?

515
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,738
‐ It sounds like a couple
arguing on an open comm channel.

516
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,612
‐ Huh?

517
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,488
‐ [Akito] Let go!

518
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,076
‐ [Yurika] You let go!

519
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,329
‐ [Akito] Come on, please?
‐ [Yurika] I don’t want to!

520
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,490
‐ Jeez will you please
start using your brain

521
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,000
and stop being so stubborn?

522
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,830
‐ Me?

523
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,124
And when will you realize I was

524
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,997
just trying to help you and Ai?

525
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,924
‐ What are you talking
about, you nut bar?

526
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,882
‐ I know how guilty you
feel about what happened

527
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,634
to Ms. Fressange,
which is the reason

528
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,224
why I tried to turn back time.

529
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:36,882
‐ [Akito] Idiot!

530
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,719
(Yurika crying)

531
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,974
‐ Incidentally, I’ve
been relaying the feed

532
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,565
from the Aestivalis to
every ship in the area.

533
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,183
‐ So this is the
lovers spat that

534
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,807
will decide the fate
of the universe.

535
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,354
‐ Uh huh.

536
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,269
‐ [Yurika] I’m not stupid,
quit calling me that!

537
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,027
‐ Yurika, I watched
the last episode

538
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,111
of Gekigangar Three last night.

539
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,525
‐ Huh?

540
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,323
‐ Yeah, and it was the
worst episode of the series.

541
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,698
(gentle music)

542
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,374
But as awful as it was,

543
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,874
I felt shivers going down
my spine as I watched it.

544
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,327
Seeing Gekigangar Three
and Gekigangar Five

545
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,587
fighting side by
side with each other.

546
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,461
‐ [Yurika] Side by side.

547
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,956
Sounds kind of nice.

548
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,257
‐ [Akito] I guess there’s
a part of me that wants

549
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,722
to believe in perfect
good, happy endings,

550
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,343
and hot blooded passion.

551
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,218
The part of me that
loves Gekigangar‐‐

552
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,675
‐ Is the part of you that’s
in love with me, isn’t it?

553
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
‐ Look, I was just
about to make a major

554
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,939
and very profound
speech here, damn it!

555
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,401
But since you mentioned
it, yes I do, you wacko.

556
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,192
You’re supposed to say
something back, you know.

557
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:34,865
‐ Excuse me?

558
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,192
You know how I feel.

559
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,487
I love you with all my
heart and soul Akito!

560
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,492
‐ That’s the first time
I’ve heard you say it.

561
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,534
‐ It is not!

562
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,576
‐ I’m sure it is.

563
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,579
‐ It is not.

564
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,580
‐ Yes it is.

565
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,583
‐ It is not!

566
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,504
‐ Is too!

567
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,330
‐ No, it’s not!

568
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,214
‐ Yes it is!

569
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,920
(romantic music)

570
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,956
‐ [Yurika] I love you Akito.

571
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,216
‐ [Ruri] So all of that
being said and done,

572
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,090
I still have to wonder if
kissing was really essential

573
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,138
for the two of them to
start the Boson Jump.

574
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,933
All Ms. Fressange would
say is that when I was

575
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,516
a little older I
would know the truth.

576
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,901
In the end, a lot of big
mysteries remained unexplained,

577
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,610
like the meaning of
the plate that Ai gave

578
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,900
to her older self, and who
the ancient martians were,

579
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,985
and what happened to
their civilization.

580
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,912
Still, since we had the
calculation unit from

581
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,580
the ruin onboard the
Nadesico, we were able

582
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,079
to Boson Jump far away.

583
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,461
The war between Jupiter and
the Earth will probably go on,

584
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,959
but they won’t be able to
do much more than growl

585
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,542
at each other for a while.

586
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,087
I guess we’ll have to wait
for another opportunity

587
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,011
to find out what happens next,
in the inevitable sequel.

588
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,259
(gentle music)
