1
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,441
‐ [Ruri] Sun swept beaches,

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,729
hot sun, and nasty
ramen noodles.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,154
We tried to have fun,
but in the end we found

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,072
ourselves in the middle of
another military idiocy.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,033
Is it any wonder this crew
is getting all stressed out?

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,862
I’m beginning to wonder
if a lot of them aren’t

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,119
so much resilient as
just incredibly dense.

8
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,161
(jazzy action music)

9
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,853
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,838
‐ [Sadaaki] This is the
Kursk industrial region

11
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,762
located inside what used
to be known as Russia.

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
Long before any of us
were born, Kursk was

13
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,054
a prosperous military
industrial complex

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,216
specializing in development
of land based weapons system.

15
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,386
Now however, Kursk
has been occupied by

16
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,985
the Jovian Lizards, and
to make matters worse

17
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,651
they have apparently
chosen this region

18
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,609
to test the deployment
of a new type

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,149
of weapons platform,
something that

20
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,902
we’ve never encountered
anywhere else.

21
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,864
Headquarters has codenamed
it The Walking Stick.

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,107
‐ [Yurika] I assume
that our new mission

23
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,907
is to destroy this
Walking Stick.

24
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,950
‐ That’s right, but it
won’t be an easy assignment.

25
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,205
Three special demolition
teams have been sent in

26
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,499
so far, but not a single
person has yet returned.

27
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,462
‐ What a waste of our resources.

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,632
‐ But none of those
teams had the Nadesico.

29
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,671
Our gravity blast
cannon should do it.

30
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,635
‐ Of course.

31
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,554
A long range strike is perfect.

32
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,595
‐ We’ll blow them away!

33
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,176
‐ It is the safest way.

34
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,010
‐ And it’s also very efficient
economically speaking.

35
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,018
‐ Even better, the
Aestevalis won’t be

36
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,679
vulnerable to an
attack this way.

37
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,937
‐ Oh don’t beat around
the bush, Megumi.

38
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,349
You’re worried about
a pilot, not a robot.

39
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,808
‐ Well I suppose I might.

40
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,898
‐ And I’ll bet that
pleases someone else.

41
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,275
‐ We’ll start preparing
for this immediately!

42
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,951
‐ [Ken] What’s
wrong with you Joe?

43
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,699
It’s all your fault that that
mechanical monster got away!

44
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,951
‐ I’m tired of
listening to you whine

45
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,204
and gripe all the
time, you jerk.

46
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,496
‐ Now I’m mad!

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,880
‐ Ken, Joe, stop fighting,
you got to act like a team!

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,880
‐ To act like a team.

49
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,002
‐ [Ruri] Eight
minutes and 30 seconds

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,588
until operation commencement.

51
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,765
‐ [Minato] Energy bypass feed

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,382
connecting to
gravity blast cannon.

53
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,927
‐ All right, as soon as
the cannon is fully charged

54
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,933
we’ll swoop over that
mountain and let them have it.

55
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,555
We’ll completely blow them away!

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,020
‐ 17,000 until we clear
the crest of the mountain.

57
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,482
‐ That hurt!

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,733
You hit real hard, Joe.

59
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,824
‐ Yeah, that will
leave a mark, Ken.

60
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,359
(laughter)

61
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,534
‐ You made up!

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,741
‐ Still, things rarely end
like this in real life.

63
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,816
‐ [Minato] Phase
transition engine.

64
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,698
All systems condition green.

65
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,075
Distortion field
strength down 13%.

66
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,254
Final safety mechanism unlocked.

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,921
‐ 1,500 until we
clear mountain crest.

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,131
(energy humming)

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,384
800 until we clear
mountain crest.

70
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,393
It’s shooting at us.

71
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,180
‐ Huh?

72
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,102
(suspenseful orchestra music)

73
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,641
What in the hell was that?

74
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,266
‐ We’ve lost our
distortion field, Captain!

75
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,776
‐ Severe damage
inflicted over 18 blocks.

76
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,279
‐ Phase transition
engine shutting down!

77
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,651
‐ It would appear
that The Walking

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,570
Stick is a gravity wave railgun.

79
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,195
‐ Huh?

80
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,872
We’re losing control,
we’re going to crash!

81
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,791
‐ [Ruri] Auxiliary
engine output to maximum.

82
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,912
‐ [Yurika] Hold on Miss
Fressange, I’ve got

83
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,956
more pressing concerns
at the moment!

84
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,297
‐ On the positive
side the mountaintop

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,841
took most of the
damage and it will be

86
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,304
a while before The
Walking Stick can

87
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,344
generate another
micro black hole.

88
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,428
They won’t be able to
shoot us again immediately.

89
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,562
‐ Well that’s very
reassuring to know.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,430
But what are we gonna do now?

91
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,767
‐ [Jun] I suppose we’ll have
to send in the Aestevalis.

92
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,982
‐ The Walking Stick’s gravity
railgun is unstoppable.

93
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,323
As soon as it’s
recharged they’ll

94
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,768
shoot us right
through the mountains.

95
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,608
That’s how all the other
previous teams were destroyed.

96
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,704
‐ Okay, so why didn’t you
tell us this before now?

97
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,203
‐ Oh, didn’t I mention it?

98
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,244
‐ Unfortunately our
Aestevalis units won’t

99
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,486
stand a chance against
that thing’s defenses.

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,000
‐ The economic losses we’ve
sustained give me a headache.

101
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,961
‐ Our pilots would get
worse than a headache.

102
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,292
‐ That’s the truth.

103
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,167
‐ Okay, scratch the
airborne attack.

104
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,805
‐ I’ve calculated
that it will take

105
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,921
12 hours to create
another black hole.

106
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,008
We were hit at 1700
hours so they’ll‐‐

107
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,974
‐ Yes, thank you Miss
Fressange, can’t you

108
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,514
ever tell us anything
nice for a change?

109
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,019
‐ Isn’t there any way
to stop that thing?

110
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,600
‐ Yes, a ground assault.

111
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,855
The Walking Stick’s defenses are

112
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,306
strong, but designed
for air defense.

113
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,897
We’ll send the Aestevalis in on

114
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,033
foot and destroy it with mines.

115
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,689
You’ve got one hour.

116
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,277
Mr. Akatsuki.

117
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,362
‐ Yes sir?

118
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,608
‐ [Goat] You’ll
be ground leader.

119
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,028
‐ I’ll do my best.

120
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,987
‐ You’ll be operating
at a considerable

121
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,736
distance from the
Nadesico, so you won’t

122
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,200
be able to recharge, that’s why

123
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,909
we’ve designed this
external battery.

124
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,709
It clips on the back
of your Aestevalis

125
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,251
just like a camcorder battery.

126
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,536
That’s pretty cool huh?

127
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,883
‐ Tell me sir, do you really

128
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,546
think that we can pull this off?

129
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,054
‐ Well if we all work together
I’m sure that we can succeed.

130
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,846
‐ And if not, I guess
we’ll suck another C.

131
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,930
‐ Erm, right.

132
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,056
And I was the top student in my

133
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,942
advanced tactics and
planning class you know.

134
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,151
‐ It takes more than that.

135
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,519
‐ You’re right, Akito.

136
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,186
The commander doesn’t
fight a war alone.

137
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,734
That’s only the start.

138
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,779
There are a lot
of things equally

139
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,072
important like
rigorous training.

140
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,244
‐ No, that’s not what I meant.

141
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,278
‐ Here, one icy cold Mars Cola.

142
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,504
‐ A team needs teamwork.

143
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,842
(laughter)

144
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,669
Hey why are you guys laughing?

145
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,264
I don’t remember saying
anything remotely funny.

146
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,932
‐ Let me catch my
breath for a second.

147
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,681
It’s just that we
were discussing how
to divide the work.

148
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,262
‐ It was great!

149
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,557
It was almost as
if you volunteered!

150
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,931
‐ Volunteered for what?

151
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,307
‐ "A team needs
teamwork," brilliant.

152
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,476
‐ Dope.

153
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,274
‐ Akito’s Aestevalis
will be the pack mule!

154
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,516
Pile the supplies on it ladies!

155
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,028
‐ [Crewmen] Yes sir!

156
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,899
‐ Well I can see
that nobody here

157
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,946
understands the
concept of teamwork.

158
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,700
‐ 15 minutes until
mission deployment.

159
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,322
All pilots and mechanics please

160
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,490
conduct your final
mission checklists.

161
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,489
‐ Yeah all right.

162
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,450
‐ Um, Akito?

163
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,577
‐ Huh?

164
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,004
‐ Oh don’t worry,
I’m using a private

165
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,793
communication channel
so no one can hear us.

166
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,537
We really need to talk.

167
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,920
I know that you’re
going up against that

168
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,384
awful Walking Stick
all by yourself‐‐‐

169
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,014
‐ [Crewman] Hey Akito, is your
camera monitor functioning?

170
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,183
‐ Yeah, it’s fine,
everything checks out.

171
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,841
‐ Please come back
to me safely‐‐

172
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,760
‐ [Crewman] Okay, Akito’s
Aestevalis cleared for takeoff!

173
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,386
‐ Okay.

174
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,353
‐ I know that this may be a
little forward sounding of me.

175
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,735
But I’ve been thinking
about this an awful lot

176
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,272
and I think I’m ready to advance

177
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,735
our relationship
to the next step.

178
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,195
(signal beeping)

179
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,566
‐ Hold on a second Megumi,
I’ve got a priority message.

180
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,492
‐ Akito.

181
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,609
‐ Yurika!

182
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,606
‐ Oh don’t worry Akito,
I’m using a private

183
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,738
communication channel
so no one can hear us.

184
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,785
Can we talk now?

185
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,158
‐ Oh...

186
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:15,795
‐ I know that the
opponent you’re going up‐‐

187
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,750
‐ Akito!

188
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,120
Akito, hey!

189
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,826
Hello there!

190
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,826
Gosh darn it.

191
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,207
‐ I me to say how I feel.

192
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,214
‐ Uh, sure.

193
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,417
‐ I hope that I’m
not sounding too

194
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,165
forward in saying this, Akito.

195
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,429
But once you get
back, I’m expecting

196
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,890
that our relationship will‐‐

197
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,852
‐ Will advance a
lot farther right?

198
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,312
(gasp)

199
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,270
‐ Oh Akito, I’m so happy
to finally hear you say it!

200
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,022
‐ Hey, wait, I, that’s
not that I meant!

201
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:42,307
‐ Huh?

202
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,113
‐ This is crazy.

203
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,362
I’m trapped.

204
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,527
‐ Tenkawa!

205
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,985
‐ I’m so sorry God,
I don’t know why

206
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,283
you do this to me, but I swear

207
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,946
I’ll be a good person
from now on, really!

208
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,415
‐ What are you babbling about?

209
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,536
‐ Huh?

210
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,792
‐ Miss Howmei’s been
banging on your cockpit.

211
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,043
Didn’t you notice her?

212
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,326
‐ Huh?

213
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:02,917
‐ It’s about time
you noticed me.

214
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,213
‐ What a dork.

215
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,955
‐ Normal rations
are way too bland,

216
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,586
so I loaded you up
with lots of food!

217
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,435
‐ [Akito] But that’s way
more than we’d ever need.

218
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,181
‐ A good chef
needs to be able to

219
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,891
cook anything his
customers might want.

220
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:16,934
‐ Akito!

221
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,267
Teammate!

222
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,811
‐ My God, is there a
single female on this

223
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,943
entire stupid ship who doesn’t

224
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,521
have some kind of thing for you?

225
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,774
(groans)

226
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,857
‐ Quit playing the martyr!

227
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,400
What is it with you?

228
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,574
It’s just not fair!

229
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,534
‐ [Crewmen] If you don’t
want them, give them to us!

230
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,914
We’re available!

231
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,910
‐ I’ve said it before,
all of them are idiots.

232
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,413
‐ Salute!

233
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,255
‐ Oh my.

234
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,084
‐ Is this a costume show?

235
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,795
‐ Mr. Uribatake said
if we wore these...

236
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,298
‐ It would help us think in
terms of mine‐based operations.

237
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,761
‐ Yes, and also the captain
thought they looked cute.

238
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,632
‐ Salute!

239
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,640
‐ Cool huh?

240
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,682
‐ Oh.

241
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,723
‐ I think I’ll
withhold my comments.

242
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,227
Miss Fressange has
downloaded all of the

243
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,189
necessary plotting from
our observation satellite.

244
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,730
At this point it’s up
to the Aestevalis team.

245
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,029
‐ [Ruri] Aestevalis
units are now passing

246
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,939
the edge of our
energy feed system.

247
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,697
‐ Salute!

248
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,109
‐ Yes, they’re all
idiots all right.

249
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,568
‐ Excuse me.

250
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,578
Why aren’t you wearing
one of these uniforms?

251
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,120
‐ I’m too old to play dress up.

252
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,543
(rhythmic drumming)

253
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,542
(singing in foreign language)

254
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,936
‐ [Crew] Hey when’s
dinner ready?

255
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,276
‐ It’ll be a few more minutes.

256
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,530
The wok’s not hot enough for the

257
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,913
crepes suzette to
properly brown yet.

258
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,951
‐ Idiots.

259
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,537
‐ All right kids,
45 minute break.

260
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,086
Let’s get some rest
while Akito cooks.

261
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,171
Whoa, Izumi’s way ahead of me.

262
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,634
(snoring)

263
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,054
‐ Oh oh, can I take a
nap too, Mr. Akatsuki?

264
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,883
‐ Sure, go ahead.

265
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,178
‐ Okay!

266
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,811
(chuckles)

267
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,059
‐ Someone’s feeling
their hormones call.

268
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,561
(chuckles)

269
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,114
♪ Our dreams call
out for tomorrow ♪

270
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,071
♪ As we seek God in the sorrow ♪

271
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,190
(throat clears)

272
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,566
‐ Oh Ryoko, hey.

273
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,157
‐ I swear Tenkawa
you’re such a dork.

274
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,032
‐ What did I do this time?

275
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,448
‐ Don’t talk, eat.

276
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,163
‐ But why?

277
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,328
‐ ’Cause you were so busy
cooking for us you didn’t eat.

278
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,126
So eat!

279
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,591
‐ Oh, yeah.

280
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,749
‐ Geez, I don’t know what it is

281
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,006
about you that
drives me so nutty.

282
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,419
‐ Huh?

283
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,918
‐ I didn’t mean nutty that way,

284
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,258
so don’t read
anything into it okay?

285
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,086
‐ Oh.

286
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,470
‐ Will you just eat?

287
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,100
‐ Sure.

288
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,312
Oh hey, this tastes pretty good.

289
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,813
‐ Of course it
does, you cooked it.

290
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,096
‐ Oh, right.

291
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:51,939
(laughs)

292
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:52,943
‐ Dork.

293
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,444
‐ Hey pick it up, you two.

294
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,145
This is a daring
military adventure

295
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,486
we’re trying to tell here, not a

296
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,780
coming of age movie
for teenagers.

297
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,992
Might watch out for
him anyway, Ryoko.

298
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,625
He is an anime fan.

299
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,951
‐ And what does that mean?

300
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,326
‐ Oh come on, everyone
knows that in anime

301
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,043
the guys who act
uninterested are really

302
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,292
just trying to hide
their own inadequacies.

303
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,286
Don’t you think Mr.
Platonic Relationship

304
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,798
here is just a little
too good to be true?

305
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,128
Are you really buying his act?

306
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,336
‐ What?

307
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,375
‐ Oh I’m not saying
that you’re not

308
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,376
really good at
leading the ladies on.

309
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,048
After all you certainly got the

310
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,057
captain and Megumi snowed under.

311
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,889
You play the pitiful act well.

312
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,274
‐ And you’re a jerk!

313
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,940
Why do you keep
knocking my hobby?

314
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,229
‐ Because I live
in the real world

315
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,903
while you use anime
as a substitute.

316
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,982
‐ I just don’t
understand you at all.

317
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,647
‐ That’s my line exactly.

318
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,822
(explosions)

319
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,907
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

320
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,660
‐ What was that?

321
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,332
‐ I think we’re under attack.

322
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,040
(dramatic orchestra music)

323
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,836
‐ [Yurika] You’re under attack?

324
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,209
‐ I’m sending you a visual of

325
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,878
exactly what we’re up against.

326
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,129
‐ I had a little
drink and got tanked.

327
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,798
‐ Using tanks?
‐ Using tanks?

328
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,057
‐ Those tanks must’ve
come from a museum.

329
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,981
No one’s used those things
for over two generations.

330
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,809
‐ Right!

331
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,813
Of course the proper term for‐‐

332
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,144
‐ I see.

333
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,518
Using tanks to protect the
land approach is clever.

334
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,516
‐ And it’s brilliant
economically.

335
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,239
By improvising with
available resources,

336
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,362
they conserve
their own weaponry.

337
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,567
‐ [Ryoko] Tenkaea,
Akatsuki, go on ahead!

338
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,659
‐ [Nagare] Right,
come on fanboy.

339
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,452
‐ [Akito] No, I’ll
stay and fight!

340
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,365
‐ [Ryoko] Huh?

341
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,755
‐ [Goat] They may be outdated,

342
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,331
but they’re still a
threat in numbers.

343
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,955
‐ We have a problem, Captain.

344
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,292
‐ What?

345
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,337
‐ [Inez] I don’t have all
the data yet, but it’s bad.

346
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,130
‐ How bad?

347
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,173
‐ Well very bad.

348
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,376
‐ [Akito] Take that and that!

349
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,378
‐ [Nagare] Stop
shooting, damn it!

350
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,259
‐ [Akito] What’d
you do that for?

351
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,845
‐ You’re wasting ammo!

352
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,548
We brought these
heavy artillery frames

353
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,559
along to take out
The Walking Stick!

354
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,471
Let Ryoko and her
squad handle this!

355
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,058
‐ And let them get clobbered?

356
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,560
‐ [Ryoko] Get moving!

357
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,612
‐ They got the batteries.

358
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,863
‐ Why weren’t you
guarding them, damn it!

359
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,693
‐ Aw shut up!

360
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,324
‐ [Nagare] Conserve
your ammo, you idiot!

361
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,946
‐ Dammit, dammit, dammit!

362
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,585
(rapid fire)

363
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,999
‐ Satiated yet?

364
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,376
‐ Huh?

365
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,382
‐ I hate to bring
bad news, but I’m

366
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,303
afraid that we’re out of time.

367
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,764
I don’t have enough data to tell

368
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,643
just how soon until
the walking stick

369
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
fires again, but I
can say for sure that

370
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,432
damage from the next
blast will be far worse.

371
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,645
‐ What does that mean?

372
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,596
‐ The fire micro
black hole dissipated

373
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,096
after leaving Earth’s atmosphere

374
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,556
resulting in little
residual damage.

375
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,226
I’m sure the next
one will dissipate

376
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,435
within the Earth’s atmosphere.

377
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,436
‐ Why are you so
positive about that?

378
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,698
‐ Because our
enemies aren’t fools.

379
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,450
Simply put, they have
less to lose than we do.

380
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,035
The next black hole will swallow

381
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,368
this entire area
and saturate what’s

382
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,544
left with lethal gamma rays.

383
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,621
‐ Transfer the
batteries from the

384
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,287
flight frames to
the heavy units.

385
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,247
‐ [Crew] Roger!

386
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,804
Have fun attacking the Jovians!

387
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,840
‐ [Hikaru] Come back soon okay?

388
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,633
‐ [Izumi] She’ll be waiting!

389
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,926
‐ They’ll be back
before we know it.

390
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:08,879
‐ They better since
they took all of

391
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,638
our Aestevalis
batteries with them.

392
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,851
‐ No kidding.

393
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,602
We’re stuck here
until they get back.

394
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,137
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

395
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,150
‐ Oh man, this really bites.

396
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,992
‐ [Nagare] We’re low on
energy and ammunition,

397
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,570
so keep the grandstanding to
a minimum from now on, okay?

398
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,315
‐ Roger.

399
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,907
Just who do you think you are?

400
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,121
(loud explosion)

401
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,375
What the heck was that?

402
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,038
‐ [Nagare] Looks like those
tanks had a big brother.

403
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,457
(computer beeping)

404
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,045
(screaming)

405
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,382
‐ Use the suction mines
attached to your Aestevalis!

406
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,258
‐ Okay okay, we’ll try anything!

407
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,391
‐ This is hopeless.

408
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,676
‐ Hikaru, where’s that mine?

409
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,098
‐ Just hold on!

410
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:03,769
Okay I got one!

411
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,278
Huh?

412
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,689
(screams)

413
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,987
It smashed my little Aeste!

414
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,703
‐ I gotcha!

415
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,036
‐ [Seiya] Put the mine on
the bottom of the hull!

416
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,422
‐ I know how to use
a mine, thank you.

417
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,542
‐ [Seiya] What are you doing?

418
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,878
What, oh, run!

419
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,258
‐ I think his fuse was blown.

420
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,098
‐ Uh yeah.

421
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,183
‐ Great work!

422
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,676
It just goes to
show you if you know

423
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,937
where to hit, your hands
are deadly weapons!

424
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,561
‐ Yeah, that was
really impressive.

425
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,647
‐ For an old guy.

426
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,571
‐ Huh?

427
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,731
‐ There’s no time to party!

428
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,397
Get out of there now!

429
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,437
‐ [Hikaru] But
how can we do that

430
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,740
if our Aestes have now power?

431
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,912
‐ I don’t know, but
there are a lot more

432
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,331
tanks coming this way
and we can’t stop them.

433
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,329
Ahhh!

434
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,407
‐ [Akito] Goddammit!

435
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,656
‐ [Nagare] Hold it, be patient!

436
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,787
‐ Just what are we
waiting for, more of them?

437
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,876
(computer beeping)

438
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,094
(energy humming)

439
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,096
‐ Captain, I’m registering
a massive gravitron

440
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,218
fluctuation building
around The Walking Stick.

441
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,556
It’s going to fire.

442
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,310
‐ The repairs won’t
be done in time!

443
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,434
‐ What are we going to do?

444
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,190
What are we going to do?

445
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,350
What am I going to
tell headquarters

446
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,858
about this situation, Captain?

447
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,229
‐ Be quiet, Admiral!

448
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,192
Thank you for behaving
like an officer.

449
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,739
‐ Our captain certainly
can keep her cool

450
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,952
even when things
start to heat up.

451
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,953
‐ Is it because
you believe in him?

452
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,795
‐ Mmmhm.

453
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,287
‐ We’re gonna have to make
a run for The Walking Stick.

454
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,542
You got that, Tenkawa?

455
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,464
‐ I got you, but I
think they got me!

456
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,258
‐ Could we interest
you tigers in a tank?

457
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:51,959
‐ Yeehaw!

458
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,218
‐ You’re just in time.

459
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,469
‐ Well we’re all on the
same team aren’t we?

460
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,433
‐ So I guess we
know what’s next.

461
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,431
‐ What are you talking about?

462
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,972
‐ We you some real training.

463
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,888
‐ He means you gotta take
on that Walking Stick.

464
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,646
‐ Our job is to keep the
bug tanks pinned down.

465
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,809
‐ Tank bugs.

466
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,147
‐ What’s the idea?

467
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,151
‐ It means you head
for The Walking Stick

468
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,484
and we’ll try to
cover your ass, kid!

469
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:12,938
Let’s do it team!

470
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,954
‐ [Crew] Charge!

471
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,780
(uplifting orchestra music)

472
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,408
‐ Everyone hold on tight!

473
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,505
‐ Hold on why?

474
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,211
‐ Because we’re gonna ram!

475
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,501
‐ [Hikaru] Oh no!

476
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,962
‐ [Izumi] I don’t suppose
we could talk you out of it.

477
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,633
‐ [Ryoko] Come on, you
long‐haired killer!

478
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,501
‐ Gotcha!

479
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,587
Basic tactics 101.

480
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,803
How to knockout an
old‐fashioned tank.

481
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:41,807
Oh no you don’t.

482
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,222
‐ Gut it like a fish!

483
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
‐ Almost there!

484
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,772
Stay on target.

485
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,975
Just a little further now.

486
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,356
All right, firing all weapons!

487
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,953
Oh no.

488
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,084
Oh my God, I’m almost
out of ammunition!

489
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,041
Oh crap.

490
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,005
‐ [Nagare] Now do you see why I

491
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,294
told you not to waste your ammo?

492
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,341
(sighs)

493
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,176
‐ Thanks guys.

494
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,511
‐ Great work.

495
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,555
Great work everyone, and that
even includes the anime fan.

496
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,732
Nadesico, Akatsuki.

497
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,439
So is it possible
for you to send

498
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,981
someone over to pick us up?

499
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,062
‐ [Yurika] Roger!

500
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,897
‐ All right!

501
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,032
‐ Well that was quite a mission,

502
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,741
but in the end,
you did good kid.

503
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,454
Not too shabby, Tenkawa.

504
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,915
‐ Well our ride’s here.

505
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:49,918
‐ [Hikaru] This gives me a great

506
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,829
idea for my next comic book!

507
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,497
‐ [Izumi] It won’t
be another one

508
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,916
of those guy/guy things will it?

509
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,927
(singing in foreign language)

510
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,976
‐ [Narrator] Hey
there fans, welcome to

511
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,108
the Nadesico character
popularity poll!

512
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,574
Who do you like best?

513
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,164
First there Miss
Minato for those

514
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,909
who like their
women all grown up.

515
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,660
On the other hand
Hikaru proves that

516
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,992
guys do make passes at
girls who wear glasses.

517
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,659
Then there’s the
captain with her

518
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,906
white suit and perky
little hat, but the one who

519
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,498
steals everyone’s heart
is sweet like Ruri.

520
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,835
The next episode of
Martian Successor Nadesico

521
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,343
will feature a special
focus on our adorable

522
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,545
science officer, don’t miss
those unforgettable days!
