1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,560
‐ [Narrator] I know
we’re supposed to be

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,894
protecting the earth,

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,439
but our staff had a
really rough New Year

4
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,271
and everyone
decided to sleep in.

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,726
So since the animation’s
running a little late,

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,568
this time we present
a very special edition

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,613
of Martian Successor Nadesico.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,025
‐ Darn, it’s gonna be a
show made of old clips.

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,066
‐ Dang.

10
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,788
(intense music)

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,458
(upbeat music)

12
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,833
(birds chirping)

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,004
‐ [Woman] So today’s
episode of Nadesico

14
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,292
is just a highlights episode?

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,965
‐ It looks more like an
introductory episode.

16
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,554
‐ Don’t you know that
they always do this

17
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,011
in the middle of animated series

18
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,800
so new viewers know
what’s happening?

19
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,552
‐ You’re pretty familiar
with this Jun Pay.

20
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,966
(chuckles)

21
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,432
‐ That’s not the only reason.

22
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,222
I’ll bet they were just
running behind schedule

23
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,347
and needed a quick
filler episode.

24
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,522
‐ You’re always such
a gloomy Guss, Joe.

25
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,061
‐ Hey, it’s starting!
‐ Yay!

26
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,355
‐ [Children Voiceover]
Three, two, one, kaboom!

27
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,072
Wee!

28
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,534
‐ It’s time to get
to know Nadesico.

29
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,486
Hey, kids, we’re back!

30
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,954
Come closer, it’s time to go
behind the scenes at Nadesico.

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,536
‐ Close up, please.

32
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,961
This special will be filled
with interesting facts

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,420
about the Nadesico.

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,212
‐ Oh, let me explain.

35
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,303
In 2195, Earth was confronting
the greatest threat

36
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,550
it had ever encountered.

37
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,671
‐ Abandon ship!

38
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,377
We’re gonna ram that thing!

39
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,887
‐ [Woman] To begin with,

40
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,971
a mysterious arm
of unmanned weapons

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,055
attacked and occupied Earth’s
colony on the planet Mars.

42
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,602
The aliens next
concurred the moon,

43
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,477
then advanced on
the Earth itself.

44
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,023
The United Earth Forces
were hopelessly outgunned

45
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,067
and unprepared for
such an attack.

46
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,441
Nothing we had could stop them,

47
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,489
not that is, until
Nergul Heavy Industries

48
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,281
created the high mobile
battleship Nadesico.

49
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,908
Her designation
is Nergul NDZ001,

50
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,625
total length 298 meters,

51
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,578
total height 106.8 meters,

52
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,169
total width 148 meters,

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,423
total weight 37,530 metric tons.

54
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,049
The ship is powered by
four nuclear pulse engines

55
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,145
and two face transition engines

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,142
and equipped with an
SVC‐2027 computer.

57
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,266
‐ Right, and now that you
know the basic specifications,

58
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,232
let’s take a tour of the ship,

59
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,233
beginning with the
bridge which is located

60
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,825
on the 12 and upper
most deck of the ship.

61
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,282
‐ [Yurica] As you can
see, our command staff

62
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,072
is ever vigilant
and alert and oops,

63
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,785
I forgot that everyone
has the day off today.

64
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,328
Nevermind.

65
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,621
‐ [Ruri] Directly
below the bridge

66
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,374
is the virtual reality room.

67
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,004
‐ I’ll explain.

68
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,792
The system automatically
analyzes the person’s brainwaves

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,965
and conducts a
psychological analysis.

70
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,875
It then creates a
virtual environment

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,842
calculated to help the
crew relieve themselves

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,674
of stress and
other primal urges.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
For some reason, this
Japanese high school setting

74
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,145
is extremely popular.

75
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,349
‐ Hey, Akeyto, would
you like to pretend

76
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,315
that you’re my after
school advisor again?

77
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,765
‐ Huh?

78
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,063
‐ Come on, it’s time
to relax a little.

79
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,937
Don’t you want to
drop our inhibitions

80
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,484
and bare our inner souls?

81
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,198
(comical music)

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,991
(screaming)

83
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,697
I’m doing this for you.

84
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,498
(screaming)

85
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,001
‐ It’s not fair!

86
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,711
‐ [Woman] In addition to
the virtual reality suites,

87
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,425
we also have a meditation
room for zen meditation.

88
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,345
(bell rings)

89
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,054
‐ Owe.

90
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,764
‐ [Woman] The recreation
room, located on deck four,

91
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,803
is outfitted with a brand
new 2195 table tennis table.

92
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,767
Next to that is an
observation deck,

93
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,639
fitted with a
holographic projector

94
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,805
for adjustable scenery.

95
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,153
The air pressure
and oxygen levels

96
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,019
can also be adjusted at will.

97
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,992
Just below that is
the ships galley

98
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,399
where Mrs. Helmay
performs her magic.

99
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,120
‐ [Girl] Wow, doesn’t
that look wonderful?

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
‐ Hey, keep cooking, girls.

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,370
This is no time
for slacking off.

102
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,036
We’ve got a lot of hungry crew
members to feed, you know?

103
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,544
Pick up the pace if you
want to get off early

104
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,457
on New Years Eve.

105
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,464
‐ I don’t think I’m
such a bad cook myself,

106
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,376
but it’s amazing what
a real master can do.

107
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,797
‐ The Earth is small
but very diverse.

108
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,055
Every region has it’s own
different variety of flavors,

109
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,928
that’s why the
Nadesico cafeteria

110
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,556
has over 300 different
spices and seasonings.

111
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,484
I don’t like to boast but
that’s very impressive.

112
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,613
‐ [Man] They even stock
a nice selection of tea,

113
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,073
which tastes even better
with my special ingredient.

114
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,783
‐ [Mrs. Helmay] Emerald,
you leave that tea alone!

115
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,285
By the way, our most popular
dish is the Mars Bowl,

116
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,328
that’s rice with weenies
and stroganoff, mm!

117
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,081
‐ Personally, I like the
chicken fried rice the best.

118
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,497
Moving on, our next
stop is the Hanger Bay.

119
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,675
This is where we store
the Estovales robots

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,594
that defend our ship.

121
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,512
‐ [Yurica] Okay, let’s talk
about Estovales themselves.

122
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,512
‐ Hey, let me talk about
the Estovales, okay?

123
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,685
They’re the sexiest
robots you’ve ever seen!

124
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,064
We’ll start with the land
combat frame version.

125
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,811
Look at that amazing punch!

126
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,405
Behold it’s awesome mobility.

127
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,649
Oh, it’s so cool, I have
to take a sponge bath

128
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,943
every time it takes off.

129
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,944
Oh, and look at
the way it jumps!

130
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,026
But wait, there’s more.

131
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,530
Next there’s the
combat frame version.

132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,202
‐ Hold on right there!

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
Leave this baby to me.

134
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,448
This is the robot for a
real hero to fight in.

135
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,458
Oh yeah, baby, check
out those thrusters.

136
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,542
But makes this hunk of heavy
metal so hot is the payload.

137
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,168
The one and only
indomitable me, Guy Digoji!

138
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,218
‐ [Ruri] Mr. Yamatta,
aren’t you supposed to be?

139
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,224
‐ Hey, it’s guy thing!

140
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,306
You wouldn’t understand.

141
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,602
Yeah, I haven’t had
this much fun in months!

142
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,647
And don’t forget the
Estabales’s special secret move.

143
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,531
Come on, everybody, let’s say
it all together with feeling,

144
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,612
Gragrat!

145
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,244
‐ We have the knowledge,
we have the technology,

146
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,867
world peace is at hand now.

147
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,617
‐ [Man] What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

148
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,748
‐ You know, I’ve ridden on
Akeyto’s artillery frame.

149
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,217
‐ [Man] Oh, the artillery
frame, yes sir, baby.

150
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,430
This is build like a tank.

151
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,469
And then there’s
the zero G‐frame.

152
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,473
Those are for outer space work.

153
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,815
We have one for each
of our main pilots.

154
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,690
Akeyto Takowa, Reoko Subaru,
Ikaru Amatto and Azumi Maki.

155
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,558
Oh, that’s four right?

156
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,439
(triumphant music)

157
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,491
‐ Huh, I only know
three out of 10?

158
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,245
‐ It appears that
these grasshoppers

159
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,118
have a few legs up on us
in terms of defensive field.

160
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,374
‐ When did they get those?

161
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,036
‐ Who cares how
many legs they have?

162
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,384
We’re still one up on them

163
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,379
when it comes to
hand‐to‐hand combat!

164
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,501
All right, that takes
care of those lizards

165
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,378
but where in the
heck did they go?

166
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,553
Take cover!

167
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,756
‐ [Boy] The Estebales
that came to my rescue

168
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,639
was the very newest model.

169
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,944
‐ That’s a brand
new model Estebales,

170
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,481
a new frame, a new generator!

171
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,273
Look at that hand, look
at those thrusters!

172
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,939
Oh, it’s so smooth, I’m
in love, I’m in love.

173
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,699
‐ [Girls] Geez, what a loser!

174
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,699
‐ [Ruri] Nagarae Akatzki
joined us at the same time

175
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,702
that Arina Kinjowan came
onboad as Cohelm’s woman.

176
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,036
Personally, I think these
two are up to something.

177
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,672
(dramatic music)

178
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,257
‐ [Woman] We know next to
nothing about the Jovians,

179
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,840
their true nature, their goals.

180
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,554
Everything about them is
still cloaked in mystery.

181
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,265
And since they use
unmanned weapons,

182
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,716
we don’t even know
what they look like.

183
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,176
(guns firing)

184
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,886
(dramatic music)

185
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,535
‐ [Woman] Yuko, it’s
coming your way!

186
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,787
(screaming)

187
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,815
It’s just a matter of
picking the right angle.

188
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,981
(screaming)

189
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,659
Get me again!

190
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,702
Lance!

191
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,669
‐ [Ruri] Somehow we’ve
managed to get by until now

192
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,423
but will we be able to deal
with the continued evolution

193
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,134
of the Jovian weapons?

194
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,014
‐ [Yurica] Oh, don’t
you just love anime?

195
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,843
It’s so imaginative.

196
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,716
‐ Wow, the fight sequences sure
are animated realistically.

197
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,136
‐ Eee, I wonder what’s
gonna happen to them next

198
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,143
do you suppose?

199
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,694
(dramatic music)

200
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,362
(upbeat music)

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,490
(dark music)

202
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,912
‐ What’s wrong, Prince Akara?

203
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,992
When will you have the
planet Earth conquered

204
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,366
as I have ordered?

205
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,714
‐ Very soon, sire.

206
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,290
I’m currently collecting
cultural information

207
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,634
regarding the earthlings.

208
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,339
‐ Data on the earthlings, aye?

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,460
Sounds interesting.

210
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,627
‐ Well, that’s enough
cold data for now.

211
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,796
How about some hot
gossip instead?

212
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,805
With 214 people living
and sleeping together

213
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,388
at all hours of the day,

214
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,393
things can be quite interesting!

215
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,726
For example, just
what’s going on

216
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,100
between the captain
and Akeyto Tinkowa.

217
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,940
Apparently, it’s been going on

218
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,074
e loncame onto this ship.

219
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,530
(screaming)

220
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,073
‐ I’m so sorry, I’m so
terribly, terribly sorry.

221
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,699
How could you
possibly forgive me?

222
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,914
Are you hurt, is
anything broken?

223
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,714
‐ Yes, it seems that
the relationship

224
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,499
between the captain
and Mrs. Tinkowa

225
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,832
goes back quite a ways.

226
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,424
‐ Don’t you feel like there’s
some kind of connection here?

227
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,342
(gentle music)

228
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,593
‐ Yes, there is.

229
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,431
‐ Aketo!

230
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,931
What’s wrong, does
your tummy hurt, Aketo?

231
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,388
‐ Shut up!

232
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,436
‐ Were you in a fight?

233
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,559
‐ Shut up, go away! (sobbing)

234
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,026
‐ Hey, wanna see a magic trick

235
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,663
that’ll turn you back to normal?

236
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,701
‐ Huh?

237
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,452
‐ Close your eyes, Aketo.

238
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,299
‐ Gross, what did
you do that for?

239
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,761
(laughing)

240
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,419
‐ I told that it would
turn you back to normal.

241
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,967
‐ Don’t ever do
that to me again.

242
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,890
(sobbing)

243
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,560
I can’t stop it.

244
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,195
‐ (sobbing) Aketo!

245
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,495
‐ Holy cow, I had no idea
all this was going on.

246
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,497
I’ve totally humiliated
myself for Eureka

247
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,749
and she’s still playing
around with the cook?

248
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,790
‐ Yes, yes, keep your shirt on.

249
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,045
‐ Oh, to be young
again sowing wild oats.

250
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,959
‐ And while they might
fight all the time,

251
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,507
sometimes they seem to
connect rather well.

252
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,390
‐ Why did we come here, Aketo?

253
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,558
Why did we bother?

254
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,936
What’s the point?

255
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,401
We didn’t save anyone.

256
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,033
I couldn’t save them, I failed.

257
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,899
‐ Eureka.

258
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,699
(dramatic music)

259
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,657
‐ You know, this is the first
time you’ve been nice to me

260
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,004
since you came aboard the ship.

261
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,369
‐ Stop it, please,
pull yourself together!

262
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,669
‐ Aketo, please, kiss me.

263
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,963
‐ Eureka, I don’t
think this is the time.

264
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,087
‐ I don’t care,
it doesn’t matter.

265
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,927
I just want something that
means there’s still hope.

266
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,721
Well?

267
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,598
Aren’t you in love
with me Aketo?

268
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,056
‐ Aketo, Aketo’s in
love with me, right?

269
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,806
‐ No, he’s in love
with me, you tramp!

270
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,858
‐ It’s me!
‐ No, it’s me!

271
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,568
‐ Poor Mr. Tinkowa,
it must be tough

272
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,704
having to act like an adult

273
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,240
with all those relationships.

274
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,584
It’s strange.

275
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,160
‐ Oh yes, it’s strange.

276
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,625
‐ But?

277
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,116
‐ But you’ll understand
once you’re grown up.

278
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,629
‐ Please, our ratings.

279
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,047
‐ By the way, those rabbit
ears, wear them tonight.

280
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,301
‐ How embarrassing.

281
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,605
‐ As I said, a lot
of interesting things
go on around here.

282
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,640
‐ (laughing) Lots
of naughty things.

283
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,175
‐ Naughty but nice things.

284
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,518
It’s on me.

285
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,444
(screaming)

286
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,115
Tinkoa!

287
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,443
‐ Tinkoa.

288
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,026
‐ Now, shut up you two!

289
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,651
I’ve had enough of this.

290
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,159
‐ Tinkoa, Tinkoa,
Tinkoa, Tinkoa, Tinkoa,

291
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,242
Tinkoa, Tinkoa, Tinkoa!

292
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,204
‐ Oh dear, what stress.

293
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,245
‐ Aketo!

294
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,955
‐ Aketo?

295
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,248
Aketo?

296
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,291
Aketo?

297
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,579
Aketo.

298
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,214
Aketo.

299
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,595
Aketo!

300
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,796
Aketo.

301
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,928
Aketo.

302
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,597
‐ [Narrator] With her hall full
of so many loves and passions,

303
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,436
the high mobile battleship
Nadesico sails on.

304
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,112
Were will she go?

305
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,781
What will be the fate of
the love between the two.

306
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,610
‐ How I wish to experience
this thing called love.

307
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,696
Will his royal
highness Prince Akara

308
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,623
never notice the way I
feel for him in my heart?

309
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,951
‐ Miyay, have you
finished collecting data

310
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,207
about earthling
culture for me yet?

311
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,791
‐ Oh, yes sire.

312
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,674
Please watch this screen.

313
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,172
This anime, Marian
Successor Nadesico

314
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,463
is the best source
of information
regarding earthlings.

315
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,877
‐ Anime, what is this anime?

316
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,508
‐ A form of entertainment

317
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,143
that uses pictures
to tell a story.

318
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,221
‐ What fools to be so infatuated
with tales of fantasy.

319
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,180
‐ Let’s do it, guys!

320
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,018
‐ Hm, so the earthlings allow
the genders to intermingle.

321
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,024
‐ Yes, many of their war stories

322
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,766
are mixed with stories of love.

323
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,648
It’s very romantic.

324
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,025
‐ What tripe, all
this love and romance.

325
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,735
How can one win battles when
preoccupied with such folly?

326
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,866
‐ Yes, my lord.

327
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,161
‐ Ah, by the great
gonzorks, what is that?

328
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,995
What kind of weapon
was that, MeaMea?

329
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,793
‐ Well, I am not sure, my lord.

330
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,456
But it appears to be a form

331
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,505
of inverted polarized
energy barrier

332
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,958
called a distortion field.

333
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,298
‐ Hm, I see.

334
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,804
Penetration by using the
force of repelling energy.

335
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,967
(chuckles) Oh, I like that.

336
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,056
And it gives me the perfect plan

337
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,732
for destroying Gecky
Ganger once and for all.

338
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,560
You have served me well MeaMea.

339
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,815
‐ Huh, oh, thank you.

340
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,767
I exist only to serve you.

341
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,569
‐ [Man] His royal highness
Akara’s custom robot,

342
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,032
The Big Akara, is ready.

343
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,123
‐ (chuckles) Just you
wait Gecky Ganger.

344
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,870
‐ Professor, an
unknown flying object

345
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,294
is closing in on the laboratory

346
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,464
at a ferociously fast pace.

347
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,963
‐ What, raise the force field!

348
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,591
‐ (laughing) That
won’t do you any good.

349
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,224
Distortion field on.

350
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,603
‐ What was that?

351
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,221
‐ It’s an earthquake!

352
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,938
‐ Ken, Ko, Akira,
a giant monster is
attacking the building.

353
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,270
You’ve got to destroy it.

354
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,273
‐ [All] Yes, sir!

355
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,112
‐ What’s wrong, Gecky Ganger?

356
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,112
If you don’t come
out and fight me,

357
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,191
I’ll destroy your secret base.

358
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,817
It’s judgment time!

359
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,985
‐ Come on, team!

360
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,163
‐ [All] Gecky Ganger, go!

361
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,992
(dramatic music)

362
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,077
‐ Gecky Gang beam!

363
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,882
‐ (laughing) No manner
of attack such as that

364
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,499
will have any affect on me.

365
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,628
Take this!

366
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,844
‐ Darn it, ugh!

367
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,972
Gecky Gang sword!

368
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,692
(gasping)

369
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,151
‐ Your little toys
will never be a match

370
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,731
for my brilliant
distortion field.

371
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,815
Die, Gecky Ganger!

372
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,653
‐ Father, Kanjo and
Akira are in danger.

373
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,856
You must do something.

374
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,488
‐ (laughing) And now you die!

375
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,946
‐ Must fight back!

376
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:20,994
‐ Ken!
‐ Professor?

377
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,157
‐ Yes, just configured
on it recently

378
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,167
and it hasn’t been tested
yet but we have no choice.

379
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,500
Ken, Jo, Akira, use
the Gekegan Flare!

380
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,627
‐ The Gekegan Flare!

381
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,212
‐ That’s right,

382
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,259
I anticipated that something
like this might happen

383
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,221
so I secretly developed
the Gekega Flare,

384
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,394
but be careful,

385
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,512
the three of you must be
perfectly synchronized

386
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,519
or the Gekaga will explode!

387
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,309
(dramatic music)

388
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,937
‐ But I guess we’ll
have to do it.

389
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,112
Watch out, here we go!

390
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,191
‐ Right!

391
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,690
‐ Gekegan Flare!

392
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,200
(upbeat music)

393
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,286
‐ What, what is
this blinding light?

394
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,173
‐ [Woman] Your highness!

395
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,132
‐ Damn you, earthlings,
you will rue this day!

396
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,636
‐ We did it, everyone.

397
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,565
But professor, how did you come
up with an attack like this?

398
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,976
‐ [Professor] Well, they
had it on Nadesico recently.

399
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,403
‐ What, you watch
it too, professor?

400
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,534
‐ [Professor] Yes, well in
any case, come right home.

401
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,780
We’ve got a special New
Years noodles to celebrate.

402
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,945
‐ Noodles, do you have
rice cakes ready too?

403
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,075
‐ [All] That’s for
tomorrows dinner. (laughing)

404
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,497
‐ Can we really release
an episode like that?

405
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,294
‐ Oh, one time is fine.

406
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,589
‐ Don’t worry, captain,
we’ll be back next time.

407
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,928
(upbeat music)

408
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,816
Hello, I’m Jennifer Earhart,
and I play Yurika Misumaru.

409
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,819
I hope you enjoyed
this special episode...

410
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,364
...of Martian
Successor Nadesico...

411
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,159
...as much as we
enjoyed making it.

412
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,782
Personally, the only thing
that I didn’t like...

413
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,987
...was that that
little tramp Megumi...

414
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,287
...made another
pass at my Akito!

415
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,410
I mean, just who does
she think she is?

416
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,827
And another... Huh?
Huh? All right..

417
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,498
In the next episode, we
finally find out who and
what the Jovian lizards are.

418
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,086
Hey, Yurika has a lot of good
lines in that one, doesn’t she?

419
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,922
She does? Good!

420
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,927
Anyway, don’t miss our
next thrilling episode...

421
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,719
..."The Significant Other
from a Star Far Away".
