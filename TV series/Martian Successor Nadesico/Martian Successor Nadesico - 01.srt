1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,177
‐ [Ruri] When the
first Tulip appeared,

2
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,939
all we knew was that it
came from beyond Jupiter.

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,226
‐ [Bridge] There’s
no question, sir,

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,436
the target is heading
directly toward Mars.

5
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,735
Our projections
indicate that it will

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,819
probably land near the
planet’s south pole.

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,243
‐ The evidence
suggests that they

8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,323
intend to attack our colony.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,116
We must prevent it from
landing on Mars at all cost.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,785
(upbeat electronic music)

11
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,712
All vessels, hold your
fire until the enemy

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,047
enters your obligate
targeting range!

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,843
‐ [Bridge] It’s continuing
to advance, sir.

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,895
It’ll be inside our range
of fire in 20 seconds.

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,220
(singing in Japanese)

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,437
‐ Fire!

17
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,194
(weapons firing)

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,610
(ships exploding)

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,779
‐ [deputy] They’re
repelling all of

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,407
our beam projectors
somehow, sir.

21
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,954
We can’t get near them!

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,827
‐ [Admiral] They have some
kind of gravitron wave shield.

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,502
‐ [Bridge] Sir, we’ve
got multiple small

24
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,581
bogeys emerging from the Tulip.

25
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,675
‐ Hold shields, we’ll
fire with lasers!

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,750
(lasers firing)

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:29,087
Impossible, we aren’t
getting any kills!

28
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,512
‐ [Bridge] Admiral, the
computer’s predicting

29
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,761
that the Tulip will reach
the south pole in 60 seconds.

30
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,755
‐ Abandon ship, we’re
gonna ram that thing!

31
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,364
(ship exploding)

32
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,804
(groaning)
‐ [Woman] What was that?

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,763
‐ [Man] What’s happening?

34
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,803
‐ HQ, HQ!

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,060
‐ You’re wasting your time.
‐ Huh?

36
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,944
‐ Everything on the surface
must have been vaporized.

37
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:24,889
‐ Would you like one?

38
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,108
‐ Wow, thank you.

39
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,399
‐ How kind.

40
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,572
‐ Oh, no, I’ve got a
whole crate of them here.

41
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,781
‐ You’re a nice man,
are you married?

42
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,492
(laughs)
‐ I’m Ai, what’s your name?

43
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,334
(gasps)

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,409
(thrilling music)

45
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,366
(laser beams firing)

46
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,407
‐ Get down!

47
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,788
(screaming)

48
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,503
(screaming)

49
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,839
(breaks glass)

50
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,303
‐ [Officer] Powers
gone, we’re trying

51
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,472
to open the doors manually,
please don’t panic.

52
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,721
Keep firing, we’ve gotta get
these civilians out of here.

53
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,346
(device powers up)

54
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,813
‐ I’ll try to hold that
thing off, get outta here!

55
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:08,352
‐ No, stop!
(yells)

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,484
(groans)

57
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,235
‐ How do you like that?

58
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,532
(tires turning)

59
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:23,873
(glass breaking)

60
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,164
‐ You’re wonderful, mister!

61
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,707
‐ [Man] Come on, the
doors are opening.

62
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,962
‐ Huh?
(groaning with exertion)

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:34,132
‐ Huh?
(screaming)

64
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,393
(fire burns)

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,100
(yells)

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,440
No!

67
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,084
‐ One year has now passed
since the disastrous

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
defeat at the first
Battle of Mars.

69
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,995
If the military
continues to be unable

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,500
to stop the invaders, the
Earth will soon fall, as well.

71
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,884
‐ Which is quite unacceptable.

72
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,761
‐ I have a question.
‐ And what is that, Mr. Hori?

73
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,259
‐ Exactly what does
this have to do with me?

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,433
‐ The Schiaperelli Project,
are you aware of it?

75
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,892
‐ [Mr. Hori] Of course.

76
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,722
‐ We want to implement it,
and do to your extensive

77
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,427
military experience, we believe

78
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,477
that you’re the best
choice for carrying it out.

79
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,693
‐ I don’t know, it’s been a
while since I wore a uniform.

80
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,273
‐ Ah, but this assignment would

81
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,109
involve a lot of
lovely young women.

82
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,154
‐ Oh?

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,358
‐ And your bonus,
now, let’s see.

84
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,318
How’s this?

85
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,451
‐ May I ask you
one other question?

86
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,408
‐ Of course.

87
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,625
‐ Is that after taxes?

88
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,747
‐ Well, now that that’s settled,

89
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,134
let’s assemble our
human resources.

90
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,173
‐ Our crew?
‐ Yes, our crew.

91
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,218
I’ve chosen the very
best, of course, a few

92
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,681
of them have some slight
personality disorders.

93
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,600
(machine welds metal)

94
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,642
‐ You’ve been doing this
for three days, you know?

95
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,308
‐ Quiet, a few more spot welds
and Lilly will be invincible.

96
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,146
‐ Mr Uribatake.
(screams)

97
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,903
‐ Here I am, this isn’t
what it looks like.

98
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,244
‐ Here I am, I’m Lethal Lily.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,820
(screams)

100
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,664
(garage explodes)

101
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,571
(fire crackers crack)

102
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,867
‐ The chick mechanic.

103
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,661
‐ You’re unlicensed,
but very skilled.

104
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,545
‐ Won’t you join us?

105
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,161
‐ Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

106
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,617
Come on, let’s go,
I’m ready to boogie.

107
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,916
‐ But don’t you want to
negotiate your contract first?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,290
‐ Yeah, fine, I don’t care.

109
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,667
If it means getting
away from those two,

110
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,923
I’d work in the bowels of hell.

111
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,344
‐ Are you sure about
this, Miss Haruka?

112
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,923
I thought you liked
being a secretary

113
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,838
to the company’s president.
‐ Well, I did.

114
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,008
But this looks much
more interesting.

115
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,347
‐ Time for us to fight!
‐ All right, let’s go.

116
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,595
‐ Yeah!

117
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,945
‐ Great, fantastic.
‐ Thank you very much, sir.

118
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,480
‐ Thank you, and you.
‐ Megumi.

119
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,825
‐ Huh?

120
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,899
‐ Take a breather,
these gentlemen

121
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,685
from Nergal would
like to talk to ya.

122
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,687
‐ Huh?

123
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,026
(monitor beeps)

124
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,631
‐ [Yurika’s Father] Yurika!

125
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,422
‐ Yurika, your father’s
starting to get upset.

126
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,758
‐ [Yurika] Well, I’m sorry,
but this uniform is just so‐‐

127
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,225
Uh, it’s just not me.

128
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,263
‐ It’s a bit late
to complain now.

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,057
‐ [Yurika] I know,
but speaking of late,

130
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,391
are you sure quitting the UF to

131
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,564
follow me to Nergal
is such a good idea?

132
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,065
‐ Well, I was worried
that you might need help.

133
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,398
‐ Oh, Jun, you’re
the best friend

134
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,023
that a girl could ask for.
‐ Yeah, sure.

135
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,358
‐ Yurika, damn it,
Yurika, you were

136
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,236
supposed to leave an hour ago.

137
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,993
‐ Daddy.
‐ You’re a blanking officer!

138
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,084
‐ She’s still getting
dressed right now!

139
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,751
(gasps)
(screaming)

140
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,082
‐ My little girl is a woman.

141
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,037
(objects slams against face)

142
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,665
(car speeds down the road)

143
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,092
Not only is she an officer,

144
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,841
but she’s well endowed, as well.

145
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,633
Yurika, your daddy
is very proud.

146
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,879
(ship explodes)

147
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,088
‐ [Radio Announcer] Evil lizards

148
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,599
from Jupiter are
attacking the Earth.

149
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,851
‐ It’s time to mop them
out with our united fists.

150
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,103
United forces protect the earth.

151
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,065
‐ [Radio Announcer]
This has been a message

152
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,935
from the united‐‐
‐ Not another air raid.

153
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,112
‐ Hey, what’s holding
up my stir fry?

154
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,241
(food frying in pan)
‐ Hey, oh, not again.

155
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,240
(jet explodes)

156
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,782
‐ Oh, there goes another one.

157
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,405
‐ When will they realize they’re
no match for the Jovians?

158
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,873
‐ Dudes, the fry
cooks freaking out!

159
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,124
‐ Huh?

160
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,459
‐ Hey, your fry
cook’s not sick is he?

161
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,591
‐ Nah, just scared.
‐ Of what?

162
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,629
‐ The Jovians.

163
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,299
(screams)

164
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,390
‐ Ah, damn, I burned it.
(screaming)

165
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,057
‐ Sorry, Akito, but I put
two weeks severance pay

166
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,396
on your card.
‐ You mean, I’m fired?

167
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,993
‐ I’m afraid so, look,
there’s a war going on

168
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,151
and if word gets out that I’ve

169
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,028
got a yellow pilot working here.

170
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,235
‐ What, it’s all
because of this?

171
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,084
‐ Only pilots help
those on Earth, Akito,

172
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,000
and if everyone saw the
way you froze up today.

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,830
‐ But this job is
the only thing I had.

174
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,285
‐ I know and I’m sorry,
but you can’t keep running

175
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,087
away from your problems
forever, you know.

176
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,340
‐ Damn it, what’s wrong
with running away?

177
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,385
And who’s business is it anyway?

178
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,220
Okay, so, maybe I do need
to confront my fears,

179
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,006
but how can I stand
up to my nightmares

180
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,180
if my legs are running
like nature intended?

181
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,887
I’m brave, but my feet aren’t.

182
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,809
Damn feet, ah, you jerk!

183
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,857
Huh?

184
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,690
Ah!

185
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,858
Why me, God, why always me?

186
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,817
‐ Oh, my, gosh, I’m so sorry.

187
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,907
Oh, Jun, get the first aid kit.

188
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,204
I’m so terribly,
terribly, sorry.

189
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,205
How can you ever forgive me?

190
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,867
Are you hurt, is
anything broken?

191
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,207
(groaning)

192
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,055
‐ Hey, Yurika, I know it’s late,

193
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,130
but do you really
need all this stuff?

194
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,054
‐ Jun, a girl can’t
be too prepared

195
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,394
and I spent three days
picking those out,

196
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,970
so just find a
place to put them.

197
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,974
‐ Yes, Ma’am.
‐ Thanks so much

198
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,676
for helping me pack my bag.
‐ Eh, it’s no big deal.

199
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,807
And it’s kinda obvious
that you’re not very

200
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,854
good at packing.
‐ [Yurika] Oh?

201
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,807
‐ Yeah, you need to
consolidate the fragile things

202
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,568
toward the center of the
case, and you should wrap them

203
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,861
with small articles of
clothing like this‐‐

204
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,407
Like, these, p‐p‐panties!

205
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,575
‐ Hmm!

206
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,701
‐ Gah, I’m sorry,
I’m sorry, I’m sorry,

207
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,156
I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

208
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,785
‐ You know, this is gonna
sound really strange,

209
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,924
but haven’t you and I
met some place before,

210
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,298
and don’t you feel like
there’s some connection here?

211
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,881
‐ No, honestly I
really don’t feel like

212
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,884
that at all actually.
‐ Oh, how very strange.

213
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,797
‐ [Jun] Yurika!
‐ I’m coming!

214
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,893
Well, thanks for
all your help, bye!

215
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,234
‐ [Jun] There’s no way
that’s going in the trunk.

216
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,310
Can we try the back seat?
‐ Okay.

217
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,611
‐ What in the heck is this?

218
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,860
Huh?

219
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,613
This, it’s me, how?

220
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,415
Why would that girl have
a picture of me as a kid?

221
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,619
‐ Don’t you feel like
there’s some connection here?

222
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,543
‐ Of course, of course,
of course we met before!

223
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,883
‐ Yurika! Yurika Misumaru!

224
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,047
Oh, I can’t believe fate
has crossed our paths again.

225
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,340
I have to know, I have to know.

226
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,255
You’re the only one who can
tell me the truth, Yurika!

227
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,965
(upbeat music)

228
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,308
(crickets chirping)

229
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,565
‐ Say, what, what do you
mean you don’t need us?

230
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,898
We’re Admiral‐‐
‐ He’s an idiot.

231
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,904
‐ He looks familiar, didn’t he

232
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,816
drop his ship on
the Mars Colony?

233
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,196
‐ Still, I suppose you can’t
blame him for being upset.

234
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,494
‐ There’s nothing wrong
with our crew, sir.

235
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,617
Of course, they may
be a little unusual,

236
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,464
but they’re all
experts in their fields

237
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,669
and our captain has never been
defeated in the simulations.

238
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,792
‐ And just where is
this miracle worker?

239
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,998
‐ Well, actually‐‐

240
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,377
(groaning)
‐ This must be it!

241
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,886
Hi, everyone, have no fear
your new captain’s here!

242
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,721
Vee!
‐ Vee?

243
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,012
‐ An idiot.

244
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,848
‐ There’s nothing like making
a strong first impression.

245
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,976
‐ [Guard] Well, you see,
sir, this guy just rode up

246
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,111
to the front gate on a bike
and started raising a ruckus.

247
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,520
‐ Let me go, let me see her!

248
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,569
‐ [Officer] Ah, I see,
you must be a pilot.

249
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,703
‐ No, I’m not, I’m
a cook damn it.

250
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,910
‐ And he keeps spouting
nonsense like that, too, sir.

251
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,701
He’s a real loony.

252
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,164
Hmm, now, let’s find out
what your name really is.

253
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,075
‐ [Akito] DNA database?
‐ Here we go.

254
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,416
Hmm, how did you
get to the Earth

255
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,421
from the Utopia Colony
after it was destroyed?

256
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,669
‐ I can’t remember.

257
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,876
All I know is that I
was on Mars and the

258
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,546
next thing I knew I
was here on Earth.

259
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,605
‐ And Yurika, why
must you see her?

260
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,891
‐ Back when I was on Mars,
when we were kids, I knew her.

261
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,437
I think she might know why
my parents were killed.

262
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,070
‐ I understand, you’ve had
a tough time, haven’t you?

263
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,661
A cook, huh, we need cooks.
‐ Huh?

264
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,739
‐ Well, then, you’re in luck.

265
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,736
From now on, you’ll be
a cook on the Nadesco.

266
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,499
Who am I to argue with Fate?
‐ Nadesco?

267
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,420
‐ Yes, the Nadesco.

268
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,673
The ship won’t be
taking off for a while

269
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,422
so why don’t you take a walk
around and get to know her?

270
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,916
Okay?
‐ Okay.

271
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,889
‐ Let’s go Gekiganger!
(laughs)

272
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,931
‐ It’s an Aestivalis,
not a Gekiganger.

273
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:46,467
‐ I’ve got you in my wrath!

274
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,099
Finish you off with
Gekiganger blade!

275
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,687
‐ Wait a second, who are you
and how did you get there?

276
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,364
Our pilots aren’t supposed
to arrive for three days.

277
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,282
(laughter)
‐ Are you kidding?

278
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,864
When I heard we were going to be

279
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,657
piloting real robots , I
couldn’t get here fast enough.

280
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,373
This is the real
thing, baby, whoo!

281
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,542
‐ Will you stop that,
play times over!

282
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,711
‐ Hey you’re talking to
the greatest robo pilot

283
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,210
who’s ever lived,
and to prove it

284
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,252
I’ll show you just one of my
super‐amazing god‐killer moves!

285
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,756
(gasping)
‐ Gai Super Upper!

286
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,052
(screaming)

287
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,007
(robot crashes)

288
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,349
‐ Gekiganger?
(laughter)

289
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,354
‐ It’s just like on Gekiganger.

290
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,476
Every time I move my arms the
robots arms move the same way.

291
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,654
Am I a born pilot or what?

292
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,732
‐ Actually, with the
latest developments

293
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,816
in image feedback
technology, a newborn child

294
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,403
would have done just
as well as you did.

295
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,027
‐ I’m Gai, Gai Daigoji,
but you can call me Gai.

296
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,698
‐ Well, this says your
name is Jiro Yamada.

297
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,787
‐ Hmm, that’s just the
born name my mother

298
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,541
happened to give
me, but Gai Daigoji

299
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,464
is the name, which
belongs to my soul.

300
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,341
Evil Jovians, fear my wrath.
(groans)

301
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,500
‐ Now what?

302
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,668
‐ Yes, well,
actually it’s my leg.

303
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,048
‐ I think I hurt it
quite badly, doh!

304
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,217
‐ Of course, it hurts,
it’s broken you idiot.

305
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,926
‐ [Gai] Don’t be
stupid, it’s fine!

306
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,394
(groans in pain)
No!

307
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,805
Ow, hey, you up on the catwalk.

308
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,643
‐ Me?

309
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,057
‐ Is there anyone else up there?

310
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,477
My most precious possession
is still in that cockpit.

311
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,694
Could you get it for
me pretty please?

312
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,785
‐ God, a Gekiganger robot toy

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,400
is his most precious possession?

314
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,318
Just how old is
that guy, mentally?

315
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,655
(screams)
What was that?

316
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,160
‐ [Command] Attention please.

317
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,531
Our ground forces are now
engaged in combat with the

318
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,159
enemy’s tactical fire.
‐ Oh, no, it’s them!

319
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,785
‐ [Command] All bridge crew‐‐
‐ It’s them, there here!

320
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,582
‐ [Command] Report to the
command center immediately.

321
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,206
(weapons firing)
I repeat.

322
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,921
All bridge crew report to the
command center immediately!

323
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,754
(weapons firing)

324
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,549
‐ Why are they
attacking out there?

325
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,671
‐ Who can ever figure out what

326
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,547
those damn Jovians are thinking?

327
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,095
‐ That’s true, I hope poor
Akito is not watching this.

328
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,181
(weapons exploding)

329
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,934
‐ [Mr. Hori] The enemy
seems to be concentrating

330
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,018
their attack directly
above our position.

331
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,062
‐ And you think the
Nadesco’s there target?

332
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,185
‐ If that’s the case, we’ll
hit them where it hurts.

333
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,482
‐ What do you mean?

334
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,065
‐ If we sweep the perimeter
with the Nadesco’s

335
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,192
energy cannons we’ll
burn them to a crisp.

336
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,907
‐ Are you proposing to
vaporize our own fighters?

337
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,070
‐ Well, why not, they’re
going to die anyway!

338
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,539
‐ Would you call that
cold‐blooded or just cowardly?

339
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,999
‐ Captain, do you
have any suggestions?

340
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,500
‐ The Nadesco will go
through the underwater

341
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,541
submarine dock and
into the open ocean,

342
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,625
blind the enemy from
behind and obliterate them.

343
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,092
We’ll need a decoy.
‐ That’s where Gai Daigoji

344
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,261
comes in, I can engage the
enemy with my giant robot.

345
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,341
Lure them away from the
base, it’ll be great!

346
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,598
(laughter)
It’s my destiny, yeah!

347
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,060
‐ You have a triple
compound fracture.

348
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,481
‐ I forgot that.

349
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
‐ We already have a decoy.
(gasping)

350
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,556
‐ Use the robot in the
main elevator shaft.

351
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,781
‐ There’s no way I’m gonna
be trapped inside this ship.

352
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,610
I’m just a freaking
cook, I’m not

353
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,316
gonna get killed
in some stupid war.

354
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,367
‐ Identify yourself!
‐ Huh?

355
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,199
‐ Are you a pilot?
‐ No, sir, no.

356
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,834
(screaming)

357
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,792
‐ That’s my Gekiganger!

358
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,290
‐ State your name and rank!

359
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,501
‐ Akito Tenkawa,
the ship’s cook.

360
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,003
‐ The what?
‐ Yurika, isn’t that?

361
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,376
‐ Hmm, Tenkawa.
‐ [Gai] What the blankety

362
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,592
blank is he doing
inside the cockpit?

363
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,972
‐ [Deputy] He’s from Mars,
I hired him as a cook.

364
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,591
‐ [Gai] So what’s a Martian
cook doing inside my robot?

365
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,547
‐ Akito?
(gasping)

366
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,887
‐ [Yurika] Akito, it’s Akito!
‐ Huh?

367
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,523
‐ I knew it, I knew it, I knew
we knew each other somehow,

368
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,442
Akito, and I was
right, wasn’t I?

369
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,229
Did you just pretend not to know

370
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,443
me because you’re so shy, Akito?

371
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,572
‐ Hey, wait just
one second here.

372
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,569
Just what are you doing
on this ship, anyway?

373
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,861
‐ Why, she’s the
captain of the Nadesco.

374
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,197
(gasps)

375
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,322
‐ That’s right, Akito, I’m
the captain of the Nadesco.

376
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,987
Pretty cool, huh?

377
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,615
‐ Yurika, do you actually
know this person?

378
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,372
‐ Mm‐hmm, he’s my
knight in shining armor.

379
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,498
Whenever I was in trouble, Akito

380
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,172
was always there to
help me through it.

381
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,502
‐ Can I get a word in here?

382
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,255
‐ Oh, but I can’t let you act
as a decoy against the enemy.

383
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,838
‐ Huh, act as a what?

384
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,344
‐ But I know how devoted
you are towards conducting

385
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,844
your mission and the mere
words from a sentimental

386
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,506
woman wouldn’t sway
you, will they?

387
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,644
‐ Well, they might.
‐ All right.

388
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,391
‐ I’m entrusting the
fate of the Nadesco

389
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,846
and all her crew to you, Akito,

390
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,225
but promise me that
you’ll come back alive.

391
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,864
‐ Alive, hey wait!

392
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,150
‐ The elevator is about
to reach ground level.

393
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,613
‐ Uh, wait.
‐ Good luck and godspeed.

394
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,203
‐ Give me back my Gekiganger!
‐ Just shut up!

395
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,741
‐ [Mr. Hori] You
have 10 minutes.

396
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,115
Just keep the enemy
occupied, good luck.

397
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,709
(adventurous music)

398
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,422
‐ I’ll trust you with the fate

399
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,217
of the Nadesco and all her crew.

400
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,682
‐ No, this stinks,
it’s not fair.

401
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,394
Not part of my plan!

402
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,064
I did not sign up for this crap!

403
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,727
‐ But, where’s he going?

404
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,403
Get back there and
fight like a man!

405
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,900
This is crazy, how is a cook
supposed to be able to fight?

406
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,694
Use the cannons, at least
throw a punch, goddammit.

407
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,987
‐ [Deputy] Actually,
he’s doing quite well.

408
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,361
‐ [Mr. Hori] You couldn’t
ask for a better decoy.

409
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,987
‐ Akito, I will not let you die.

410
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,374
‐ [Megumi] Opening submarine
dock at 80 percent.

411
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,121
Opening underwater doors.

412
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,750
Engines ready to launch.

413
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,332
‐ All right, Ruri, take us out.

414
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,377
‐ All engines, forward thrust.

415
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,552
‐ Seven minutes?

416
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,722
How am I supposed
to keep running for
another seven minutes?

417
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,431
I’ve had it with this,
damn it, enough is enough!

418
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,932
(screams)

419
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,314
I’m sick and tired of
all these new voices!

420
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,275
(weapon blasts off)

421
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,114
‐ Whoah!

422
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,609
(machine explodes)

423
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,532
Hey, that was cool.

424
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,611
This feels like a Gekiganger
punch in that old cartoon.

425
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,947
Oh, the hell with it.
(blasts off)

426
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,783
Okay, you lizards, you
want a piece of me?

427
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,448
Come and get it!
(laughs)

428
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,498
And that!

429
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,455
‐ Hey, I’m actually not too bad

430
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,670
at this pilot stuff after all.

431
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,462
But what’s the difference?

432
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,424
Gah!

433
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,303
(missiles launching)

434
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,097
(screams)
What now?

435
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,347
(missiles exploding)

436
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,520
(screams)

437
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,529
(adventurous music)

438
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,049
‐ [Yurika] I’m sorry we
kept you waiting, Akito.

439
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,763
‐ What do you mean, it hasn’t
been 10 minutes yet, has it?

440
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,552
‐ I rushed the
schedule for your sake.

441
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,758
‐ [Megumi] Enemy units are now

442
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,345
within our effective
range of fire.

443
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,430
‐ [Yurika] All right,
let’s fry some bad guys.

444
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,397
Fire!
(laser beams firing)

445
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,024
‐ Whoah!

446
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,768
‐ [Admiral] Situation
report, Miss Hoshino.

447
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,278
‐ All of the enemy
were destroyed.

448
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,861
Our ground forces were hit
heavily, but only five deaths

449
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,448
have been reported.
‐ Only five?

450
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,622
It’s just luck, a coincidence.

451
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,201
‐ Recognize her achievements.

452
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,865
Good work captain.
‐ True brilliance.

453
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,205
‐ Akito, you were really
amazing out there.

454
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,132
‐ Now, wait a second,
I didn’t come here

455
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,749
to save you or
anything like that.

456
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,127
I just came here
to see you and‐‐

457
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,632
‐ Me, you came to see me?
No.

458
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,015
I just saw this and
I came to find‐‐

459
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,341
(gasps)
‐ That picture!

460
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,506
You came all this way
to bring it back to me?

461
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,354
Oh, you’re just too good
for poor little old me.

462
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,601
‐ Will you stop, I got
a question to ask you.

463
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,065
Answer the question or shut up!

464
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,234
‐ A question, you
mean that question?

465
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,151
Are you rushing ahead?
‐ No, not that.

466
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,270
Yes, of course, I know you
didn’t mean it like that.

467
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,819
First we’ll have to spend
a lot of time together‐‐

468
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,860
‐ I’m a little worried
about the future here.

469
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,784
‐ At least it looks like
it’ll be interesting.

470
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,994
‐ I want my Gekiganger
back, fry boy!

471
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,243
‐ Will someone listen to me!

472
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,577
‐ But, Akito, I
already know exactly

473
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,870
how you’re feeling right now.

474
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,413
‐ [Akito] That’s the
whole reason you found me!

475
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,667
‐ They’re idiots.

476
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,869
‐ You want to know
what I’m thinking?

477
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,628
The truth is that I‐‐
‐ [Yurika] Love me?

478
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,592
‐ [Akito] No!

479
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,209
‐ [Yurika] But I
love you so bad.

480
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,916
‐ [Akito] Why don’t you listen
to someone else for a change!

481
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,970
(singing in Japanese)

482
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,742
‐ [Narrator] Fire the
cannons, bring the alarms.

483
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,992
The fighting Nadesco
has set sail,

484
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,994
but know the hands of
evil are attempting

485
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,827
to grab the wings of
our beloved Nadesco.

486
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,624
Why must brother fight brother?

487
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,205
Why must a beautiful
captain hold back her tears

488
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,673
in the face of cruel fate
and a dramatic separation?

489
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,552
It’s a barrage of breathtaking,
suspenseful moments

490
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,172
as the Nadesco departs
on her maiden voyage.

491
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,179
Don’t miss the next
thrilling episode.

492
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,010
Leave the blue onto me.
