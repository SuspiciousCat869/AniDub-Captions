1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,814
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] The
Nadesico continues to fight on.

2
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,275
It’s strange, but whether
they like it or not,

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,566
everyone seems to think

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,190
that the only way
to stop the fighting

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,025
is to keep on fighting.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,530
But just how much longer
will we have to fight?

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,865
Nobody knows.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,775
(dramatic music)

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,850
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,418
(water rushing)

11
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,136
That same dream again.

12
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,849
(beeping)

13
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,727
As I said, the Nadesico
continues to fight on,

14
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,525
and nobody knows
when it will all end.

15
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,658
(sighs)

16
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,999
‐ This sucks.

17
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,923
Will the fighting never end?

18
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,787
‐ [Ruri Voiceover]
In my spare time,

19
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,418
I’ve been reading about
the history of mankind.

20
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,426
It seems that most of
it is a history of wars.

21
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,179
More war than peace.

22
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,180
Assuming that I live to be 100,

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,812
does this mean that
90 years of my life

24
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,980
will be filled with
memories of war like these?

25
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,440
The saddest part
is that there were

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,350
no wars in the 10 years before

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,610
I came onboard the Nadesico.

28
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,361
But I don’t remember
them very well.

29
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,654
‐ Omikami, why can’t I remember?

30
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,988
(beeping)

31
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,834
Please display
all of my records.

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,213
Seven years ago, an
unidentified orphan named Ruri

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,464
was adopted by a
couple who worked

34
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,216
at a Nergal research laboratory.

35
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,718
Ruri’s foster
parents were charged

36
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,301
with training her
to be a crew member

37
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,296
of a new ship
called the Nadesico,

38
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,508
which was to be
completed in six years.

39
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,638
For the next six years,

40
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,235
she was intellectually nurtured

41
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,731
and trained for the
position of science officer.

42
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,904
At the end of this time,

43
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,190
they returned her to Nergal

44
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,983
for a large
financial settlement.

45
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,686
Yes, I remember that,
but what happened before?

46
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,027
(beeps)

47
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,572
But I still want to know.

48
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,947
(beeping)

49
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,661
The answer never changes.

50
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,576
Omikami doesn’t
know anything else.

51
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,576
And I remember so little.

52
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,877
(beeps)

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,460
What an idiot I am.

54
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,888
‐ Ruri.

55
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,429
I am your father, Ruri.

56
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,603
‐ That’s right, and I
am your mother, Ruri.

57
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,235
‐ Father, Mother.

58
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,646
‐ Ruri, I am your first teacher
of mathematics, Archimedes.

59
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,074
‐ Archimede.

60
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,775
‐ That’s Archimedes.

61
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:39,072
Pi.

62
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,283
‐ Archimedes, pi.

63
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,199
‐ Ruri, your father
is proud of you.

64
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,458
Very proud.

65
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,421
‐ That’s right, and your
mother is proud of you as well.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,670
Extremely proud.

67
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,553
‐ [Both] Hurray, hurray, hurray!

68
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,549
‐ Archimedes!

69
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,632
‐ [Both] Very good, Ruri.

70
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,679
Wonderful, Ruri.

71
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,932
You’re adorable, Ruri.

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,681
‐ [Ruri Voiceover]
Those were the first

73
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,935
words that I learned.

74
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,314
Father, mother,
Archimedes, and pi.

75
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,942
Of course, that wasn’t
pie as in apple pie,

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,610
but the numeric value of pi.

77
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,269
‐ Goodbye, students.

78
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,478
‐ Thank you, goodbye teacher.

79
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,148
‐ Hello, are you ready
for your Japanese lesson?

80
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,528
This’ll be lesson
six for Hiragana.

81
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,527
Today we’re going to learn

82
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,828
some new words beginning
with the symbol for E,

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,830
words beginning with
the symbol for row,

84
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,002
and words beginning with
the symbol for ban‐ha.

85
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:31,911
Are you ready?

86
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,918
‐ May I ask a question, sensei?

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
‐ Yes, what is your
question, Miss Ruri?

88
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,173
‐ What’s the meaning
of this word?

89
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,046
Baka.

90
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,011
‐ It means idiot
and it is not a word

91
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,803
that should be used
in everyday life.

92
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,846
‐ Idiot?

93
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,892
‐ I am Einstein, and
I will be your teacher

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,885
for advanced quantum mechanics.

95
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,977
‐ Einstein, E equals MC squared.

96
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,902
Am I right?

97
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,311
‐ [Both] Very good, Ruri.

98
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,478
Wonderful, Ruri.

99
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,186
You’re adorable, Ruri.

100
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,987
‐ Idiots.

101
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,113
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] I
do remember having some

102
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,367
friends to play with.

103
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,715
(whining)

104
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,502
I had human friends as well.

105
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,706
They were the children
I studied with.

106
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,416
We all seemed very much alike,

107
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,178
except at night, when
the dreams would come.

108
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,179
That’s when I felt
very different.

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,514
‐ Father, Mother.

110
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,394
Papa, Mama.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,230
‐ Thank you, Mama.

112
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,232
(laughs)

113
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,699
‐ Huh?

114
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,533
(rushing water)

115
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,335
‐ [Ruri Voiceover]
That dream again.

116
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:05,968
‐ Hello, Ruri.

117
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,262
‐ Hello.

118
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,045
‐ Could you please
come to the bridge

119
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,296
as soon as possible?

120
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,929
‐ Why, are we under attack?

121
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,104
‐ Well actually, no.

122
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,812
There’s someone here to see you.

123
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,104
‐ Somebody to see me?

124
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,271
What is Peace Land?

125
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,939
‐ Peace Land is a
very unusual country.

126
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,487
‐ Peace Land is a
nation that is similar

127
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,072
to Switzerland in that
it is permanently neutral

128
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,696
in all Earth politics.

129
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,833
It began as a theme park

130
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,451
but now is a kingdom ruled by

131
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,695
the great grandson of
the original owner.

132
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,708
‐ Yes, I remember going there

133
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,289
when I was just a kid.

134
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,634
‐ It’s more than just an
amusement park for children.

135
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,129
Peace Land also has
legalized gambling.

136
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,302
That makes it the ideal
vacation spot for all ages.

137
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,302
More importantly,
they also maintain

138
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,474
the world’s most
discrete banking system,

139
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,934
which specializes
in money laundering.

140
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,723
That makes it very
popular with people

141
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,307
who need to hide extra income

142
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,852
in order to avoid paying taxes.

143
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,228
‐ You mean people like Nergal.

144
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,482
‐ Well, let’s just say that
the Peace Bank and Nergal

145
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,324
have had a few dealings
over the years.

146
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,491
‐ [Yurika] Then
why are they here?

147
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,990
Does someone onboard
have an account

148
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,570
in the Peace Land Bank?

149
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,955
‐ All I know is that they
asked for young Ruri here.

150
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,992
‐ But I don’t have an account
in the Peace Land Bank.

151
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:13,988
‐ Well whatever the case,

152
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,829
it’s prudent not to anger them.

153
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,922
The financial world revolves
around its banking practices.

154
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,709
So let’s all be on
our best behavior.

155
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,804
(soft music)

156
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,019
‐ I bring you an urgent
message, Princess Ruri.

157
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,523
‐ [Both] Princess?

158
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,232
‐ Yes, our King and
Queen spent many years

159
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,185
attempting to be
blessed with children.

160
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,225
Finally, they resorted
to a procedure

161
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,109
at a famous fertility clinic.

162
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,864
‐ You mean a test tube
fertilization, correct?

163
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,947
‐ Yes.

164
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,532
They longed desperately
for an heir.

165
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,446
Unfortunately, no
sooner had they returned

166
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,155
from making their first deposits

167
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,035
than they received word
that a band of terrorists

168
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,754
had blown up the clinic.

169
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,334
The vial containing
Your Royal Highness

170
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,787
was lost among the debris,

171
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,047
and we have been searching
for you ever since.

172
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,921
‐ But I was raised as an orphan.

173
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,548
‐ Yes, we are all aware of that.

174
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,005
But there is absolutely
no doubt in our minds

175
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,184
that you are the
missing royal zygote.

176
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,224
Although the Queen has
produced other heirs,

177
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,138
you are still Peace
Land’s princess.

178
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,846
‐ Then the King and
Queen are my parents.

179
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,307
Mother, Father.

180
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,530
How can I be a princess?

181
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,544
Omikami, I need a full
readout on princesses.

182
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,959
(speaking in foreign languages)

183
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,087
This is going to be too painful.

184
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,751
Start over, eliminating
anime characters.

185
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,224
(soft music)

186
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,605
‐ But why?

187
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,970
It’s not fair.

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,639
‐ Well, someone has to take her.

189
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,727
‐ That’s right, and please
watch her carefully.

190
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,771
We want to keep the
princess out of trouble.

191
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,395
‐ [Akito] I’ll do my best.

192
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,281
‐ But why, how come?

193
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,110
‐ In times of war,
a figure of state

194
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,154
should never be
allowed to travel

195
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,278
without an armed bodyguard.

196
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,534
‐ I know that.

197
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,025
But why does it
have to be Akito?

198
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,578
‐ So why did you pick me?

199
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,451
‐ Apparently princesses
aren’t supposed

200
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,959
to travel without a
knight to accompany them.

201
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:24,832
‐ Oh.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,630
Did you read about that
in the computer files?

203
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,800
‐ [Ruri] Yes, I also
watched some videos.

204
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,337
(soft music)

205
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,035
‐ Oh Ruri, my dear child.

206
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,571
How long we have searched.

207
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,992
Thank the stars we found you.

208
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,913
‐ You’re my father?

209
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,160
‐ That’s right, I am
your papa, dear daughter.

210
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,995
And this is your mama.

211
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,288
‐ Oh, you’ve grown up to
be such a wonderful girl.

212
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:09,172
‐ And these are your
adoring little brothers.

213
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,132
‐ [Everyone] Welcome,
Princess Ruri.

214
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,672
Our dearest older sister.

215
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,007
(groans)

216
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,345
‐ This isn’t the place.

217
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,889
‐ We are all
together now at last.

218
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,184
And now you can stay and
be with us all you want.

219
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,347
(sighs)

220
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,686
‐ Father, can I request a favor?

221
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,441
‐ What is it you wish, my child?

222
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,437
‐ Time to think.

223
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,685
I would like some time.

224
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,699
(dramatic music)

225
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,042
(soft music)

226
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,594
‐ How much more shopping are
you going to do, Princess?

227
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,843
‐ I’ve got spanners
for Mr. Uri Pataki,

228
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,634
spices for Ms. Houmei,
a teddy bear for Miss‐‐

229
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,048
(groans)

230
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,638
(soft music)

231
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,480
‐ Whoa.

232
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,356
(speaks in foreign language)

233
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,653
‐ Pizza, it’s the
greatest of all

234
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,396
Peace Land’s native dishes.

235
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,238
‐ How can you call
it a native dish

236
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,826
when it was created in‐‐

237
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,039
‐ In Naples, in Italy.

238
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,579
(groans)

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,294
Everything in Peace Land
is borrowed from elsewhere.

240
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,424
‐ Why don’t you try
it and then you can

241
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,130
open your big mouth?

242
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,092
Try it, you’ll like it.

243
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,381
I guarantee.

244
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,422
‐ We’ll try.

245
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,472
‐ So what do you think
of our house specialty?

246
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,427
‐ Hey, well, I grew up on Mars,

247
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,814
so I can’t say for sure but‐‐

248
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,062
‐ It’s bad.

249
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,431
‐ Huh?

250
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,098
‐ It’s very bad.

251
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,518
In fact, it’s horrible.

252
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,444
‐ Huh, what did you say?

253
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,023
‐ He’s getting angry.

254
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,778
‐ You’ve used cheap olive oil,

255
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,529
the peppers, flour,
and mozzarella cheese

256
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,361
are all of mediocre quality,

257
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,816
the tomatoes weren’t ripe,

258
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,278
to compensate
you’ve over applied

259
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,616
cheap spices with the result

260
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,662
being a foul tasting mess.

261
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,956
‐ Is this new martian girl
brat gonna cuss on my cooking?

262
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,119
‐ It shouldn’t matter if
we’re from Mars or Jupiter.

263
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,330
Any rational human being

264
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,749
would find this pizza terrible,

265
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,496
unless they had no taste buds.

266
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,589
I won’t even mention the
carcinogens in the sausage.

267
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,934
‐ Where do you get your balls

268
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,259
to talk to me like that?

269
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,513
I’ll kill you.
‐ Hold it.

270
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,926
Leave her alone, you
lousy pasta maker.

271
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,063
(groans)

272
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,852
‐ Mr. Tenkawa.

273
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,147
(groaning)

274
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,148
‐ That ought to teach
you, martian food critic.

275
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,565
(groaning)

276
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,414
‐ Master.

277
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,621
‐ Our mentor.

278
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,451
‐ Our teacher.
‐ Muscle man.

279
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,405
‐ You got some nerve,

280
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,084
whacking on him like that.

281
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,333
‐ If he didn’t want to fight,

282
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,544
he shouldn’t have
thrown the first punch.

283
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,825
‐ Why you little‐‐

284
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,326
‐ Back off and
leave the kid alone.

285
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,540
I’m warning you.

286
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,549
‐ Trying to be her
knight in shining armor.

287
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,421
You’ve got some meatballs.

288
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,716
(yelling)

289
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,260
‐ Oh man, if I just wanted
to get into a fight,

290
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,848
I could’ve stayed home.

291
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,522
Who named this place Peace Land?

292
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,152
‐ It was all my fault.

293
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,649
I’m sorry you were hurt.

294
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,191
‐ Ruri, protecting the princess

295
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,027
is what a knight does.

296
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,660
Of course, I didn’t do very
well at that, now did I?

297
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,529
But that sure was some
nasty tasting pizza.

298
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,489
‐ [Ruri] Yes, it really was.

299
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,747
(roaring)

300
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,423
‐ A fjord in Scandinavia?

301
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,541
What do you want
to go there for?

302
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,298
‐ There’s a school up there.

303
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,749
My father said that’s where

304
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,420
his investigators discovered
that I had been brought up.

305
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,549
I’m looking for the
people who raised me.

306
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,057
(roaring)

307
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,889
‐ Wow, what a junk heap.

308
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,188
Where are you going?

309
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,714
(soft music)

310
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,673
‐ You must be Miss Ruri.

311
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,465
The King of Peace
Land sent me a message

312
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,801
that you would be coming here.

313
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,596
‐ I was looking for my parents.

314
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,889
‐ Your parents?

315
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,312
Now I see.

316
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,272
I’ll tell you what I know.

317
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,980
After the bombing, many
vials of unidentifiable

318
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,481
fertilized eggs were
brought to this facility.

319
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,397
Most of them were already dead,

320
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,784
but my associates and I decided

321
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,530
that those that had survived

322
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,663
had earned the right to live.

323
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,869
However, to justify the cost,

324
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,491
we had to use them
as test subjects.

325
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,039
‐ Test subjects?

326
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,792
‐ We believed that by
altering just a few genes,

327
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,793
we could improve
their viability.

328
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,751
‐ I thought that genetic
manipulation on humans

329
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,086
was against the law.

330
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,381
‐ There are always
those too backwards

331
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,167
to see the chosen path.

332
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,180
Genetic splicing promised
advanced intelligence.

333
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,141
Bodies free of disease,

334
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,471
able rigors of space travel.

335
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,847
We knew these things
were outlawed,

336
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,885
but we believed the gains
were worth the risks.

337
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,070
That is why we came to this
hidden spot in the wilderness.

338
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,031
Here where the air is clean
and the water untainted,

339
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,860
we could raise our
perfect children.

340
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,868
This school is where
we educated them.

341
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,580
Utilizing new
techniques to let them

342
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
absorb information in new ways.

343
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,787
‐ In other words, you
experimented on us.

344
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,882
‐ Humans learn too many
unnecessary things.

345
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,379
We only taught our children

346
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,630
what they needed to know.

347
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,551
We kept them from
wasting their young minds

348
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,260
with sports and games.

349
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,882
And you’re the result, Ruri.

350
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,628
The glorious culmination.

351
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,428
At your young age, for
all practical purposes,

352
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,645
you control the Nadesico.

353
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,063
Clearly, you are superior.

354
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,602
I am so proud of
what you’ve become.

355
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,018
‐ And what of the
other children?

356
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,896
‐ It’s very tragic,
but failures do happen.

357
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,204
Our teaching methods were banned
years ago because of that.

358
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,159
This institute has been
abandoned for years.

359
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320
But you succeeded.

360
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,448
You proved our theories work.

361
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,737
For that, I thank you.

362
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,829
Now then, when you were four,

363
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,963
a man from Nergal came

364
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,081
and left a deposit
for your schooling.

365
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,879
I placed the money
in a savings account.

366
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,762
With that card, you will be able

367
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
to withdraw money
from an account

368
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,684
in the Peace Bank
whenever you like.

369
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,430
Of course, since
you’re now a princess,

370
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,812
you may never need to use it,

371
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,600
but a young girl can never have

372
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,434
too much spending
money, can she?

373
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,440
‐ And what about my parents?

374
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,563
‐ Hmm?

375
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,437
Oh, is this what you mean?

376
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,607
‐ [Man] Ruri.

377
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,365
I am your father, Ruri.

378
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,407
‐ [Woman] That’s right,
and I am your mother, Ruri.

379
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,618
‐ [Both] Very good, Ruri.

380
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,623
Wonderful, Ruri.

381
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,826
You’re adorable, Ruri.

382
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,669
‐ We knew our children
would need special parents.

383
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,634
‐ [Both] Hurray, hurray.

384
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,634
‐ Parents who would never scold

385
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,716
or traumatize our children.

386
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,799
Real people could
never fit the bill.

387
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,105
(soft music)

388
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,807
‐ [Ruri] Thank you
for letting me live.

389
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,518
‐ It wasn’t a hard thing to do.

390
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,490
‐ However, as for everything
else that you did to me‐‐

391
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,490
‐ Huh?

392
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,491
(gasps)

393
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,829
‐ If you want that
money, you can have it.

394
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:31,922
Idiot.

395
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,762
(trickling water)

396
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,016
(gasps)

397
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,885
(rushing water)

398
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,031
‐ Ruri, wait.

399
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,490
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] That
sound, that’s the sound.

400
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,334
(trickling water)

401
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,498
(rushing water)

402
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,008
(groaning)

403
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,346
(rushing water)

404
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,394
‐ Oh wow.

405
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,234
Schools of salmon.

406
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,185
(rushing water)

407
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,111
They’re beautiful.

408
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,896
I’ve never seen
live ones before.

409
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,124
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] And so,
like a salmon returning

410
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,543
to the stream in
which it was spawned,

411
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,080
I went back to the Nadesico

412
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,915
and her complemented
idiots and fools.

413
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,095
(rushing water)

414
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,094
(singing in foreign language)

415
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,115
‐ As a child, I was in
love with the stars.

416
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,243
My idols were Lindbergh,
Gregorian, Glen, and Armstrong.

417
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,741
It’s been a long time since then

418
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,073
and I’ve come a long way.

419
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,157
I’ve achieved my dream
and flown in space.

420
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,453
But what I’ve never dared to do

421
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,536
is put my trust in
another human being.

422
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,583
Not until now.

423
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,334
But my sky blue eyes will change

424
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,825
to the color of the
darkest ocean depths

425
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,247
if I was to learn
I was being played

426
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,995
for a fool by someone I trusted.

427
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,957
The next episode of Martian
Successor Nadesico is

428
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,167
You’re The Next Captain
of the Nadesico.

429
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,048
Don’t you dare miss it, okay?

430
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,046
It’s gonna be very dramatic.
