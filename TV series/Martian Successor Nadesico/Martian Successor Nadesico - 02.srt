1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,265
‐ [Yurika] It’s been one year

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,850
since the Jovians attacked
Mars and the earth.

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,517
Mars was conquered
immediately and since then,

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,825
the united forces have
been so ineffective

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,609
in defending the Earth that
Nergal Heavy Industries,

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,363
a civilian contractor,
decided to build

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,276
its own space battleship.

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,665
Hmm, I think that sums it up.

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,002
(upbeat techno music)

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,759
(singing in foreign language)

11
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,286
‐ [Man] A civilian battleship
at a time like this?

12
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,420
‐ [Man] What are those
madmen at Nargal up to?

13
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,375
‐ [Man] It’s unacceptable
for such a powerful ship

14
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,256
to be left in civilian hands.

15
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,513
Admiral Misumaru, I
understand that the captain

16
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,927
of that ship is your daughter.

17
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,433
‐ [Man] Of course, if the
captain of the Nadesico

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,144
were to make a request to
join the united forces,

19
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,135
‐ [Man] We would be
quite willing to accept.

20
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,309
‐ [Man] If she does
not offer it, however.

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,147
‐ Orders Admiral?

22
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,611
‐ Prepare to launch immediately.

23
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,992
Our target is the
battleship Nadesico.

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,157
(alarm blaring)

25
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,281
‐ [Yurika] Not that I
really care, but who named

26
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,827
the ship The Nadesico?

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,829
‐ Take your time, yes that’s it.

28
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,745
Darn it, what the
heck are you doing?

29
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,793
‐ So what are you gonna
do with me, Mr. Hoary?

30
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,667
‐ Well you’ve done a few
things that we’re not

31
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,804
happy about, like
taking that robot out

32
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,381
without any training.

33
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,838
However, will you shut up?!

34
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,888
‐ Hey, you can’t let
him get off so easily

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,312
after he stole what should’ve
been my starring moment!

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,810
‐ [Hoary] At least he
didn’t break his own leg.

37
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,142
‐ Well he’s rude too!

38
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,147
And you heard the way he
talked to the captain.

39
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,059
He’s just bad news
waiting to happen.

40
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,859
‐ We’ll need you to stand
by as a back up pilot

41
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,362
until the other pilots arrive.

42
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,575
At least you’ll be paid
more than a cook that way.

43
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,066
‐ But I am a cook, Mr. Hoary.

44
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,988
What’s wrong with
being what I am?

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,908
‐ [Man] We have the
Nadasico on our scope, sir.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,957
But we can’t determine
what their destination is.

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,629
‐ Make sure they don’t
spot us with their radar.

48
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,749
‐ [Man] There’s a
Jovian Chulip ahead

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,376
but it seems to be inactive.

50
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,923
‐ So it seems.

51
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,466
The Tobiume will surface
but the rest of the fleet

52
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,049
will remain submerged.

53
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,835
What are you up to, Yurika?

54
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,967
What does my brilliant
and well endowed

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,264
daughter thinking of?

56
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,484
(giggling)

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
(knocking on door)

58
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,555
‐ Akito?

59
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,558
Akito?

60
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,365
Hmm.

61
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,487
Maybe the reason Akito
has been acting so shy

62
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,069
is because I’m the captain
and he’s just a pilot.

63
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,783
‐ Hold on.

64
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,117
I’m coming already, okay?

65
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,583
Just give me a second to‐‐

66
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,042
‐ Oh don’t worry.

67
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,922
As the captain, I have a
master key for every room.

68
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,297
‐ Yurika!

69
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,473
(screaming)

70
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,014
‐ These people are idiots.

71
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,562
‐ At least I know
you’ve grown up

72
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,519
to be a healthy young man,

73
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,019
so I’ll forgive you this time.

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,690
‐ You’ll forgive me?

75
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,269
You’re the one who
barged in, Yurika.

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,015
‐ Oh good, you’re still
willing to call me Yurika

77
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,605
even though I’m
your captain now.

78
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,072
‐ Huh?

79
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,280
‐ Don’t you remember how
you used to chase me around

80
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,899
yelling Yurika, Yurika
everywhere we went?

81
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,526
‐ [Akito] Well actually ...

82
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,823
‐ Akito!

83
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,027
Akito!

84
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,275
Please wait for me, Akito.

85
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,447
(sobbing)

86
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,791
You’re so rude, Akito.

87
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,122
‐ Now that’s how I
remember it being.

88
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,458
‐ Are you really sure?

89
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,754
Well, no bother.

90
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,745
I’m just glad I found you again.

91
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,797
I tried to call
you but I can never

92
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,473
get through to your number.

93
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,429
And then my father told
me that your entire family

94
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,550
had been killed in the
freak accident on Mars,

95
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,717
I was so sad.

96
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,766
But you weren’t
killed, were you?

97
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,559
How long have you been on Earth?

98
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,563
‐ I don’t believe you!
‐ Huh?

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,110
What is it?

100
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,019
Why are you angry at me?

101
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,609
Please talk to me, Akito.

102
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,443
Akito!

103
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,318
Please, Akito.

104
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,701
Oh come on, Akito.

105
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,953
Akito, Akito.

106
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,282
I said listen to me!

107
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,204
‐ Aw, hey!

108
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,329
What’d you do that for?

109
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,463
‐ Because you kept ignoring me.

110
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,420
Why won’t you tell
me what happened?

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,580
Why are you so mad?

112
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,998
You’ve got to tell me,
Akito, pretty please?

113
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,261
‐ All right, I’ll tell
you what happened.

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,839
But before that, empty cans‐‐

115
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,717
‐ Go in the recycling bin.

116
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,966
‐ My father and
mother were murdered.

117
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,267
They were killed on the same day

118
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,692
your family left Mars, Yurika.

119
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,023
Do you remember
how you begged me

120
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,067
to come see you
off the space port?

121
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,069
(sobbing)

122
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,335
(somber music)

123
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,035
(loud explosion)

124
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,416
(panting)

125
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,639
(fire raging)

126
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,180
(glass breaking)

127
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,227
I just wanna know
the truth, Yurika.

128
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,527
Who killed my parents and
why, that’s why I’m here.

129
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,111
And I swear that
if or your father

130
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,487
had anything to do
with it, I’ll kill you.

131
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,034
‐ You’d kill me?

132
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,197
You’d really kill me?

133
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,452
‐ I’ll kill you with love.

134
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,330
‐ Oh, slay me!

135
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,084
(giggling)

136
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,667
Oh my gosh, it’s just
like one of those

137
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,211
hardcore detective novels.

138
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,554
‐ I’m Akito Tenkawa, fry cook.

139
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,919
Reporting for duty.

140
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,555
I humbly submit my services.

141
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,592
‐ Welcome, Akito.

142
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,643
‐ Akito.

143
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,351
‐ Captain, please
report to the bridge.

144
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,680
Mr. Prospector wants to
make an announcement.

145
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,976
‐ Announcement?

146
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,850
‐ The reason why we’ve
kept the Nadesico’s

147
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,186
destination a
secret up until now

148
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,231
is because we
needed to keep those

149
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,945
who might wish to sabotage
our mission off guard.

150
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,198
The truth is it’s part
of Project Scaporeli

151
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,109
that Nadesico will
not be working

152
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,777
with the Earth’s
military at all.

153
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,078
‐ Scapareli?

154
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,829
‐ The Nadesico’s
destination is Mars.

155
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,584
‐ What?
‐ Hey get back to work!

156
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,585
‐ This is great.

157
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,076
I’m going back to Mars!

158
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,246
‐ You can’t really be saying

159
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,626
we’re going to
ignore the invaders

160
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,092
who are attacking
the Earth, can you?

161
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,802
‐ Have you forgotten
that there were

162
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,632
millions of settlers on
both the moon and Mars

163
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,598
that the United Forces
completely abandoned?

164
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,310
What’s become of all those
resources and people?

165
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,141
‐ They’re probably dead by now.

166
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,476
‐ Well perhaps.

167
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,940
But I think it’s
worse finding out‐‐

168
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,100
‐ You’ll do no such
thing, traitor!

169
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,229
(screaming)

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,318
‐ Have you took a
leave of your senses?

171
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,161
‐ No, Admiral.

172
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,119
I’m taking command of this ship.

173
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,989
‐ What do you hope
to achieve by this?

174
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,118
‐ I get it, you’re all
spies from Jupiter!

175
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,834
‐ Don’t forget who’s
in charge here,

176
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,417
and here’s my back up.

177
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,762
‐ This is Admiral Misumaru.

178
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,721
Commander of the 3rd
Fleet United Space Forces.

179
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,305
‐ It’s my father.
‐ Huh?

180
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,138
‐ All right, daddy, just
what is this all about?

181
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,103
‐ How are you, Yurika dear?
‐ Fine.

182
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,144
‐ I’m sorry, but this is my job.

183
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,018
Daddy’s not happy
about this either.

184
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,687
‐ This is very distressing.

185
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,733
You know we had an agreement
with United Forces, Admiral.

186
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,990
The UF knew the Nadesico was
intended for private use.

187
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,741
‐ We need weapons
that are effective

188
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,205
against the Jovian lizards.

189
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,294
Did you really think we
would let you keep this ship?

190
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,539
‐ Oh, very well stated,
Admiral Misumaru.

191
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,293
This calls for negotiations,
so we’ll be right on over.

192
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,504
‐ We’ll negotiate
if you bring both

193
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,555
the captain and her
master key to us.

194
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,345
‐ Oh boy.

195
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,723
‐ No, Captain, you can’t
abandon your ship like that!

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,890
‐ Yurika, what the
Admiral says makes sense.

197
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,261
What’s the point of setting
a ship like this to Mars?

198
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,848
‐ You’re not military
personnel, Yurika.

199
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,432
You don’t have to obey them.

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,939
‐ Admiral Zukube, stop
filling my daughter’s head

201
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,562
with nuisance like that.

202
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,726
Yurika, sweetie, has your daddy

203
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,227
ever told you something
that wasn’t true?

204
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,569
‐ [Daimonji] No!

205
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,738
Stop, Captain!
‐ Don’t do it, Captain!

206
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,325
‐ [Daimonji] Captain,
this is a trap!

207
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,240
Don’t pull it out!

208
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,251
‐ Okay it’s out.

209
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,423
‐ Is there no justice?

210
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,344
‐ The engines will be
cutting out right about now,

211
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,585
which of course leaves
the Nadesico defenseless.

212
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,182
‐ Okay, you know the rules.

213
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,063
Now be good little
boys and girls.

214
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,770
‐ Just wait, you
blanketty blank!

215
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,101
You’ll get yours!

216
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,396
‐ Can’t believe that
our dreams of freedom

217
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,939
lasted less than a day.

218
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,364
‐ Don’t give up already.

219
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,860
Where there’s light,
there’s hope, you know!

220
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,442
‐ Oh yeah, sure.

221
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,447
‐ I want all of you
to keep hope up!

222
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,699
Evil never wins!
‐ I’m so disappointed.

223
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,990
I was hoping to meet
some dashing pilots

224
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,125
and have some great
adventures on this battleship.

225
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,079
‐ Well, life’s
disappointing that way.

226
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,250
‐ You know, Mr.
Prospector sure hired

227
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,789
some strange people.

228
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,294
I wonder if he really can
do anything to help us.

229
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,345
He doesn’t seem very reliable.

230
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,340
‐ As an actress, you
should know not to judge

231
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,342
a film by its poster, Megumi.

232
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,634
You never know.

233
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
‐ Hey, why are you guys
acting so depressed?

234
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,098
Come on!

235
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,139
I’ll show you a
video that’s sure

236
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,894
to chase those
blue meanies away!

237
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,435
‐ Hey, Akito, that
crazy pilot said

238
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,479
he’s gonna show us something.

239
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,114
Some kind of video, I guess.

240
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,400
‐ Whoa!

241
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,067
‐ I’ve never tried to
hook something this old

242
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,783
and archaic up to
a modern TV before,

243
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,703
but since I’ve got
nothing better to do

244
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,993
I’ll even help you.
‐ Fantastic!

245
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,907
Now watch and be amazed.

246
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,874
Inserting disc!

247
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,326
Switching unit on!

248
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,377
‐ Whoa!

249
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,796
(dramatic music)

250
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,385
(dramatic music)

251
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:28,806
‐ Just what is this?

252
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,477
‐ Thclassic, Geki Gengar 3!

253
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,436
39 episodes of thrills, chills,
and high running emotions.

254
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,988
‐ But this isn’t the opening
animation that I remember.

255
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,412
‐ That’s right!

256
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,952
This original opening was
replaced by the classic one

257
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,794
beginning with episode three!

258
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:45,866
Oh it’s you.

259
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,210
You have no right to
talk about Geki Gengar!

260
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,382
‐ You forgot your
crutch again, Hero.

261
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,585
‐ Look, I watched this
show as a kid on Mars.

262
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,344
‐ If that’s so, then
why don’t you wanna be

263
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,184
a giant robot pilot
instead of a damn cook?

264
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,970
‐ What’s wrong
with being a cook?

265
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,314
(growling)

266
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,059
‐ [Presenter] Invincible
Geki Gengar takes off!

267
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,982
(cheering)

268
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,021
‐ Idiots.

269
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,074
‐ Where have June and
the others gone to?

270
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,651
‐ Don’t worry.

271
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,194
I say it looks to me like
you’ve lost some weight.

272
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,068
‐ It’s only been two days
since I saw you last, Daddy.

273
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,526
‐ Well, setting all that aside,

274
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,986
you must be very hungry
after all this excitement.

275
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,117
We’ve got strawberry shortcake,
double chocolate cake,

276
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,826
and even cheese cake.

277
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,925
Go ahead, try some.
‐ Tell me, Daddy.

278
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,212
Do you remember a boy
named Akito Tenkawa?

279
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,714
‐ Tenkawa?

280
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,206
No, I don’t know that name.

281
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,428
‐ Remember, he lived
next door to us on Mars.

282
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,469
‐ On Mars?

283
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,433
‐ Yes, but I just met him again.

284
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,142
‐ Today you’ve won, Geki Gengar.

285
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,768
Now finish me off!

286
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,732
‐ Ken, don’t!

287
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,152
Don’t kill my brother, Rokuro!

288
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,113
Please don’t do it, Ken!

289
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,613
‐ Ken!
‐ No, Ken!

290
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,735
‐ Isn’t the suspense
here incredible?

291
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,280
‐ It’s predictable but still‐‐
‐ Shut up!

292
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,374
Can’t you just enjoy
it for what it is?

293
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:03,619
‐ I’ll do that.

294
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,196
Enjoy it for what it is.

295
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,498
‐ I hate you, Geki Gangar!

296
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,377
‐ They were murdered?
‐ That’s right.

297
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,419
Do you know anything about
what happened, Daddy?

298
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,462
‐ [Misumaru] There
must be some mistake.

299
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,626
I thought it was very
clear that the Tenkawas

300
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,555
died in an accident.

301
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,972
‐ Well, we’re back.

302
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,800
‐ [Misumaru] And did you
talk to your superiors?

303
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,297
‐ Yes, and we discussed the
whole issue at great length.

304
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,008
‐ And?
‐ And we decided

305
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,430
that the Nadesico is
still private property

306
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,437
and we cannot condone
this act of piracy.

307
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,811
‐ Geki Gengar punch!

308
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,069
Geki Gengar cutting!

309
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,651
Geki Gengar beam!

310
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,317
This world is our home.

311
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,907
‐ The blue planet Earth.
‐ We will protect it!

312
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,411
‐ These guys are a little
over the top, aren’t they?

313
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,833
‐ Do they yell
everything because

314
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,083
they’re using voice
activated weapons?

315
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,504
‐ No, no, can’t you see
the poetry involved?

316
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,463
It’s about guts and glory
and courage and all that.

317
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,344
Come on, everybody.

318
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,091
Doesn’t this intense
situation get to you?

319
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,973
A secret base overthrown.

320
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,470
A military conspiracy.

321
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,341
Can’t you see how the
surviving children

322
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,558
would rise up and
resolve the situation

323
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,180
with their own sweat and blood?

324
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,597
Aren’t you inspired?

325
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,683
‐ What children is
he talking about?

326
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,688
‐ The Nadesico won’t
be able to move

327
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,351
until the captain comes back.

328
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,148
‐ [Daigoji] Kids can
overcome the odds.

329
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,571
What’s wrong with everyone here?

330
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,611
This is the situation that
screams out for drama.

331
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,699
‐ Okay, I’ll take off
in one of the robots

332
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,826
and bring the Captain
back to the ship.

333
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,292
‐ Huh?

334
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,122
‐ I wanna help the
people on Mars.

335
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,997
The United Forces only
wants to protect themselves

336
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,385
but there are other
people out there,

337
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,923
people depending on us.

338
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,836
I’m willing to fight for
something I believe in.

339
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:42,673
Are you?

340
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,217
Isn’t that why we’re all here?

341
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,140
(loud explosion)

342
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,815
‐ The Chulip is attacking?

343
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,475
‐ The frigates Panzy
and Crokus are caught

344
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,113
in its tractor beams, Admiral.

345
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,022
‐ Drat it!

346
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,228
It was playing possum!

347
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,583
Ready the Nadesico for action.

348
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,252
All right, Yurika, I
need that master key now.

349
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,123
Where did she go?

350
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,255
‐ [Yurika] I’m
right here, father.

351
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,245
‐ Yurika!

352
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,126
‐ I’ll ask you one more time,

353
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,924
whatTenkawa’s parents?

354
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,838
‐ Yurika, is this the time
for something like this?

355
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,179
‐ This happens to be
very important to me.

356
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,431
‐ [Soldier] Sir, the
Chulip is changing course.

357
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,815
‐ I want the truth, Daddy.

358
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,851
You’ve been lying
to me, haven’t you?

359
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,933
‐ Yurika.

360
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,977
I may have kept some of
the more heartbreaking

361
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,233
details from you,

362
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,192
but anyway omitting the truth
isn’t the same as lying.

363
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,324
‐ I understand that.

364
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:42,612
Let’s go.
‐ What?

365
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,282
(loud buzzing)

366
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,323
Stop, Yurika.

367
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,698
Where do you think you’re going?

368
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,622
‐ The Nadesico, of course.
‐ The what?

369
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,121
‐ Wait, Yurika.

370
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,334
Weren’t you going to surrender
the ship to the Admiral?

371
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,835
‐ Of course not.

372
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,206
I only came to find out what
happened to Akito’s parents.

373
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,252
‐ Yurika!

374
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,714
‐ Father, you ought to
know that no captain

375
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,245
would ever surrender
a ship to someone

376
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,838
she knows has lied to her.

377
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,795
You were the one that taught
me that lesson, remember?

378
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,225
And besides there’s
someone very special

379
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,264
to me on the Nadesico.

380
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,096
‐ No!

381
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,644
‐ All right, I’m ready to go.

382
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,726
‐ Follow Mari’s instructions.

383
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,560
‐ [Mari] We’re going
for a manual launch.

384
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,055
We don’t know what will happen.

385
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,817
You better evacuate.

386
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,029
‐ Hey, did I just see
you smiling just now?

387
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,151
‐ Possibly?

388
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,697
I guess that means that
we’re all idiots here.

389
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:33,994
‐ Victory!

390
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,294
‐ I’m coming back now.

391
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,910
Please ready the landing deck.

392
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,827
‐ They’ve taken the right
hangar that can launch‐‐

393
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,337
‐ Just surrender.
‐ No, no!

394
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,591
‐ Why, Miss Howmei.

395
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,011
‐ Just stirring up trouble.

396
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,341
‐ Ready to launch!

397
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,718
‐ On your mark.

398
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,854
Prepare for manual launch.

399
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,350
Go.

400
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,351
So a manual launch means he
just runs out of a hangar bay?

401
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,852
‐ Wait a minute!
‐ Let’s go!

402
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,018
‐ That’s the same giant robot!

403
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,356
(screaming)

404
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,451
‐ Right, jump, jump!

405
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:10,700
Go!

406
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,743
I’m off!

407
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,371
‐ [Uribatake]
Didn’t you hear me?

408
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,996
That unit’s still configured
for land based engagement!

409
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,294
(screaming)

410
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,376
‐ Come on, fly, will you?

411
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,217
I said fly!

412
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,401
‐ Akito, you’re going
to be my decoy again?

413
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,811
‐ Your decoy?

414
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,397
‐ Out with the Nadesico while
you draw their fire, okay?

415
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,283
‐ What?

416
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,321
Hey wait a second.

417
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,902
What the heck is that?

418
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,408
Why can’t I control this thing?

419
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,199
(screaming)

420
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,994
‐ I told you it’s still in
the land engagement mode!

421
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,458
‐ Akito, you’re risking
your life for me again?

422
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,713
‐ Wha?

423
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,752
What is that thing?

424
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,996
‐ My goodness.

425
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,667
Up down up down,
talk about energy.

426
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,876
‐ We came as fast
as we could, Minato!

427
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,062
Electrical charge normal.

428
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,429
Restarting phase
transition engine.

429
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,228
Engine’s coming back online.

430
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,310
‐ All systems nominal.

431
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,107
‐ All right, Mari, take
us full speed ahead.

432
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,859
‐ Before we do that,
Mr. Jiro Yamada

433
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,781
is asking permission
to take off.

434
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,440
‐ Yamada?
‐ Yamada?

435
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,447
‐ Gai Daigoji, I told you.

436
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,529
I’m ready to go!

437
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,784
Just say the word,
pretty please?

438
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,616
(screaming)

439
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,291
Don’t give up, kid.

440
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,499
Sorry, I kept you
waiting, partner.

441
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,462
Geki Ken win!

442
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,287
Okay, fry boy,
we’re gonna combine

443
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,587
your cockpit with
this air combat unit.

444
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,551
The call sign will
be Crosscrash.

445
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,052
‐ Do I really have to say that?

446
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,183
‐ Of course.

447
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,341
Now stop thinking and
get with the program.

448
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,720
‐ All right, Yamada.
‐ It’s Gai, you idiot!

449
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,466
‐ All right!

450
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,520
Go!

451
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,981
‐ Ten seconds to
rendezvous, here we go!

452
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,145
Crosscrash.
‐ Crosscrash.

453
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,401
‐ Oh come on, you can
do better than that.

454
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,534
Crosscrash.
‐ Crosscrash.

455
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,874
(screaming)

456
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,832
(dramatic music)

457
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,214
‐ Way to go, Akito!

458
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,129
Geki Ken flare!
‐ Geki Ken flare!

459
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,513
‐ That’s right, that’s right.

460
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,014
Here we go, boy!

461
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,142
‐ Good grief!
‐ Good grief!

462
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,195
‐ The high speed attack
using the distortion shield

463
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,268
actually worked.

464
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,983
‐ What’s a Geki
Ken flare anyway?

465
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,233
‐ Aim for the Chulip, Mari.

466
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,356
Full speed ahead.

467
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
‐ Are you serious?

468
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,570
‐ Trust me.

469
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,449
‐ [Akito] Hey, stop,
what are you doing?

470
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,032
‐ Stand by on gravity blast.
‐ Roger, Captain.

471
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,039
Gravity blast is charging.

472
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:05,875
‐ Yurika!

473
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,882
(loud explosion)

474
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,643
Using the cannons
from the inside?

475
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,222
What are on earth
was she thinking?

476
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,218
What a nut bar!

477
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,309
‐ That was cool.

478
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,187
‐ [Yurika] Prepare to
pick Akito’s Aestevalis.

479
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,981
‐ [Mari] And what
about Mr. Daigoji?

480
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,614
‐ Well, I guess we’ll
collect him too.

481
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,244
‐ [Ruri] Nice work, Mr. Yamada.

482
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,448
‐ [Daigoji] I’m
Daigoji, Gai Daigoji!

483
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,279
‐ [Soldier] Are we going
to pursue her, Sir?

484
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,738
‐ Pursue, what’s the
point in chasing her?

485
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,119
This operation was a failure.

486
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,366
‐ Who’s this person
she’s crazy about?

487
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:49,867
I want a full report!

488
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,504
‐ Yurika!

489
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,048
(singing in foreign language)

490
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,614
‐ [Presenter] Oh the tears!

491
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,154
The tears that will be shed!

492
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,359
The tears of young
lovers separated

493
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,530
by battle lines
as friend and foe.

494
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,989
The passionate crimes
of a young officer,

495
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,579
the maiden’s anticipation
of forbidden love!

496
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,504
Witness the outcome of
the romance of the century

497
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,843
as hearts plummet to
earth like falling stars

498
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,301
in the stratosphere!

499
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,589
Have three handkerchiefs
ready for the climax

500
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,133
of the next episode of
Martian Successor Nadesico!

501
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,218
A goodbye that came too soon!
