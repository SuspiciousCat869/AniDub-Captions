1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,680
‐ Human beings just
can’t keep themselves

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,518
from opening
mysterious packages.

3
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,556
And the giant robot
we captured has turned

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,859
out to be a real Pandora’s box.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,283
Can you believe what
we found inside,

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,281
Gekiganger merchandise?

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,163
And I thought this was supposed
to be a realistic anime.

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,329
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:56,104
(upbeat music with singing
in foreign language)

10
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,711
‐ It does look like someone
was on board, doesn’t it?

11
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,337
‐ But is that possible sir?

12
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,136
The Jovians have always used
unmanned weapons in the past.

13
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,430
And didn’t Miss Fressange
say that no ordinary lifeform

14
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,472
could survive that
passing through a Chulip?

15
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,308
It just doesn’t make sense.

16
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,481
‐ Stop arguing.

17
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,729
Start looking.

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,440
If there was an enemy
pilot on that robot,

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,610
then he must be hiding
on this ship someplace.

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,899
‐ Yes sir.

21
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,442
‐ And what if there’s
an enemy pilot on board?

22
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,315
If there’s a spy then it’s a
job for the security people

23
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,745
not us, geez.

24
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,491
‐ We’re luggers not fighters.

25
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,035
‐ [All] Yeah.

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,778
But if we call them in
then everyone will find out

27
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,988
there’s an alien on board.

28
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,659
We’d have total
panic on our hands.

29
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,536
And what’s worse the
top brass would blame me

30
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,335
for everything.

31
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,827
Absolutely not.

32
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,497
‐ Did it ever occur to you
that this just might be

33
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,545
some kind of UEAF weapons test.

34
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,012
(man screams)

35
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,260
Perhaps the UAEF are testing
some kind of infiltration

36
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,182
system using
Nadesico as a target.

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,180
‐ Well I suppose it’s possible.

38
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,274
‐ Right come on men, let’s
give this Jovian invader

39
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,309
a good shellacking.

40
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,392
(men cheer)

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,439
‐ This is surprising.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,900
(tapping ball)

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,561
I thought that Nergal’s new
policy was to coordinate

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,400
all of our actions
with the UEAF.

45
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,365
And yet here we are
sneaking to the moon

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,903
to pick up Mr. Tinkawa.

47
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,698
‐ We’re also supposed
to conduct an exchange

48
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,782
with the forth vessel
reducing our exposure

49
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,825
once the military gets
their hands on it.

50
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,239
However, recovery
Tinkawa is more important

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,910
to my own agenda.

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,578
‐ So have you fallen for
Mr. Tinkawa’s charm as well?

53
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,668
(woman coughs)

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,460
‐ What?

55
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,793
Are you serious?

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,457
Why does everyone
on this ship assume

57
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,376
that any relationship
between a man and a woman

58
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,916
has to be sexual in nature?

59
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,379
I’m not that way.

60
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,389
My only interest in him
is due to his importance

61
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,719
as a test subject for
the company, okay?

62
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,315
‐ No it’s not okay.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,180
‐ Captain.

64
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,726
‐ I’m getting sick
and tired of the way

65
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,230
you treat my Akito.

66
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,981
Either you stop bothering
him or else I’ll‐‐

67
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,233
‐ Or you’ll do what?

68
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,154
‐ Ah?

69
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,072
‐ Hit me?

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,690
Kick me?

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,525
Rearrange my hair?

72
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,489
‐ Ah?

73
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,319
‐ Well?

74
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,453
‐ Um, well?

75
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,241
‐ Don’t worry.

76
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:58,911
‐ Huh?

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200
You mean you’ll‐‐

78
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,622
‐ Let me explain
this to you clearly.

79
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,332
‐ Hhmm, explain?

80
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,371
Explanation?

81
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,754
(pouring tea)

82
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,830
‐ I hope that video
cleared thing up.

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,075
Now do you see how the
Nadesico jump from Mars

84
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:11,918
to orbiting the moon?

85
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,542
‐ Yes, I did.

86
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,798
It showed how Akito’s love
for me caused a miracle.

87
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,632
And also how Miss
Fressange tried to but

88
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,718
in between us.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,130
(slaps head)
Ow. (starts crying)

90
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,890
‐ I should have known you’d
detect an explanation.

91
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,429
I’m sorry I’m so late.

92
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,222
In any case it does seem
that Akito is our best chance

93
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,267
at unlocking the secret
to bozen jumping.

94
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,442
That does make him especially
valuable doesn’t it Arena?

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,770
Now be a dear and
pour me a cup of tea?

96
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,649
‐ Oh now I understand.

97
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,816
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

98
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,783
‐ And I’m willing to
forgive you for trying

99
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,821
to come between us.

100
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,775
‐ That’s not it.
‐ That’s not it.

101
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,323
‐ Oops.

102
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,028
‐ In order to make organic
bozen jumping a reality,

103
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,116
we first have to discover what
makes Akito able to do it.

104
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,503
Time is of the essence
if we’re going to beat

105
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,792
the Jovian lizards.

106
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,545
So we’ll do whatever it takes.

107
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,295
(upbeat music)

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,920
‐ Oh hi ladies.
(ladies gasp)

109
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,967
Have you seen anything
peculiar recently?

110
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,262
‐ Peculiar?

111
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,435
‐ No nothing peculiar at all.

112
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,644
We haven’t seen
anything peculiar.

113
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,774
‐ I see.

114
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,560
‐ So is there
something going on?

115
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,104
‐ I’m on a top secret mission,

116
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,647
so please keep
this to yourselves.

117
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,073
(footsteps)

118
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,479
‐ I don’t think we should
mention this to anyone, do you?

119
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,648
‐ I sure hope Gekiganger
phantom isn’t contagious.

120
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,407
(electronic noise)

121
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,820
‐ I’ve completed
littering the hanger

122
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,118
with Gekiganger stickers.

123
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,411
‐ I’ve put the action figures

124
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,664
and Geki plushies
on the bridge sir?

125
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,657
(man laughs)

126
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,247
‐ I’m so clever it kills me.

127
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,042
Our Gekiganger fan intruder will

128
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,667
never be able to
resist this bait.

129
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,592
(man laughs)

130
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,381
And once he comes after the
stickers, we’ve got him.

131
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,667
(footsteps)

132
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,678
‐ Minato?

133
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,765
‐ I’m not leaving this ship.

134
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,427
‐ I’m just trying to do my job.

135
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,315
‐ Just exactly what
is it that you do

136
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,392
on the Nadesico
mission, Mr. Horey?

137
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,019
It can’t be keeping me
under surveillance, can it?

138
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,226
Or is that what
your job really is?

139
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,937
‐ My job is to protect
the Nadesico’s crew.

140
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,196
That’s all I’m trying to do.

141
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,029
‐ And I suppose that
after the war’s over,

142
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,485
you’ll be wanting a nice
little family to come home to.

143
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,625
‐ I’d rather not talk
about my private life.

144
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,213
‐ So am I part of your
private life or your job?

145
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,170
‐ I can accept
either, but not both.

146
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,975
‐ All systems are nominal.

147
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,051
‐ Huh?

148
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,846
Oh my goodness, Murray.

149
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,219
How long have you been here?

150
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,057
‐ I got here before you did.

151
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,391
‐ Um, really?

152
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,305
‐ However, since I’m
just a young girl,

153
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,064
I wouldn’t understand such
an adult conversation.

154
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,857
‐ No, of course you wouldn’t.

155
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,400
I’ll just be leaving
to powder my nose.

156
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,025
Hold down the space
fortress for me, okay?

157
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,401
‐ I‐‐
‐ Minato?

158
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,783
(footstep)

159
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,779
(door closes)

160
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,040
‐ Aw is it over already?
‐ Hmm?

161
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,749
‐ Ssh, be quiet you idiot.

162
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,082
‐ You three.

163
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,326
‐ We were just servicing
the panel under there

164
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,666
with the two of you walked in.

165
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,671
And since it would have
been rude to interrupt,

166
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,422
we didn’t in any way.

167
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,632
We couldn’t really hear nothing.

168
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,674
Right, right?

169
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,178
‐ Ahoy Moby Dick,
I stab at thee.

170
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,430
Harpooned. (laughs)

171
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,432
‐ I’m so glad, you’re not
mixing work with pleasure.

172
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,894
‐ Hmm.

173
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,814
‐ Idiots.

174
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,192
‐ Please Ken, Recrew
is my older brother.

175
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,023
He may be evil, but I
still care about him.

176
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,938
I’m sorry, but
he’s now a warrior

177
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,108
for the Dark String
Universe, Nanaco.

178
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,817
This makes him our enemy.

179
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,495
‐ What’s the matter Gekigaga?

180
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,790
Aren’t you brave enough
to fight with me?

181
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,585
(loud commotion)

182
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,669
‐ Nanaco.

183
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,005
‐ Please Ken.

184
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,379
‐ Sorry.

185
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,674
‐ Why Ken?

186
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,259
Why do we always have to
fight among ourselves.

187
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,854
Why?

188
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,972
‐ Yes Akito. (cries)

189
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,018
Why do we always have to
fight among ourselves.

190
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,153
‐ There you are Ken
Kinko. (continues
talking in background)

191
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,309
‐ I played that scene a
lot better than she did.

192
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,609
‐ It is my duty as a
warrior to vanguish you.

193
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,982
This is our destiny.

194
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,318
‐ Wait don’t turn that off.
(girl gasps)

195
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,863
‐ Huh?

196
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,278
Ah, Mr. Bun‐Bun?

197
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,407
‐ I was right.

198
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,161
This is the lost episode 13,

199
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,124
The Tragic Holy Night (mumbles).

200
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,330
This is incredible.

201
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,075
‐ Ah‐ha.

202
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,584
(banging noise)

203
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,956
‐ It’s okay.

204
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,212
There’s nothing
wrong with being open

205
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,125
with your feelings for Akito.

206
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,842
‐ No, I have to disagree.

207
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,882
Just think of your position.

208
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,297
I mean you’re a captain.

209
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,643
‐ Right, I am a captain.

210
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,049
‐ Then what is it that
motivated you to become

211
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,848
the captain of the Nadesico?

212
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,522
‐ Huh?

213
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,178
I guess the reason I’m
here is because at home

214
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,849
nobody ever though
of me as anything

215
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,518
except my father’s daughter.

216
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,404
And it was the same all
the way through school

217
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,273
and even at the university.

218
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,108
But here on the Nadesico, I
feel like I have a purpose.

219
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,864
That’ I’m part of doing
something important.

220
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,236
‐ You mean that’s all there is?

221
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,374
Nothing more?

222
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,700
‐ Well, there’s also the part

223
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,203
about capturing Akito’s
heart and living

224
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,246
happily ever after just
like in the movies.

225
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,541
‐ Will you please stop
talking about that idiot.

226
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,286
Do you have any idea how
frustrating it is for me

227
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,877
to watch you acting as if
position means nothing to you?

228
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,674
Don’t you have any ambition?

229
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,218
What have you achieved as
captain of this vessel?

230
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,512
‐ It seems to me
that she’s been doing

231
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,565
a pretty good job
as captain thus far.

232
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,598
‐ Do you think all
the people who died

233
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,893
on the ship would
agree with that?

234
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,937
How can you devote so much
time to frivolous pastimes

235
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,192
when you still haven’t mastered

236
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,941
your professional duties
as a senior officer?

237
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,396
Have you even defined your goals

238
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,944
as the Captain of the Nadesico?

239
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,819
What is your purpose?

240
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,403
What is your vision?

241
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,948
‐ How can she answer
her if you keep

242
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,413
hammering her like that?

243
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,831
‐ Well I don’t think Ms. Wans
questions are so unreasonable

244
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,081
‐ [All] Huh?

245
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,002
‐ Not that there’s anything
wrong with chasing Akito around.

246
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,672
However, as a
member of this crew,

247
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,630
I’m also very
interested in learning

248
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,672
what our captain’s
specific goals and vision

249
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,264
for this ship might
be beyond that.

250
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,260
‐ I think my goal is the same

251
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,393
as any captain in times of war.

252
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,679
All I really want is to
be able to keep my ship

253
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,813
and crew safe from harm for
as long as the war continues.

254
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,523
But that doesn’t mean
that we can’t also try

255
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,771
to make the best of
things in the meantime.

256
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,523
‐ And what will you do if
the war never ends, Captain?

257
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,725
(women gulping their drinks)

258
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,938
‐ [All] Ah.

259
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,029
It does a body good.

260
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,243
‐ What I’m saying
is that I don’t care

261
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,952
if you think of yourself
as captain first.

262
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,163
But if you can’t figure out
what your role in the war is,

263
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,745
then you’re just playing around.

264
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,289
And I don’t want someone
who’s not completely focused

265
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,252
on her duties getting in my way.

266
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,002
‐ Well if you’re so
focused, just what is

267
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,586
your vision Miss Smarty Pants?

268
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,129
‐ I intend to be in charge
of Nergal within three years.

269
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,633
‐ [All] Oh.

270
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,046
‐ Being in charge of
Nergal would mean the power

271
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,093
to influence nearly every
single economic sector on earth.

272
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,967
And with that kind of power,
I could reshape the course

273
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,345
of the human race.

274
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,353
‐ Well maybe my goals
aren’t quite as grandiose

275
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,765
as yours are, but I think
that protecting the Nadesico

276
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,233
and Akito is pretty
important as well.

277
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,693
And I don’t think
there’s anything wrong

278
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,485
with not wanting
to be a big shot,

279
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,777
if you’re doing
something that helps

280
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,440
other people achieve
their own goals.

281
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,898
‐ That’s assuming that, that...

282
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,488
‐ You do know that they’ll
throw us out of an airlock

283
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,123
if they catch us
watching them again.

284
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,029
‐ Who the heck cares,
just kill me now.

285
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,003
(man screams)

286
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,371
‐ Are you trying to kill me?

287
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,999
‐ Isn’t that what
you said you wanted,

288
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,376
you bad boy?

289
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,172
So just what are you
doing out here anyway?

290
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,264
‐ A well, actually
we were just looking

291
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,169
for an intruder.

292
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,169
‐ An intruder?

293
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:15,418
‐ [All] An intruder?

294
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,597
‐ Admiral, is it true
that there’s an intruder

295
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,009
running around stealing
people’s underwear?

296
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,017
‐ And is it true that
you ordered Mr. Rebatawki

297
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:24,892
to be a peeping Tom?

298
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,138
‐ Huh?

299
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,187
‐ Admiral what is this about,
‐ Huh?

300
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,350
‐ (mumbles) maintenance
crew to examine

301
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,438
the women’s locker room
while we’re in there.

302
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,692
‐ Degenerates.
‐ What?

303
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,015
Why me, why is it
always... (screams)

304
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,858
‐ Admiral.

305
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,744
(man screaming)

306
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,532
‐ Idiots.

307
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,123
‐ One tranquility‐based
Tonkatsu combo,

308
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,215
fried leaks and livers, Mmm.

309
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,712
‐ I made those deliveries sir.

310
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,171
‐ Well that didn’t take long.

311
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,551
‐ So were you able to contact
the Amoto this time, Akito?

312
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,211
‐ I keep telling you
it’s not the Amoto.

313
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,720
It’s called the Nadesico.

314
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,431
‐ Yes I finally got
through to them.

315
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,891
They’ll be arriving
in just a few days.

316
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,181
‐ Well that’s great,
although I guess that means

317
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,312
that we’ll be losing you.

318
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,519
‐ Isn’t that nice and
I’m sure you’ll be glad

319
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,350
to get away from
my bossy husband.

320
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,595
‐ Who’s bossy?

321
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,018
I’m a peach to
work with, a peach.

322
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,444
‐ You can grab a bit, while
helping Koomey in back.

323
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,936
‐ Here you go Akito.

324
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,448
‐ After all that, my message
didn’t make it there in time.

325
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,910
‐ Oh, you shouldn’t
blame yourself Akito.

326
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,119
‐ I can’t help but feel
she died in my place.

327
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,793
‐ Please don’t say it like that.

328
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,911
‐ Our families lived here
on the moon for a while,

329
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,167
so we’ve known a lot of
people who were killed

330
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,420
in blowouts and things.

331
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,091
In a place like this,
you learn that the fact

332
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,459
that you live an somebody else
dies doesn’t mean anything,

333
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,468
just that you’re lucky
and they weren’t.

334
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,430
Ah, I mean...

335
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,640
‐ I know what you’re
trying to say.

336
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,801
But that girl
didn’t have to die.

337
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,100
For the first week, I was
locked up in that hospital.

338
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,312
And then all those people from
Nergal kept interrogating me.

339
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,145
I didn’t realize
what was happening.

340
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,651
That I’d somehow
gone back in time,

341
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,112
when I used the crystals.

342
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,530
I had two full weeks in
which I could have contacted

343
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,859
the Nadesico and kept them
from attacking that robot.

344
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,995
And if I had been able to get
a message through to the UEAF,

345
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,285
then that girl wouldn’t
have had to die.

346
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,077
But by the time
I finally managed

347
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,910
to get through it was too late.

348
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,996
Get over it kid.

349
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,923
Like I said, it’s just
the luck of the draw.

350
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,461
‐ The logical part of my
brain understands that,

351
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,634
but the emotional side
is having a harder time.

352
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,974
It just feels like there must
be a reason for what happened.

353
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,590
‐ [Man over ship’s radio]
Attention all crew,

354
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,097
there’s evidence that our
ship has been infiltrated

355
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,889
and there may be
an alien aboard.

356
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,063
All hands are to
remain...(continues
to talk in background)

357
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,641
‐ If the Jovians could
plant a spy on board

358
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,767
that means they be humanoid
or have human allies.

359
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,814
‐ That’s true but we
do know for a fact

360
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,609
that mankind is never gone
past the orbit of Mars, right?

361
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,072
So there’s no way
that the Jovians

362
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,742
could have found human spies.

363
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,200
‐ That big oaf is acting like
the announcer at a fox hunt.

364
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,823
‐ Huh?
(knock on door)

365
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,527
‐ Huh?

366
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,698
Ah, don’t move.

367
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,827
‐ Fukomi, you’re supposed
to go up to the bridge.

368
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,462
‐ Yeah, of course, I just
wanted to tidy up first.

369
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,080
‐ To yidy up?

370
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,037
(loud TV)

371
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,919
(girl screams)

372
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,174
‐ Aquamarine.

373
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,047
‐ Huh?

374
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:00,883
‐ What’s that?

375
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,756
‐ Pardon this deception.

376
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,014
I am Lieutenant Commander
Tsukomo Shiratori

377
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,466
of the Space Assault
Superior Male Forces

378
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,056
of the Anti‐Earth
Cooperative Federation

379
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,484
of the Jovian Realm and
Associated Moons and Asteroids.

380
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,022
‐ The what’s, what?

381
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,225
‐ Our Federation has held all
space outside of Jupiter’s

382
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,568
orbit for 100 years.

383
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,862
‐ Now hold on.

384
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,363
Haven’t you read
any history books?

385
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,245
Human beings have only
gone as far as Mars

386
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,784
in this Solar System.

387
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,025
‐ The history that your
people have learned is untrue.

388
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,239
(knocking on door)

389
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,159
‐ This is security.
(women gasp)

390
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,374
Is something wrong in there?

391
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,706
‐ We’re fine.

392
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,040
‐ We’re asking for
everyone to assemble

393
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,253
in the cafeteria ma’am.

394
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,255
‐ We’ll be there in a second.

395
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,997
(man moaning)

396
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,457
‐ Are you sure about
this? (whispering)

397
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,006
Mr. Horey, will be angry.

398
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,630
‐ I really couldn’t
care much less

399
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,046
what Mr. Horey
will be right now.

400
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,595
Anyway, I want to hear what
our visitor has to say,

401
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,721
before we throw
him to the wolves.

402
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,057
‐ Hmm.

403
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,643
‐ Hold it, what are the
two of you doing out here?

404
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,896
Don’t you know we have a
security alert in effect?

405
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,230
‐ I know and I can see
that you’re enjoying

406
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,646
your little blood sport.

407
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,652
‐ I’m just saying
that you’re in danger.

408
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,284
‐ And I’m saying that
you can arrest me,

409
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,653
if that’s what you want.

410
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,027
‐ Hold it.

411
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,915
How dare you claim
to be a soldier,

412
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,783
when you would distress
these fair maidens.

413
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,120
‐ Hold, you’re under arrest.

414
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:12,705
‐ Your under arrest.

415
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,537
‐ Your under arrest.

416
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,844
(loud spacecraft noise)

417
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,592
(boy gasps)

418
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,093
‐ You’re having a nightmare.

419
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,224
Was it the same one?

420
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
‐ Ah.

421
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,637
Yeah.

422
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,351
I feel like a little kid.

423
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,220
Why do I keep having
the same dream?

424
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,346
‐ Do you think that glittering
castle means something?

425
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,564
Wouldn’t be fantastic if
you’re a reincarnated warrior

426
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,694
from a mysterious
ancient civilization?

427
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,192
‐ A reincarnation?

428
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,284
‐ Well it does explain
a few things about you,

429
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,361
like how you became
an Nadesico’s ace
pilot without training

430
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,106
and can teleport by yourself.

431
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,369
You’re pretty mysterious.

432
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,620
‐ I’m nothing like that Koomey.

433
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,082
‐ I’m just a little‐‐ (screams)

434
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:53,701
(loud thunderous noise)

435
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,616
‐ Great Neil Armstrong.

436
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,625
(crashing noise)

437
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,341
‐ No longer will you build
these demonic weapons

438
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,725
to use against us earth‐scum.

439
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,759
‐ Di Majin tornado.

440
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,639
‐ Thank God we have a pilot
with your experience here.

441
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,681
We need to take
care of that thing

442
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,096
before the UEAF
reinforcements arrive.

443
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:16,894
‐ Why’s that?

444
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,266
‐ That’s the reason over there.

445
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,902
Nadesico Class Vessel
number four, the Shokuyoku.

446
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,110
We’ve been building her
secretly as part of our plan

447
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,151
to return to Mars.

448
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,035
‐ Sonargol’s been
withholding information

449
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,152
from the military?

450
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,488
‐ Please we need you
to pull this one off.

451
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,492
‐ I don’t give a
damn, what Nergal

452
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,913
and the UAEF want anymore.

453
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,992
I’ve got a personal score to
settle with these lizards.

454
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:39,039
And if I run away this time,
I couldn’t forgive myself.

455
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,715
(crashing thud)

456
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,261
‐ Mighty is the fist
that fights for justice.

457
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,262
You’re evil giant robot is
no match for my di Majin.

458
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,257
(giant robot yelling)

459
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,928
(loud laser noise)

460
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,306
‐ I knew it.

461
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,812
That’s the same giant robot
I just fought on earth.

462
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,904
‐ That lunar surface frame has
a self‐contained PT engine,

463
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,862
however, you’ll reaction
time is slowed down

464
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,111
by the larger mask.

465
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,572
Use your real gun
at close range.

466
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,863
I understand, don’t worry.

467
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,785
There’s no way I’m gonna
let that thing fire

468
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,243
off a gravity blast.

469
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,252
‐ The lab reports said his
DNA was slightly modified,

470
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,711
but otherwise normal.

471
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,499
It seem our guest as an
earth human just like us.

472
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,213
‐ Don’t call me an
earthling, earthling.

473
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,673
I’m a proud soldier of
the Jovian Federation.

474
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,964
‐ Captain.
(man screams)

475
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,047
We are receiving an
S. O. S. from the moon.

476
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,341
It appears that a
Nergal Aestivalis is

477
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,425
engaged in combat with one
of the Jovian Goliath units.

478
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,724
‐ Oh my gosh.

479
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,556
That’s gotta be Akito
in the Aestivalis.

480
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,310
Well, I guess I’d better
go up to the bridge.

481
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,852
‐ If you would‐‐

482
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,645
‐ What about the prisoner
and those two traders?

483
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,438
‐ Saving Akito’s life
is more important

484
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,444
than bullying those two Ms. Wan.

485
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,776
‐ Well if that’ your decision.

486
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,820
‐ Have you lost your mind?

487
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,031
How can you put
something between a man

488
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,742
and a woman in front
of a war captain.

489
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,072
‐ Why not?

490
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,776
Or is the crew of this
ship not men and women?

491
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,329
‐ The captain is just too soft.

492
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,465
Hold it.

493
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,503
I think this is far enough.

494
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,584
‐ Huh?

495
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,920
(man gasps)

496
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,174
I think the public is
better off believing

497
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,634
that the Jovians are
inhuman invaders.

498
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,295
I’m afraid that
makes your existence

499
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,725
rather inconvenient.

500
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,551
It’s too bad‐‐

501
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,335
(load thud)

502
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,928
(man moaning)

503
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,886
‐ Start running, but I just
can’t break my prisoners

504
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,807
parole like that.

505
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,766
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

506
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,064
‐ Well you’re not capture now.

507
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,607
‐ This is your last
chance at freedom.

508
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,522
‐ Stop.

509
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,358
(man and women gasp)

510
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,362
In the name of the UEAF.

511
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,455
(gun clicks)

512
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,449
‐ I’m sorry.

513
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,373
(gunfire)

514
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,239
‐ How’s that?

515
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:37,875
‐ How’s this?

516
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,330
Yakegan (mumbles)

517
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,465
(boy screaming)

518
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,082
(loud thud)

519
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,787
(robot laughing)

520
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,499
‐ Why are you doing this?

521
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,630
It doesn’t even make any sense.

522
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,924
(strong motor force)

523
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:53,627
Why you attacking all
these innocent people?

524
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,968
(loud thrusting noise)

525
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,731
‐ I swear you’ll pay for
that one you birth scum.

526
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,270
‐ What did...

527
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,274
Who the hell are you?

528
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,735
‐ You’ll never
extinguish the flame

529
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,774
that burns within my soul.

530
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,277
I will defend my
Jupiter even if to do so

531
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,401
may mean my own death.

532
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,777
‐ Oh my God.

533
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,283
You’re fighting for
the Jovian lizards.

534
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,035
‐ Ah, thank goodness,
are you okay Akito?

535
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,119
‐ What’s going on here?

536
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:22,833
Who are you?

537
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,372
‐ We might have been...

538
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,373
We might have been
friends, had we been born

539
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,290
in another place in time.

540
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,336
‐ Hold on Akito,
we’ll be right there.

541
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,460
‐ Quiet I can’t hear.

542
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,706
‐ What?

543
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,259
Reinforcement, I
must flee for now,

544
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,801
but I will surely defeat
you when next we meet.

545
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,885
‐ Hey wait, where you going?

546
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,847
(loud thud)

547
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,057
‐ He was human.

548
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,898
The lizards are humans.

549
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,943
That’s impossible.

550
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,145
‐ Do you see what the
consequences of your actions

551
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,276
are Captain.

552
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,032
Because of you our
prisoner has escaped

553
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,985
and our helm’s woman and
communication’s officer

554
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,534
are both missing.

555
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,867
‐ I’m sorry.

556
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,502
‐ None of this changes
who the enemy is Eureka.

557
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,539
You can’t let your emotions
sway your decisions

558
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,423
as Captain.

559
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,001
‐ I know that June.

560
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,464
‐ This isn’t gonna be pretty.

561
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,294
Hunting your friends never is.

562
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,458
(slaps dash)

563
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,548
‐ I’m coming with you.

564
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,134
This was partly my fault.

565
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,337
‐ No way.

566
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,967
‐ I just heard that the
enemy prisoner got away.

567
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,553
‐ Oh Akito, are you okay?

568
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,140
How wonderful.

569
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,063
But you should rest after
all you’ve been through.

570
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,062
I really thought I was
doing my best to do

571
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,394
what I thought was
the right thing to do.

572
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,730
But maybe I was wrong about
what I was right about.

573
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,023
‐ I won’t let them
get away with this.

574
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,226
(Captain continues
talking in the background)

575
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:33,857
All this time we’ve been
fighting other humans

576
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,781
just like us.

577
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,190
How could they be so evil?

578
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:36,987
‐ Don’t you?

579
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,569
‐ Ah, shut up already.

580
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,494
Shuttle one now taking off in
pursuit of escaped prisoner.

581
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,913
(loud squeaking noise)

582
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,913
(thrusting noise)

583
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,788
‐ What’s wrong Akito?

584
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,665
There’s something
different about you.

585
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,091
You’re scaring me.

586
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,894
(upbeat music with singing
in foreign language)

587
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,282
‐ [Voiceovers] Xebec
Studio Newsletter.

588
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,069
Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep...

589
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,322
‐ [Man] And so here
we are at Xebec,

590
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,065
the studio that
animated Nadesico.

591
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,155
‐ [Woman] Hey there’s someone
sleeping under this desk.

592
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,622
Let’s talk to the director.

593
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
‐ [Director] A hello, I’m
(mumbles) the director

594
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,084
and the next episode,
Eureka and Akito will

595
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,752
finally have a bigger
romantic scene.

596
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,581
‐ [Woman] Oh really.

597
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,925
How wonderful.

598
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,669
‐ [Man] Hey, what
did you just say?

599
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,500
‐ [Woman] Nothing.

600
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,286
What are those?

601
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,787
‐ [Man] Gekiganger animation so,

602
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,588
I’m gonna wallpaper
my room with them.

603
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,841
‐ [Woman] I see.

604
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:20,714
‐ [Man] Don’t mill
the next episode

605
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
of Martian Successor Nadesico,

606
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,631
the beginning of Nadesico’s war.

607
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,336
‐ [Woman] And maybe a lot more.
