00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,059
‐ [Ruri] Mars.

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,525
The planet of war
and destruction.

3
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,273
The planet of death.

4
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,695
The ancient Babylonians
called it Nergal,

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,284
the namesake for the
company that sent us here.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,240
Having found only new
mysteries and deaths

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,952
on the red planet, we fled,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,530
although our final
destination is unknown.

9
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,028
Kind of typical, isn’t it?

("You Get to Burning"

(loud explosions)

24
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,311
‐ Gravitron waves increasing
in Chulip Force One, sir!

25
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,311
‐ What?

26
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,562
‐ It’s off the scale, sir.

27
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,484
Something huge is
coming through.

28
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,733
‐ Bring up the main guns.

29
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,483
And if those don’t work,
we’ll ram the gladiola

30
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,818
down their throats!

31
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,152
‐ [Man] Whatever it
is sir, here it comes!

32
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,451
‐ Huh?

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,250
That can’t be what
I think it is.

34
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,958
(loud explosion)

35
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,303
‐ [All] It’s the Nadesico!

36
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,379
(machine beeping)

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,840
‐ The Nadesico has
returned to normal space.

38
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,058
I’m now calculating
our current position.

39
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,351
Will everyone
please wake up now?

40
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,686
Um, hello?

41
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,019
It’s time to get up.

42
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,685
May I have your attention?

43
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,274
Your attention please.

44
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,897
Wake up now.

45
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,895
Please return to your
assigned positions

46
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,236
and begin your emergency
alert checklists.

47
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,533
Captain.

48
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,374
Captain, wake up.

49
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,368
‐ Ah!

50
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,374
‐ The ship has returned
to normal space, captain.

51
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,626
May I ask why you’re
in the recreation area

52
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,789
instead of on the bridge?

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,786
‐ Huh?

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,547
(screams)

55
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,551
(dramatic music)

56
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,423
Stop that!

57
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,970
‐ [Ruri] Captain?

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,931
‐ What’s going on Ruri?

59
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,183
‐ There’s something outside

60
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,723
that I believe you
should look at captain.

61
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,559
‐ Oh my gosh,
we’re under attack!

62
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,483
Configure the gravity blast
cannon to maximum spread.

63
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,233
Fire at will, Ruri!

64
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,066
‐ Have you gone out of
your mind, you imbecile!

65
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,903
You’re just lucky
that none of us were

66
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,487
in the direct path of the blast

67
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,822
so there weren’t any casualties!

68
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,986
As it is we’ll be
shipping their dollar bill

69
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,575
for the 2066 jockey
shorts that were ruined.

70
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,411
Sansley out!

71
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,458
(sighs)

72
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,831
‐ I said that we were sorry.

73
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,575
‐ Maybe he’ll calm down
once his ship cools off.

74
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,418
‐ Ruri, how bad were the
damages to the second fleet?

75
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,666
‐ By that I assume you mean

76
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,166
the ones that we inflicted.

77
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,587
Fortunately, there were
only five serious injuries

78
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,758
and no deaths.

79
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,096
‐ Still, we can’t
deny that we did

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,350
almost vaporize most of them.

81
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,721
‐ True.

82
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,637
And considering that we were
just saved by another admiral,

83
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,228
this is pretty embarrassing.

84
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,981
‐ [Goat] Yes, if you
had been on the bridge,

85
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,524
you would have had a
better understanding

86
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,016
of the situation.

87
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,777
‐ By the way, Akito,
just how did you, me

88
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,072
and Fressange get down there?

89
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,283
‐ What were you doing?

90
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,283
Inquiring minds

91
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,776
want to know.
‐ Now wait a second!

92
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,866
‐ [Megumi] Yeah, I’d
like to know as well!

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,200
‐ Well...

94
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,735
‐ How could you sneak
off during an alert?

95
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,118
It’s disgraceful!

96
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,456
If Miss Fressange
hadn’t been there,

97
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,919
I’ll bet the two of
you would’ve been‐‐

98
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,289
‐ [Both] Doing what?

99
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,167
‐ Oh!

100
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,174
‐ I don’t know what happened
or how we got there!

101
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,796
If you’re all so hung
up on finding out,

102
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,971
why don’t you just
ask Miss Fressange!

103
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,643
She’s still asleep?

104
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,853
‐ [All] Mm hmm.

105
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,062
‐ Wait, that doesn’t
mean anything at all.

106
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,601
‐ [All] Uh huh, uh huh.

107
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,944
‐ Will you all just shut up!

108
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,599
If my Tenkawa says that
he didn’t do anything,

109
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,728
then we should trust him!

110
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,035
Not that I really care anyway.

111
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,322
‐ [Both] My?

112
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,065
‐ Huh?

113
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,324
What does that mean?

114
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,485
‐ You just called him
my Tenkawa, Ryoko.

115
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,494
‐ How possessive.

116
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,825
‐ Will you two keep
the channels clear?

117
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,662
We’re supposed to be on standby!

118
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,415
‐ [Both] My Tenkawa, my
Tenkawa, my Tenkawa, my Tenkawa.

119
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,329
‐ By the way, the
enemy’s attacking.

120
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,047
(dramatic music)

121
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,509
‐ [Ryoko] All units, spread out!

122
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,669
Seek and destroy!

123
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,667
‐ [Hikaru] What’s our strategy?

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,510
‐ [Ryoko] Improvise!

125
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,475
(dramatic music)

126
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,564
‐ Maintain the fields
at maximum and standby.

127
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,142
Keep the gravity blast cannon
on continuous recharge.

128
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,596
‐ [Ruri] Roger, captain.

129
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,186
‐ [Yurika Voiceover] The
thing is, I don’t understand

130
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,692
how I got down there either.

131
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,442
I know I was here on the bridge.

132
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,115
‐ Not that I would
mind being down there

133
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,743
all alone with Akito.

134
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,032
‐ Hello captain,
I have some things

135
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,363
I need to talk to you about.

136
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,867
‐ We were all fully
clothed, weren’t we?

137
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,581
‐ Huh?

138
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,911
(laughs)

139
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,865
That may not look like
a private debriefing.

140
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,084
I’m sure it’s fine.

141
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,325
I think they just
want to go over

142
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,335
some new policies
and procedures.

143
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,207
‐ Oh.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,590
‐ [Hikaru] (laughs) Got ya!

145
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,426
(dramatic music)

146
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,131
Huh?

147
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,048
I don’t believe it!

148
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,547
I only nailed three out of 10!

149
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,179
‐ [Izumi] It appears that
these grasshoppers have

150
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,854
a few legs up on us in
terms of defensive fields.

151
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,273
‐ [Hikaru] When
did they get those?

152
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,853
‐ Who cares how
many legs they have?

153
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,056
We’re still one up on them

154
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,057
when it comes to
hand to hand combat!

155
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,649
Alright, that takes
care of those lizards,

156
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,363
but where in the
heck is Tenkawa?

157
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,243
‐ [Both] Who?

158
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,279
‐ Will you two knock it off?

159
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,364
Tenkawa!

160
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,657
Tenkawa?

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,120
Where are you Tenkawa?

162
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,042
(dramatic music)

163
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,326
Tenkawa, why aren’t
you responding

164
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,924
to your radio, you idiot?

165
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,079
Do you need assistance?

166
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,577
‐ It’s too late!

167
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,047
(gun fires)

168
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,344
(screams)

169
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,507
‐ Hold on Akito, just
keep it calm and go back.

170
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,556
‐ Tenkawa, we’re coming
as fast as we can.

171
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,810
‐ [Ruri] He’s been
surrounded captain.

172
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,934
‐ There’s something
wrong with me.

173
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:15,768
‐ He’s freaking!

174
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,814
‐ Calm down!

175
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,937
‐ [Akito] My hands won’t move!

176
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,233
‐ Akito.

177
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,114
‐ [Hikaru] Try to
imagine that all

178
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:20,941
the grasshoppers are naked‐‐

179
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,194
‐ We’ve got to help him!

180
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,395
‐ No goddammit!

181
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,615
Just hold on five
more seconds Akito!

182
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,817
(yells)

183
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,828
(breathing heavily)

184
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,788
‐ What in the hell’s
wrong with me?

185
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,043
I thought I’d
beaten this already.

186
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,833
I wasn’t afraid but
now it’s back again.

187
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,250
(breathing heavily)

188
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,134
(heart beating)

189
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,143
(breathing heavily)

190
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,810
(heart beating)

191
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,606
(screams)

192
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,809
‐ [Ryoko] Tenkawa!

193
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,320
‐ [Nagare] Stay back!

194
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,570
It’s about to get
extremely dangerous here!

195
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,781
You three return
immediately to base.

196
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,781
Don’t just stand there.

197
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,112
Do it!

198
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,657
‐ Just who do you think
you’re talking to!

199
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,532
Huh?

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,870
‐ [Ruri] 20% of the enemy
have been vaporized.

201
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,706
‐ I don’t believe it!

202
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,171
‐ Second blast approaching.

203
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,131
‐ Wow.

204
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,092
‐ A multi‐barreled
gravity blast cannon.

205
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,962
‐ Huh?

206
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,218
But that means...

207
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,232
‐ Oh!

208
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,855
That’s a brand new
model of Aestavalis!

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,110
A new frame, a new generator!

210
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,241
Look at that head, look
at those thrusters!

211
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,861
Oh, it’s so smooth, I’m
in love, I’m in love!

212
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,408
‐ [All] Geez, what a loser.

213
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,873
‐ But I don’t understand
how they could have made

214
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,203
a new model so soon.

215
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,827
‐ Yeah, and didn’t
those liars tell us

216
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,502
that our sweet little
Aesties were the latest

217
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,541
state of the art
just two months ago?

218
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,666
‐ Ah, but you see,
that’s not exactly right.

219
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,803
(machine whirring)

220
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,301
Actually, it’s been eight months

221
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,472
since the Nadesico
disappeared from Mars,

222
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,221
during which time the
Earth has been steadily

223
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,854
reinforcing its arsenal.

224
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,719
‐ [Man] Who the heck are you?

225
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,977
‐ I’m Nagare Akatsuki.

226
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,939
From the space
battleship Cosmos.

227
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,061
‐ So if you understand captain,

228
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,806
we sincerely hope
that you will accept

229
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,148
the terms and conditions
we’ve just given you.

230
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,283
Otherwise I’m afraid
that the Nadesico

231
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,282
could be severely
damaged in the cross fire

232
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,914
between the Earth’s space forces

233
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,031
and the Jovian lizards.

234
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,405
‐ Well, it’s just that
this is so sudden.

235
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,703
‐ Mm.

236
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,826
Well, I’m sure we can
have a nice meeting

237
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,583
and draft up the proper forms.

238
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,544
‐ Very well.

239
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,924
I’ll arrange to
have the Cosmos dock

240
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,093
with the Nadesico.

241
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,379
‐ The Cosmos?

242
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,422
‐ Yes, the Nadesico’s
sister ship, the Cosmos.

243
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,599
(triumphant music)

244
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,598
(triumphant music)

245
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,862
‐ We are now receiving
guidance beams.

246
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,821
‐ Roger that.

247
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,942
Wow.

248
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,238
It’s all automated!

249
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,371
(triumphant music)

250
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,082
‐ It is now obvious that passing

251
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,963
through a Chulip entails
far more than just

252
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,252
simple teleportation.

253
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,543
Eight months have passed
since we left Mars.

254
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,877
During this time, Nergal
has settled its differences

255
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,423
with United Earth forces,
and has begun building

256
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,177
new battleships for them.

257
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,970
Together, the two have
reclaimed the surface

258
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,144
of the moon from the enemy.

259
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,472
And based on my project‐‐

260
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,265
‐ Yes, that’s very
interesting Inez.

261
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,098
However, at the moment,
our main interest must be

262
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,484
on what this entails
for this vessel.

263
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,602
Captain?

264
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,268
‐ What it means is
that the Nadesico

265
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,266
has been reassigned and
that we will be integrated

266
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,648
into the United Earth
navy’s far eastern command.

267
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,855
‐ [All] Huh?

268
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,027
‐ Are you saying that
we’ll have to do what

269
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,245
those idiots tell us to do?

270
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,662
‐ No not at all.

271
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,990
Simply means that we’ll
cooperate for a while.

272
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,117
‐ And you would be?

273
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,202
‐ Nagare Akatsuki,
at your service.

274
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,249
Think of us as the
privateers of old,

275
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,121
flying our own flag but rallying

276
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,708
around the cause of liberty.

277
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,959
After all, it’d be a
shame to spoil a hand

278
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,296
such as this with the
duties of a common soldier.

279
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,882
‐ And what about Mars?

280
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,759
‐ Yeah!

281
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,643
Minato’s right.

282
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,389
What about Mars?

283
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,391
Are we just going to abandon it?

284
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,933
‐ [Prospector] Do you
really think we can succeed

285
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:22,775
if we went back?

286
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,139
‐ But we‐‐

287
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,095
‐ No I’m afraid that
we have no chance

288
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,565
of defeating the
Jovians on Mars.

289
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,976
So until there is a
reasonable hope of victory,

290
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,023
the Nadesico is far better
utilized defending the Earth.

291
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,188
‐ [Jun] Strategically speaking,
it would make more sense

292
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,567
to cooperate with
the United Forces.

293
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,025
‐ [Seiya] Now wait a second.

294
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,993
I’m not sure I like the idea
of becoming mercenaries.

295
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,203
‐ [Nagare] If you don’t like it,

296
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,165
you can always just
collect your back pay

297
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,872
and get off the ship, you know.

298
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,538
(triumphant music)

299
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,039
‐ [Man] Hello class!

300
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,208
Today we have a new student!

301
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,376
This is Genji Akara.

302
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,836
‐ I’m Akara, it’s nice
to meet all of you.

303
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,296
(girls squeal)

304
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,095
‐ [Boy] Damn it, I’m
better looking than he is.

305
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,061
‐ By the great lizard!

306
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,389
Is it possible that earthlings

307
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,385
have the same capacity
to love as we do?

308
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,438
This is an amazing
discovery I’ve made!

309
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,897
‐ Huh?

310
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,362
‐ Oh, excuse me, but
your door was open and...

311
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,073
‐ And what!?

312
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,905
‐ Rokotsu!

313
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,698
He’s going in for a kill!

314
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,492
Huh?

315
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,744
‐ [Man] Let’s go everyone!

316
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,407
‐ [Man] It’s time to
launch Gekigangar!

317
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,124
‐ It can’t be!

318
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,576
Ken and his friends are
the pilots of Gekigangar?

319
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,247
(laughs)

320
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,004
‐ You don’t have to
watch it, you know.

321
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,376
‐ I just don’t get it.

322
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,212
‐ No, I’d say that it’s
obvious that you don’t.

323
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,338
‐ What I don’t get
is how you can be

324
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,304
such a fan of this anime stuff

325
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,836
and not welcome the integration

326
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,678
of the Nadesico into the

327
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,262
United Armed services.
(growls)

328
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,219
‐ [Akito] Just who the hell

329
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,806
are you anyway?
‐ Hi Akito.

330
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,393
‐ [Nagare] I’m just a man
who enjoys a good fight.

331
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,897
Not unlike yourself,
I would imagine.

332
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,900
You do know that the
image feedback system

333
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,112
tends to stimulate a person’s
aggressive instincts,

334
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:56,982
don’t you?

335
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,490
‐ I never asked for this!

336
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,241
I got my implant so I
could do my job on Mars!

337
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,492
Why does everyone here have
such a hard time understanding

338
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,486
that I just don’t
like to fight!?

339
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,498
‐ So, what you’re saying
is that you’re afraid?

340
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,916
‐ Hell, I’m not scared of you.

341
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,335
‐ Let’s not fight Tenkawa.

342
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,842
But how about a nice
game of one on one?

343
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,385
(screaming)

344
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,677
By the way, I was about
to say that the gravity

345
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,223
in this room has been
lowered to zero G.

346
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,136
But I guess it’s
a little late now.

347
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,136
(screaming)

348
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,058
What’s wrong Akito?

349
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,064
n’t ylike your anime heroes?

350
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,186
‐ Aw, shut up!

351
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,444
‐ Look, Tenkawa!

352
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,653
The trick is to create
a counter force.

353
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,856
‐ Oh dammit I’ll counter
your force in my‐‐

354
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,987
What?

355
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,991
Oh!

356
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,164
‐ [Nagare] (laughing) See?

357
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,322
That’s all you needed.

358
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,370
‐ Shut up!

359
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,622
This is basketball!

360
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,502
In a real fight, I would’ve‐‐

361
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,294
‐ Enemy fleet approaching!

362
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,373
Aestavalis pilots,
prepare for war.

363
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,919
‐ What the hell are
you waiting for,

364
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:55,921
a great invitation?

365
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:56,882
Get moving!

366
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,546
(adventurous music)

367
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,012
‐ [Man] Don’t let them
lure you out of formation.

368
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,302
‐ [All] Roger!

369
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,763
‐ Well, you wanted a real fight.

370
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,843
‐ Shut up!

371
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,217
‐ [Ryoko] Assume
closet formation!

372
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:06,596
‐ [All] Roger!

373
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,098
‐ [Akito] Oh, oh.

374
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,314
Hey, hey, ah!

375
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,603
‐ I like it.

376
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,096
A very safe and reliable
method of engagement.

377
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,858
‐ I didn’t become a pilot
so I could be a soldier.

378
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,570
‐ Then why are you still
on board the Nadesico?

379
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,115
(engine whirring)

380
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:23,986
‐ Ah!

381
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,785
Dammit I didn’t join the
Nadesico to fight at all!

382
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,118
I just wanted to be a cook!

383
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,206
Ah! (yelling)

384
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,463
‐ Huh?

385
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,674
Hey Akito, let go
of the grasshopper!

386
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,095
‐ I don’t think he can hear you.

387
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,225
‐ Akito!

388
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:43,671
‐ [Akito] Ah!

389
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,637
‐ [Ruri] Pilot Tenkawa’s
Aestavalis is entering

390
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,892
the moon’s shadow.

391
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,975
His graviton power
beam has been severed.

392
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,479
‐ [Goat] I’m afraid
he’s lost at space.

393
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,060
‐ Lost in space?

394
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,147
‐ [Goat] Could he get back
to the Nadesico on his own?

395
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,321
‐ [Inez] I’m afraid not.

396
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,569
‐ Without the gravitron beam

397
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,150
to feed his Aestavalis energy,

398
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,705
his only source of power
is his back up battery.

399
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,279
That’s five minutes of thrust.

400
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,816
‐ Well in girl scouts they said

401
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,237
that the best thing
to do when you’re lost

402
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,447
is to stay in one place.

403
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,156
So I doubt he’ll
try to go very far.

404
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,415
(women groan)

405
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,576
‐ [Woman] His chances
of making it back

406
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,115
would increase greatly
if the Nadesico

407
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,669
were to get closer to him.

408
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,880
‐ Unfortunately the
Nadesico’s weapon systems

409
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,501
are still down for repairs.

410
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,587
If we took off right now,
we’d be sitting ducks.

411
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,263
‐ Akatsuki.

412
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,263
Do you know if the Cosmos has
any standard fighters onboard?

413
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,466
(engine starting)

414
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,005
‐ You’ve got four
hours worth of fuel.

415
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,887
Come back if it gets
too hairy out there.

416
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,274
‐ Thank you.

417
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,520
‐ I didn’t realize you were
going after him personally.

418
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,811
I wouldn’t have
thought a captain would

419
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,437
get so involved in a rescue.

420
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,523
‐ Oh I’m one of that
new type of captain.

421
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,188
But on the other
hand, you haven’t had

422
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,397
any zero gravity combat
training, Megumi.

423
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,907
‐ True, but I had
a pilot’s license

424
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,199
even before I joined Nergal.

425
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,282
And there’s nothing
you can say to keep me

426
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:51,619
from coming captain.

427
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,200
‐ Okay Jun.

428
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,908
I’m entrusting you with my baby.

429
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:57,708
‐ Mm hmm.

430
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,210
I’ll take good care of her.

431
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,133
(engine thrusting)

432
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,852
‐ Eight hours until my
power reserves give out.

433
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,773
Although my air will give
out long before that.

434
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,942
Huh?

435
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,230
Someone’s shooting at someone.

436
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,234
Not much I can do either way.

437
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,646
Not without a power feed.

438
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:26,737
Wait!

439
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:28,699
Jettisoning feet!

440
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,744
I can’t believe that worked!

441
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,985
It’s like something out of
an episode of Gekigangar!

442
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,909
(laughs)

443
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,287
(screaming)

444
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,623
‐ Are you alright Megumi?

445
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,628
‐ [Megumi] I’m losing
thruster control!

446
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,170
(screaming)

447
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,345
‐ [Both] Oh, you saved us!

448
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,215
‐ You’ll always be my knight
in shining armor Akito!

449
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,645
‐ Aren’t you afraid anymore?

450
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,522
‐ Well, when I
realized that I needed

451
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,769
to help you two, I
suddenly wasn’t afraid

452
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,351
of fighting anymore.

453
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,558
Just like before.

454
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,647
‐ You mean your love
overcame your fear?

455
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,481
‐ His love for who?

456
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,685
‐ Knock it off!

457
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,356
We’ve only got 30
minutes of oxygen left!

458
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,534
‐ Is that all?

459
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,362
‐ Well we’ve got three
people in just one ship.

460
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,657
‐ Exactly!

461
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,700
‐ [Yurika] Um, so
what are going to do?

462
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
‐ At this rate of
acceleration, we won’t be

463
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,080
in range of the Nadesico
for another two hours.

464
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,459
That’s not enough.

465
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,714
‐ By the time two
hours have gone by,

466
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,586
we’ll all be frozen solid.

467
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:27,883
‐ Okay!

468
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Now if we deploy the
emergency solar sail,

469
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,346
we should be able to
accelerate even faster.

470
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,770
But it’s still 40 minutes.

471
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,270
‐ [Megumi] What about
that figure at the bottom.

472
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,642
How can we get there
in just 20 minutes?

473
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,437
‐ That’s if there
was only one person.

474
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,443
For two it’d take 30 minutes.

475
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,575
‐ [Megumi] So if one of us
got off, the remaining two

476
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,571
would reach the Nadesico
10 minutes earlier?

477
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,903
‐ [Yurika] Then the
others could refuel

478
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,738
and come back for
the one left behind.

479
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,783
‐ [Megumi] Yes, but
Akito has to stay because

480
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,828
he’s the only one who
can pilot an Aestavalis.

481
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,740
‐ [Yurika] Which means‐‐

482
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,619
‐ [Akito] I have to decide.

483
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,906
Yurika.

484
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,999
‐ [Yurika] Um, is that
because I’m heavier?

485
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,582
‐ [Akito] No, it’s
because I’d have

486
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,829
to come back for you.

487
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,458
‐ [Yurika] Oh why, Akito!

488
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,707
‐ Well maybe I should get off!

489
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,166
‐ Forget it Megumi!

490
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,966
Not only do I have
better survival training,

491
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,841
I’m much larger every
place it counts.

492
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,756
‐ [Megumi] Not every place,
in case you hadn’t noticed.

493
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,176
‐ [Yurika] Only proportionately.

494
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,353
‐ [Megumi] Well that’s
beside the point.

495
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,681
‐ [Akito Voiceover] Gai.

496
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,095
What would Gai do?

497
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,899
‐ He’d go for it!

498
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,269
Deploying solar sail!

499
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,398
‐ Wait Akito!

500
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,402
I’m supposed to jump
off the ship, remember?

501
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,244
‐ It’s alright.

502
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,359
We’ll all go together.

503
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,535
The military may have
to sacrifice something

504
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,204
to save something
else but I don’t.

505
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,282
We’ll make it work
somehow, just like Gai.

506
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,998
Into danger, Gekigangar.

507
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,383
‐ I think we just
ran out of energy.

508
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,922
‐ I’m sorry girls, we must
have strayed off course!

509
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,626
Or maybe there wasn’t
enough acceleration!

510
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,756
‐ It’s not your fault!

511
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,432
‐ Yes, that’s right.

512
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,050
‐ Akito, you’ve always been
my knight in shining armor,

513
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,467
and you’ve always done
the very best you could.

514
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,348
I know this will work out!

515
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,275
‐ You mean the only
reason you like Akito is

516
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,982
because he’s always
there to help you?

517
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,693
‐ Huh?

518
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,652
‐ I see.

519
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,980
That’s not why I love him.

520
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,067
‐ But you do love
him, don’t you?

521
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,781
He’s very special to us in
different kinds of ways.

522
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,782
But maybe different
kinds of love

523
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,244
can be equally strong.

524
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,085
‐ Well as long as
we’re baring our souls,

525
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
what were you thinking the
first time you kissed me?

526
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,254
‐ Huh?

527
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,410
‐ Excuse me, but
just how many times

528
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,618
have you kissed her anyway?

529
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,457
‐ Huh?

530
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,461
Me?

531
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,252
‐ I wanna know too!

532
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,045
‐ So do I!

533
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,999
‐ I wouldn’t mind knowing.

534
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:31,837
‐ I really couldn’t care less.

535
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,461
‐ [All] Huh?

536
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,547
‐ [Megumi] Hey, if
our communications
have been restored...

537
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,968
‐ You’re the last
person I’d imagine

538
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,564
taking a risk like this.

539
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,141
‐ (laughs) What fun would it be

540
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:43,974
without a little competition.

541
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,813
‐ Hey Akatsuki.

542
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,104
I’m going to stay
on the Nadesico.

543
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,687
‐ So you finally come around.

544
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,192
That’s good.

545
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,073
I knew there was a
warrior there inside you.

546
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,532
‐ No, let’s just say I found
something worth protecting.

547
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,071
Gai.

548
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,566
My friend Gai didn’t want
to fight a war either,

549
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,448
but he realized that the
Earth was worth protecting

550
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,163
and worth any sacrifice.

551
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,203
By protecting the Nadesico‐‐

552
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,535
‐ Oh, it’s just like Gekigangar!

553
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,211
‐ Yeah, that sounds like
something he’d say, alright.

554
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,466
‐ I’m back!

555
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,429
I bet you thought you’d
seen the last of me, right?

556
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,381
‐ [All] Huh?

557
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,930
‐ Yes, Admiral Munatake
has been assigned

558
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,354
to our ship as the United
Earth forces liaison.

559
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,312
‐ It’s cool!

560
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,731
Really!

561
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,349
‐ And I’m Erino Won.

562
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,726
I’ve been assigned
to the Nadesico

563
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,442
as your new co‐helmswoman.

564
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,904
‐ Yes, that’s right!

565
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,782
Damn it, what is the chairman’s
secretary doing here?

566
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,030
‐ [Erino] Well, I
certainly didn’t expect

567
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,151
to find you onboard.

568
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,737
‐ [Nagare] Will
I be in your way?

569
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,112
‐ [Erino] Of course.

570
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,080
‐ [Nagare] So, what is this?

571
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,950
‐ [Erino] Akito Tenkawa,
the moment the Nadesico

572
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,157
jumped from Mars.

573
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,579
‐ How interesting.

574
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,166
‐ (laughs) Oh yes.

575
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,000
Very.

(singing in foreign language)

584
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,062
‐ [Announcer] Look
out for icebergs!

585
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,567
The Nadesico is sent
to the Arctic Ocean

586
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,649
on a mysterious rescue mission.

587
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,944
Will Akito make it back
from a deadly journey

588
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,608
over the frozen sea?

589
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,066
Or will he succumb to the
frigid sleep of icy death?

590
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,577
On the other hand, with the
way his love life is going,

591
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,080
will he even want to come back?

592
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,161
He’ll need all that
ice just to cool off

593
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,037
as the battle for Akito’s
heart really begins to heat up!

594
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,666
You’ll get to see the girls
in incredibly short skirts

of Martian Successor Nadesico,
