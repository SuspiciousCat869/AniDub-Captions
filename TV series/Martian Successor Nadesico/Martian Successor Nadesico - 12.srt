1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,846
‐ [Ruri] Conventional
military wisdom says that

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,306
a superior combat vessel
must take on risks

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,225
that match the superior
capabilities of that ship.

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,777
Since the Nadesico
is the greatest ship
in the UEAF arsenal,

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,900
I guess that’s why we’re
always where we are.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,529
In the midst of fighting.

7
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,534
You don’t want to know what
I think of military wisdom.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,237
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,932
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,499
‐ Once again, the Nadesico
was placed at the front

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,340
of the UEAF assault formation

12
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,265
and the enemy singled us out
as if we killed their parents.

13
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,644
It looks like the Jovians
want to play rough.

14
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,351
Well that’s fine with me.

15
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,813
‐ Onward comrades.

16
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,981
For the future of our planet

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,350
depends on our
gallantry in battle.

18
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,188
‐ Oh yeah whatever.

19
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,313
‐ Let’s do it.

20
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,607
‐ And not get shot.

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,400
‐ It’s time to make
the rent payment.

22
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,994
(upbeat music)

23
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,322
‐ [Intercom] All
Aestivalis have taken off.

24
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,827
All units engage at will.

25
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,116
‐ Launching missile barrage now.

26
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,005
Huh?

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,630
(yelling)

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,670
(dramatic music)

29
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,005
‐ Where are they going?

30
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,380
‐ [Intercom] They’re
going everywhere.

31
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,838
(explosions)

32
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,597
‐ Those damn slimy, lizard,
kill bastards got us.

33
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,062
I guess we’re done for.

34
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,693
‐ [Man] Um sir, we were
just shot by the Nadesico.

35
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,941
‐ Huh, say what?

36
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,941
Those bastards.

37
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,029
(dramatic music)

38
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,862
‐ Huh, huh, what’s
happening out there?

39
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,907
‐ [Ruri] Our
Aestivalis are shooting

40
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,161
at our own ships, Captain.

41
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,701
‐ They’re shooting
at friendlies?

42
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,954
‐ The attack guidance system

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,575
doesn’t seem to
be malfunctioning.

44
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,374
The Nadesico’s
Aestivalis are attacking

45
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,615
what it perceives
to be enemy units.

46
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,538
‐ But, but the
enemy’s over there.

47
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,746
‐ The Nadesico Aestivalis
are attacking both the enemy

48
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,878
and the UEAF units, Captain.

49
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,384
‐ Have they lost their minds?

50
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,467
Stop fighting immediately.

51
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,091
‐ [Ruri] The enemy is
too close, Captain.

52
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,059
If we stop firing now, our
entire side may be wiped out.

53
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,469
‐ Oh tell them to to
shoot at the Jovians.

54
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,888
Just at the Jovians.

55
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,886
‐ Don’t give up team.

56
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,847
Keep trying to engage the enemy.

57
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,057
‐ Even if we keep
shooting at our own side?

58
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,153
‐ At least we’re only shooting

59
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,355
at our own ships half the time.

60
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,495
‐ Yes I’m sure they
appreciate that.

61
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,912
(explosions)

62
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,912
‐ What in the hell
are you doing?

63
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,502
‐ Well at least none of
them have started shooting

64
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,542
at the Nadesico yet.

65
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,875
I guess the best we can do
is weather this one out.

66
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,961
Send out more Aestivalises
as reinforcements.

67
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,588
‐ [Ruri] We have no
more pilots, Captain.

68
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,515
(gasping)

69
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,801
‐ That’s not exactly true.

70
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,505
This is my time to shine.

71
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,104
I’m also a pilot.

72
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,890
And it is the duty of
an executive officer

73
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,313
to serve his captain.

74
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,733
That’s all I want to
do to serve my Yurika.

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,560
I will die to
protect you Yurika.

76
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,555
Attack!

77
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,396
(yelling)

78
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,784
(crashing)

79
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,611
(yelling)

80
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,565
‐ Mr. Aoi.

81
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,614
Please come in Mr. Aoi.

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,080
(explosions)

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,505
(yelling)

84
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,297
(dramatic music)

85
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,009
‐ [Ruri] The fighting that
day was a terrible mess.

86
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,593
Fortunately, the Jovians
were as confused as we were

87
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,507
and pulled out quickly.

88
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,467
Probacouldn’t figure out why

89
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,557
we’d attack ourselves
unless it was some part

90
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,141
of a brilliant trap.

91
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,516
‐ Well at least all of
you made it back safely.

92
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,488
‐ Well it looks like none of
Aestivalis were badly damaged.

93
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,402
(yelling)

94
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,658
Jumping jahosaphat.

95
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,701
What happened to that one?

96
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,074
(grunting)

97
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,948
‐ Jun, why were you
in that Aestivalis?

98
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,825
(grunting)

99
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,834
‐ What is that, sign language?

100
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,624
‐ Baseball hand
signals actually.

101
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,037
I believe he’s saying with
the Nadesico so undermanned,

102
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,998
it was his job to
fill in as a pilot.

103
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,168
‐ Well that’s fine but you
should have worn a pilot’s suit

104
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,257
to cushion you from the inertia.

105
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,681
(grunting)

106
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,009
What the hell’s that mean?

107
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,554
‐ I did it for Yurika.

108
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,599
Steal home.

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,180
‐ Doing it for Yurika is fine,

110
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,306
but you still should have
put on a pilot’s suit.

111
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,852
(grunting)

112
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,557
‐ I don’t want to start
bickering with you

113
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,227
at a time like this.

114
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,975
Yes, yes I think that’s more
than quite enough right now.

115
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,566
(grunting)

116
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,944
‐ What’s he saying?

117
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,278
(grunting)

118
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,743
‐ You should make sure
to put on your seatbelts

119
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,875
when you get in the Aestivalis.

120
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,739
Well except for the
whiplash to his neck,

121
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,198
he appears to be fine.

122
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,616
However he won’t be able to
speak normally for a while.

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,630
Idiots.

124
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,046
‐ Poor Jun.

125
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,585
Take care of yourself.

126
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,299
‐ Thank god no one was fatally
injured in all of this,

127
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,888
but do any of you realize
how much a battleship

128
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,894
like this costs?

129
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,347
‐ Um that one was my bad sir.

130
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,686
‐ Really?

131
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,730
That ship, the Fox
Glove, cost more to build

132
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,194
than the Nadesico.

133
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,944
‐ Uh I shot down 50.

134
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,897
‐ That’s pretty sharp
shooting Hikaru.

135
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,448
‐ Well yes but.

136
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,411
‐ But what?

137
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,700
‐ [Hikaru] Everything
is shot down

138
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,071
had a UEAF insignia on it.

139
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,409
‐ Please stop for
the love of god stop.

140
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,543
‐ I sure hope they
don’t have good lawyers.

141
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,962
‐ Well I set a new fleet
record with 78 units shot down.

142
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,842
That includes
friendly and enemy.

143
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,629
‐ [Mr. Prospector]
62 were friendly.

144
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,094
‐ Man what a bummer.

145
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,722
‐ Um you’ve been unusually
quiet over there Akito.

146
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,550
‐ Um well actually I kind of,

147
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,637
I didn’t shoot as many of
our ships as the others did,

148
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,604
but when I was aiming
for the enemy’s culup,

149
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,942
well I kind of blew up
the UEAF refueling depot.

150
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,769
‐ Do you have any idea how much
it cost to build that depot?

151
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,765
‐ I’m sure that all those
things must be insured.

152
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,778
Aren’t they?

153
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,151
‐ Of course they are.

154
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,277
In point of fact, Nergal
owns the insurance company.

155
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,704
At least no one was killed so
we won’t have to worry about

156
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,704
any wrongful death lawsuits.

157
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,826
(crying)

158
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,255
‐ [Yurika] Well there was
that one case of whiplash.

159
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:42,132
‐ So exactly how did all
of this end up happening.

160
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,462
Why did our Aestivalis
attack the UEAF fleet?

161
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,469
‐ It wasn’t like we
tried to attack them.

162
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,839
‐ We all dearly love our
beautiful blue mother earth

163
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,429
and would never betray the UEAF.

164
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,473
‐ Then was faulty
maintenance at fault?

165
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,386
‐ I’m going to pretend I
didn’t hear that haircut boy.

166
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,346
How dare you question
the ability of our
maintenance teams.

167
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,859
‐ The fact is that we’ve
been fighting continuously

168
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,022
for several months.

169
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,149
It’s possible that
there could have been

170
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:06,857
a maintenance error
due to fatigue.

171
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,777
‐ Look you blonde bimbo.

172
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,323
My men know that when
they screw up, people die.

173
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,158
That’s why every single
process is double

174
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,743
and triple checked
until it’s right.

175
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,947
Got that.

176
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,036
I’m a womanizer and
dead beat father,

177
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,912
but I do my job damn well.

178
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,168
So don’t blame your cherry
ass novice shortcomings on us.

179
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,462
‐ [Ruri] Please, wait a minute.

180
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,544
‐ Huh?

181
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,710
‐ There’s no indication
that either pilots

182
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,208
or maintenance crew
were at fault here.

183
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,169
‐ Then what was the cause Ruri?

184
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,128
‐ I don’t know, but
there’s a ship filled

185
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,637
with UEAF investigators
hailing us now.

186
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,681
‐ They’re sending a message
saying something about

187
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,846
how they think that the
Nadesico defense computer

188
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,525
maybe malfunctioning.

189
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,651
(sirens)

190
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,363
No don’t shoot at them Omoikane.

191
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,111
Those people aren’t our enemies.

192
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,492
‐ Huh?

193
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,859
(yelling)

194
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,528
(explosion)

195
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,164
(groaning)

196
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,491
‐ Oh no don’t look at me.

197
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,196
I didn’t touch a single button.

198
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,037
The escape pod from the research
is requesting assistance.

199
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,542
(explosion)

200
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,594
(groaning)

201
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,381
It’s being ordered
to fire again.

202
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,174
‐ But who is
issuing the command?

203
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,876
‐ I don’t know, Captain.

204
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,128
‐ Please stop firing.

205
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,798
Those people aren’t the enemy.

206
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,677
The UEAF investigation’s
vessel pod is now landing.

207
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,815
(dramatic music)

208
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,233
(sighing)

209
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,981
The investigators who were
accidentally fired upon

210
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,067
were predictably not very calm.

211
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,824
They immediately started
pointing their fingers

212
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,244
at every little minor
problem on the Nadesico.

213
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,994
Some people just like to condemn

214
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,165
the shortcomings of others.

215
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,452
‐ No!

216
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,827
‐ Obviously computers
have the capacity

217
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,412
to learn on their own,

218
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,408
accumulating knowledge
from experience

219
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,419
allows them to determine
the best options.

220
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,212
However, the
Nadesico’s computer.

221
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,455
‐ [Ruri] The Omoikane.

222
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,628
‐ That’s the name
of the computer.

223
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,507
‐ Attaching names to computers
is an idiotic practice

224
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,053
that ended in 20th century.

225
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,467
‐ But it identifies
itself as Omoikane.

226
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,018
‐ I don’t care if it
calls itself Orphan Annie.

227
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,351
‐ In any case, the
Nadesico’s computer

228
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,556
remembers the experience

229
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,686
of breaching the
Earth’s defense lines.

230
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,783
‐ Obviously Nad believes
that the UEAF is it’s enemy.

231
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,951
‐ Which is why it
targeted the UEAF armada

232
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,623
as well as the Jovians.

233
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,869
‐ So it’s behaving like
a disgruntled employee

234
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,704
who resents new management

235
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,328
afteby a competitor?

236
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,497
‐ That’s a nice
analogy Miss Fressange.

237
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,456
Believe I can sympathize
with how it feels.

238
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,297
‐ And that kind of
stress sometimes leads

239
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,881
to destructive behavior.

240
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,966
‐ Normally this stress
would make a system lock up.

241
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,354
If that were the case, we
could simply cut the power,

242
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,931
clear the RAM, and
reset the entire system.

243
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,425
‐ But Omoikane automatically
resets itself anyway.

244
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,438
‐ And that is what we believe

245
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,610
made the computer’s resentment
against the UEAF so strong.

246
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,520
Rather than purging
it each reboot

247
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,490
seems to have
increased its paranoia,

248
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,739
until it felt
compelled to attack.

249
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,491
The only solution now seems to
be a complete system rewrite.

250
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,616
We’ll have to wipe
the memory completely.

251
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,332
‐ Could I say something please?

252
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,832
‐ [Man] Yes.

253
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,005
‐ Resorting to such
jarkonian measures is stupid.

254
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,832
To purge the computer’s
memory in such a fashion

255
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
would mean a complete
loss of all the valuable

256
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,384
and still unanalyzed
information it acquired

257
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,586
during the Nadesico’s
mission to Mars.

258
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,215
‐ The Nadesico is operating
as part of the UEAF.

259
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,264
Any memories from when
the ship was alone

260
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,176
are more trouble
than they’re worth.

261
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,475
‐ The Admiral is right.

262
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,178
It’s humans that fight
to protect the Earth.

263
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,020
Not computers and machines.

264
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,355
Reprogram that thing.

265
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,018
‐ And after that last fiasco,

266
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,898
the ship will
belong to the UEAF.

267
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,825
Therefore, it makes
sense to have the system

268
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,112
purged completely.

269
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,705
We’ll wipe the slate
and start over.

270
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,031
‐ You’re wrong, but
it’s what I expected.

271
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,698
Why is it that adults think

272
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,794
that forgetting
something is a solution?

273
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,250
You can’t just throw
knowledge away.

274
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,292
‐ Ruri’s right.

275
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,665
(gonging)

276
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,383
(triumphant music)

277
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,971
(yelling)

278
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,602
(marching)

279
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,431
‐ Great crazy ball berries.

280
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,726
Is there a proctologist
convention in here?

281
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,940
‐ Switch control to
auxiliary computer.

282
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,732
Initiate installation now.

283
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,226
‐ All that data.

284
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,817
Do you really have
to erase everything?

285
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,072
‐ I’m afraid so.

286
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,613
‐ Yes, yes.

287
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,408
‐ We will eliminate self
awareness from this computer

288
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,410
and the Nadesico will be reborn.

289
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,294
‐ We’ll turn this civilian
zoo into a real battleship.

290
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,122
This overhaul was long overdue.

291
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,328
(jazz music)

292
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,167
‐ Akito.

293
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,753
(spitting)
‐ What’d you do that for?

294
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,129
‐ To get your
attention, of course.

295
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,757
Could I get you to do a
little favor for me please?

296
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,722
‐ No way, I’m not interested.

297
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,803
‐ But why not?

298
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,049
‐ Because I still
haven’t given up

299
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,098
my lifelong of becoming a chef.

300
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,102
And I’ve got to practice
whenever I’m not fighting.

301
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,314
Okay?

302
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,095
‐ But we really need
an Aestivalis pilot.

303
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,397
‐ Well why don’t you ask Ryoko,
Hikaru, Izumi, or Igatzki?

304
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,112
‐ Because we can’t.

305
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,532
‐ Huh?

306
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,110
‐ You’re the only one who
can do it Mr. Tenkawa.

307
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,107
Please help us.

308
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,278
‐ How can you resist that?

309
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,625
(sighing)

310
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,580
‐ Oh man it stinks in here.

311
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,201
‐ [Akito] You’ll get used to it.

312
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,958
‐ Are all men’s rooms like this?

313
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,289
‐ I don’t like it either.

314
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,376
‐ Well since the computer
center is occupied

315
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,209
and we can’t do this
from the bridge,

316
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,715
you’ll have to live
with it for a bit.

317
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,456
(yelling)

318
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,458
Watch where you’re stepping.

319
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,918
I’ve got a figure drying there.

320
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,218
‐ [Group] Huh?

321
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,221
‐ So can you really handle this
debugging from your PC unit?

322
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,435
‐ It just so happens
that I’ve accessed

323
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,265
the central computer
system several times

324
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,600
from this terminal already.

325
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,945
So popping back into the
system should be a snap.

326
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,061
And there we are.

327
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,817
(triumphant music)

328
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,608
‐ An Aestivalis.

329
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,111
‐ Why’s it wearing a smock?

330
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,532
‐ It’s a maintenance program.

331
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,402
It lives inside the
computer’s memory,

332
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,197
hunting down and
repairing broken parts

333
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,663
whenever it finds them.

334
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,332
It’s kind of like a
cyberspace, superhero janitor.

335
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,830
‐ That’s very strange.

336
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,373
‐ Excuse me, you got a
problem with my tastes?

337
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,077
Now then, by
hooking this program

338
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,537
into that virtual reality
simulator interface,

339
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,209
you’ll actually be
able to move around

340
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,958
like a cyberspace warrior.

341
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:00,878
‐ I’m ready sir.

342
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,167
‐ Alrighty then.

343
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,720
Let’s this show on the road.

344
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,933
Tenkawa Aestivalis online.

345
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,102
‐ Sure.

346
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,060
(loading noises)

347
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,194
Huh?

348
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,812
(gentle music)

349
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,443
This is the inside
of a computer.

350
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,736
‐ That’s correct.

351
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,951
This is the computer’s
graphical representation

352
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,200
of it’s own memory core.

353
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,533
Actually it’s modeled after
the central library at MIT,

354
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,698
which rejected me seven times.

355
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,295
‐ So where am I
supposed to go now?

356
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,661
‐ I’ll be your
guide Mr. Tenkawa.

357
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,207
‐ Just tell me where.

358
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,832
‐ Okay go up there.

359
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,337
Turn right.

360
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,839
Straight ahead.

361
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,171
Our destination is the
place where Omoikane’s

362
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,216
self consciousness is located.

363
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,722
That’s the military’s
new program.

364
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,894
It’s installing itself.

365
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,271
‐ I guess it’s time
to send it home, huh?

366
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,351
‐ No, not yet.

367
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,563
If we attack the
new program now,

368
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,154
the installation
will stop too soon

369
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,939
and the Nadesico will
continue to attack the UEAF.

370
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,405
‐ Then what do
you want me to do?

371
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,026
‐ We’ve got to keep moving on.

372
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,401
To the place Omoikane’s
consciousness is located.

373
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,990
‐ Roger.

374
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,283
Are you sure we
shouldn’t try to stop it?

375
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,529
‐ The Captain was right.

376
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,698
You’re very sensitive.

377
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,406
‐ Not to mention gullible.

378
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,206
Holy cow.

379
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,751
‐ That tree represents
the place where Omoikane’s

380
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,747
self consciousness resides.

381
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,918
It represents the ship’s
dreams and ambitions.

382
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,929
‐ I didn’t know that a
ship could have a dream.

383
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,009
‐ Aren’t dreams made
from pieces of memories?

384
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,515
It’s why they can’t
just be thrown away.

385
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,267
Why they must be cherished.

386
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,771
‐ Memories become dreams?

387
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,563
If that’s true, it
explains so many things.

388
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,726
But what about memories
that become nightmares?

389
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,186
‐ You can’t get rid of them,

390
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,316
but you can change them.

391
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,204
‐ How can you change a memory?

392
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,819
‐ Do you see that branch there?

393
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,737
It is only part of the tree

394
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,745
and the flowers on it
are even smaller still.

395
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,448
That branch cannot be cut,

396
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,918
but in time the tree
can grow new flowers.

397
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,629
It’s heart wrenching
to cut them,

398
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,711
but at least Omoikane will
remember who and what it is.

399
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,086
‐ I understand.

400
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,265
‐ Omoikane please
let yourself forget

401
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,553
and when your memories return,

402
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,216
do not let them rule you.

403
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,185
If you can learn how
to pretend to be a good

404
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,177
and obedient child, you can
still be true to yourself

405
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,600
in your own heart.

406
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,031
‐ Do you really think
this is working?

407
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,491
(yelling)

408
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,070
‐ Akito!

409
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,165
(yelling)

410
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,369
‐ What’s wrong Akito?

411
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,831
‐ It’s what we expected.

412
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,330
‐ What the heck was that?

413
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,661
‐ It’s the computer’s
automatic defense mechanism.

414
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,828
A sort of self
preservation program.

415
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,866
‐ Huh?

416
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,210
‐ The computer doesn’t
want to give up

417
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,385
what’s most precious to it.

418
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,383
(yelling)

419
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,456
‐ This is crazy.

420
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:47,758
What?

421
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,676
‐ Gekiganger Three.

422
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,177
‐ Gekiganger?

423
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,933
‐ Yes Omoikane has learned
to associate this image

424
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,516
with all that is good and
right in this universe.

425
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,482
Out of all the data
it has processed,

426
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,942
this is the entity
which it has chosen

427
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,072
as it’s avatar and defender.

428
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,031
That is why only you have a
chance to succeed at this task,

429
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,280
Mr. Tenkawa.

430
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,242
‐ But you can’t really expect
me to fight Gekiganger?

431
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,625
‐ Please Mr. Tenkawa.

432
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,289
You’re the only one
who can possibly do it.

433
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,499
‐ But Gekiganger is unbeatable.

434
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,709
‐ I’m begging you.

435
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,169
‐ Come on Akito.

436
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,789
You can beat that
Gekiganger piece of junk.

437
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,035
‐ What did you say?

438
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,378
‐ You can defeat, I
know that you can.

439
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,844
‐ Ruri please.

440
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,422
‐ I don’t think you’re going
to have much choice about it.

441
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,970
‐ Gekigang beam.

442
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,263
‐ Yikes.

443
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,558
(yelling)

444
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,521
‐ Gekigang cutter.

445
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,929
(punching)

446
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,518
(yelling)

447
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,515
‐ This is completely impossible.

448
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,686
I can’t defeat Gekiganger.

449
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,645
‐ But you can.

450
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,244
Think Mr. Tenkawa.

451
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,279
I know that you know
more about Gekiganger

452
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,165
than Omoikane does.

453
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,370
‐ I understand now.

454
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,159
It’s a virtual world.

455
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,293
Yeah.

456
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,423
Gekiganger charge!

457
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,630
(dramatic music)

458
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,883
Now we’re evenly
matched in power.

459
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,723
Gekigang beam.

460
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,798
(explosion)

461
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,886
Gekigang kick.

462
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,852
(explosion)

463
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,979
This is getting us nowhere.

464
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,904
‐ Actually the odds are against
us since you’re only human.

465
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,942
‐ No that’s his advantage.

466
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,947
Mr. Tenkawa has know
about and loved this robot

467
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,359
since he was just a child

468
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,737
and it must hold a very
special place in his heart.

469
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,454
That love can’t be defeated.

470
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,954
It can’t.

471
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,196
‐ Gee I like how you put that.

472
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,248
It really does hold
a very special place

473
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,422
in my heart, you know.

474
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,079
And!

475
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,378
(dramatic music)

476
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,513
Did you know that episode 28,

477
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,343
Gekiganger became
Gekiganger five.

478
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,299
And that’s not all.

479
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,099
Then there’s the
legendary unused sequence

480
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,391
to transform into Dragonganger.

481
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,145
(dramatic music)

482
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,824
Dragon blast!

483
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,119
(explosion)

484
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,830
(dramatic music)

485
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,295
‐ Omoikane’s self preservation
reflex has been defeated,

486
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,496
but now we’ve got to
hurry Mr. Tenkawa,

487
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,836
before the military program

488
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,922
finishes erasing
everything else.

489
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,336
‐ But what happens when we
take out the military program?

490
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,097
Won’t someone notice
what’s going on?

491
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,639
‐ Don’t worry about it kid.

492
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,062
I’ve been keeping
those military idiots

493
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,893
completely buffaloed with a
bunch of faked up read outs.

494
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,148
‐ Let’s blow that
thing to ash Akito.

495
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,269
‐ Roger that.

496
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,865
(explosion)

497
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,744
You know the Dragonganger
transformation

498
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,914
was never actually animated.

499
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,583
I only learned about
it by reading the books

500
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,202
that Gai left behind.

501
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,706
‐ Mr. Tenkawa.

502
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,421
I think it’s wonderful
that you still have

503
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,921
a child’s sense of wonder.

504
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,538
‐ Do I?

505
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,880
Well you should know.

506
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,589
‐ Yes I would.

507
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,514
After that, no
abnormalities appeared

508
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,394
in either Omoikane or
in the Nadesico itself.

509
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,722
At least not that the
military ever saw.

510
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,268
‐ Isn’t it beautiful?

511
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,103
My sweet new computer is
going to win this war.

512
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,649
Isn’t that right, Captain?

513
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,151
‐ Yes, of course it is.

514
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,862
‐ Well let’s be
off then, alright?

515
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,322
‐ Yes sir.

516
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,572
Slow speed ahead.

517
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,403
Rightful redder.

518
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:39,988
Take it away, Minato.

519
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,913
(gentle music)

520
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,169
‐ [Ruri] Yes how very true.

521
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,342
(gentle music)

522
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,222
(singing in foreign language)

523
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,226
‐ [Narrator] You won’t believe
what happens next, folks.

524
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,487
Akito says goodbye to Yurika.

525
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,069
My god can this
really be happening.

526
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,574
Your heart will
be torn to shreds

527
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,657
as a tragic twist of fate
causes a hero to leave the ship

528
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,705
and his lady love behind.

529
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,909
Is this the end or
a new beginning?

530
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,457
There’s a lot of action,
mystery, adventure,

531
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,582
and drama ahead,

532
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,588
as our saga steers a new course

533
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,670
towards an unexpected destiny.

534
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,505
In the next shocking episode
of Martian Successor Nadesico.

535
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,724
There is no single truth.
