1
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,601
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] The
present is made possible

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,515
by the ghosts of the past.

3
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,266
And because there is a present,

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,356
there will be a future.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,820
The past, therefore, is
where the future begins.

6
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,152
I wonder if it means that

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,697
in the same context as
we think of breakfast.

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,735
(dramatic music)

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,891
(singing in foreign language)

10
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,960
‐ You can’t avoid it forever.

11
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,919
Don’t you know how bad
this makes you look?

12
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,218
‐ I can live with it.

13
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,841
‐ That’s exactly
the sort of thing‐‐

14
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,389
‐ Don’t believe a thing
that one says, Akito.

15
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,602
You’ll always be our number
one pilot in my eyes.

16
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,813
‐ Maybe you should start being

17
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,063
more concerned about the welfare

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,524
of the Nadesico and her crew.

19
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,606
‐ Our crew is composed of
individual members, Ms. Won.

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,570
‐ And what member
are you thinking of?

21
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,821
‐ Hey, would you
two knock it off?

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,160
‐ I have to object to
how you’re talking.

23
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,818
You need to be more
respectful to your captain.

24
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,948
‐ Don’t complicate
this anymore, Akatsuki.

25
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,544
‐ If you’re not
interested in the captain,

26
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,121
well then, I’ll just have
to take her off your hands.

27
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,915
‐ You wouldn’t let that
happen, right Akito?

28
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,498
‐ This is an
inappropriate discussion.

29
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,964
‐ Well now, do I detect a
certain amount of jealousy?

30
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,805
‐ [Both] Hubba hubba.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,300
‐ You idiots are going to‐‐

32
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,382
‐ Crash into it head on.

33
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,428
‐ Shut up!

34
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,843
(yells)

35
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,019
Okay, I’ve got
visual on the target.

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,103
It appears to be a
miniature enemy shuttle.

37
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,857
Initiating retrieval procedure.

38
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,277
(soft music)

39
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,198
‐ Her ship’s bows that jumped
into our space was unstable.

40
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,703
So it’s possible that the stress

41
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,867
of the transition may
have caused some trauma.

42
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,334
‐ I don’t understand it.

43
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,424
Why would a cute
little girl like this

44
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,581
be out here all alone?

45
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,749
‐ We’ll have to wait for her

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,876
to regain consciousness
to find out.

47
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,962
But it looks like she’s
finally starting to wake up.

48
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,297
Hello, Sleeping Beauty.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,470
‐ Where am I?

50
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,722
‐ You’re onboard the
space battleship Nadesico.

51
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,224
‐ Nadesico.

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,597
‐ That’s right.

53
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,564
‐ [Yurika] Are you okay?

54
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,853
Does anything hurt?

55
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,444
‐ Nadesico.

56
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,561
(screams)

57
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,556
‐ What’s wrong?

58
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,107
‐ Are you okay?

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,862
‐ What am I doing here?

60
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,152
I don’t remember anything.

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,446
Who am I?

62
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,951
‐ Let’s see.

63
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,072
It appears that your
name is Yukina Shiratori.

64
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,658
You have brown hair, brown eyes,

65
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,413
and were found in
a maroon shuttle.

66
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,874
Oh, I hope you don’t mind

67
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,584
that we confiscated your
wallet and identification.

68
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,916
‐ No, give them back.

69
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,501
‐ I’m afraid that
the regulations

70
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,635
do say I have to hold
onto these for awhile.

71
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,214
‐ But I might need them.

72
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,218
You seem like such a nice lady.

73
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,090
Pretty please?

74
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,508
‐ Oh well, I suppose
it’s no big deal.

75
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,391
Now then, you were suffering
from memory loss, right?

76
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,728
‐ Uh‐huh.

77
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,942
‐ Uh‐huh.

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,610
‐ Gosh, I wonder if
my cover’s blown.

79
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,944
‐ Very well then.

80
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,988
‐ I don’t understand.

81
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,655
Why would Yukina put herself
in such horrible danger?

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,255
‐ Don’t worry, justice
always prevails in the end.

83
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,249
‐ Our goal is to
establish peace.

84
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,291
If we don’t win
that, we all lose.

85
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,294
I just hope Yukina knows that.

86
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,796
‐ Don’t you trust your
own little sister?

87
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,549
‐ I don’t really have
a choice, now do I?

88
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,052
I must have faith.

89
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,812
‐ [Yukina Voiceover] Tiptoe,
tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe.

90
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,271
(laughs)

91
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,179
Why would I want to
help bring peace?

92
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,140
(scoffs)

93
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,648
Where are you, Earth woman?

94
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,520
I’ll make you pay for stealing
my big brother’s heart.

95
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,401
‐ I’m going to find
you, Miss Minato,

96
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,526
and then I’ll beat you
into a bloody pulp.

97
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,026
Oops, sneak, sneak.

98
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,832
(sighs)

99
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,162
‐ [Erina] What took you so long?

100
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,081
What’s wrong, isn’t
this your room?

101
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,665
‐ Why are you here?

102
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,630
‐ I’ve been staking you out.

103
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,960
You can’t run from me forever.

104
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,335
‐ I’m not running.

105
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,587
I’ve been filling out my report

106
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,676
on retrieving that shuttle,
not hiding from you.

107
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,222
‐ Are you sure about that?

108
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,557
You’re not thinking
of running again?

109
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,433
‐ Will you just back off?

110
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,187
Not all of us
believe that fighting

111
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,690
is always the right
thing to do, Erina.

112
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,981
Find someone else to play with.

113
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,774
I’m getting tired now.

114
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,148
Would you please leave?

115
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,284
‐ I never said fighting
is the right thing to do.

116
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,701
But what’s wrong with fighting

117
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,069
if someone else attacks you?

118
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,867
‐ I’m not going to answer that.

119
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,489
I’m going to bed now.

120
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,526
‐ Go ahead then.

121
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,115
Sometimes you have
to face the things

122
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,955
you most want to avoid.

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,210
‐ Sorry, I’m not buying it.

124
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,633
‐ So you’re just giving up?

125
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,131
Don’t you understand that people

126
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,672
are going to die if you
don’t fight for them?

127
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,386
Can’t you see that the time
for hesitating is long passed?

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,100
Even a child ought to be
able to understand that.

129
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,641
‐ [Akito] Well I don’t, and
I don’t need your advice.

130
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,734
‐ You need a kick in your pants.

131
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,649
‐ Well then, kick me now
because I’m taking my pants off.

132
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,149
‐ I don’t care.

133
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,730
I’m sick of you acting as
stubborn as your damn father.

134
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,188
(gasps)

135
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,236
‐ What did you just say?

136
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,900
You know something, don’t you?

137
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,198
‐ How dare you come
near me like that.

138
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,118
You jofer.

139
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,665
(gasps)

140
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,118
‐ What in the hell is a jofer?

141
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,211
(panting)

142
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,761
‐ Idiot.

143
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,684
‐ Silently, silently.

144
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,850
Hmm.

145
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,025
Revenge is hungry work.

146
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,653
‐ [Man] It’s Yukina, right?

147
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,652
(gasps)

148
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,113
‐ [Woman] Huh, what
are you talking about?

149
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,112
‐ [Man] That’s the
name of the new girl.

150
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,572
Isn’t that right?

151
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,112
‐ [Woman] She’s a
prisoner, not a recruit.

152
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,157
‐ But she’s cute, right?

153
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,241
‐ She’s also just 13 years old.

154
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,205
‐ Hey, I’ve got patience.

155
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,755
‐ Well this is her picture.

156
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,789
‐ She is pretty cute, isn’t she?

157
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,795
(gasping)

158
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,995
‐ I guess earthlings must
know something about beauty.

159
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,208
‐ [Man] My niece
is about her age.

160
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,047
‐ She’s suffering
from memory loss, huh?

161
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,512
That’s a shame.

162
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,184
Too bad she can’t get
well and head home.

163
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,603
‐ Hopefully the war
will be over by then.

164
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,271
‐ [Man] War stinks, man.

165
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,979
‐ [Man] That it does.

166
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,269
‐ [Man] I sure wish
it would end soon.

167
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,267
‐ This is weird.

168
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,695
Those evil savage earthlings
sound almost nice.

169
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,316
Hold on a second.

170
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,902
Maybe they already know
that I made a break for it

171
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,317
and this is all some
kind of a trick.

172
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,526
Yeah, that’s gotta
be what’s happening.

173
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,157
I’ve gotta find Miss Minato
before they catch me.

174
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,743
Sneak, sneak.

175
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,576
‐ [Woman] So, are you ready
for a hot soak, Minato?

176
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,835
‐ [Minato] I sure am.

177
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,456
‐ I’m done, so you’ll have
the hot tub to yourself.

178
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,503
Watch your posture.

179
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,257
‐ [Yukina] All right.

180
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,688
‐ Oops, I forgot my shampoo.

181
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,150
(groans)

182
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,859
(humming)

183
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,325
(screams)

184
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,408
‐ You Minato, haruka, earth
wanted brother, getting dizzy.

185
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,537
(groans)

186
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,335
(humming)

187
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,881
That’s the theme to big
brother’s favorite cartoon show.

188
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,890
Big brother.

189
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,815
‐ [Minato] Are you all right?

190
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,351
(giggles)

191
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,941
‐ Why were you humming
that theme song?

192
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,115
‐ Mr. Shiratori taught it to me.

193
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,903
‐ I may like my older brother,

194
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,317
but I hate that cartoon.

195
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,574
‐ I thought that
you were his sister.

196
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,951
‐ You seduced my brother to
turn him into a spy, didn’t you?

197
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,498
‐ If I was going to do that,

198
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,959
I’d have gone all the way.

199
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,871
‐ What do you mean, all the way?

200
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,207
‐ I’d have been more
intimate with him, you know.

201
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,174
‐ That’s disgusting.

202
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,974
(groans)

203
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,341
‐ There you go
again, just hold on.

204
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,762
‐ So what’s so special
about my stupid brother?

205
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,719
‐ Hmm.

206
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,944
Well, he has a wonderful
younger sister who loves him.

207
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:04,982
(giggles)

208
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:05,945
‐ Don’t play games.

209
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,942
‐ But I’m not playing games.

210
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,034
You came all this way just
because you were worried, right?

211
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,611
That means he
means a lot to you.

212
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,106
‐ Well, maybe.

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,950
‐ And if you love him so much,

214
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,625
he must be very special.

215
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,791
That tells me a lot about
him right there, see?

216
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,133
Which is why I hope you
won’t be using this.

217
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,461
‐ Huh?

218
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,245
‐ Were you planning on
assassinating somebody?

219
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,337
Whatever were you
thinking of, Yukina?

220
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,006
You know how sad
your brother would be

221
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,685
if you got killed, don’t you?

222
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,598
‐ Just one thing.

223
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,271
When you do it with my brother‐‐

224
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,269
‐ Huh, do it?

225
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,481
‐ [Yukina] Be gentle.

226
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,396
(dramatic music)

227
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,324
‐ The Nadesico is
heading to Earth?

228
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,664
I understand.

229
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,032
Yurika.

230
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,329
‐ Oh my.

231
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,785
‐ Huh?

232
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,014
‐ So, this machine
will allow you

233
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,129
to talk across space instantly.

234
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,046
‐ Actually, it was
supposed to be used

235
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,887
for the peace negotiations.

236
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,642
‐ [Ruri] Oh wow, let
me see, let me see.

237
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,814
(hissing)

238
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,404
(gasps)

239
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,938
(banging)

240
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,317
(hissing)

241
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,951
‐ Ah.

242
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,662
(laughs)

243
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,453
‐ What the heck?

244
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,865
Yukina, is that you?

245
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:45,956
‐ Hi, big brother.

246
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,039
Are you alone right now?

247
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,085
‐ Yes, I am.

248
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,788
But where in the hell are you?

249
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,036
Is your ship intact?

250
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,709
You’re not hurt, are you?

251
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,705
‐ Don’t sweat the small stuff.

252
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,549
‐ Huh?

253
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,514
(gasps)

254
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,183
It’s been a long time.

255
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:00,431
‐ It has.

256
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,935
‐ [Tsukomo] You seem well.

257
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,467
‐ [Minato] Yes, I am.

258
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,098
‐ I’m confused.

259
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,937
I don’t know where to start.

260
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,229
‐ Well don’t begin
with that dumb cartoon.

261
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,195
‐ Huh, why would I bring up
something like Gecky Ganger?

262
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,146
I’m sure Minato didn’t
tune in for tunes.

263
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,448
(laughs)

264
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,993
I made a pun.

265
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,455
(groans)

266
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,996
‐ So, Jovians make puns too.

267
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,869
‐ Sometimes we can be jovial.

268
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,116
(laughing)

269
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,458
‐ Shoot me, please.

270
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,879
‐ That’s pretty harsh, Izumi.

271
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,127
(laughs)

272
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,220
‐ What’s wrong with your eyes?

273
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,013
‐ I really don’t
know why I’m crying.

274
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:44,427
It was very funny.

275
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,518
‐ Your attention, please.

276
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,141
I would like to announce
an important decision

277
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,770
I have just made.

278
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,614
As the captain of the Nadesico,

279
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,321
I believe we need
to keep Yukina here

280
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,401
onboard the ship
for her own safety.

281
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,935
Furthermore, we
will do all we can

282
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,238
to make this peace
treaty a reality.

283
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,242
We must convince
the Earth’s leaders

284
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,624
to negotiate a real
and lasting peace.

285
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,123
We must bring an end
to this awful fighting.

286
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,115
‐ Minato?

287
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,133
On the day when the
peace treaty’s signed,

288
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,382
when peace does come,

289
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,012
would you please grant me the‐‐

290
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,131
(sirens blaring)

291
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,677
What’s going on there?

292
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,801
Yukina!

293
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,135
‐ I don’t know,
but I’d better stop

294
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,302
the transmission for now.

295
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,558
‐ [Tsukomo] No, wait.

296
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,059
‐ Status report, Ruri.

297
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,061
‐ [Ruri] Multiple vessels
are surrounding the ship.

298
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,693
It appears to be a fleet.

299
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,021
‐ [Yurika] That’s the Yugo,
the Horijean, the Majean,

300
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:35,558
and that means‐‐

301
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,900
‐ Hello there, Yurika dear.

302
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,146
‐ It’s my father.

303
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,989
‐ It’s been so long.

304
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,034
‐ Huh?

305
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,487
‐ And you’ve grown bigger.

306
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,986
‐ Ew Daddy, you’re weird.

307
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,157
‐ I was talking overall
growth, of course.

308
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,458
(clears throat)

309
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,119
Headquarters has
sent me to ensure

310
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,087
the safety of the Jovian
named Yukina Shiratori.

311
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,999
‐ And just what does that mean?

312
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,877
The Nadesico is the safest
place for her right now.

313
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,297
‐ I know you mean well but
you must hand her over.

314
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,755
‐ What’s going on?

315
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,675
What’s happening over there?

316
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,135
‐ You’re being
deceived, Tsukomo.

317
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,894
That woman is nothing more
than an evil savage earthling.

318
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,099
‐ What was that?

319
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,307
‐ Have you forgotten everything?

320
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,856
How could you pick that woman

321
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,729
over the most glorious
image of womanhood?

322
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,239
Compared to Miss Nanako,
she’s a stain on the floor.

323
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,952
‐ You take that back.

324
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,415
‐ That doesn’t make any sense.

325
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,332
Why can’t she stay on this ship?

326
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,949
What place could
possibly be safer

327
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,706
than inside the most powerful
warship in our fleet?

328
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,249
‐ I can’t explain these orders.

329
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,294
I’m simply obeying them.

330
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,536
‐ I’m afraid that’s
not good enough.

331
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,459
Prepare to fire
gravity blast cannon.

332
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,126
‐ No!

333
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,055
‐ Target the first blast
between their ships, Ruri.

334
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,136
‐ Aye, Captain.

335
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,639
‐ Wait a second.

336
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,220
Listen to what your
father’s trying to tell you.

337
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,217
‐ Fire one.

338
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,216
‐ Yurika!

339
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,059
‐ All systems shutting
down, Captain.

340
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:56,937
‐ Huh?

341
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,155
(laughs)

342
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,573
(screams)

343
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,152
‐ You don’t have to worry.

344
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:03,986
The ship’s not going to crash

345
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,410
just the master key.

346
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,569
Since it was an
authorized pullout,

347
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,657
the engines went into
a gradual shutdown.

348
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,293
We should land safely in
just a couple of seconds.

349
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,663
‐ I thought only the captain

350
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,417
of the Nadesico could
remove that key.

351
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,371
How did you‐‐

352
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,128
‐ Nope, there’s one other person

353
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,592
who’s authorized to do it.

354
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,421
The chairman of Nergal
supersedes you, right?

355
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,628
‐ Exactly what does that mean?

356
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,258
‐ What it means is that
I’m the chairman of Nergal.

357
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,845
(gasping)

358
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,271
What’s the matter, Captain?

359
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,519
Are you surprised?

360
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,770
(laughs)

361
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,522
‐ Idiot.

362
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,065
‐ I knew he was up to
something like this.

363
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,399
‐ Predictable.

364
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,073
‐ It’s like an episode
of Gecky Ganger.

365
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,323
‐ Was it that obvious?

366
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,106
‐ As clear as a cloudless sky.

367
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,449
You really oughta update
your webpage, playboy.

368
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,455
‐ Well who cares what
you all think anyway?

369
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,198
Well this wasn’t in my plans.

370
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,458
From this moment on,

371
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,579
the Nadesico will be
under my direct command.

372
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,875
When you calm down
and think about it,

373
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,709
having the military
protect this young lady

374
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,214
seems like a good idea.

375
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,126
Oh, and if anyone doesn’t agree,

376
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,716
then they are welcome
to get off the ship.

377
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,970
‐ Don’t worry, kid.

378
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,431
‐ Chairman Akatsuki,
I will be leading

379
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,642
a boarding party
onto the Nadesico.

380
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,483
Let me talk to my
daughter and her crew.

381
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,641
I believe there is no reason

382
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,307
to further agitate matters.

383
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:19,727
‐ Very well.

384
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,111
‐ Don’t worry, your
father will find a way

385
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,324
to work all this out.

386
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,617
What’s happened to
the Jovian girl?

387
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,796
‐ You know I can help you
get out of this, right?

388
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,884
I know you don’t believe me.

389
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,508
But you must realize I can do
more than your captain can.

390
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,597
‐ Maybe.

391
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,259
‐ I guess that’s a start.

392
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,939
I’ve already told you that
I know about your father.

393
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,809
Doesn’t that intrigue you?

394
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,727
(soft music)

395
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,197
‐ It seems even our
allies don’t trust us.

396
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,835
(soft music)

397
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,669
‐ You’re becoming more
like your father every day.

398
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,669
‐ And just what does
that statement mean?

399
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,171
‐ I was just recalling
a time long ago.

400
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,135
Back when your father
and the 10 cowards

401
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,305
first discovered the
truth about the C. C.’s

402
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,344
and the Jovian phase
transition engine factory.

403
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,508
And about how Akito’s parents

404
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,677
just happened to die
in a military coup

405
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,686
that just happened to take
place a few days later.

406
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,269
(soft music)

407
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,654
Was Nergal secretly manipulating

408
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,566
the parties involved in
this affair even then?

409
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,776
‐ What is this
you’re talking about?

410
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,448
I’m afraid I don’t follow
what you’re saying at all.

411
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,408
‐ Then perhaps your memory
needs a little jogging.

412
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,659
‐ [Man] If you’ll recall,

413
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,708
C. C.’s were top
secret at the time.

414
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,592
And Nergal didn’t
want anyone else

415
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,999
to know of their existence.

416
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,297
Professor Tenkawa, however,

417
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,933
was adamant about
publicizing the findings.

418
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,890
And then the professor
and his wife died

419
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,009
under suspicious circumstances.

420
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,306
This is probably a good
time to shut your mouth.

421
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,523
‐ I was an interim commander

422
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,771
of the Mars branch
office at the time.

423
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,983
Looking back on it now,

424
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,614
it’s amazing how
smoothly it all went.

425
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,440
With the military
pullout and the coup,

426
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,485
it seems odd that Nergal
could’ve been so fortunate.

427
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,992
Don’t you agree?

428
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,113
Would you like to
know what I learned

429
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,407
when I accessed the
company’s computer

430
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,871
to follow up on my theories?

431
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,951
‐ Stop it, that’s enough.

432
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,208
‐ The leaders of Nergal
were behind everything,

433
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,789
including the assassination
of the Tenkawas.

434
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:46,877
‐ Akito.

435
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,549
‐ It was because
of what they found

436
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,800
on the ruins on Mars, you know.

437
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,132
‐ [Man] The bullets
and jump technology

438
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,968
left behind by an
ancient civilization.

439
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,013
Even then, my father could see

440
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,467
that whoever controlled
this technology

441
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,056
would control the universe.

442
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,731
So, my father and his advisors

443
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,059
planned out a strategy in which

444
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,314
the bullet and jump system

445
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,305
would fall into the
hands of Nergal.

446
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,529
‐ And my mother and father
were obstacles to that plan?

447
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,902
Is that what happened to them?

448
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,196
‐ Tell me something.

449
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,741
What will happen to
Yukina, Mr. Chairman?

450
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,664
‐ The main Jovian fleet
is now orbiting Mars.

451
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,156
Any mention of
peace negotiations

452
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,077
or an armed assist would
only lower our troops’ moral.

453
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,995
‐ In other words, she
must be eliminated.

454
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,174
‐ [Man] I suppose so.

455
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,014
Of course, publicly, we’ll make
it sound much less extreme.

456
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,969
‐ Then I’m afraid you
leave us no choice.

457
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,430
‐ Akito, run for it!

458
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,850
(groans)

459
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,510
‐ [Erina] No, don’t run away.

460
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,430
(gunshots)

461
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,018
‐ Stop shooting.

462
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,193
(groans)

463
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,151
(chuckles)

464
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:51,982
‐ [Man] Captain!

465
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,026
‐ [Yurika] Coming.

466
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,111
‐ [Akito] After
everything we just heard,

467
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,534
you still want me to stay?

468
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,816
‐ [Erina] You mustn’t go.

469
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,697
‐ [Akito] I’m going.

470
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,533
‐ [Erina] No!

471
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,527
‐ Forget it.

472
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,583
The universe doesn’t
revolve around

473
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,414
your wants and desires, Erina.

474
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,209
‐ You can’t go.

475
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,916
Please don’t leave me.

476
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,843
(dramatic music)

477
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,843
‐ I’m sorry.

478
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,514
(sobbing)

479
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,386
‐ [Man] Freeze!

480
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,352
‐ Damn it.

481
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,476
(groans)

482
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,602
‐ Time to dance.

483
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,980
(yelping)

484
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,398
‐ Time to leave.

485
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:39,992
‐ Are you afraid?

486
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:43,909
‐ [Akito Voiceover]
I’ll protect her,

487
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,583
no matter what the cost.

488
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,543
‐ [Woman] All right, everybody.
