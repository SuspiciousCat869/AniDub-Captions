00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,104
‐ [Narrator] Discovering
that our enemies

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,976
are in fact the
descendants of humans

3
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,363
who were banished to Jupiter
seems to have been a shock

4
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,612
for most everyone here.

5
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,991
Meanwhile, some people
are getting closer

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,990
while others are straying apart.

7
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,032
A lot sure happens on this ship.

8
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,793
(Japanese music)

9
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,999
With the Y unit attached,
the Nadesico now has four

10
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,959
phase transition engines.

11
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,589
That ought to make her
an invincible battleship.

12
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,255
At least, that’s what
we’d like to say.

13
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,144
But to be honest, things
aren’t looking so good.

14
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,980
Right now, we’re on
our way to a rendezvous

15
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,813
with the mobile space
dock ship The Cosmos.

16
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,939
Hopefully we’ll still
be able to dock with her

17
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,535
despite the changes we’ve made

18
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,822
to the ship’s structure.

19
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,905
‐ [Yurika] Oh, where
is everybody, Ruri?

20
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,582
‐ From what I understand,
the NERGAL supervisors

21
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,162
received a message
from the main office

22
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,498
and are going
through the budget.

23
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,043
Everyone else on the staff

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,916
is getting crisis counseling
from Miss Fressange.

25
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,422
‐ Crisis counseling?

26
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,304
‐ The crew is upset about
the new revelations.

27
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,971
‐ You mean because they
found out that our enemies

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,969
were humans just like us?

29
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,011
‐ Most of the Nadesico’s crew

30
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,394
joined believing
that we were fighting

31
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,603
a group of hostile aliens
called the Jovian Lizards.

32
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,063
It would seem that
learning otherwise

33
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,894
has been very
traumatic for them.

34
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,849
‐ I understand how they feel.

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,189
But if everyone feels that way,

36
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,822
then what about a pilot
like my sweet Akito.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, my poor Akito
must be suffering.

38
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:19,275
Oh, oh, I must go
and ease his anguish.

39
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,326
Yes, I must go to him
in his time of need.

40
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,371
I should solace him,
soothe his fevered brow.

41
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,957
Ruri, take care of everything
here for me please.

42
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,089
‐ She never learns, does she?

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,461
‐ I’m a soldier, so
it doesn’t matter

44
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,757
that the enemy are humans.

45
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,051
I won’t reject the war
just because of that.

46
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,715
But I do have to
admit I feel deceived

47
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,644
by the military as well.

48
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,891
‐ Yeah, I understand
how you feel.

49
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,222
‐ Akito, where are you, Akito?

50
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,644
‐ Yurika?

51
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,557
‐ I am here in
your time of need.

52
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,557
Akito, where are you hiding?

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,067
‐ See, never fall in
love with a soldier, kid.

54
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,861
‐ And that’s why men
are always worthless

55
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,493
when you need them.

56
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,030
They’re only good for one thing.

57
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,863
‐ Akito, your angel awaits you.

58
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,068
‐ So is that what
you’re going to talk

59
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,198
to Miss Fressange about?

60
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,084
‐ Well, you know
I’ve always felt

61
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,121
that the most important thing

62
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,164
is to be wanted by somebody.

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,076
When I was a voice actress,
I always told myself

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,456
that everybody loved
me before I started

65
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,794
a recording session.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,668
‐ You used to be
a voice actress?

67
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,754
I thought you sounded familiar.

68
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,088
‐ Akito, please answer me.

69
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,005
‐ So were you in
Tentacle Love Goddess?

70
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,641
‐ Akito?

71
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,142
Akito?

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,095
‐ [Doctor] So you’re a
pilot who has to fight them

73
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,434
on the actual
battlefield, right?

74
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,520
‐ Pilot, I’ve found
him, stand aside, men,

75
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,274
black captain’s here.

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,030
Oops.

77
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,030
‐ So do you enjoy playing
doctor, Miss Fressange?

78
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,912
‐ Not really, but hearing
other people’s problems

79
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,410
takes my mind off my own.

80
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,622
‐ I guess you need a
lot of patients then.

81
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,544
(chuckles)

82
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,542
‐ Right, next patient.

83
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,884
Huh, you’re not next captain.

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,629
‐ Has Akito visited you yet?

85
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,963
‐ No, he hasn’t.

86
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,802
And neither has Ryoko.

87
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,594
‐ Huh?

88
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,755
‐ [Doctor] And they’re alone.

89
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,263
(chuckles)

90
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,055
‐ All alone?

91
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,847
I’ve got to hurry, no.

92
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,472
‐ Oh, captain?
‐ Huh?

93
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,679
‐ What wonderful timing, we
needed to speak with you.

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,520
‐ Could you bring this up later,

95
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,855
I’m kind of busy.

96
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,479
‐ We have a major issue
we need to discuss.

97
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:15,975
‐ It’s rather delicate.

98
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,485
‐ Such long faces,
what’s with you two?

99
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,078
There’s no point in
getting all neurotic now.

100
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,831
I’m out of here.

101
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,706
‐ Just when I start
to think we can win,

102
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,005
it has to come out that
this war is no more noble

103
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,168
than any other.

104
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,475
I can’t believe we fell for it.

105
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:45,009
‐ We did, but I’m committed
to winning this thing.

106
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,056
‐ You’re stronger
than I thought, Akito.

107
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,642
‐ You’re just saying that.
‐ It’s true, believe it.

108
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,937
‐ Hey, Hikaru.
‐ Hi, Yuri‐pie.

109
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,151
‐ [Yurika] Mr. Uribatake
has been embezzling?

110
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,783
‐ Yes, that seems to be
the only explanation.

111
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,361
We’ve been lenient with his
accounting irregularities

112
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,948
in the past, as they’re
inevitably attributed

113
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,832
to the cost of the
devices he builds.

114
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,909
But this time, well, exactly.

115
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,617
And as I understand the rumor,

116
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,746
he’s become very familiar
with a certain female member

117
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,536
of the crew.

118
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,629
‐ Hikaru Amano.

119
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,012
‐ Well, in any case, I
think that we all agree

120
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,680
that a special investigation
is in order here.

121
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,349
‐ I agree, but the admiral’s
been locked up in his room

122
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,139
talking to Headquarters all day.

123
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,892
I think we should
handle this ourselves.

124
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,774
‐ A wise decision, captain.

125
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,483
If the admiral ever finds out,

126
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,401
we would never
hear the end of it.

127
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,609
‐ That is all.

128
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,728
‐ It’s just not fair.

129
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,900
Why didn’t you warn me?

130
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,199
Why didn’t you warn me, papa?

131
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,079
‐ What now, hold on a second,
why are you dragging me

132
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,041
into this embezzlement
investigation?

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
‐ Because it may have
something to do with romance

134
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,037
and how men think, of course.

135
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,794
And you know I can’t
understand any male minds

136
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,088
except for yours, Akito.

137
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,210
‐ Yeah, right.

138
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,666
But this is just too bizarre.

139
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,377
Hikaru and Uribatake?

140
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,797
‐ I know, I can’t
think of any two people

141
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,348
who would be more mismatched.

142
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,679
But re;ationships like
yours and mine are unique.

143
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,935
‐ Yeah, right.

144
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,936
‐ Oh, yes.
‐ Bet you didn’t know

145
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,521
I could do that, did you?

146
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,444
‐ [Woman] You’re so good
with your hands, can I try?

147
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,774
‐ [Man] Sure, now
remember how you hold it

148
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,940
makes all the difference.

149
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,988
‐ Like this?
‐ No, you need to be

150
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,821
more gentle, that’s it, oh yeah.

151
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,658
Now you’ve got it.

152
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,251
‐ Why are you
pussyfooting out there?

153
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,169
‐ Hi.

154
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,422
‐ Wow, that looks almost real.
‐ I know.

155
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,425
That’s why I’m having
Yuri‐pie teach me

156
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,717
how to modify plastic models.

157
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,841
Look, Sailor Aestivalis.

158
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,100
‐ I thought I was an easy date.

159
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,259
‐ What scale?
‐ 148.

160
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,058
Do you wanna try your
hand at it too, Tenkawa?

161
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,352
‐ Can I?
‐ Well, of course.

162
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,807
Building models is
the ultimate hobby

163
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,477
for the mature male.

164
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,523
It takes a skilled mind, a
steady hand, and a keen eye.

165
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,819
And it’s a lot less
expensive than collecting

166
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,743
the real thing.

167
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,739
‐ What are you doing?

168
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,701
‐ Bullet hits, or at least
that’s what they’ll be soon.

169
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,743
I just need to file
off the edges a little

170
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,745
and add a few details
with some textured paint

171
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,117
and voila, isn’t that realistic?

172
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,714
‐ It’s very
realistic, maybe too.

173
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,013
‐ [Hikaru] So captain, did you
have some business with us?

174
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,430
‐ Oh, that’s right,
Mr. Uribatake,

175
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,009
is this what you’ve been doing
with the money you embezzled?

176
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,768
Somehow, I don’t think
that ah is an answer

177
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,639
that accounting will accept.

178
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,686
I demand that you show
me where all this money

179
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,691
has been going.

180
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,980
Whoa, a giant Aestivalis?

181
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,605
‐ Yeah, this is a
little prototype

182
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,692
I’ve been throwing
together in my spare time.

183
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,197
An Uribatake original.

184
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,319
I call it the X‐Aestivalis.

185
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,316
That’s X‐tivalis for short.

186
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,868
‐ Well, it’s really big.

187
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,622
‐ And extremely expensive.

188
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,834
‐ That’s right, Captain.

189
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,833
It’s equipped with an
advanced custom generator

190
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,575
with a gravitron wave
energy conversion efficiency

191
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,420
five times that
of the old model.

192
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,705
A mechanical juggernaut

193
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,168
with the mobility of
the standard Aestivalis

194
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,256
and the power of the
lunar surface frame.

195
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,684
It’s an even match for one
of the Jovian Goliaths.

196
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,352
However.
‐ What?

197
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,273
‐ I was building
it to fight aliens

198
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,193
and just can’t imagine using
it to kill other humans.

199
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,070
‐ That it, that’s
it, it’s perfect.

200
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,069
I want this weapon finished,

201
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,861
I’m ordering you to
complete it as fast

202
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,574
as you possibly can.

203
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,816
‐ But why admiral?

204
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,076
‐ Because I’ve just learned
that I may be demoted.

205
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,619
‐ [All] Huh?

206
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,044
‐ If you people hadn’t
discovered the true identity

207
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,750
of our enemy, I
wouldn’t be in danger

208
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,712
of losing my rank.

209
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,420
Well I won’t go down
without a fight.

210
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,591
I’m going to find
something worthwhile

211
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,088
to get the admirals to
notice, and here it is,

212
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,922
Aestiva‐X.

213
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,587
‐ That’s X‐tivalis.

214
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,175
‐ Well, whatever
you wanna call it,

215
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,969
just so long as the
dumb thing works.

216
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,855
All that matters is that
the top brass notices me.

217
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,681
‐ You mean you’re going
to steal my X‐tivalis

218
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,516
to protect your position
on the pecking order?

219
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,521
‐ That’s exactly what I’m doing.

220
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,113
I’ll do whatever it takes to
keep me on top of the stack.

221
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,782
And anyone who gets
in my way is history.

222
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,741
Now I’m ordering you to finish
this new weapon at once,

223
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,901
do you understand?

224
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,121
‐ They told me that
someone else confessed.

225
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,753
But I wonder, could
it have been him?

226
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,878
‐ [Announcer] Reversal of
fortune, kyugan nunchuk.

227
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,338
‐ Well, look at that.

228
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,549
Looks like Akito is finally
confronting the admiral.

229
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,308
‐ Those movies are so cool.
‐ Oh just look at you, Junpei.

230
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,268
‐ Would you mind turning
off that idiotic cartoon,

231
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,024
it’s really annoying and
the main character’s voice

232
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,019
gets on my nerves.

233
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,610
‐ It’s fine as it is.

234
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,903
‐ Can’t you follow a
simple instruction?

235
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,987
‐ Can you afford to lose
the only willing pilot

236
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,074
for your X‐tivalis.

237
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,618
‐ So why did you
ask me to come here?

238
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,162
‐ It’s about the death of the
person who loved this series

239
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,498
and how he died, Jiro Yamada.

240
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,632
I want to know who
killed Gai Daigoji.

241
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,750
‐ Gai Daigoji?

242
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,956
‐ He’s murdered,
that was my teacher,

243
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,956
how is that possible?

244
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,680
(upbeat music)

245
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,854
‐ Gai Daigoji.

246
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,150
Who was that?

247
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,020
Wait, wait, I’ll
remember real soon.

248
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:37,068
Hmm, let’s see, oh, I think
I’m remembering something.

249
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,707
That fellow killed
in the warehouse,

250
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,634
are you still obsessing
on that silly incident?

251
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,552
Everything happened exactly
as it’s said in my report.

252
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,222
‐ Are you so sure
about that, sir?

253
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,802
‐ I believe I said so.

254
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,185
‐ That’s the truth?
‐ That’s the truth.

255
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,051
‐ Is it, now?

256
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,390
The truth can be a
very dangerous thing
to unlock, Admiral.

257
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,394
That’s something I imagine
you’re discovering.

258
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,065
I’m going to learn
what happened.

259
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,896
I swear that I’m going to
dig up the truth about Gai.

260
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,402
‐ I have nothing
else to say to you.

261
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,405
It’s time for you to move on.

262
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,026
(Japanese music)

263
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,451
‐ Looks like a draw.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,040
‐ Can I borrow some tea
strainers, Miss Helme?

265
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,252
‐ Tea strainers,
to do what with?

266
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,133
‐ Snow for our diorama.

267
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,594
Oh, this is great,
all of it’s here.

268
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,425
‐ The tiny crystals
and baking soda

269
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,890
make for a totally convincing
snow effect in dioramas.

270
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,930
Just look at how they
glitter, it’s almost...

271
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,646
‐ Huh, what’s wrong?

272
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,658
‐ Hikaru, I‐‐
‐ what are you doing?

273
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,871
What are you doing
playing with plastic toys?

274
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,291
Why aren’t you working
on my Aestiva‐X?

275
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,792
‐ Oh, I finished that already.

276
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,621
‐ What?

277
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,326
‐ Yes, but‐‐
‐ yes, but what?

278
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,168
What do you mean a
complete writeoff?

279
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,965
‐ There were design problems.

280
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,128
The energy amplification
systems just didn’t work.

281
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,676
The feedback
reflecting increased

282
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,891
gravitron wave
conversion efficiency

283
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,300
has gotten really bad.

284
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,220
The unit won’t be able
to handle the stress.

285
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,847
I wanted to have this thing
have a showstopper armament,

286
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,056
an X cannon, so I gave it
a gravity blast cannon.

287
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,405
But if it were to
actually charge up
energy to fire the gun,

288
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,651
it’d blow up.

289
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,484
Still, it was really
just a little pipe dream

290
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,688
I cooked up as a hobby,

291
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,779
not a full scale
development project.

292
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,953
Oh well, I‐‐

293
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,451
‐ You’re not going
to give up yet.

294
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,082
The Aestiva‐X is my only
way out of this mess.

295
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,581
I’m at the edge of my
cliff, the end of my rope.

296
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,793
And if you don’t get
back to work and fix it,

297
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,924
I’ll nail your worthless
eye to the wall.

298
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,091
‐ Break it up.

299
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,130
Behave yourself, Admiral.

300
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,173
An officer should conduct
himself as befits his position.

301
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,389
‐ Sir, we’re closing
the cafeteria now.

302
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,637
‐ There was a time once.

303
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:17,818
A time when I believed in
justice, righteousness.

304
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,213
(sighs)

305
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,843
‐ I’ve gotta take a break.

306
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,553
‐ Has anyone ever told
you that you’re cute

307
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,922
with your glasses off?

308
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:45,969
‐ Come on, that
sounds like something

309
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,762
from a 100 year old
romantic comedy.

310
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,138
No writer today would dare
use a line that stale,

311
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,774
not even in a cartoon.

312
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,062
So what are you
saying, Yuri‐pie?

313
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,574
‐ I really don’t know, I
guess I was just thinking

314
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,529
that if I had met a girl
like you a long time ago,

315
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,569
I’d probably be a
much happier man.

316
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,237
‐ Like me, oh you’ve
got to be kidding me.

317
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,244
‐ Don’t be so sure of that,

318
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,914
it’s really not that
far‐fetched at all, you know.

319
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,293
Having someone who
understands your hobbies,

320
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,833
someone who you
can have fun with.

321
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,834
Someone who actually gets the
same jokes and references.

322
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,247
‐ Well, it is more fun if
your tastes are similar.

323
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,296
‐ Think so?

324
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,011
‐ I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t.

325
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,419
And I’m sure that you’ll make
some woman very happy someday.

326
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,930
‐ Think so?

327
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,771
Hikaru, there’s something
I’ve been wanting to say.

328
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,179
To tell you the truth‐‐

329
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,097
‐ We should stop.

330
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,185
I wanted to be close
to you without having

331
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,771
that come between us.

332
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,266
People misunderstand
me all the time.

333
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,980
I don’t know why.

334
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,440
But that’s not
what I had in mind

335
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,070
when I started coming here.

336
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,865
I mean, sharing a
hobby is different

337
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,078
from sharing a life and
a relationship, isn’t it?

338
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,449
‐ I suppose it is.

339
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,748
‐ Friendship and love
are separate things.

340
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,710
I only realized that after I
moved out on my ex‐boyfriend.

341
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,631
‐ You mean you’ve actually
lived with a man before.

342
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,553
I guess I really
am an old fossil

343
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,431
and you’re a modern
girl, after all.

344
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,469
(laughs)

345
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,473
‐ I’m sorry, Yuri‐pie.

346
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,815
I’ll make this the
last time I come here.

347
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,653
(machine humming)

348
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,621
‐ [Woman] Cosmos identification
signal confirmed.

349
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
‐ Confirm rendezvous point.

350
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,962
All mechanics prepare
for docking procedure.

351
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,264
‐ It’s the enemy.

352
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,682
‐ Huh, what was that?

353
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,801
‐ It’s time to
launch the Aestiva‐X.

354
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,677
‐ Admiral.
‐ Let’s get Kiga in.

355
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,025
‐ Huh?

356
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,929
‐ Can you hear
tomorrow scream ho.

357
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,356
Can you listen to our souls
yelling let’s go past this.

358
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,861
We will come back to all.

359
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,742
With the hand we play, let’s
go get in danger, three.

360
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,658
Beware accursed Jovian Lizards
who threatened the earth,

361
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,992
I am here.

362
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,831
‐ If we don’t stop him,
the Cosmos is doomed.

363
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,124
‐ But he’s faster than us.

364
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,207
‐ Can’t we just shoot
him and be done with it.

365
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,384
‐ We’ve been ordered to
bring him back alive.

366
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,131
‐ But why, why is he doing this?

367
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,386
‐ There is no enemy that can
withstand true righteousness.

368
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,681
The corrupting forces of evil
incarnate must be destroyed.

369
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,434
Feel the might of
true righteousness.

370
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,390
‐ Has he completely flipped out?

371
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,650
‐ Now what?

372
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,019
‐ We’ll just have to go
in and drag him back.

373
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,936
‐ It’s too late, fall back.

374
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,686
He started charging up
the energy, it’s too late.

375
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,993
(screams)

376
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,162
I’ve got to stop
the Jovians now.

377
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,951
Hold on, hold on my
precious Aestiva‐X.

378
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,961
Captain Danger.

379
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,754
‐ [Man] The friend of
justice is here to aid you.

380
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,956
‐ It’s Yamada.

381
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,127
‐ Yes, but I no
longer use that name.

382
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,296
For now, I am truly Gai
Daigoji, angel of mercy.

383
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,347
‐ After what I did to
you, you’ll help me?

384
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,929
‐ He who is truly righteous
has no memory of evil.

385
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,307
Now let us be brave
and together preserve

386
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,945
true righteousness.

387
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,270
‐ Gai.

388
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,114
‐ I managed to get an
audio link through, ma’am.

389
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,399
‐ Link us.

390
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,732
‐ Thank you, Gai.

391
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,607
‐ Gai, did he say Gai?

392
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,785
‐ Now, let’s do it.

393
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,236
(screams)

394
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,478
‐ There’s no betrayal as painful

395
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,310
as the one that takes away the
dreams hidden in your heart.

396
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,436
‐ Are you talking
about the admiral?

397
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,153
‐ In the end, I think it
really applies to us all.

398
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,944
Like how a crusade
to save our race

399
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,528
turned out to be
just a dirty war.

400
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,658
Life can be pretty harsh.

401
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,367
‐ I suppose so.

402
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,957
‐ Still, at least the
diorama is finished.

403
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,253
‐ They look amazingly real.

404
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,668
‐ Yeah, but I intentionally
didn’t make them as realistic

405
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,009
as I could’ve.

406
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,633
‐ I’ve been in love
with machines of war

407
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,508
for as long as I can remember.

408
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,045
But it’s the machine part I love

409
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,520
so I left the blood and
violence and death out.

410
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,521
‐ That’s very profound.

411
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,021
‐ It’s like I said, this is
a hobby for mature adults.

412
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,935
Hey, what are you writing there.

413
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,397
‐ I was going to customize
this into Gai’s Aestivalis.

414
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,109
‐ I see, but I don’t
remember the word Gai

415
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,528
being written
anywhere on his ST?

416
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,529
‐ Are you positive?

417
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,040
‐ It happens all the time.

418
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,750
You think you’ve got
this perfect memory,

419
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,581
but you don’t realize
that you’ve actually

420
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,077
been rewriting it in your mind.

421
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,128
Still, that’s probably
not such a bad thing.

422
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,840
‐ Mr. Uribatake, I wish to
discuss a certain discrepancy

423
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,841
in some of your models
that’s been bothering me.

424
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,804
As you can see, your
sculpture of Ruri is rather,

425
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,715
and your sculpture of
me seems to be lacking,

426
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,967
will you please tell him, Akito?

427
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,557
‐ What, how would I know
anything about that, you nut?

428
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,853
‐ I’m ordering you

429
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,516
to make this figure
structurally accurate.

430
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,404
And maybe you can make these
arms a little thinner too.

431
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,613
(screams)

432
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,235
‐ Woman, I worked
on that for hours.

433
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,867
‐ I’m so sorry, forgive me.
‐ God may forgive you,

434
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,413
but I certainly won’t.

435
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,464
‐ Help, Akito, help me.
‐ Stop dragging me into this.

436
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,920
‐ I’m busted.

437
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,426
(Japanese pop music)

438
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,150
‐ [Narrator] Hello, everybody.

439
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,695
I’m (speaks foreign language),

440
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,150
the little magic girl princess

441
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,318
from the kingdom of magic.

442
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,985
So what do you wanna
be when you grow up?

443
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,616
I wanna marry a doctor
or lawyer and, oops.

444
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,583
Anyway, wouldn’t it be
terrible if you found out

445
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,675
that you were actually a
princess, only nobody knew it.

446
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,671
(speaks foreign language)
knows that being a princess

447
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,963
is no picnic.

448
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,666
The title of the
next episode will be

449
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,916
the sound of water is my sound.

450
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,338
‐ [Girl] Idiot.
