00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,564
‐ [Woman] I don’t know
how much Nergal had

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,595
to pay for all the
damage that Nadeisco did

3
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,397
while breaking through
the big barrier.

4
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,483
But it must have
been quite a bit.

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,226
With all the action
violence however,

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,610
there was also love.

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,744
And there is no greater
love than that of those

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,283
who give their lives so
that others may carry on.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,026
Thank you Mr. Yamada.

Gai?

00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,654
Say something!

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,360
You can’t die on me!

We did it, Joe!

31
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,405
Joe what’s wrong?

32
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,504
Joe, snap out of it!

33
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,371
Joe!

34
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,826
‐ I’m sorry Miss Nanako.

35
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,418
It looks like I won’t
be able to take you

36
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,213
to the beach like I promised.

37
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,506
‐ I should go.

38
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,552
‐ Uh huh.

39
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,679
‐ But, don’t you think
that at a time like this,

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,511
my poor Akito should
have his true love

41
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,508
standing beside him?

42
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,849
‐ Oh yeah mama, ooh!

43
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,392
Oh man, just looking
at these specs

44
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,688
gets me hot and bothered!

45
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,521
(laughs)

46
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,524
‐ Aren’t we supposed to
pick up some new pilots

47
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,688
at the space colony?

48
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,784
‐ Oh who cares about that?

49
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,029
These zero G combat
frames are the cat’s meow!

50
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,572
It’s just like Christmas!

51
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,994
‐ You know, about
the pilots, I think‐‐

52
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,875
‐ [Howmei] Personally, I hope
these new pilots all turn out

53
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,412
to be real jerk heads.

54
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,197
‐ [Seiya] You do?

55
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,457
And why is that?

56
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,669
‐ Because they’re all
probably going to be killed

57
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,749
and I’d rather not get to‐‐
‐ Excuse me.

58
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,955
‐ [Howmei] Like them
too much before they do,

59
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,843
you know?
‐ Excuse me.

60
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,339
‐ [Seiya] Mm‐hmm, yep.

61
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:32,961
‐ [Howmei] Mm‐hmm.

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,046
‐ [Seiya] Mm‐hmm!

63
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,381
‐ Ugh!

64
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,335
Excuse me, but as your captain
I have something to say!

65
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,587
‐ Excuse me captain!

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,930
We’re beginning our approach
to the Satsuki Midori

67
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,965
space colony L2.

68
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,267
Your presence is required
on the bridge, ma’am.

69
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,903
‐ [Man] Ah, don’t mind
us, the door was open.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,400
‐ [Man] What have we got here?

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,810
‐ [Man] Well let’s see.

72
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,238
Personal effects
of Mr. Jiro Yamada.

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,570
Give me a hand.

74
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,823
Looks like goes back to Earth.

75
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,824
‐ [Man] Sorry to bother you.

76
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,445
‐ [TV Announcer]
Missing a pilot.

77
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,994
Will they be able to
recover from this loss?

78
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,446
You’ve got to stand
up Gekiganger three!

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,250
Joe!

80
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,080
‐ The L2 colony will be
on visual in one minute.

81
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,629
‐ Alright, lower the
distortion fields,

82
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,303
prepare for docking.

83
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,591
‐ [Megumi] This is the high
mobile battleship Nadesico.

84
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,225
Can you read us Midori two?

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,220
‐ [Man] This is SM2,
we hear you fine,

86
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,722
and that’s a sweet voice
you have, Nadesico.

87
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,064
‐ [Megumi] Are you
ready to receive us?

88
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,969
‐ [Man] That’s a roger
Nadesico, just leave it to‐‐

89
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:28,891
‐ [Megumi] Oh!

90
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,307
Oh my god!

91
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,437
(machine beeping)

92
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,233
‐ [Ruri] Shockwave from the
colony approaching captain.

93
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,818
‐ [Yurika] Ruri, status report.

94
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,735
‐ [Ruri] Damage status running.

95
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,412
Satsuki Midori Two
drifting to our bow.

96
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,872
‐ Mm.

97
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,791
Right, let’s continue
our approach.

98
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,042
(colony explodes)

99
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,632
‐ [Ruri] Engineering
reports moderate damage

100
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,095
to field generator two.

101
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,593
‐ But I was just talking to him.

102
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,006
He was there and then he wasn’t.

103
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,927
‐ [Yurika] Megumi!

104
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,143
Full frequency scan!

105
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,434
There may still be
survivors out there!

106
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,806
‐ Oh, right!

107
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,562
‐ Engineering, fix
that generator!

108
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,194
Ruri, I want a full
quadrant scan for hostiles!

109
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,944
‐ [Yurika Voiceover] If they
attack while our shield’s down,

110
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,444
we’ll be defenseless.

111
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,953
(dejected music)

112
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,995
‐ [Jun] So that’s what
breached our hull.

113
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,633
‐ What do you think
it means, sir?

114
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
‐ I think it means that
we have an intruder.

115
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,798
Sweep the area!

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,010
We’re going to
security condition one!

117
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,420
‐ [Goat] Security alert!

118
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,838
Security alert!

119
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,176
There’s reason to
believe an intruder

120
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,511
has infiltrated the Nadesico!

121
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,808
Damage control crews,
continue your repairs!

122
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,061
All others, remain
at your stations!

123
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,361
‐ [Man] Damn that
evil General Masaka!

124
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,940
Damn him for what he’s
done to my friends

125
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,693
and the Gekiganger Three!

126
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,735
But then, a new and trustworthy
ally joined our team.

127
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,952
His name was Tetsuya Ryazaki,

128
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,199
and with him we formed
Gekiganger Five!

129
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,534
‐ Hmm?

130
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,620
Four space craft approaching
from the stern, captain.

131
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,624
‐ Engineering!

132
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,465
Field status?

133
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,539
‐ Not good, captain.

134
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,793
It’ll be 10 minutes
before it’s back online!

135
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,536
‐ Have it ready in five please!

136
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,457
‐ [Ruri] Increasing
magnification on
incoming bogies.

137
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,672
‐ Ah!

138
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,548
Ahhh!

139
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:26,894
(gasps)

140
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,010
‐ [Joe] Gekigan cyclone!

141
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,349
Ken, finish him off!

142
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,644
‐ [Ken] But Joe, what about you?

143
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,728
‐ [Joe] Don’t worry about me.

144
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,655
Do it!

145
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,651
Ken, Gekigan flare now!

146
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,107
‐ [Ken] Gekigan flare!

147
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,738
We did it Joe!

148
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,743
Joe, what’s wrong?

149
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,577
Joe, snap out of it!

150
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,702
Joe!

151
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,576
Joe!

152
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,502
‐ I’m sorry Miss Nanako.

153
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,998
Looks like I won’t
be able to take you

154
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,254
to the beach like I promised.

155
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,048
(crying)

156
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,761
‐ [Hikaru] Joe!

157
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,591
‐ Huh?

158
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,425
‐ Joe!

159
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,216
(crying loudly)

160
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,059
‐ Huh?

161
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,188
(crying loudly)

162
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,942
‐ Oh, I’m sorry,
are you alright?

163
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,194
You poor man.

164
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,448
(laughs maniacally)

165
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,530
(gasps)

166
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,125
‐ [TV Announcer] Thanks
to the sacrifices

167
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,331
of Joe Umitsubame, General
Masaka has been driven back.

168
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,412
But now Gekigangar Three
is missing a pilot!

169
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,707
Will they be able to
recover from this loss?

170
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,961
Stand up‐‐

171
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,172
‐ Isn’t Joe just
totally most awesome!?

172
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,054
‐ Well, why, um‐‐

173
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,549
‐ I only found out
about Gekigangar Three
a little while ago

174
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,302
but I’m already
completely hooked.

175
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,795
I was thinking about
doing my own version

176
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,967
as an amateur comic book.

177
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,475
What do you think about that?

178
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,256
Only in my version Joe
and Ken would be shonen ai

179
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,808
and then they meet a girl
who looks just like me!

180
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,805
‐ Um, miss.

181
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,595
‐ Huh?

182
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,148
‐ Who are you?

183
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,822
And why were you crawling
around inside my ceiling?

184
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,782
‐ Oh leaping lizards,
I guess you would want

185
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,742
to know that huh! (laughs)

186
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,243
‐ Leaping lizards?

187
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,414
‐ Yeah, it’s a pretty
archaic expression

188
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,084
but I think it suits me
and the situation to a T.

189
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,253
‐ Oh!

190
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,421
(laughs sheepishly)

191
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,710
(sighs)

192
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,127
(laughs sheepishly)

193
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,593
‐ Target is in range.

194
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,673
Ready to fire.

195
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,379
‐ No, wait!

196
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,838
Increase magnification.

197
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,256
It’s an Aestivalis zero G frame!

198
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,135
‐ If it’s one of ours, why
hasn’t it identified itself?

199
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,853
‐ A Trojan horse?

200
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,025
‐ It’s ours.

201
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,731
They just don’t know
the proper code.

202
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,023
‐ How can you be so
positive about that?

203
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,017
‐ Just look.

204
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,816
On the tow cable.

205
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,739
(engine thrusting)

206
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,355
‐ A piece of white
cloth on the cable?

207
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,369
That’s standard
procedure for towing.

208
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,701
But with cars, not spaceships.

209
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,947
‐ And I doubt that the
Jovian lizards could tie

210
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,208
such a pretty little bow.

211
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,166
(engine thrusting)

212
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,506
(machine whirring)

213
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,433
‐ Oh, oh!

214
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,311
Gah, what a stench!

215
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,403
This suit is really ripe!

216
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,850
Catch!

217
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,188
‐ [All] It’s a girl!

218
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,193
‐ Yeah, and I need a shower.

219
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,704
And how about something to eat.

220
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,819
‐ Uh, excuse me.

221
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,816
Just who are you anyway?

222
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,908
‐ And just who the heck
are you, pretty girl?

223
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,584
‐ I’m Yurika Misumaru, the
captain of the Nadesico.

224
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,456
‐ Ohhh.

225
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:44,957
‐ Hey, wait up!

226
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,795
‐ The name’s Ryoko Subaru.

227
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,550
Can I take a shower now?

228
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,420
‐ You were towing
four zero G frames.

229
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,878
Is that all that were left?

230
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,336
‐ I think there’s one more back
in the colony’s hangar bay.

231
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,218
I could only haul four
at a time, you know?

232
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,265
‐ And what about the
other Aestavalis pilots?

233
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,560
‐ You got me.

234
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,353
They could be alive
or blown to bits.

235
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,810
‐ I’m still alive!

236
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,059
‐ Ah!

237
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,358
‐ Hi there, I’m Hikaru Amano

238
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,782
and I’m an Aestavlis
pilot just like Ryoko is.

239
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,573
I’m 18, my blood type is B
and my favorite foods are

240
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,327
pizza crusts and
soggy rice crackers!

241
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,290
It’s so nice to be
working with you!

242
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,790
(blows whistle)

243
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,002
(sighs)

244
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:22,962
(inhales deeply)

245
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,501
(blows whistle)

246
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,915
Um, would you like to
know some more about me?

247
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,462
‐ [All] Uh, no.

248
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,467
‐ Well, I suppose two out
of three isn’t too bad.

249
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,640
‐ [Izumi] It is if
you’re the third.

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,970
‐ Izumi?

251
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,433
Oh, you’re alive!

252
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,143
Where are you Izumi?

253
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,473
‐ [Izumi] Where am I?

254
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,678
Where is anyone really?

255
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,020
Or shouldn’t I say, the
answer is in the box.

256
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:48,978
‐ [Both] Huh?

257
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:49,897
‐ [All] Huh?

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,983
‐ Mm?

259
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,527
(quirky music)

260
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,622
(machine whirring)

261
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,867
‐ I live!

262
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,671
I breathe! (coughs)

263
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,302
(laughs)

264
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,434
Oh, so the cat is alive.

265
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,140
‐ Ah!

266
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:22,433
‐ No!

267
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:24,927
Ah!

268
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,109
There’s no need to
pack me in again Ryoko!

269
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,859
I’ve already been
canned once today.

270
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,317
(laughs)

271
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,153
‐ And that’s Izumi Maki,
pilot number three.

272
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,988
(laughs wildly)

273
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,370
(triumphant music)

274
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,839
(elevator whirring)

275
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,422
‐ [Yurika] As soon as your
Aestavalis have all been checked

276
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,878
and rearmed, I
want you to go back

277
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,716
and search for survivors
and also retrieve

278
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,551
that last zero G
frame from the hangar.

279
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,388
‐ Oh swell, you’re gonna
work us to the bone,

280
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,273
aren’t ya captain bly?

281
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,890
‐ Oh, by the way, I’ve
just remembered that

282
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,435
when I boarded this
ship I kinda broke

283
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,230
through the hull on my way in.

284
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,152
I tried to fix it
with some chewing gum,

285
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,691
but maybe someone
should look at it.

286
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,614
‐ Stand down from
security alert.

287
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,574
‐ So what happened
to these two pilots

288
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,113
you’re supposed to have already?

289
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,119
‐ Well I’m afraid
one was killed,

290
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,081
and the other one is...

291
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,081
‐ [All] Hmm?

292
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,748
‐ You’re kidding!

293
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,710
‐ No, she is not kidding,
and I’m also a cook!

294
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,003
‐ I see!

295
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,456
I knew you didn’t look
like a real pilot at all!

296
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,090
‐ Ah!

297
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,005
That’s right, I’m a cook!

298
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,554
I was only a temp pilot!

299
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,602
But...

300
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,433
But I...

301
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,599
Ah.

302
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,493
(birds chirping)

303
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,325
‐ [Man Voiceover] This
is SM2, we hear you fine.

304
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,950
And that’s a sweet voice
you have, Nadesico.

305
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,946
‐ [Yurika Voiceover] We are
initiating docking protocol.

306
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,460
Are you ready to receive us?

307
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,081
‐ [Man Voiceover] That’s
a roger, Nadesico.

308
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,076
Just leave it to‐‐

309
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,127
(colony explodes)

310
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,960
‐ Ah!

311
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,799
(birds chirping)

312
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,718
‐ [Akito] I can’t
believe that he’s dead.

313
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,806
And I’m the only one who
even cares that he’s gone.

314
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,142
No one cares when
people die anymore.

315
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,900
‐ But that’s not true.

316
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,570
I know that I never stopped
caring about other people.

317
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,319
‐ Yeah, but I don’t think
there are very many people

318
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,202
like you left, Megumi.

319
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,491
‐ You’re wrong.

320
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,072
‐ No I’m not!

321
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,657
It is true!

322
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,623
Even if I lose my
life defending them,

323
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,002
will anyone here even
care when I’m gone?

324
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,329
Gai gave everything he
had to save this ship,

325
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,295
and now it’s like
he never existed!

326
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,955
Sometimes I wonder
if I’m the crazy one

327
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,214
because I don’t
understand how people

328
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,457
can be like that!

329
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,006
I just don’t get it.

330
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,642
(crickets chirping)

331
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:08,849
Huh?

332
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,692
‐ Then I guess I’m crazy too.

333
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,991
‐ Oh, sorry.
(laughs)

334
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,363
‐ I think sometimes
people just have

335
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,987
to hide their feelings.

336
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:26,874
‐ Huh?

337
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,370
Of course, that’s it.

338
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,742
Now I understand it!

339
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,213
I’ve been hiding too.

340
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,542
But not anymore.

341
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,786
I won’t let fear keep
me from piloting!

342
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:39,925
‐ Yeah!

343
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,126
Go for it!

344
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,224
‐ [Man] Come on, come
on, get out of the way

345
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,801
or you’re gonna get stomped!

346
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,558
‐ [Ruri] The gravitational
catapult is ready for launch.

347
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,890
‐ It’s time to suck
some vacuum girls!

348
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,684
‐ You can count on us captain!

349
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,098
‐ Be careful out there!

350
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,647
‐ [Ruri] Graviton
waves are charging.

351
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,941
‐ [Ryoko] Pilot Subaru.

352
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:00,606
Aestavalis launch!

353
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,816
(hopeful music)

354
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,911
‐ [Yurika Voiceover] Oh Akito.

355
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,372
You should have
been leading them

356
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,372
after my words of
confident support,

357
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,753
but I’m so sorry I failed you.

358
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,831
If someone is to
blame, it is me!

359
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,126
For I know that otherwise
you would surely‐‐

360
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,292
‐ [Ruri] Um, captain?

361
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,050
We have another launch request.

362
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,260
‐ You idiot!

363
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,379
You can’t operate a zero G type!

364
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,626
‐ It’s not all
that different from

365
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,509
how you handle the
land engagement type.

366
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,264
The basics are still
the same, aren’t they?

367
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,178
‐ The basics!?

368
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,264
Like when you almost drowned?

369
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,140
You’re nuts!

370
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,016
‐ Of course!

371
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,680
I’m a pilot, you know!

372
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,638
‐ [Seiya] Alright!

373
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,939
Everybody get out of the way,

374
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,270
this idiot’s gonna
press his luck!

375
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,187
(crew screaming)

376
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,201
(determined music)

377
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,617
‐ No live signs, so
where’s the frame?

378
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,162
‐ As I recall it,
it’s to the port.

379
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,157
‐ Stupid port. (laughs)

380
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,080
(growls)

381
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,206
‐ Right!

382
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,002
Well, if we go in we’ll
lose our energy feed

383
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:01,627
from the Nadesico.

384
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,801
Check your batteries!

385
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,683
Eight and a half
minutes worth of charge.

386
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
Thrust to minimum and
conserve your batteries.

387
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,350
‐ It’s like pearl diving!

388
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,851
‐ Pearls before port.

389
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,731
(machinery clanking)

390
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,784
(machine humming)

391
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,453
‐ Ah ha!

392
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,159
I think I just found the pearl.

393
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,565
‐ Alright then.

394
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,448
Let’s get it and get
the heck out of here.

395
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,245
‐ [Akito] Ah!

396
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,579
Let me help you girls!

397
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,923
(screams)

398
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,042
It’s okay, I meant to do that.

399
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:43,919
Oh.

400
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,343
(screams)

401
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,343
Whoa!

402
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,464
Hey, how do I stop this?

403
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,258
What‐‐

404
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,341
What’s this‐‐

405
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,335
Ah!

406
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,310
Uh oh, out of power.

407
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,602
‐ Um, did you know that
if there’s a barrier

408
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,646
between you and the
Nadesico, your power supply

409
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,900
will be cut off?

410
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,233
‐ That’s the first thing
in the basic manual!

411
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,399
‐ Well okay.

412
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,107
So what do we have to do now?

413
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,865
‐ We draw back and punt!

414
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,487
‐ Huh?

415
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:11,782
Ah!

416
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,794
(machine beeping)

417
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,293
Hey, it worked.

418
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,175
‐ [Hikaru] By the way, if
you keep going you’ll smash

419
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,212
into the Nadesico’s
distortion field.

420
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:31,045
‐ Huh?

421
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,255
‐ [Ryoko] Sheesh, where
did they find him?

422
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,846
Alright, let’s get it
and get out of here.

423
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,970
Ah!

424
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,388
It moved!

425
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,096
(dramatic music)

426
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,265
‐ Ah!

427
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
It’s been possessed!

428
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,398
‐ [Ryoko] Huh?

429
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,985
What’s that supposed to mean?

430
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,450
‐ [Izumi] Um, I think
she means the computer’s

431
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,743
been taken over by the lizards.

432
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,750
(dramatic music)

433
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,088
‐ [Ryoko] Damn it!

434
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,012
They’re making us waste
our energy on shields!

435
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,850
(guns fire)

436
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,429
‐ All those guns may
give you more power,

437
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,926
but you must be awkward.

438
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,267
So I’ll take
advantage of my speed!

439
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,361
I am ready for some hand
to hand style fight!

440
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,069
(dramatic music)

441
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,440
(guns fire)

442
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,780
‐ It’s faster than
you thought, Ryoko!

443
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,574
‐ Can’t judge a
bot by its cover.

444
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,078
‐ Um, what are we gonna do now?

445
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,330
‐ We’re gonna turn up the heat

446
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,414
and make some lizard stew!

447
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,407
Yeah!

448
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,498
Can you smell what
Ryoko’s cooking!?

449
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,088
‐ It’s my turn now!

450
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,340
‐ We who are about to die.

451
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,555
(dramatic music)

452
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,265
‐ [Hikaru] Killer move!

453
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,426
Double attack!

454
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,223
Or maybe not!

455
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,059
Yeah!

456
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,646
‐ [Ryoko] Talk about
sucker punches!

457
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:06,941
Yeah!

458
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,152
(dramatic music)

459
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,072
‐ Oh crap!

460
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,863
It’s heading toward
the Nadesico!

461
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,368
The only thing that can
stop it is that cook!

462
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,781
Tenkawa, get that sucker!

463
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,827
‐ Be careful with
your field attack.

464
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,502
‐ I’m not afraid of
anything anymore.

465
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,249
This is the all new Akito!

466
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:25,911
‐ Kick that lizard’s

467
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,168
ass!
‐ Charge!

468
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,464
‐ [Akito] Gai!

469
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,793
For you!

470
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,208
This one’s for you brother!

471
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,432
(dramatic music)

472
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,800
Gekigan flare!

473
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,018
(dramatic music)

474
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,526
(crew cheering)

475
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,196
‐ Thanks!

476
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,026
Huh?

477
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,906
(laughs)

478
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,672
‐ Oh congratulations Akito!

479
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,749
You did it!

480
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,915
I’m so very proud of you!

481
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,844
‐ I couldn’t have done
it without your help.

482
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,262
‐ Um, I shouldn’t be
down here, should I?

483
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,224
‐ No it’s okay.

484
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,263
‐ Akito.

485
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,944
(gentle romantic music)

486
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,941
(gentle romantic music)

487
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,780
(gentle romantic music)

488
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,195
‐ Oh no, I just imagined that.

489
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,203
This must be all
part of a bad dream.

490
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,125
Just a really, really bad dream.

491
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,575
That could’ve never really
happened in real life!

492
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,616
Could it?

493
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,384
I wanna wake up now!

494
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,628
("Being Myself" by
Houko Kuwashima)

(singing in foreign language)

503
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,069
‐ [Announcer] Oh the
bittersweet seeds of fate.

504
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,571
Yurika runs, unable
to face the truth

505
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,864
of what she has seen.

506
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,118
Akito anguishes,
seeking a deeper meaning

507
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,329
to his unwanted destiny.

508
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,700
Jun cries, knowing that
his love is unreturned.

509
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,329
And Ruri, Ruri bemoans the fact

510
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,126
that she is adrift in
space on a ship of fools.

511
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,209
The flames of revolution
sweep across the Nadesico,

512
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,917
as a mutiny turns the ship
into a Bastille in space!

513
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,547
Join us as we go where
no giant robot show

514
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,007
has gone before!
