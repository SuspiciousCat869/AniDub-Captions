‐ Boson showing an exchange

00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,394
‐ Test Aestivalis.

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,390
Are you ready?

15
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,261

Massive amounts of photons,
gravitons and mesons

19
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,984
are being registered.

20

‐ [Man] Aestivalis
monitor, all stats nominal.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,490
‐ All right, I’m about to
contact the jump field.

22
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,491
I am activating sensors now.

23
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,953
‐ [Man] Sensors on.

24
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:39,491
‐ [Pilot] Penetrating field
in three, two, one, contact.

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,420
‐ [Woman] May I inform
you that all attempts

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,210
at organic Boson Jumping
have ended in failure.

27
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,586
‐ Untrue.

28
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,671
In addition to the
proof provided by

29
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,587
the Nadesico’s jump from Mars,

30
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,924
our data indicates
that the croak

31
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,508
has appeared on Mars before
it disappeared on Earth.

32
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,514
Obviously, organic Boson Jumping

33
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,216
doesn’t adhere to your
existing theories, Professor.

34
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,519
‐ Perhaps.

35
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,522
However, your
theory that the CC’s

36
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,904
are the key to Boson Jumping

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,560
seems to have been disproved.

38
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,059
‐ I disagree.

39
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,730
The data that I
collected on the Nadesico

40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,938
proves that organic
Boson Jumping

41
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,647
is possible with humans.

42
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,407
And we know how
the chairman feels.

43
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,872
Therefore, we will continue.

44

45
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,342

about being invited

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,050
to Mr. Akatsuki’s party.

47
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,050
‐ [Woman] I never imagined
Christmas on a battleship

48
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,673
could be anything exciting.

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,128
‐ [Woman] Isn’t
Christmas wonderful?

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,548
‐ [Woman] Yeah, I’m glad I
got to go on the Nadesico.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
‐ Come on, come on.

52
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,723
I see idle hands.

53
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,347
You’ve got to work
faster than that, girls.

54
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,354
If you want to get off
early for the party.

55
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,056
(laughing)

56
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,606
‐ Everyone, let’s
go out and party.

57
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,651
‐ And have a merry Christmas.

58
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,573
‐ Let’s not forget
what’s important.

59
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,493
This is a special time.

60
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,700
‐ It’s a time for
lords bearing presents.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,950
‐ And for lords bearing flowers.

62
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,874
‐ And this lord comes
bearing the champagne.

63
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,502
(laughing)

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,500
(singing in foreign language)

65
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,999
‐ Christmas time for
just me and there.

66
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,762
That looks just
about perfect to me.

67
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,723
‐ I don’t know.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,970
It looks a little crooked to me

69
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,513
and I think your eyes
aren’t big enough

70
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,895
and the perspective’s off.
‐ A Nergal Christmas party?

71
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,142
‐ [Yurika] That’s right.

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,305
I thought it would
be nice if we all

73
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,103
had a bash together
for a change.

74
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,596
‐ But you’re always making
others abash, Captain.

75
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,899
(snickers)

76
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,651
‐ But we’ve already been
invited to the party

77
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,405
Mr. Akatsuki’s giving.

78
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,535
‐ So what’s the
lineup for your party?

79
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,742
‐ The lineup?

80
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,821
‐ I mean, who have
you invited to come?

81
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,948
♪ I’ll be jolly ♪

82
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,783
♪ Fa la la la la la la ♪

83
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,738
‐ Hey, Megumi.

84
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,997
Are you coming?

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,500
‐ Oh I’m sorry, I don’t
think I’ll be there.

86
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,753
I plan on spending Christmas

87
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,542
with someone special
all by ourselves.

88
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,627
Under the mistletoe.

89
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,551
(laughs)

90
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,879
‐ I knew it.

91
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,883
Well if that’s the
way it’s gonna be,

92
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,094
I’ve got my angle.

93
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,264
After all, this is the time for

94
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,632
friendship and stuff, right?

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,800
Sorry, I’ll be busy.

96
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,598
Tenkawa, where are you, Tenkawa?

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,680
‐ Come to think of it,

98
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,928
where did Tenkawa run off to?

99
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,638
‐ [Women] Mm‐hmm.

100
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,818
(singing in foreign language)

101
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,571
‐ [Akito] Maybe I’ll
just hide until Easter.

102
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,282
Do they ask how I feel?

103
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,912
‐ [Woman] Tenkawa, are
you in there, Tenkawa?

104
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,330
‐ [Narrator] What will
become of the future?

105
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,830
Scandals Q‐A‐Q.

106
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,412
This will be our last final‐‐

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,875
‐ The final episode.

108
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,956
I’ve watched every
episode through number 38.

109
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,341
But I just can’t
watch the last one.

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,500
‐ This is perfect.

111
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,207
Behold, my ultimate
party facility.

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,010
We’ve got three
dimensional Twister,

113
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,932
got that mistletoe and
see you spin the bottle.

114
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,851
‐ What?

115
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,181
‐ Okay ladies, come to papa.

116
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,022
‐ [Ruri] Didn’t you
know that everybody said

117
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,641
that they were going to
Mr. Akatsuki’s party?

118
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,978
(gasps)

119
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,363
(giggles)

120
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,034
‐ [Woman] There.

121
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,322
(giggles)

122
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,535
‐ I thought we were
being discreet.

123
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,414
‐ I don’t see anyone
else here, do you?

124
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,833
Let’s be bold and
daring for once.

125
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,540
Screens up.

126
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,631
What is this?

127
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,589
Are you telling me to
get off the Nadesico?

128
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,211
‐ I’m giving you the option.

129
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,956
‐ Don’t tell me that
you can’t handle

130
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,507
having me in the same
workplace as you.

131
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,762
‐ Don’t misunderstand.

132
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,145
This job is becoming dangerous.

133
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,720
‐ It’s been dangerous.

134
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,217
I think I can handle it.

135
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,227
‐ Once the crew is
officially drafted,

136
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,559
you won’t be able to
come and go so easily.

137
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,226
‐ I see.

138
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,315
So this is your
Christmas present.

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,530
(yelling)

140
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,834
‐ The UEAF can’t allow
a ship under its command

141
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,239
to be crewed by civilians.

142
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,118
Therefore, we’ve
reached a decision.

143
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,695
‐ Normally, all of
you would’ve been

144
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,828
booted off just like that,

145
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,795
but I went through
extraordinary steps

146
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,417
to request that the current crew

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,803
of the Nadesico be smoothly
incorporated into the military.

148
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,632
‐ Just whose idea was this?

149
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,127
‐ Well, this is very
difficult for me to say.

150
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,929
But after calculating
all the damages

151
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,761
that the UEAF
suffered as a result

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,177
of our little computer problem,

153
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,885
the damages we
would’ve had to pay

154
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,305
would’ve forced us to turn
to a military staff anyway.

155
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,267
‐ Two weeks ago, there
was a mysterious explosion

156
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,688
on the surface of the moon.

157
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,285
As a result, there’s
a distinct possibility

158
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,822
that the Nadesico
will be incorporated

159
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,526
into the lunar theater fleet.

160
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,704
‐ If anyone does decide
to leave the ship,

161
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,873
they’ll be subjected to
constant military surveillance.

162
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,953
So this is the best way.
‐ So what are you

163
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,539
going to do, Akito?

164
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,962
‐ Well, I wasn’t
really interested

165
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,882
in becoming a
career soldier but‐‐

166
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,500
‐ [Man] Oh, you
won’t have to worry.

167
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,918
‐ I won’t?

168
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,344
‐ The UEAF couldn’t
leave an Aestivalis

169
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,014
in the hands of
a novice forever,

170
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,302
so we’ve already obtained

171
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,635
a superb pilot as
your replacement.

172
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,185
‐ It’s nice to meet you, sir.

173
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,596
‐ [Ruri] So Akito will
return to being a cook?

174
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,734
‐ No, based on our
analysis of his past

175
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,152
performance and history,

176
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,230
we cannot regard Akito
Tenkawa as soldier material.

177
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,356
We feel he would better
serve the war effort

178
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,485
performing civilian
support duties.

179
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,992
Under our surveillance,
of course.

180
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,283
‐ You mean that you’re
going to fire me?

181
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,157
‐ I’m afraid this wasn’t
meant to be your place.

182
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,791
‐ You’ve done an excellent
job, Mr. Tenkawa.

183
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,285
It’s unfortunate that
you won’t be staying,

184
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,747
but I’m sure you’ll agree

185
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,167
that defeating the Jovians
is the most important thing.

186
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,296
I hope that we can
still be friends.

187
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,472
It’s too bad I won’t have a
chance to try your cooking.

188
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,560
(groans)

189
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,072
‐ I’m getting off too.

190
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,281
(singing in foreign language)

191
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,127
‐ Look Yurika, they’ve already
told me they don’t want me.

192
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,789
Being a soldier means
doing what you’re told,

193
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,378
so I’m going and you’re staying.

194
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,514
‐ Please don’t leave me, Akito.

195
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,549
How can you just
walk away like this

196
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,974
and leave your
girlfriend behind?

197
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,591
‐ You’re not my girlfriend.

198
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,851
Well, you’re my friend.

199
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,721
Huh?

200
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,893
‐ Did I keep you waiting, Akito?

201
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,230
‐ Kept me waiting?

202
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,443
‐ Thank you for everything,
Captain Misumaru.

203
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,105
Come on, let’s go, Akito.

204
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,034
‐ But we’re not finished yet.

205
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,952
(horn beeping)

206
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,874
‐ They look like newlyweds.

207
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,120
(groans)

208
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,584
‐ Please Akito, come back.

209
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,132
(horn beeps)

210
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,920
‐ So, what are you
going to do now, Megumi?

211
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,385
‐ No, you tell me first.

212
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,844
‐ Go back to cooking, I guess,

213
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,054
but I suppose everyone will just

214
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,933
call me a washed up pilot again.

215
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,972
But in the end,
it doesn’t matter.

216
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,306
Whatever it is that I try to do,

217
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,020
nobody ever really wants me.

218
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,639
‐ That’s not true, Akito.

219
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,637
‐ I agree.

220
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,397
Nergal still wants you, Akito.

221
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,401
‐ You’re just saying that

222
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,113
so you can keep him under
your thumb, aren’t you?

223
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,784
‐ No, we have a job
that only he can do.

224
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,205
‐ Only me?

225
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,121
‐ [Erina] As you know,
the Jovian lizards

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,950
are able to use the
tulips to conduct

227
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,995
a form of teleportation
that we call Boson Jumping.

228
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,162
Ever since its discovery,

229
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,789
Nergal has been trying to unlock

230
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,884
the secrets of the system

231
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,629
independently from the military.

232
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,052
‐ [Woman] The Jovians
use only unmanned weapons

233
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,960
and the accrual of the croaks

234
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,507
were all dead on arrival.

235
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,142
So, how was the Nadesico able
to Boson Jump successfully

236
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,009
with no harm to the
lifeforms on board?

237
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,178
‐ [Inez] I believe that the key

238
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,765
to this puzzle is Akito Tenkawa.

239
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,060
‐ Miss Fressange?

240
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,443
‐ Yes, Miss Fressange expressed
an interest in our research.

241
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
These people went to make

242
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,898
organic Boson Jumping a reality.

243
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,942
If we could send ships
to Mars and Jupiter,

244
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,645
the course of this war
could be reversed, Akito.

245
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,488
But as our unmanned
weapon technology

246
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,283
is nowhere near
that of the Jovians,

247
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,905
our ships will have
to carry pilots.

248
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,202
‐ True, however, to the
best of our knowledge,

249
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,156
not even the Jovians
have succeeded

250
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,037
in Boson Jumping lifeforms.

251
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,044
Therefore, we must develop
that technology at any cost.

252
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,537
No matter what the risk.

253
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,168
‐ We at Nergal believe
you have this ability.

254
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,006
Earth needs you, Mr. Tenkawa.

255
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,171
‐ Wait a second.

256
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,167
What makes you
think Akito can do

257
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,508
this thing you want him to?

258
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,014
‐ This is a tulip
crystal, a CC for short.

259
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,348
We found it on Mars.

260
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,311
Have you seen one?

261
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,101
You recognize it.

262
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,016
‐ My father gave one to me.

263
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,016
But I lost it on Mars.

264
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,936
(dramatic music)

265
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,698
‐ The first CC we discovered

266
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,414
when we began excavating
the Martian polar caps.

267
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,707
Nergal immediately took
over the entire operation.

268
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,040
This is a CC.

269
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,957
These are all CC’s.

270
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,424
So, are you surprised?

271
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,045
‐ More than that.

272
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,010
I thought I had the only one.

273
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,840
‐ [Erina] So tell me,
what happened to your CC?

274
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,047
‐ [Akito] Well‐‐

275
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,138
‐ Analysis proves the
crystal’s molecular structure

276
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,062
is identical to
that of the tulips.

277
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,310
It’s my hypothesis that the CC’s

278
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,102
can be used to
trigger Boson Jumping.

279
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,059
You’ve jumped
before, haven’t you?

280
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,229
From Mars to the Earth.

281
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,938
‐ I Boson Jumped?

282
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,608
To the Earth from Mars?

283
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,450
(eerie music)

284
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,248
‐ [Akito Voiceover] I
don’t know how I got here.

285
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,383
When I woke up, I
was on the Earth.

286
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,423
And the stone in my
pendant was gone.

287
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,167
‐ I knew it.

288
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,338
That’s why you have to help us.

289
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,755
You and Miss
Fressange can ensure

290
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,973
a bright future for all mankind.

291
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,046
‐ Excuse me, madam.

292
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,968
‐ [Erina] What?

293
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,138
‐ It’s back.

294
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,676
(crumbling)

295
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,613
‐ [Inez] So, Miss Won,
why didn’t you tell me

296
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,862
that you were conducting
live experiments?

297
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,355
‐ Hi, we kind of followed you.

298
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,777
(giggles)

299
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,987
‐ [Inez] You’re not
doing well, are you?

300
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,118
‐ Actually‐‐

301
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,453
‐ I understand.

302
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,748
You don’t want Miss
Fressange and I as coworkers.

303
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,132
What you want is guinea pigs.

304
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,631
‐ All right, damn it.

305
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,632
Yes it’s true and I refuse
to apologize for it.

306
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,013
You’re a nothing right now,

307
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,421
but at least this way,
you’d have some value.

308
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,136
‐ [Akito] You mean like that?

309
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,891
‐ But you can do it.

310
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,141
I know that you can.

311
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,684
You’ve got to help us.

312
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,637
Please?

313
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,056
‐ [Inez] Aren’t you
going to stop him?

314
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,274
‐ [Erina] He’ll be back.

315
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,313
Who’s gonna want
a loser like that?

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,900
‐ Obviously you do.

317
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,074
‐ What’s that mean?

318
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,442
(laughs)

319
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,318
‐ However, have you
stopped to consider

320
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,535
what the implications are

321
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,066
if the Jovians
don’t have organic

322
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,328
Boson Jumping technology either?

323
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,622
It could mean that
they, like us,

324
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,714
simply found the phase
transition engine and the tulip.

325
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,093
‐ [Man] The force field
generation is failing.

326
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,710
‐ [Man] No, there’s a more
powerful distortion field

327
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,549
coming from inside‐‐
‐ We’re registering massive

328
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,513
amounts of Boson particles.

329
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,432
‐ [Erina] What?

330
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,009
‐ It’s what I was afraid of.

331
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,426
If your research probes made
it to the enemy’s home planet,

332
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,813
then they know that
Earth has started

333
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,640
experimenting with the prospects

334
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,524
of organic Boson Jumping.

335
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,192
If I was in their place,

336
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,649
my first response would be
to stop our experiments,

337
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,770
and unfortunately, I’m right.

338
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,028
(rumbling)

339
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,162
‐ Oh my god, they’re here.

340
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,663
‐ I told Evelyn to
marry Christopher.

341
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,334
Merry Christmas Eve.

342
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,713
(cheering)

343
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,876
They arrested my brother
for stealing miniature cars.

344
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,883
He said he only
liked Hot Wheels.

345
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:46,386
(singing in foreign language)

346
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,051
‐ I’ve thought it over
and I can’t go back

347
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,847
to being just a secretary.

348
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,226
‐ Are you sure?

349
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,520
‐ Mm‐hmm.

350
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,606
‐ Captain, the Jovian lizards
are attacking Kawaski.

351
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,612
‐ It’s a big one!

352
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,897
(rumbling)

353
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,680
(speaking in foreign language)

354
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,016
‐ Looks like the
UEAF are wiped out.

355
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,614
‐ The hostile units
appear to possess

356
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,609
miniature gravity blast cannons.

357
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,612
Move in but be careful.

358
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,614
‐ [Announcer] Please
refrain from driving.

359
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,606
Sightseers and other
civilians are advised

360
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,868
to stay away from the
Kawasaki District,

361
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,329
as they will only interfere

362
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,741
with the efforts of the UEAF.

363
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,997
‐ Akito, you promised to
forget about the Nadesico

364
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,121
and spend a nice
Christmas with me.

365
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,038
‐ But I‐‐

366
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,294
‐ But you what, Akito?

367
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,286
‐ You know that I
don’t like fighting.

368
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,670
But now that Mars is gone,

369
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,506
the Nadesico was
like home to me.

370
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,222
I want to protect
the ones I love.

371
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,302
‐ Am I not enough?

372
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,637
Isn’t it enough to protect me?

373
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,470
Look at them.

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,230
Everyone looks so cheerful.

375
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,480
Do they look detached?

376
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,353
But they’re all
desperate inside.

377
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,360
They’re all trying desperately

378
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,071
to keep a smile on their face.

379
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,729
Trying to protect
each other’s happiness

380
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,817
by not letting their
fears show through.

381
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,284
You don’t have to fight a war

382
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,162
to be protecting
somebody, Akito.

383
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,449
Safeguarding one girl and
safeguarding the Earth

384
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,243
are only different
on a matter of scale.

385
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,617
(screams)

386
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,245
‐ Take this, you!

387
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,003
Die, damn it.

388
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,753
Huh?

389
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,630
(screaming)

390
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,775
‐ What is this, I don’t get it.

391
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,389
‐ Hold on, Hikaru.

392
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,808
Let me try something.

393
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,363
(intense music)

394
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,356
Teleporting won’t do
that thing any good

395
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,606
if I’m still attached to it.

396
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,906
‐ Oh my god.

397
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,531
If that thing jumps,
the Aestivalis pilot

398
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,368
will be killed instantly.

399
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,406
(gasping)

400
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,248
(intense music)

401
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,674
‐ Seiya, Seiya!

402
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,093
‐ He’s gone, the
cockpit’s crushed.

403
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,304
‐ I’ll straighten your fire

404
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,185
on the one that’s still moving.

405
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,392
(panting)

406
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,386
‐ You’re such a fool.

407
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,440
A fool.

408
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:43,726
‐ Open fire!

409
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,071
(intense music)

410
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,405
30 degrees to the
left in three seconds.

411
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,952
(gunshots)

412
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,786
With this jump
pattern figured out,

413
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,830
we can beat it.

414
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,455
(intense music)

415
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,423
‐ What’s that?

416
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,252
‐ Yes, I was afraid of this.

417
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,707
If all else failed,

418
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,757
they programmed its PT
engines to self‐destruct.

419
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,181
‐ You mean‐‐
‐ Yes.

420
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,839
The thing is trying
to phase transition

421
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,927
the entire adjacent
spatial sphere.

422
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
The energy generated
will vaporize

423
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,348
everything from miles around.

424
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,143
‐ [Erina] Perhaps, but I
wouldn’t worry too much.

425
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,019
‐ Huh?

426
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:26,772
Akito?

427
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,225
‐ All right, Erina.

428
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,067
The crystals.

429
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,450
‐ Hey, down there.

430
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,822
(beeping)

431
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,116
‐ What’s that idiot doing?

432
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,372
‐ Captain, look.

433
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,754
(gasps)

434
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,628
‐ Something I can do.

435
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,629
Something only I can do.

436
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,463
Okay, let’s find out.

437
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,456
I’m sending you back to hell.

438
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,296
(yells)

439
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,974
(intense music)

440
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,494
‐ [Megumi] Akito?

441
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,040
Akito?

442
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:24,913
Akito!

443
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,502
‐ [Man] Well, I
guess he turned into

444
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,008
a real warrior in the end.

445
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,510
‐ How can you say
something so insensitive?

446
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,634
I don’t believe you.

447
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,758
He sacrificed himself for us.

448
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,005
For all of us.

449
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,396
You, it’s all your fault
that Akito was killed.

450
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,693
‐ Please, control yourself.

451
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,436
And as for Tankawa.

452
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,236
‐ Hey, Nadesico.

453
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,071
Nadesico.

454
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,906
Oh, well it’s about time.

455
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,371
What’s going on?

456
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,619
It’s been two weeks.

457
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,411
I’ve been calling
you over and over.

458
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,196
‐ It’s the time variable.

459
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,537
He jumped to the
moon two weeks ago.

460
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,883
(sobbing)

461
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,537
‐ [Yurika] Akito.

462
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,998
‐ Yurika, are you crying?

463
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,218
‐ You’re a ghost.

464
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,681
‐ No.

465
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,969
‐ You’re alive?

466
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,602
Where are you now?

467
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,391
‐ I’m on the moon
someplace, why?

468
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,145
‐ So we can come get you.

469
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,055
‐ They might not let you.

470
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,944
I just wanted to
say, Merry Christmas.

471
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,940
‐ Akito really does love me.

472
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,742
‐ [Man] Hey, who is that
singing the Gangy Gankar theme?

473
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,744
‐ It’s not us, it’s
coming from inside.

474
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,826
‐ That’s impossible.

475
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,540
This is an unmanned weapon.

476
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,500
(gasps)

477
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,593
(singing in foreign language)

478
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,461
‐ Oh my god.

479
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,550
(singing in foreign language)

480
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,815
‐ [Ken] Hello everyone.

481
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,820
I’m Ken Tanku, pilot
of the Kakiga Jet.

482
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,953
In the next exciting
episode of Gangy Gankar,

483
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,530
we’re up against our
most dangerous enemy

484
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,737
and we have to use the new
top secret Gankegan flare.

485
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,868
It’s going to be a tough battle,

486
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,495
but we know we can
do it if you join in

487
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,500
to help us out.
‐ That’s not right.

488
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,172
Next week’s episode
