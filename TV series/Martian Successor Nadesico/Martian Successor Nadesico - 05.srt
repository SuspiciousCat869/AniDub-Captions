1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,811
‐ [Narrator] After stopping
at the L2 space colony,

2
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,694
the Nadesico continued
her journey to Mars.

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,942
The new pilots who
joined us, fit right in.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,694
Having proved to be just as
hopeless as the rest of us

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,356
on this ship of fools,
and speaking of idiots,

6
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,946
does anyone really wanna know
where this plot development

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:32,702
is going?

8
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,033
It’s hopeless.

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,827
(upbeat music)

10
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,466
‐ [Female voice] I, I, I again.

11
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,799
Looks like the Is have it.

12
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,468
‐ [Narrator] As the
latest in greatest

13
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,763
technological achievement
of the Nergal corporation,

14
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,847
the battleship, Nadesico,
pretty much runs itself.

15
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,064
Consequently, there’s
not much to do at times

16
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,904
like this, the only people
who have to be on standby

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,900
are Megumi, the
communications officer,

18
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,942
and myself, Minato,
the Helmswoman,

19
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,447
has taken to sleeping in late.

20
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,319
‐ Well, I was up late.

21
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,118
‐ [Narrator] That’s
what she always says.

22
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,291
(yawns)

23
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,950
‐ This really is boring.

24
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,005
(buzzing)

25
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,548
‐ [Narrator] Enemy
attack incoming.

26
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,513
‐ Huh?

27
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,342
What?

28
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,256
Where?

29
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,262
‐ Scrabble the fighters!

30
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:56,933
‐ [Ruri] Unnecessary.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,390
‐ [Yurika] Huh?

32
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,182
‐ The distortion field is
operating in automatic mode.

33
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,933
(laser beams)

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,015
As the Jovian Lizards
haven’t mounted a serious

35
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,232
attack against the Nadesico
since the L2 colony,

36
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,194
it would appear that
they are simply trying to

37
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,524
probe the strength and
capacities of this ship.

38
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,148
This will probably continue
until we enter Mars space

39
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,906
where they will
enjoy overwhelming
numerical superiority.

40
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,331
Does that concur with
your analysis, captain?

41
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,949
‐ You certainly have
perceptive for just a kid.

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,997
‐ I’m 12, not a kid.

43
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,035
Second attack wave approaching.

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,537
Field strength is stable.

45
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,299
(laser beams)

46
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,709
‐ I see, I guess I
won’t have much to do

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,470
until we get to Mars either.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,880
(groans)

49
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,048
‐ You’re blocking my view.

50
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,717
Would you please return
to your seat, captain?

51
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,395
‐ Sure.

52
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,435
(gasps)

53
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,232
(gasps)

54
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,357
(laughs)

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
‐ Is there something
wrong, captain?

56
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,118
‐ Oh, no not really.

57
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,332
I’m just noticing you’re
looking really happy.

58
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:05,872
‐ (laughs) Can you tell?

59
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,118
‐ Captain, what are you
doing on the bridge?

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,000
We can’t begin the
ceremony without you,

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,035
so will you please hurry?

62
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,258
‐ [Captain] Oh
gosh, that’s right!

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,300
‐ [Prospector] And make sure
you’re properly dressed!

64
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,724
‐ [Yurika] Right!

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,180
(footsteps)

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,600
(yelling)

67
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,389
‐ [Narrator] Since we
don’t expect any real enemy

68
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,603
action for a few weeks,
it’s been decided

69
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,103
to hold funerals for all
of the crew and colonists

70
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,436
who perished during
the last few battles.

71
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,519
(church bell rings)

72
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,767
(drum banging)

73
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,318
Unfortunately, we
were unable to recover

74
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,533
many bodies from the L2 colony
(church bell rings)

75
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,112
since most were incinerated
or lost to space.

76
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,279
Because of this, most
of the funerals will be

77
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,446
held with the
deceased in absentia.

78
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,535
That means that the
actual ceremony takes on

79
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,461
a far greater significance
than it might otherwise.

80
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
And the Nergal
corporation will insist on

81
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,206
every nuance being perfect
down to the last detail.

82
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,586
(bell rings)

83
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,882
(sighs)

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,465
‐ What I don’t understand
is why I have to

85
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,220
perform the ceremonies.

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,972
‐ The reason you have
to do it is because

87
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,305
it’s in your contract under
the duties of a captain.

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,471
(sighs)

89
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,597
‐ Well, if I have
to, then I have to.

90
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,024
So let’s get on with it.

91
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,654
(bell rings)
At least it will be over soon.

92
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,649
‐ [Jun] You’re joking, right?

93
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,943
‐ Huh?

94
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,154
‐ Now we have to
do the Catholics.

95
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,685
‐ Let’s see, our father
who art in heaven‐‐

96
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,240
‐ [Jun] Come on, hurry!

97
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,701
‐ [Yurika] Ashes to ashes, amen!

98
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,873
‐ There’s still more to come!

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,700
‐ There’s more?

100
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,785
‐ [Jun] Hurry, hurry!

101
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,657
‐ [Yurika] Okay!

102
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,335
‐ We need to whistle!

103
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,251
Hurry!

104
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,329
Another one!

105
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,123
‐ The Earth may be a
small planet, but it’s

106
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,667
also very diverse and
since there are so many

107
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,301
religions, there are a lot
of different funeral rituals.

108
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,129
‐ But why do I have to perform
each and every one of them?

109
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,685
‐ Because Nergal’s contract
states that any employees

110
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,719
killed on the job have
the right to the proper

111
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,185
funeral of their choice.

112
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,473
‐ Oh.

113
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,516
‐ And since we can’t
afford 50 different monks,

114
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,851
priests, shamans, and
rabbis on the ship,

115
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,565
the captain has to
substitute for them.

116
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,937
‐ Exactly right.

117
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,111
Not to mention, it saves
a bundle on the cost

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,860
of weddings and funerals.

119
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,494
‐ (sighs) I know, but
I’ve been so busy that I

120
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,571
haven’t had a chance to
see Akito or even talk

121
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,568
to him on‐‐

122
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,869
Oh!

123
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,702
‐ Come on, we’re going
to take care of at least

124
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,874
five more today!

125
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,332
‐ Five?

126
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,792
‐ Well Nergal does
guarantee a proper funeral

127
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,002
to every employee killed on
the job or in the workplace.

128
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,092
‐ We are the
children of the sun!

129
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,170
‐ And this is is only one
Nergal company benefit

130
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,675
as an equal opportunity
employer, we also allow you

131
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,048
to make specific requests
as to how your remains

132
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:26,886
are disposed of.

133
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,720
‐ Another four to go!

134
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,595
‐ Another three!

135
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,774
‐ Another two!

136
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,732
‐ The last one!

137
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,731
‐ (sighs) it’s finally over.

138
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,484
‐ Um, captain?

139
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,316
That hat.

140
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,695
‐ At least they’re all done.

141
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,158
‐ Oh no, ma’am, there are
still all of the personalized

142
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,659
funeral requests.
‐ Huh?

143
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,581
‐ Displaying requests on screen.

144
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,912
‐ I don’t need no funeral.

145
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,456
‐ [Yurika] Thank God.

146
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,671
‐ Just scatter my ashes
over the wide, blue ocean.

147
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,881
‐ The ocean?

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,500
How are we going to
do that out here?

149
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,997
‐ Play next request.

150
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,338
‐ What I want is to
become one of the billions

151
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,594
of stars in the Milky
Way Galaxy and watch over

152
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,719
‐ It’s a nice idea, but‐‐
‐ everyone’s happiness!

153
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,014
Good morning star shine.
‐ Some kind of marker shaped

154
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,388
like a star?

155
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,445
‐ My wish is to be
bitten in the neck by

156
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,808
the most beautiful
woman on Earth.

157
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,148
‐ I suppose you’ll
have to fill in

158
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,612
for the most beautiful
woman, right?

159
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,821
You have more requests
for personalized services

160
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,034
than for standard ones.

161
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,822
‐ [Yurika] Huh?

162
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:27,737
This many?

163
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,492
‐ No, a lot more.

164
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,947
‐ You mean, this isn’t all?

165
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,946
‐ Actually, this is
only a small selection

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,290
from the list.

167
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,043
I suppose it just
goes to show how many

168
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,464
people died in that last battle.

169
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,673
Lots of funerals
for lots of people.

170
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,798
‐ But there must be
hundreds of funerals

171
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,223
to perform here!

172
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,801
All those customs
and ceremonies!

173
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,387
All those rituals!

174
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,102
Is that the only
reason I’m here?

175
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,233
‐ Well, I guess you’ll
also be the one to

176
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,650
perform our wedding
ceremonies, won’t you?

177
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,861
(wailing)

178
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,778
‐ You know, you’re a very
cruel person, Megumi.

179
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,030
‐ Am I?

180
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,653
‐ Yes, you are.

181
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,530
‐ I am?

182
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,736
‐ Yes, you are.

183
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,244
‐ I am?

184
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,285
‐ Yes, you are.

185
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,655
‐ You know, I am what I am.

186
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,380
(laser beams)

187
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,791
‐ Alright people, look
lively, look lively!

188
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,128
We’ve got a lot of
funeral meals to prepare!

189
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,594
We’ve got buffets in
room 712 and 13 and

190
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,006
an Irish wake in
the recreation hall.

191
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,177
We’re not about to let
the dead be disappointed

192
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,055
with the meal that’s
prepared in their honor.

193
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,022
Okay, now for this afternoon.

194
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,851
Italian, Russian,
Arab, and Thai‐‐

195
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,188
Hm?

196
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,152
There’s no nanpura
in that Tomo Yankun.

197
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,323
‐ But what’s nanpura?

198
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,531
‐ It’s a salty sauce
that’s made from fish.

199
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,372
The Earth is small
but very diverse!

200
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,120
Every region has
its own palate of

201
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,790
distinct and varied flavors.

202
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,449
And here on the Nadesico,
we stock over 300

203
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,668
different spices and flavorings
to accommodate them all.

204
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,380
‐ Um I can’t find
the nanpura, ma’am.

205
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,711
‐ Mm, got to learn
to use your eyes!

206
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,048
Is it over there, Tenkawa?

207
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:08,881
‐ No ma’am.

208
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,045
‐ Is it over here?

209
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,343
‐ No ma’am.

210
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,836
‐ Then the rest
would be in there!

211
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,677
‐ Oh!

212
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,802
‐ Come on, hurry up!

213
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,348
It’ll boil over!

214
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,595
‐ Alright, here
we go again today!

215
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,426
‐ Right!

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,310
Akito.

217
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,525
‐ Get outta the way!

218
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,695
(gasps)

219
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,653
‐ We’ve got funeral
stuff coming through,

220
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,072
everybody outta the way!

221
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,610
‐ Akito!

222
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,865
(shouting)

223
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,905
Akito!

224
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,120
‐ Yurika!

225
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,031
We don’t have time for
this, as the captain

226
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,328
you have to fulfill
your duties to those

227
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,501
who have perished.

228
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,245
‐ Akito.

229
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,832
Why won’t you to speak to me?

230
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,417
‐ Get outta the way!

231
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,593
(gasps)

232
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,881
‐ We’ve got funeral
stuff coming through.

233
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,092
‐ Wait!

234
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,262
He must say we’ve
got funeral stuff

235
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,721
meaning that we
both have to fulfill

236
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,340
our duties before
we’ll have time to see

237
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,836
each other personally.

238
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,258
Oh thank you for that, Akito!

239
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,097
You’ve given me the
inspiration to fight on!

240
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,854
That’s right, that’s right!

241
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,104
I happily mourn all your deaths.

242
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,976
‐ Wow, Yurika sure
is into it today.

243
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,816
‐ I’m praying as fast as I can.

244
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,532
(laser beams)

245
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,490
(groans)

246
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,861
No more.

247
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,816
‐ Uh, captain...

248
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,118
That hat‐‐

249
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,199
‐ I’m so tired.

250
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,785
Ruri, just what am
I doing this for?

251
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,963
‐ Would you like to know?

252
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,369
‐ Sure, tell me.

253
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,497
‐ I can’t tell you but I can
collect the data for you.

254
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,627
‐ Huh?

255
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,801
‐ I need a comprehensive
data search.

256
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,090
Search all libraries.

257
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,133
Prepare analysis of common
characteristics of captains.

258
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,838
‐ Are you kidding me?

259
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,800
‐ The reply.

260
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,307
Hm, it’s asking
captains of what era.

261
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,312
‐ [Yurika] Um, the
last hundred years?

262
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,611
‐ It’s finished.

263
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,991
It’s a complete analysis of
modern trends in captains.

264
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,201
‐ [Yurika] Hm.

265
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,700
‐ Since the conclusion
of the second world war,

266
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,202
no note‐worthy captains
have been recorded.

267
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,494
In an age such as today,
when all aspects of

268
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,828
combat have been
systematically integrated into

269
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,544
a comprehensive war
strategy, the decisions

270
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,995
made by the captain of
one ship, cannot elicit

271
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,384
a reversal in the strategic
flow of the events in a battle.

272
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,554
The most important duty
of the captain then,

273
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,173
is to be a figure head.

274
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,680
A symbolic representation
of the war ship.

275
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,392
Previously, reliable‐looking
elderly men were popular.

276
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,354
But recently there has
been a marked increase

277
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,314
in the number of
younger, attractive male

278
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,813
and female captains, a
reflection of the need

279
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,606
to motivate
contemporary youth with

280
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,479
something sexy to look at.

281
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,648
‐ That can’t be right, Ruri.

282
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,776
It’s saying that,
that it doesn’t‐‐

283
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,453
‐ It’s saying that
it doesn’t matter who

284
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,031
the captain is anymore.

285
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:40,948
(water droplet echoing)

286
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,834
(screaming)

287
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,752
‐ Megumi?

288
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,214
‐ Yes, I know, I’m
cruel and vicious

289
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,291
aren’t I?

290
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,325
‐ Very.

291
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,788
(sighs)

292
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,498
‐ But how can I help it?

293
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,391
‐ Thank you for your
guidance, ma’am.

294
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,933
‐ You did well, girls!

295
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,467
‐ See you tomorrow, ma’am!

296
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,558
‐ Eri, where’s Tenkawa?

297
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,274
‐ He’s standing in the
storage room staring

298
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,805
at the spice rack.

299
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,897
‐ [Howmei] Tenkawa!

300
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,823
‐ Oh, Miss Howmei.

301
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,320
‐ Haven’t you ever seen
a spice rack before?

302
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,492
‐ Yes, but none as wonderful
as this one, ma’am.

303
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,282
I never realized that there
was so many spices on Earth.

304
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,488
‐ Did you know there
used to be a time

305
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,407
when every family had their
own way of flavoring foods?

306
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,289
Recipes were prized
family heirlooms

307
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,087
passed down from
mother to daughter,

308
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,801
generation to generation.

309
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,421
‐ I see, but why do you
stock all of these spices

310
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,548
here, Miss Howmei?

311
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,013
This isn’t a fancy restaurant,

312
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,553
it’s just a ship’s cafeteria.

313
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,466
‐ Ah, but that’s
just why I do it.

314
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,427
You see, back in the
days when I first started

315
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,347
as a ship’s cook, a young
soldier who was about

316
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,266
to die, told me in
a very weak voice

317
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,398
that if he could have
some paella like his

318
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,113
mother used to make,
he could die happy.

319
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,454
‐ Paella?

320
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,319
‐ I thought I was a good
cook, but all I could

321
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,947
really make was Chinese dishes.

322
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,625
I did my best, but I
didn’t really know how to

323
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,954
prepare paella, so
what I cooked for him

324
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,668
was more like fried rice
than the real thing.

325
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,461
But even if I had known
how to prepare paella,

326
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,503
I couldn’t have because
our ship’s stores

327
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,879
didn’t stock saffron,
one of the most important

328
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,175
ingredients.

329
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,840
He ate it anyway and said
"Thank you, it was good,

330
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,969
"but it didn’t taste the way
my mother used to make it."

331
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,385
I’ve never forgotten that.

332
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,024
That’s the story
behind that spice rack.

333
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,484
I swore that never again
would I be unable to

334
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,654
prepare a soldier’s last supper

335
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,652
exactly the way his
mother would have.

336
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,815
‐ Miss Howmei, please teach me.

337
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,402
I wanna be a better cook too.

338
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,197
‐ I’ll try, but I think
you have something

339
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,453
more important to do.

340
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,946
‐ [Announcer] Good
evening everybody,

341
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,875
you did great work
today, day shift

342
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,795
and night shift, please
continue to do your best!

343
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,630
‐ Everyone keeps telling me
that I need to fight, but

344
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,091
no I don’t wanna fight!

345
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,673
I wanna be a cook!

346
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,339
Do I have to fight just
because other people

347
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,176
want me to?

348
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,682
No matter what I want?

349
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,390
‐ [Video Game] Ready?

350
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,354
Go!

351
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,524
(fighting cries)

352
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,112
‐ Uh, Ruri, excuse me, I
haven’t seen the captain

353
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,321
in a while, is she sick?

354
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,701
‐ You’ve probably
scared her away.

355
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,780
Let’s look and see
if we can find her.

356
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,791
‐ [Megumi] There she is!

357
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,869
‐ [Ruri] No, that’s Minato.

358
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,044
‐ In a little.

359
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,424
‐ So where’s the captain?

360
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,460
‐ Here.

361
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,631
(buzzing)

362
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,880
‐ [Megumi] In the
meditation room?

363
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,212
(beeping)

364
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,418
What is she doing in there?

365
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,549
(bell ringing)
‐ I must concentrate...

366
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,604
What is the purpose
of being the captain?

367
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,050
Why am I here?

368
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,510
I must think!

369
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,098
(meditating)

370
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,766
(sonar ringing)

371
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,652
‐ Strange, she’s in
a state of torpor.

372
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,153
‐ What’s that mean?

373
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,455
‐ The captain is in a trance.

374
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,240
‐ A zen trance?

375
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,282
‐ A zen trance?

376
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,567
‐ Yes.

377
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,279
And it is your duty to
assume the captain’s

378
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,240
functions in her absence.

379
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,827
You’re in command.

380
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,251
‐ Sleep well, dear friends!

381
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,081
‐ Well as long as funerals can
go on without interruption,

382
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,919
I’m happy.

383
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,004
I think we’ll just let
the captain work out

384
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,258
her issues in private.

385
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,049
‐ [Narrator] And so two
weeks went by, the Nadesico

386
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,894
was quickly nearing its
goal, the planet Mars.

387
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,890
The captain, on the other hand‐‐

388
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:32,563
‐ Meditate.

389
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,850
I must meditate.

390
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,483
It’s hard to obtain the
enlightenment sitting

391
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,601
under a Bodhi tree.

392
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,767
I too can reach enlightenment.

393
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,154
I must cast aside all
my worldly passions.

394
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,404
Hey wait!

395
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,443
Just what are my
worldly passions anyway?

396
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,489
I don’t know.

397
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,741
Do I really wanna get rid of ’em

398
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,781
before I even know
what they are?

399
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,615
The only thing I have
a passion for is‐‐

400
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,871
Akito!

401
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,292
You like me more than
anyone, don’t you, Akito?

402
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,083
‐ What did you just say?

403
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:56,794
(laughing)

404
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,923
‐ I said Akito likes me!

405
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,460
‐ Ah, stop it!

406
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,593
‐ I know it’s true,

407
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,499
Akito has always loved me!

408
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,129
You don’t have to
be shy, you know.

409
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,795
I know you like me, Akito.

410
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,644
‐ And just who told you that?

411
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,720
‐ Nobody has to
tell me, silly boy!

412
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,064
I know it in my heart!

413
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:13,929
‐ Well.

414
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,315
‐ [Female Voice]
Are you so sure?

415
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,561
(giggling)

416
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,483
Akito Tenkawa belongs to me.

417
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,775
‐ Akito Tenkawa belongs to me.

418
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,227
‐ Akito Tenkawa belongs to me.

419
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,948
(giggling)

420
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,149
‐ Don’t go!

421
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,110
Wait!

422
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,318
Akito, come back here!

423
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,660
(giggling)

424
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,499
Wait, Akito, wait!

425
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,874
Come back!

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,750
Come back to me, Akito!

427
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,495
Where are you going?

428
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,247
‐ [Megumi] He’s going
with me of course.

429
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,128
‐ No!

430
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,923
This can’t be happening to me!

431
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,048
This can’t be real, it can’t be!

432
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,297
No no no no no!

433
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,596
‐ Cast aside those
distracting thoughts.

434
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,931
It is reflected in
your brain waves.

435
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,097
Such indulgence is bad,
cast aside your worldly

436
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,397
passions.

437
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,942
‐ Cast aside my
worldly passions.

438
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,033
Cast aside my worldly passions!

439
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,778
Cast aside my‐‐

440
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,029
‐ Maybe I don’t wanna fight!

441
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,365
I do, I don’t!

442
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,159
Ah!
‐ Akito!

443
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,371
‐ What’s going on here?

444
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,620
‐ Is this the real thing?

445
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,911
‐ What are you doing here?

446
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,696
‐ I was fighting with
my worldly passions

447
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,328
in order to reach
enlightenment, my dearest.

448
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,214
And then you appeared before me.

449
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,461
‐ What, now wait a second!

450
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,543
I’m not your worldly passion,
I’m a guy with issues

451
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,708
that need resolving!

452
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,706
‐ I understand you perfectly.

453
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,379
You’re saying that you like me.

454
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,048
‐ Do you even
listen to yourself?

455
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:32,804
‐ Of course!

456
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,545
My intuition never lies.

457
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,677
‐ Wait, is that what you’ve
been thinking about in here?

458
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,425
‐ Of course, what else?

459
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,439
And now, look at thunderbolt,
everything has been

460
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,391
revealed to me.

461
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,650
Yes!

462
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
But this isn’t
carnal attraction,

463
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,823
it’s much much greater!

464
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,569
‐ Worldly passion’s bad,
worldly passion’s bad.

465
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,404
‐ And speaking of whom.

466
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,319
‐ Captain, we have a mutiny.

467
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,526
‐ Huh?

468
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,525
‐ Some of the crew
declared a mutiny,

469
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,776
it’s getting ugly.

470
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,159
‐ Is there anybody
to charge here?

471
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,754
(protesting)

472
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,576
‐ We’re really sorry Megumi.

473
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,838
(laughs)

474
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,963
‐ Okay, what’s going on here?

475
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,880
‐ [Seiya] What I don’t
understand is why you wouldn’t

476
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,837
tell us about the free
funerals and you wouldn’t

477
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,797
tell us about this!

478
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,598
It’s deceptive and unethical!

479
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,930
‐ But doesn’t it say
in the contract‐‐

480
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,605
‐ Oh, give me a break!

481
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,433
Who in this day in
age takes time to read

482
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,520
the entire contract?

483
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,773
Well?

484
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,555
‐ [Yurika] Well it
is rather small type.

485
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,437
‐ [Ryoko] Go on,
read the smallest one

486
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,896
at the bottom!

487
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,694
‐ While Nergal will not
permit fraternization

488
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,947
between fellow employees
in order to maintain

489
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,121
public morality, any
physical intimacy

490
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,488
beyond holding hands
will be prohibited.

491
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,538
What is this?

492
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,739
‐ That’s why we’re upset!

493
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,248
‐ Yeah, it’s ridiculous!

494
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,460
Does Nergal actually
think we’ll be satisfied

495
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,922
with just holding hands?

496
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,960
Is the Nadesico a pre‐school
filled with children

497
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,045
who can’t handle
their own affairs?

498
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,459
I’m still young, you know?

499
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,339
‐ You are?

500
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,595
‐ Yes I am!

501
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,304
The young maiden’s
beckoning to me,

502
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,716
I see their wanting gaze.

503
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,682
‐ At other men!

504
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,393
‐ Just drop that
sugar in my arms

505
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,602
and the passion starts to blaze!

506
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,482
‐ If he gets any,
we’ll all be amazed!

507
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,309
‐ I’m afraid we can’t allow
that sort of behavior.

508
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,145
‐ Do we look like
celibates to you?

509
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,652
‐ Sexual relationships
aren’t allowed here.

510
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,863
The ship just isn’t
equipped for it.

511
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,985
As you said, the Nadesico
is not a pre‐school

512
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,992
and we don’t offer
daycare either.

513
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,874
‐ I’ve had enough
of your tyranny!

514
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,082
It’s still not your
puritan morality to

515
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,751
the freedom of space asking
to subsist on holding

516
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,870
hands is cruel and
inhuman, it would almost be

517
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,419
better to be stuck back on
Earth with my frigid wife!

518
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,502
‐ Well, you did sign a contract.

519
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,669
‐ Shut up!

520
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,265
We’re un‐signing it.

521
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,550
‐ I think you should read
the paragraph above it again.

522
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,546
‐ Hm?

523
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,218
‐ What next?

524
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,756
(slurping)

525
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,518
‐ We should be nearing Mars now.

526
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,063
(screaming)

527
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,647
‐ What was that?

528
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,191
‐ Ruri, are the fields still up?

529
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,476
‐ Yes, captain, but
we’re in trouble.

530
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,528
That blast wave wasn’t a probe.

531
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,204
They’re preparing to attack.

532
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,990
(dramatic music)

533
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,292
‐ Alright everyone,
listen to me,

534
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,925
I’m well aware of your
frustrations with your

535
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,173
contracts, but now is
not the time to address

536
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:13,924
that issue!

537
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,706
Unless we can all pull together,

538
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,508
unless we can function
as a team and win,

539
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,801
people are going to get killed!

540
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,344
And if people get
killed, that means more

541
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,178
funerals and I will never,
never let that happen again!

542
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,894
I’d even rather do weddings!

543
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,978
‐ Aestivalis launching now!

544
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,481
‐ [Female Voice] Here we go!

545
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,359
‐ I hate this war and
all the senseless death

546
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,653
and madness it brings.

547
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,236
But still, to live,
we must fight!

548
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,617
‐ [Narrator] And
so, the Nadesico’s

549
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,372
battles at Mars began.

550
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,502
But now we had two
enemies, the lizards

551
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,909
and our contracts.

552
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,957
Of course, I didn’t get
to sign my own contract.

553
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,503
I would’ve read the whole
thing before signing it.

554
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,916
Grown‐ups are idiots.

555
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,027
‐ [Narrator] Since
the dawn of time,

556
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,491
man has viewed the red
planet with a sense of wonder

557
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,902
and dread.

558
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,988
Name for the god of
war, it has been seen

559
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,155
as the source of
nightmarish invaders of

560
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,124
octopus‐like creatures
with giant heads

561
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,043
and greenish skin and as
the home of voluptuous

562
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,504
martian princesses who
can’t keep their hands off

563
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,085
rugged earth men.

564
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,748
Schiaparelli and
Lowell thought they saw

565
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,167
canals on the surface of Mars,

566
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,595
but what Mars really
hides is a dangerous

567
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,134
Jovian kelger attack!

568
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,137
Don’t miss the next episode
of Martian Successor Nadesico!
