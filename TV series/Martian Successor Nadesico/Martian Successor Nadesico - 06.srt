1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,515
(soft music)

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,810
‐ [Ruri] Time has
passed rather quickly

3
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,273
since the Nadesico broke

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,023
through the earth’s big barrier.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,436
Our backup pilot’s
been like this

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,654
and our Captain’s
been like this.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,824
The crews mutinied,
then changed their minds

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,653
and we’ve still made it to Mars.

9
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,198
Isn’t it amazing?

10
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,873
But now that we’re here,
will we be able to win?

11
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:38,712
("You get to Burning"
by Yumi Matsuzawa)

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,893
(singing in foreign language)

13
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,840
(whooshing)

14
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,470
‐ You wanna piece of me?
(computerized beeping)

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,056
Take this.

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,351
(yelling)

17
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,477
(triumphant music)

18
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,481
‐ Hikaru.

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,192
Connect the dots.

20
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,024
‐ Got it.

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,979
(explosions)
(triumphant music)

22
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,489
Now that’s a pretty picture.

23
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,149
(laughing)

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,777
(groans)

25
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,824
‐ Let’s keep our head,
or we’ll be dead.

26
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,737
‐ [Ryoko] Well who
brought that on?

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,906
‐ [Izumi] You were
kind of showing off.

28
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,996
‐ A ship is but a shell, it’s
hull lies in vacuum hell,

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,667
no robot, pug, nor alien
race chills my soul

30
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,666
as cold as space.

31
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,428
Or something like that.

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,220
I’m sorry, sometimes I

33
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,386
get moody.

34
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,894
(growls)

35
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,135
‐ And that’s the
understatement of ye year.

36
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,516
(whooshing)
(triumphant music)

37
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,106
‐ Jeez, is everyone in this
firefight screwing around

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,400
except me?

39
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,445
Hm?

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,820
(whoosh)
(triumphant music)

41
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,156
(yelling)

42
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,411
I hate inertia, I
hate it. (grunts)

43
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,125
(whooshing)

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,663
(sighs)

45
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,707
(triumphant music)

46
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,254
(shinging)

47
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,298
(lasers firing)

48
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,510
(zapping)

49
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,427
‐ Captain, I think you
should recall the Aestivalis.

50
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,974
‐ It’s not necessary, sir.

51
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,055
Come on, Akito.
‐ What?

52
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,232
‐ The enemy is equipped
with gravity blast cannons,

53
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,809
is that what’s
worrying you, Admiral?

54
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,475
There’s no need
to worry about it.

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,074
Our distortion fields
and offensive weapons

56
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,531
are far more powerful
than theirs are.

57
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,490
They can’t even touch us.

58
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,071
As long as we possess
the technological edge,

59
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,567
we are nearly invulnerable.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,120
(whooshing)

61
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,583
‐ [Ruri] Enemy forcefields
are strengthening.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,337
‐ [Ryoko] What?

63
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,959
(whooshing)

64
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,127
Damn, we can’t get
through that shield.

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,586
‐ [Izumi] Look like the
Reaver’s going to claim veal.

66
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,215
(all yelling)

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,103
‐ Come on.

68
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,057
(yelling)

69
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,439
(whooshing and yelling)

70
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,359
Damn, that’s a tough field.

71
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,782
‐ Watch where
you’re goin’, jerk.

72
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,112
‐ Sorry.
‐ That was great,

73
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,455
except for that bungled
ending, of course.

74
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,742
‐ Huh?

75
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,573
‐ We’ll bury you
with full honors.

76
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,867
‐ Bury?
‐ Izumi.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,290
‐ So what are we gonna
do, we’re really stuck.

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,411
(sighs)

79
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,286
‐ I know.

80
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,424
(whooshing)
(triumphant music)

81
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,341
‐ Tenkawa, that’s crazy.

82
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,631
‐ It’s suicide.

83
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,672
‐ No it’s not,
it’s just a matter

84
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,627
of picking the right angle.

85
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,047
(groaning)
(whooshing)

86
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,057
(blasts)

87
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:08,975
Demigod lance.

88
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,055
(triumphant music)

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,412
(roaring and explosions)

90
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,330
(triumphant music)

91
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,005
‐ 80% of the enemy units
have been vaporized.

92
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,292
Atmospheric entry now
possible. (beeping)

93
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,255
Coordinates.

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,300
‐ Thank you, Ruri‐Ruri.

95
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,419
‐ Huh?

96
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,925
‐ Okay, is everybody
ready for this?

97
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,006
It might get a little
bumpy for a bit.

98
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,683
‐ Recall the Aestavalis.
‐ Already done.

99
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,101
(whirring)

100
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,310
(footsteps)

101
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,604
(chaching)

102
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,307
‐ Uh uh.
‐ Huh?

103
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,397
‐ I’ll buy.

104
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,693
‐ Huh?

105
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,074
‐ You left us with our
eyes bugging out. (sproing)

106
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
(startled skwawk)

107
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,066
‐ Don’t mind the junior geek.

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,527
You did good.

109
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,987
(whooshing)

110
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,825
(peaceful music)

111
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,160
‐ [Minato] Entering
Mars thermosphere,

112
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,215
phase transition engine
reaction power decreasing.

113
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,459
‐ [Megumi] What
are those things?

114
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,631
‐ Those are nanomachine
collectives.

115
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,670
‐ Nano?
‐ Machines.

116
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,923
Small, self replicating robots.

117
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,667
The mars colonists
seeded the clouds

118
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,587
with nanomachines to give
the planet an atmosphere

119
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
similar to earth’s.

120
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,181
‐ Hm.

121
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,063
‐ Yes, and the nanomachines
serve a dual purpose.

122
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,932
For even as they
continue to maintain

123
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,059
the stable atmospheric
composition,

124
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,695
they also function as shields
to protect the surface

125
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,572
from harmful space radiation.

126
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,821
‐ [Minato] Passing
through the first layer

127
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,741
of nanomachines.
‐ Isn’t it dangerous

128
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,989
to have something like that
passing through the Nadesico?

129
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,571
‐ There’s nothing
to worry about.

130
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,987
I remember people on Mars
were always swallowing

131
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,695
or inhaling nanomachines
by accident.

132
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,906
But if you wait a few days,

133
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,288
they just come
out the other end.

134
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,714
(gasps)

135
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,880
‐ That’s right, you were born
on Mars, weren’t you, Captain?

136
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,210
‐ Oh, is that so.

137
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,546
‐ [Yurika] Minato, stand by
on the gravity blast cannon.

138
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,592
‐ Yes, ma’am, but may I
ask why we didn’t use it

139
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,427
before this?

140
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,852
‐ Because I don’t think we’ve
seen their real force yet.

141
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,220
There’ll be a second wave.

142
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,516
Turn the bow toward the planet
and engage the batteries.

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,020
(yelling)

144
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,151
‐ How about some
gravity control here?

145
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,731
‐ I don’t get it.

146
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,404
Why is it that he always
gets all the chicks? (yells)

147
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,410
(whooshing)

148
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,084
(zapping and explosions)

149
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,753
‐ [Rurika] All enemy
units vaporized.

150
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,376
No signs of Jovian activity

151
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,093
within a 30 kilometer
radius of the Nadesico.

152
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,974
‐ Prepare the landing
ship immediately.

153
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,051
We’ll send a search team down
to scout out the surface.

154
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,967
‐ But sir, where should we land?

155
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,638
We’ve checked the satellite data

156
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,306
and there appear to
be no active colonies

157
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,733
remaining on the planet.

158
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,941
‐ Our first stop will be
the Derkal research facility

159
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,691
at Mount Olympus.

160
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,905
‐ It figures, business
first, is that it?

161
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,114
‐ Actually our research
facility was built to double

162
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,105
as a survival shelter.

163
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,696
‐ Now, for the landing party.

164
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,665
‐ Excuse me, I’d like
to borrow an Aestavalis.

165
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,866
‐ For what?

166
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,076
‐ I’d like to go see my home?

167
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,674
‐ You mean the Utopia colony?

168
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,291
‐ Hmm.

169
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,546
‐ [Seiya] I don’t know, that
area was completely devastated

170
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,801
and there’s a chulep lying
on the ground nearby.

171
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,681
‐ [Akito] I know, but I’d
just like to see it again.

172
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,432
(crosstalk)

173
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,851
‐ Let him go.
(gasps)

174
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,350
‐ But sir.

175
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,483
‐ I know I’m just a figurehead,

176
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,559
but I’m still technically in
charge here, isn’t that right?

177
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,767
Nobody should be denied
the chance to go back home.

178
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,817
Especially in times like these.

179
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,440
‐ Oh, thank you very much sir.

180
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,067
(beeping)

181
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,985
‐ Shaadow one, lifting off.

182
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,872
(whooshing)

183
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,449
(whirring)

184
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,615
(hisses)

185
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,003
(whoosh)

186
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,789
(whirring)

187
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,044
(footsteps)
‐ Huh?

188
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,497
Hey, what are you
doing, you’ll get hurt.

189
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,876
‐ Megumi, hi.

190
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,552
‐ I was wondering if I could
tag along with you. (chuckles)

191
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,932
‐ Um, but why?

192
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,341
‐ So I could see your roots?

193
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,758
‐ You can’t do that.

194
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,968
‐ I don’t get it,
why is it always him?

195
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,427
‐ I have no idea, I say that
those that look most unlikely.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,850
‐ Unlikely?
(growling and yelling)

197
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,897
(thuds)

198
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,821
(whooshing)

199
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,730
‐ Wow, it’s gorgeous.

200
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,780
Is the place you live
very far from here?

201
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,035
‐ Huh, I (stammers).

202
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,906
‐ We could court
marshal her, right?

203
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,907
‐ I don’t really think it’s
such a big deal, Captain.

204
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,750
Do we need her right now?

205
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,925
‐ Well no, but it’s the
principle. (muttering)

206
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,223
(growling)

207
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,800
‐ Leaving, Captain?

208
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,967
(stammering)

209
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,765
‐ I know, Jun can take command

210
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,808
for just a little bit,
couldn’t you Jun, huh?

211
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,182
‐ Not without a good reason.

212
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,596
(sighs)

213
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,854
(gasps)

214
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,016
‐ That ought to do it,
Gekki, take command.

215
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,655
(growls)

216
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,773
‐ Are you nuts?

217
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,819
(baffs)

218
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,742
‐ You’d probably
do a better job.

219
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,282
(solemn music)

220
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,616
‐ This doesn’t look good, it
looks like it’s been abandoned

221
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,787
for months now.

222
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,583
‐ Yeah, whoever was here
left a long time ago.

223
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,248
‐ So anyway, what was
Nergal doing out here

224
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,457
in the middle of nowhere.

225
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,338
‐ [Seiya] Discovering
the Nadesico.

226
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,877
‐ What?

227
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,048
‐ This is where it began.

228
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,386
In this place, would
you like to see?

229
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,305
(triumphant music)

230
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,808
(quiet whirring)

231
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,525
Well, this is it.

232
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,822
(gasps)

233
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,035
It’s been nearly 30 years
since our research teams

234
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,906
discovered this.

235
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,161
That’s how long it took for us

236
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,294
to begin to decipher
its secrets.

237
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,460
(gentle harp music)

238
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,047
‐ Um, can I ask you something?

239
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,672
‐ Sure.

240
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,256
‐ The Captain’s family,
were you very close to them?

241
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,342
‐ Well they were in the military

242
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,508
and both of my parents
were scientists.

243
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,098
‐ But I guess stuff like that

244
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,852
didn’t matter much
to kids, did it?

245
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,735
‐ I guess. (gasps)

246
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,022
(giggling)

247
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,563
‐ [Child Yurika] Look at
me, Akido, I’m a pilot.

248
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,859
‐ [Child Akido]
What are you doing?

249
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,190
You’re not supposed to
be in there, Yurika.

250
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,237
‐ [Child Yurika] It’s
alright, firing engines.

251
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,530
Forward launch. (giggling)

252
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,324
(panicked crying)
(grunting)

253
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,027
‐ Come on. (grunting)

254
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
I can’t stop it.

255
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,674
(slap)
(whimper)

256
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,749
(crying)

257
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,377
‐ In the end, I was
the one who got blamed

258
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,424
for messing with the machine.

259
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,678
But what really
made me frustrated

260
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,049
was that I couldn’t
control the machine

261
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,387
in the first place.

262
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,516
I guess that’s why I got
this nanocontroller. (gasps)

263
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,179
‐ But you became a cook.

264
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,937
Why a cook and not a pilot?

265
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,733
‐ Oh, well it’s because
the food’s so bad.

266
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,108
‐ Huh?

267
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,365
‐ [Akito] Take a look, see them?

268
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,065
(gasps)

269
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,407
(screams in disgust)

270
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,912
‐ Just what are those things?

271
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,253
‐ They’re nanomachines.
‐ You mean like the ones

272
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,461
that make the atmosphere here?

273
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,620
‐ Uh huh, thanks to these guys,

274
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,579
we can breathe
without a respirator.

275
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,958
But cultivating the soil
will take a while yet.

276
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,627
Plants taste funny.

277
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,835
But a good cook can make
all of them taste wonderful.

278
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,586
That’s like magic to me.

279
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,049
I guess...
‐ And that’s why you wanted

280
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,597
to become a cook, right?

281
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,602
I see.

282
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,483
‐ Um yeah.
‐ That’s so sweet.

283
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,401
But I guess that you’re
a pilot now instead, huh?

284
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,229
‐ Uh, I guess it means
I don’t have much

285
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,404
resolve.
‐ No, that’s not true.

286
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,744
You’re not a quitter,
I know you’re not.

287
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,321
You work harder
than anyone else.

288
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,868
You never give up.

289
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,161
It’s true, you know.

290
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,076
(stammers)

291
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,122
Did I say something wrong?

292
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,617
Did I offend you somehow?

293
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,418
‐ But, no, it’s not that.

294
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,711
‐ Then what did I say?

295
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,634
Why did you pull away like that?

296
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,967
‐ It’s just that I
(distorted noises)

297
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,470
don’t know, I kind of
thought of something odd.

298
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,595
‐ You know, when I
quit my last job,

299
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,521
I was looking for something.

300
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,811
I was looking for someone
who was real responsible,

301
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,273
( grunting and crashing)
see, and focused on a goal.

302
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,444
Someone like you, Akito,
that’s why I, huh?

303
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,147
Akito, Akito?

304
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,065
(screams)

305
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,534
(rumbling)

306
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,987
(groans) That hurt.

307
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,735
Akito, where are you?

308
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,160
(groaning)

309
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,538
‐ He’s on the planet Mars.

310
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,834
(surprised grunts)

311
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,957
I think you should get
off your boyfriend now,

312
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,133
he’s turning blue.

313
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,250
(grunting)
(yells)

314
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,957
I"m not sure whether to welcome
you or to throw you out,

315
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,088
so I think I’ll compromise
by making you drink

316
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,185
some of my nasty coffee.

317
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,552
(suspenseful music)

318
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,106
I suppose I need to
explain a few things.

319
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,649
This is all that’s left.

320
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,282
Every single survivor from
all the Martian colonies

321
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,900
has gathered here.

322
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,448
Fortunately the Jovians don’t
really seem to be interested

323
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,700
in people.
‐ My god, you guys made it.

324
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,413
This is better than
I ever dreamed.

325
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,994
You can all go
back to earth now.

326
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,498
I was afraid there’d
be nothing left,

327
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,659
but you’re really here.

328
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,787
I’ve got to call our sup...

329
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,503
‐ We’re not leaving.
‐ Why not?

330
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,633
‐ That would require
a long explanation.

331
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,381
‐ I’ll settle for
the cliffs notes.

332
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,673
‐ [Figure] Because
here at least,

333
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,756
there’s a chance of survival.

334
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,932
Your ship will never
make it back to earth.

335
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,511
‐ Look, we’ve fought hard
to get back to this planet

336
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,264
to rescue you and
you have no idea

337
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,389
how powerful the Nadesico is.

338
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,306
‐ I know all about the Nadesico.

339
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,063
‐ You do?
‐ Of course I do.

340
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,225
I helped design the Nadesico’s
phase transition engines

341
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,226
and distortion field.

342
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,396
I’m Inez Fressange and I
know what I’m talking about.

343
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,606
‐ you worked for Nergal?

344
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,197
(surprised yelling and rumbles)

345
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:08,662
‐ Akito, Akito.

346
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,539
Oh, there you are, Akito.

347
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,000
I was worried about you,
so I came to find you.

348
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,582
‐ Worried about
what, I won’t ask.

349
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,289
Tenkawa landing party confirmed.

350
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,090
(shing)
(machinery chirping)

351
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,804
‐ In other words, go away
we don’t wanna be saved.

352
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,177
Is that what you’re saying?

353
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,472
‐ That’s correct, all of
the surviving colonists

354
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,597
wish to remain here on Mars.

355
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,273
It is their opinion that
boarding the Nadesico

356
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,651
for the journey back to
earth would be suicide.

357
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,020
And as this ship’s
designer, I agree with them.

358
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,266
The Nadesico will not
survive this mission.

359
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,610
‐ Please reconsider ma’am.

360
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,614
The Nadesico has
beaten the lizards

361
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,316
in every single exchange
of hostilities thus far.

362
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,908
You’ll be quite safe.

363
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,701
‐ (frustrated
groan) You’re wrong.

364
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,954
How much do you really know

365
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,197
about these Jovian
lizards, Mr. Hoary?

366
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,038
Have you any idea how
advanced their technology is?

367
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,134
What are their goals,
why are they here?

368
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,670
‐ So you’re just
going to give it up?

369
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,916
‐ We’re not, you’re the ones
who won’t face the facts.

370
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,127
Your actions are so predictable,

371
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,509
you may think you’ve had
a little success to date,

372
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,636
but have you really?
(stammers)

373
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,813
‐ You know you can
only analyze so much.

374
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,602
‐ Right now you’re
letting your hormones

375
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,475
cloud your judgment,
little girl.

376
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,314
Not everyone can be a hero.

377
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,107
‐ That’ll be enough.
‐ Hmm?

378
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,651
‐ [Ruri] Captain,
enemy forces incoming,

379
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,615
five large battleships,
30 smaller warships.

380
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,485
‐ Stand by on the
gravity blast cannon.

381
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,823
‐ Engaging power coils.

382
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,119
‐ Gravity blast energy charging.

383
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,082
(whooshing)
‐ Fire.

384
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,623
(zapping and explosions)

385
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,134
Yeah, we did it.

386
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,337
‐ [All] Huh?

387
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,801
(rumbling)
(ominous music)

388
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,921
‐ How could they survive
a full gravity blast?

389
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,088
‐ You see?

390
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,836
The enemy also has
distortion fields.

391
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,509
So much for a quick
and easy victory.

392
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,349
(anxious music)

393
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,391
‐ [Ruri] The enemy are
reinforcing their numbers

394
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,190
from a chulep 40
kilometers ahead.

395
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,983
‐ What’s going on, how
can it hold so many ships?

396
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,396
‐ They’re not coming out of it,

397
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,236
they’re coming through.

398
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,571
Those chuleps are actually
dimensional gates,

399
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,276
who knows how many
warships are still waiting

400
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,915
on the other side, waiting
for the order to advance.

401
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,995
‐ [Ruri] Enemy
continuing to reinforce.

402
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,039
‐ Their fields
can’t be invincible,

403
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,714
go to continuous fire.
‐ Huh, right.

404
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,712
Rearm the gravity blast cannon.

405
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,304
‐ We can’t.

406
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,629
‐ That’s right, we’re
not in a vacuum, Captain.

407
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,343
The phase transition engines

408
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,093
can’t generate enough power
to sustain continuous fire.

409
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,718
(tense music)

410
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,394
‐ So what now?

411
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,602
‐ There’s no way we can fight
that many of them is there?

412
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,434
‐ Bring up the distortion field.

413
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,440
‐ You can’t.
‐ If we raise

414
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,061
the distortion field now,

415
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,557
the ground underneath the
Nadesico is going to collapse

416
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,768
under the pressure.

417
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,729
If that happens, all
the survivors down there

418
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,449
will be crushed to death.
(dramatic music)

419
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,319
‐ Minato, take us up
and raise the shields.

420
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,988
‐ We can’t.

421
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,036
It’ll be 20 minutes until
we can divert enough power

422
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,159
from the fields for
sufficient thrust.

423
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,406
‐ Enemy fleet is taking up
position above the Nadesico.

424
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,458
The chulep continues to
reinforce the enemy’s numbers.

425
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,095
‐ [Inez] Either raise your field

426
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,959
or take on the enemy’s
attack without it.

427
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,338
‐ [Seiya] Well I’m
afraid this decision

428
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,053
may be too much for
our Captain to handle.

429
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,803
‐ [Hoary] (grunts)
We have no choice.

430
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,966
‐ But what about those
people, Akito and I told them

431
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,425
we were here to help them.

432
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,775
We said that we’d come back
to Mars in order to save them.

433
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,850
How can you betray
them like this?

434
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,274
They’re all going to die.

435
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,155
‐ Akito.

436
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,324
(tense music)

437
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,691
‐ Enemy in position.

438
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,275
Captain?

439
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,282
‐ [Prospector] This is
no time to be indecisive.

440
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,531
Activate the automatic
defenses now.

441
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,374
‐ [Ruri] The Captain has still
not given the order, sir.

442
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,290
They’re activating
their Graviton cannons.

443
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,791
(tense music)

444
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,955
(inaudible speaking)

445
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,007
(Zapping)

446
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,928
(explosions)

447
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,473
‐ Our fates were sealed when
the first chuleps appeared.

448
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,979
Even without the
fields the shelter

449
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,519
would have been destroyed
by that barrage.

450
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,605
At least this way,
it came quickly.

451
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,068
We all knew this day
would come, Captain.

452
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,359
Nobody really expected
you to be able to save us.

453
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,495
(tense music)
(gagging)

454
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,863
‐ Yurika.

455
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,909
‐ Ruri, maintain
dissociation field integrity.

456
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,955
(water running)

457
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,171
(sighs)

458
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,221
Why did we come here, Akito?

459
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,761
Why did we bother?

460
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,302
What’s the point, we
didn’t save anyone.

461
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,178
I couldn’t save them.

462
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,224
I failed.

463
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,480
‐ [Akito] Yurika.

464
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,810
(gasps)
(mournful music)

465
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,107
‐ This is the first time
you’ve been nice to me

466
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,111
since you came onboard the ship.

467
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,783
‐ Stop it, pull
yourself together.

468
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,202
‐ Akito.
‐ Huh?

469
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,161
‐ Please kiss me.
‐ Yurika.

470
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,083
I don’t think this is the time.

471
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,703
‐ Oh no, I didn’t mean
for you to kiss me

472
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,540
the way you kiss Megumi.
(squawks)

473
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,545
‐ What, you saw that?

474
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,495
Oh that was just something

475
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,924
something that...

476
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,594
‐ I don’t care.

477
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,883
It doesn’t matter, I just want

478
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,886
something that means
that there’s still hope.

479
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,059
‐ Uh. (stammers)

480
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,059
I’m sorry, I’m really sorry.

481
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:26,892
‐ Akito?

482
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,392
Megumi?

483
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,728
‐ Excuse me, Yurika.

484
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,483
But I don’t care if
you are the Captain.

485
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,186
I’m not going to lose.

486
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,606
‐ Uh huh.

487
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,566
And I’m not gonna lose either.

488
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,026
‐ Hm?

489
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,074
‐ We’re all going to beat
those Jovian lizards together.

490
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,239
‐ Uh. (chuckles nervously)

491
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,247
‐ That’s right, they’re
not gonna keep me down.

492
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,580
No siree, Bob, not me.
‐ That’s not what I meant

493
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,116
by what I was saying.

494
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,499
‐ We’re gonna fight.
‐ Oh, come on let me explain

495
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,595
what I meant.

496
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,715
("Watashi Rashiku"
by Houko Kuwashima)

497
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,889
(singing in foreign language)

498
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,615
‐ [Narrator] It was thought
that the battleship Nadesico

499
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,573
could withstand any attack,
but fate is a cruel mistress

500
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,665
and her cold embrace can
be fatal to the unwary.

501
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,453
As the diabolical might of
the mysterious battleships

502
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,036
encircles our heroes,
is the mighty Nadesico

503
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,463
about to embark upon
her final voyage?

504
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,671
In an epic saga
filled with limitless

505
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,921
soul stirring intensity and
beautiful romantic narrative,

506
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,424
the Nadesico may be
going down for the count.

507
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,547
Don’t miss the next
spectacular episode.

508
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,176
Because it could be my last.
