1
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,687
‐ [Yurika] Nobody expected
20‐year‐old Yurika Misamaru

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,980
to do well as the
captain of the Nadesico,

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,944
but thanks to her,
the world’s first

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,244
civilian space battleship has
overcome a takeover attempt

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,031
by Earth’s military.

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,374
Now, the high mobile battleship
is about to head to Mars.

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,953
(upbeat techno music)

8
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,462
To protect the Earth
from the Jovian invaders,

9
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,918
a series of defensive rings

10
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,006
has been placed
around our planet.

11
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,393
The first defensive line,
also known as the Big Barrier,

12
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,720
is composed of nuclear
fusion powered satellites.

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,056
Unfortunately, this
barrier works both ways,

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,603
and the Nadesico will have
to cross this obstacle

15
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,807
in order to leave
the Earth’s orbit.

16
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,019
I wouldn’t wanna die
in a place like this.

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,743
‐ We can’t afford to
overlook the existence

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,906
of the battleship
Nadesico any longer.

19
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,165
The time for wars between
individual nations is long gone.

20
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,170
The Earth has been
united by our struggle

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,500
to fight off these
mysterious attackers

22
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,998
from beyond Jupiter.

23
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,759
The crew of the
Nadesico, however,

24
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,379
seems to think that they
can have their own way.

25
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,760
How can we allow this
to go unpunished?

26
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,636
‐ Chief Commander,
we’re receiving

27
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,103
an emergency relay
via the White House.

28
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,644
‐ Now what?

29
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,437
‐ It’s the Nadesico, sir.

30
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,442
‐ Hi, happy New Year, everybody!

31
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,825
(shouting)

32
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,701
(indistinct talking)

33
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,620
Most of them don’t
understand our language.

34
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,909
Just let me chat a little while.

35
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,543
‐ However some of us
understand your language

36
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,201
quite well, Captain.

37
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,959
‐ Well, that makes things simple

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,330
which is good since we
don’t have much time.

39
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,998
The fact is that the
Nadesico will be able

40
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,456
to escape the Earth’s gravity
well in about three hours,

41
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,217
but unless you shoot the Big
Barrier down for a moment

42
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,181
to let us pass,
we’ll have to destroy

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,840
some of your barrier satellites.

44
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,298
So with that mind,

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,557
would you be nice and
shut the Big Barrier down

46
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,233
pretty please?

47
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,731
‐ You want us to
disable the Big Barrier?

48
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,364
Are you insane?

49
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,519
Forget it!

50
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,476
‐ Okay, we’ll just do
this the hard way then.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,277
‐ That was the last straw.

52
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,452
If you cross the barrier,
you will all be outlaws.

53
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,612
‐ Is that so?

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,030
I guess we’ll have
to live with it.

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,577
‐ This is no longer
a time for debate.

56
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,004
This is the time for action.

57
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,792
In order to maintain order,
we must save the Nadesico.

58
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,378
‐ But if we destroy it,

59
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,962
we’ll lose the most
advanced weapon we have.

60
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,259
Over 70% of the Nadesico’s
crew are Japanese.

61
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,932
Admiral Misamaru, do you
have any thoughts here?

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,680
‐ Well, while she
is my daughter,

63
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,645
I’m taken aback by her boldness

64
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,557
and by the way she filled
out that kimono (giggles).

65
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,978
‐ [Female Soldier] Most
of our available forces

66
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,438
from the Pacific coastal
region are already in pursuit

67
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,697
are already in pursuit
of the Nadesico, sir.

68
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,949
‐ Good.

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,281
We should be able
to intercept her

70
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,494
before she makes it
to the stratosphere.

71
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,326
‐ In theory, however,
the sudden expansion

72
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,622
of the field operations
that we’ve employed

73
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,624
in order to collect the Nadesico

74
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,746
has caused the Jovians to
increase their own activities.

75
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,964
There are battles everywhere.

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,129
‐ I’ll never forgive
the Nadesico for this!

77
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,006
Launch the 3rd defensive line.

78
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,387
‐ Geki Gen Punch!

79
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,600
(screaming)

80
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,147
But the Geki Gen Punch is
made of yakigadian alloy.

81
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,573
‐ That is very
amusing, aren’t they?

82
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,901
However, action for you today!

83
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,818
‐ Oh not again!
‐ Yeah.

84
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,657
And just when it was
getting interesting too.

85
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,792
Why doesn’t Yurika do
something about those clowns?

86
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,749
‐ There’s not much she can do.

87
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,620
Our distortion
field was designed

88
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,166
as a countermeasure to
the lizard’s gravity blast

89
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,042
which means, grasshopper,
its use against

90
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,759
regular weapons is
compromised, comprende?

91
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,009
‐ Then why don’t you go fight
them with your Aestevalis?

92
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,841
‐ You still don’t get the
big picture, do you kid?

93
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,297
Robots aren’t for
fighting missiles.

94
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,887
They’re for fighting robots.

95
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,263
Wait till we get further out.

96
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,718
That’s when the real fun begins.

97
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,430
Oh yeah, baby.

98
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,268
We’ll be kicking
lizard butt galore

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,983
once we get past the
third defensive line!

100
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,188
And this time no cook
is gonna upstage me.

101
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,699
‐ Whatever floats
your boat, big guy.

102
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,282
‐ Yeah, right.

103
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,825
I’ll make sure that the
Nadesico reaches outer space

104
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,539
no matter what the
final cost might be,

105
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,461
and you better not get
in my way, fly cook boy,

106
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,829
or I won’t show you
the next episode.

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,746
‐ Wasn’t episode 26
the last episode?

108
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,207
‐ No, they changed the time slot

109
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,046
and did another full
season after that, dork.

110
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,012
‐ I’ve got to see
them pretty please.

111
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,048
‐ All right then,
but first promise

112
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,887
that you’ll stop
stealing my spotlight!

113
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,394
‐ [Hoary] As you know,
the Earth is shielded

114
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,015
by seven separate
lines of defense.

115
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,061
We’ll need to defeat
each of these barriers.

116
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,945
‐ Well we’ve already
gone beyond the range

117
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,523
of scram jet fighters,

118
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,977
and our reports say that
their airborne fleets

119
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,027
are all engaged in
multiple skirmishes

120
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,241
with the grasshoppers.

121
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,321
The current ground‐based
missile attacks

122
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,026
are a part of the third line,

123
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,076
and we should be
breaching the perimeter

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,790
at the fourth defense
line very shortly.

125
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,582
‐ This is so tedious.

126
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,583
Can’t we just blast our
way into outer space?

127
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,165
‐ Sorry, it’s not
that easy, I’m afraid.

128
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,421
‐ In order to break free of
the Earth’s gravity well,

129
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,263
we first have to reach
an escape velocity

130
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,130
of 11.2 kilometers a second.

131
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,428
To achieve escape velocity,
we’ll have to bring

132
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,260
the Nadesico’s space
transition engine online.

133
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,927
However, in order to
reach peak performance,

134
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,178
the engine needs to be
at a higher altitude.

135
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,438
Effective phase transition
cannot take place

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,060
below an altitude of
20,000 kilometers.

137
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,688
‐ But before we
can get that high,

138
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,285
we’ll have to get past the
third and second defense lines.

139
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,612
Now in theory our
shield should be able to

140
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,816
handle everything the
UF can throw at them.

141
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,288
‐ However, they do
seem to be weakening.

142
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,134
‐ Perhaps you should
change now, Captain.

143
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,845
‐ Oh yeah, good idea.

144
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,712
But before that.

145
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,126
My relationship
with Akito has been

146
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,046
on rather unsteady ground.

147
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:48,344
However.

148
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,135
Akito!

149
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,312
‐ [Ken] Joe!

150
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,095
‐ Huh?

151
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,604
What’s going on?

152
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,727
What are the two of
you doing in here?

153
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,976
‐ My poor Joe.

154
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,819
He sacrificed himself.

155
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,244
Oh the humanity.

156
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,105
‐ You see.

157
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,618
You see it, don’t you?

158
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,120
You understand?

159
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,747
‐ Huh?

160
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,749
‐ [Presenter] Thanks
to the sacrifices of‐‐

161
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,171
(voice drowned by sobbing)

162
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:25,091
But now Geki Gengar
3 is missing a pilot!

163
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,171
‐ Joe!

164
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,257
‐ Do you see?

165
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,511
This is the way a
man could go, man.

166
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,013
Dying in battle,
sacrificing himself

167
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,846
for the sake of friends.

168
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,023
‐ Thank you!

169
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,519
Thank you for
showing me the line!

170
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,351
‐ Oh you’re welcome.

171
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,357
‐ How can they pick that
over me in a kimono?

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,020
‐ Just how long do you
think you can get away

173
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,440
with locking us up like this?

174
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,936
This treatment is
clearly a breach

175
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,818
of all international
POW conventions.

176
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,864
‐ [Soldier] If you don’t quit
yapping about your rights,

177
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,028
I’m gonna have to introduce
an illegal hard mod

178
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,279
to your face.

179
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,868
Now shut up and
behave, soldier boy.

180
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,834
‐ Well?
‐ Almost too easy.

181
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,334
I can’t believe they use
rope in this day and age.

182
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,037
What a bunch of amateurs.

183
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,547
‐ I’m afraid I’m not
really in the mood

184
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,628
to go on Nadesico’s
little jog to Mars.

185
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,845
We’ll escape when the
fighting breaks out.

186
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,472
‐ You must listen to me, Aoi.

187
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,724
You are a junior officer with
a career in front of you.

188
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,228
‐ I’ve sworn to stop the
Nadesico at any cost, sir.

189
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,520
‐ But to receive
nanomachine treatment!

190
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,733
‐ He’s right.

191
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,274
There’s no reason why you
have to have this done.

192
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,147
‐ It’s of minor
consequence, Admiral.

193
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,362
Every pilot has to
do this eventually.

194
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,193
Without the nano injection,
the IFS won’t operate.

195
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,778
‐ I’ve completely
given up on Yurika,

196
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,566
so please don’t go.

197
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,408
‐ Gimme that!

198
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,254
(grunts)

199
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,126
‐ Stop wasting time!

200
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:49,955
Move it!

201
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,590
Move it!

202
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,176
‐ Lieutenant, now that your
nano injection has taken hold,

203
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,550
you’ll be able to
control this delphinium

204
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,217
as if it was part of your body.

205
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,095
The attached external
fuel tanks will enable you

206
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,772
to stay alive for at
least one full hour.

207
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,982
Don’t forget to keep up
your thrust at all times.

208
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,273
‐ Thanks for your help.

209
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,734
‐ Sure, good luck, sir.

210
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:07,825
‐ Right.

211
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,285
(somber music)

212
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,964
Delphinium squadron,
intercept the Nadesico.

213
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,917
(dramatic music)

214
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,680
‐ Oh yeah!

215
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,892
Get out of my way.

216
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,011
Move it!
‐ Listen!

217
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,309
(indistinct talking)

218
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,109
‐ That idiot!

219
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,693
He’s not listening
to a word I’m saying.

220
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,070
I want the line to the bridge
disconnected right now.

221
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,446
‐ [Daigoji] Professor, lower
the laboratory’s force field

222
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,453
and let me at ’em!

223
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,164
‐ Hey, what happened to Tenkawa?

224
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,334
‐ [Daigoji] Tenkawa?

225
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,874
He’s in his room
crying like a baby.

226
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,129
Oh well, more for me.

227
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,669
‐ [Rumi] Nine Delphinium
fighters approaching

228
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,922
from 30 degrees to
port, as in left.

229
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,225
Elevation is 60 degrees,
distance is 8,000 meters.

230
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,011
‐ Enter danger, Geki Gengar.

231
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,175
Ah, and here come the bad guys.

232
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,806
Over in one big stinking pile!

233
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,612
‐ Here we go.

234
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,770
‐ [Yurika] How long until
we can have maximum thrust

235
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,028
from the PT engine?

236
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,781
‐ [Rumi] Another
19,750 kilometers.

237
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,952
‐ Stay on course, ma’am?

238
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,240
‐ Yes, stay on course.

239
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
‐ Oh yeah baby.

240
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,658
At long last, I can show
you how a real hero fights.

241
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,374
‐ Attack!

242
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,335
(screaming)

243
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:56,047
‐ You idiot!
‐ Hey, relax, pal.

244
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,552
(screaming)

245
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,679
All right, here they come.

246
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,355
Okay, Uribatake, drop
off the space Gengar

247
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,395
heavy armaments module.

248
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,691
‐ Mr. Yamada’s
requesting something.

249
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,404
‐ If he’s not willing
to listen to me,

250
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,744
I won’t listen to him.

251
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,898
‐ [Daigoji] Drop off
the Space Gengar heavy

252
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,607
armaments module, please?

253
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,238
‐ You can ask all you want,

254
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,123
but this ship doesn’t
stock any of these

255
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,582
Gengar geeky things.

256
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,751
‐ Maybe he means the
beam module for unit one?

257
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,080
‐ [Daigoji] Yeah,
yeah, that’s it.

258
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,913
‐ All right.

259
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
Here it comes.

260
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,083
Just make sure to catch it.

261
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,420
‐ This is great.

262
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,503
I’ll rush down below
them and lure them in.

263
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,468
The enemy thinks I
don’t have any weapons

264
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,180
but then I’ll combine
with the launched

265
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,089
heavy armaments
module in midair!

266
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,759
I’ll crush them
all in one sweep.

267
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,055
I call this plan
Operation Gengar Cross.

268
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,180
‐ [Uribatake] Whatever.

269
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,227
‐ Time to rock and roll.

270
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,020
All right!

271
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,063
Let’s go!

272
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,115
Gengar Crush!

273
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,651
‐ Hi!

274
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,236
Did the plan not work
out exactly right?

275
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,859
‐ Ain’t nothing.

276
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,446
Mind over matter.

277
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,531
Gai Super Upper!

278
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,413
(screaming)

279
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,000
This’ll do just fine.

280
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,553
‐ [Rumi] Mr. Yamada is
completely surrounded.

281
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,259
‐ [Hoary] It’s up
to you, Tenkawa.

282
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,469
‐ First he breaks
his leg, now this.

283
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,721
‐ Yurika, this is
your last chance.

284
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,386
Return the Nadesico to Earth.

285
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,734
‐ It’s Jun!

286
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,849
‐ You’re violating the
terms of our contract.

287
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,148
‐ Yurika, we’ll stop you
with force if we have to.

288
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,523
If you don’t turn around,

289
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,069
the third defensive line
will be focused on Nadesico.

290
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:41,985
‐ Uh‐oh.

291
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,661
‐ Please, I don’t
want to fight you!

292
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,661
‐ 19,650 kilometers
left to go, Captain.

293
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,505
‐ [Mr. Prospector] What
will it be, Captain?

294
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,667
‐ I’m sorry, Jun.

295
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,420
But I can’t turn back now.

296
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,670
‐ But why?

297
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,552
Why must you do this, Yurika?

298
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,710
‐ I’m doing it
because it’s my job.

299
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,629
I’m not just my
father’s daughter, Jun.

300
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,586
I’m a captain in my own right.

301
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,006
This is the only place
where I can be myself.

302
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:06,927
The real me.

303
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,018
‐ You mean?

304
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,233
Because of him?

305
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,442
All right then.

306
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,863
That’s that.

307
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,573
We’ll begin by
destroying that robot.

308
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,204
‐ Hey, let me go!

309
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,698
Stop it!

310
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,035
‐ Akito!

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,540
‐ What are you doing?

312
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,712
We were all friends just
a few hours ago, remember?

313
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,166
‐ You’re not my friend.

314
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,381
You’re my nemesis!

315
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,013
I challenge you, Akito Tenkawa.

316
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,049
One on one, man to man.

317
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,224
And if lose, I’ll have
my squadron withdraw.

318
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,052
‐ A duel?

319
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,851
‐ Not a bad deal, actually.

320
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,062
‐ Yeah, do it.

321
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,061
That’s the way real
men should fight!

322
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,393
‐ I don’t wanna fight you.

323
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,938
‐ You lousy coward!

324
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:57,653
Fight like a man.

325
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,146
‐ Stop it!

326
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,825
I don’t wanna fight you, Jun!

327
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,243
‐ [Soldier] We’re coming, sir.

328
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,283
‐ Oh no you don’t.

329
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,446
I’m your designated opponent.

330
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,954
And don’t you know
that interrupting

331
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,826
a duel of honor is nothing
short of really rude?

332
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,622
Right?

333
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,712
‐ [Rumi] Passing
third defensive line.

334
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,001
19,550 kilometers until we
can engage the PT engine.

335
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,380
‐ Phase transition engine at
50% and steadily increasing.

336
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,836
‐ What I don’t understand is
why Jun is so angry at Akito.

337
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,599
‐ Why, Captain, isn’t
this heart there

338
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,062
for everyone to see?

339
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:33,851
‐ Huh?

340
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,773
‐ It’s because Mr. Aoi is your‐‐

341
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,853
‐ He’s just a good friend.

342
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,937
‐ Uh‐huh.

343
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,861
‐ 19,400 kilometers
until PT engine burn.

344
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,071
‐ Wait a second, wait a second,

345
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,031
you’re getting this
all wrong, Jun.

346
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,990
I’m not even
interested in Yurika.

347
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:46,742
Cross my heart!

348
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,201
Space cook’s honor!

349
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,741
‐ I don’t believe you.

350
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,374
And besides this has nothing
to do with our personal lives!

351
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,411
‐ Then why do you wanna
fight so bad, you bone head?

352
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,254
It makes no sense!

353
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,381
‐ Since I was a child I’ve
dreamed of protecting the Earth.

354
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,840
That’s why I joined
the United Forces

355
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,511
to make those dreams
into a reality.

356
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,220
‐ I believed in the
same thing, Jun.

357
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,719
I believe that if you had faith,

358
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
you could make a
difference and be a hero.

359
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,602
I thought I could
change the world.

360
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,305
But I was wrong.

361
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,522
‐ I’m not like you.

362
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,391
‐ 19,000 kilometers
until PT engine burn.

363
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,478
‐ We’re now entering
the second line’s

364
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,114
missile envelope, Captain.

365
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,778
‐ I’m going to protect the
Earth no matter what it costs.

366
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,819
I’ve been ordered to stop you,

367
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,653
and that’s what I’m going to do.

368
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,237
I can’t let my personal feelings

369
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,412
come between me and my duty.

370
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,240
It’s a matter of honor.

371
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,915
It’s a matter of pride.

372
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:40,289
‐ You stupid moron!

373
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,536
‐ Oh!

374
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,037
‐ Yeah, way to go, Akito.

375
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,289
That’s the spirit.

376
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,588
That’s the way to fight
between a real man’s gotta be.

377
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,673
‐ Well, why did you stop?

378
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,719
‐ Because I’ve had
enough of this idiocy.

379
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,184
You don’t really think
that the two of us

380
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,974
hitting each other is
going to solve our problems

381
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,636
or win Yurika’s heart, do you?

382
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,144
‐ Don’t you understand?

383
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,016
I can’t let her become the
enemy of everything I hold dear.

384
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,765
I don’t have any
other choices left.

385
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,395
There’s no other way.
‐ The armed satellites

386
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,365
are now targeting the Nadesico.

387
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,153
‐ 18,000 kilometers until

388
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,356
ximumtransition engine burn.

389
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,356
‐ If the missiles come now,

390
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,487
we won’t be able to evade them.

391
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,704
(missiles firing)

392
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,713
‐ What’s going on?

393
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,869
I can’t move!

394
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,167
‐ I ran out of energy as well.

395
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,040
‐ [Rumi] Both Aestevalis
have gone beyond

396
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,918
our maximum energy
transfer range.

397
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,545
‐ Missiles launched
from armed satellites

398
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,012
approaching from
three directions.

399
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,800
‐ 10,000 kilometers
until PT engine burn.

400
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,757
‐ PT engine
accelerating smoothly.

401
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,808
‐ [Megumi] Armed
missiles approaching!

402
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,441
‐ He’s gonna block
’em with his robot.

403
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,693
‐ Jun!
‐ Jun, stop!

404
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,233
‐ I should’ve known.

405
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,728
I should’ve know that I
didn’t have what it takes

406
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,819
to be a real soldier.

407
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,323
The people in the military
are only interested

408
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,415
in fighting a war, not doing
what’s best for mankind.

409
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,743
I can see that now.

410
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,334
Yurika, maybe this
is what I was really

411
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,713
wishing for from the very start.

412
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,579
I would do anything
to protect you.

413
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,287
Wherever you are,
that’s where I belong.

414
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,093
‐ [Daigoji] For crying out loud,

415
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,922
quit trying to steal the show.

416
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,508
‐ I thought you
were immobilized.

417
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,973
‐ The Nadesico caught up to us.

418
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,715
‐ 300 kilometers until maximum
PT engine burn, Captain.

419
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,176
‐ Oh yeah, mama’s
really cooking now.

420
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,018
‐ Distortion field
at maximum strength.

421
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,563
‐ Get those fighters on board.

422
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,436
We’re going to breach
the Big Barrier.

423
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,825
‐ [Rumi] 100, 50, 10.

424
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,490
PT engine maximum thrust.

425
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,242
(dramatic music)

426
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,367
‐ Well you never know.

427
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,127
We may still be able to
become heroes after all.

428
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,341
And Jun, Yurika needs
someone to be her

429
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,502
knight in shining armor.

430
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,677
‐ You mean I can still
do that on the Nadesico?

431
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,010
‐ [Akito] You want
it, you got it.

432
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,465
‐ [Daigoji] Well, you
know, I was born a hero.

433
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,675
‐ Yeah, right.
‐ Yeah, right.

434
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,176
‐ Don’t let them
breach the barrier.

435
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,478
I don’t care if the nuclear
power plants melt down!

436
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,493
(loud explosion)

437
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,083
‐ Well after that ...

438
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,495
‐ In order to keep the Big
Barrier up and running,

439
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,344
Earth had to use half the
power plants on the planet.

440
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,710
There are huge
blackouts everywhere.

441
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,918
‐ Yurika, I‐‐
‐ No, you have nothing

442
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,428
to apologize about.

443
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,840
I know that you did what you did

444
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,508
because you were worried
about me as a friend, right?

445
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,307
‐ Well actually‐‐

446
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,521
‐ And thank you, Akito.

447
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,020
Thank you for not hurting
my very best friend.

448
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,563
‐ Actually I didn’t
save him just because

449
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,269
he was your friend, you know.

450
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,365
‐ Come on, things are
bound to get better

451
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,863
as long as you’re alive.

452
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,535
Just make sure not to die
looking better than me,

453
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,455
all right, kid?

454
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,241
‐ What are those things?

455
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,066
‐ Oh these?

456
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,696
‐ [Akito] Geki Gengar stickers!

457
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,248
‐ [Daigoji] Yup, and I
took care of six buggies

458
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,581
so I’m gonna put six of
these on my Space Gengar.

459
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,458
‐ [Joe] Ken, finish him off!

460
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,843
‐ Joe, you must stop!

461
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,669
‐ [Ken] But, Joe,
what about you?

462
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:13,964
Joe!

463
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,548
‐ Don’t worry about me.

464
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,888
If we let them get away now,

465
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,392
they’ll demolish Tokyo.

466
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,521
Do it, Ken.

467
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,728
Ken!

468
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,441
Geki Gen Flare now!

469
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:32,769
‐ [Daigoji] Let me see.

470
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,688
I wonder where I
should put these now.

471
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,525
‐ [Soldier] Come on,
come on, come on.

472
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,361
‐ Hey!

473
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,736
Who are you?

474
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,912
(gun firing)

475
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,872
‐ [Ken] Geki Gen Flare!

476
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,210
‐ [Joe] Sorry, Miss Minako.

477
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,669
Looks like I won’t
be able to take you

478
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,040
to the beach like I promised.

479
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,224
(calm music)
