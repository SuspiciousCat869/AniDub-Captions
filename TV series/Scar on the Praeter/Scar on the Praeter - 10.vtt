See, look right there?

Y'know, there's a saying: "With

It's an old Chinese stratagem.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
It basically means

That's correct.

even when the moon was out.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
That means she could've drawn
on the full power of Artemis.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center

matter where they fought.

we fight. Agreed?

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
two and two together
to figure out that much.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
So then, both of us
were his victims.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a lift?

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
We're headed the
same way, aren't we?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
[RAN] All right Helios,
we're coming for you!

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back.
Show us what you've got!

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Let's go. Bring it on!

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
We'll end this right here,
right now!

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
Hraesvelgr! Tear them apart!

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
Look at that! You've gotten
a lot better, Yamato Kai.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
Did the pup warm up to ya?

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
Actually, Cerberus has been
watching my back since day one.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
I just wasn't experienced
enough yet.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Hmph! If you say so!

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] This guy and
his stupid illusions!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[JIN grunts]

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I already know
what your Scard ability is!

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
Your illusions are no
match for me, Jin.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
Or Cat-sìth either.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
[JIN laughs]

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
[JIN] So what if our abilities
aren't a good pair?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
That's not the point here.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
I'm just interested in one
thing, and that's your power!

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] What the hell
are you rambling about?

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
In that case, I'll just
dispel your illusions!

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
[JIN grunting]

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
[RAN] You've finally
learned how to fight

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
like a Scard, Yamato Kai.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
Your style is pretty different
from Eiji Arashiba, too.

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
That was kind of fun.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[JIN] My fight here with
Cat-sith on the other hand

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
has been a real pain.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
I'd love it if we
could keep fighting.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
But you know we have
other priorities, right?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
And being efficient
is important to me.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
They're preparing to strike.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
You up for this?

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Long as I've got you.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Uh. Don't push your luck.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Let's do this, Jin!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Okay, Ran!

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Have a taste of
Morrígan's flames!

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Here we go, Hraesvelgr!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hey!

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] You can't even beat
Yamato of all people?

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[RAN] It's just easier for me
to fight you, Cat-sìth!

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
That quick-draw of yours, it's
pretty easy to parry, you know?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
Well then, I guess
I'll just have to go

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
with attacks that
are more direct.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
You idiot!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
Who said anything
about fighting head-on?

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA groans]

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I know they're
illusions, but damn.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Just because you know
they're illusions doesn't mean

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
that they're going to fade away.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
The things people see
are just images the brain

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
processes from information
it gets from the eyes.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Morrigan's illusions
alter those images.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.827 position:50% align:center
That's how it tricks the brain.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
And another thing.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
Some illusions even have
the power to kill a man.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
Even Cerberus has
been thrown off.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Or is the intent to kill I'm
seeing another illusion?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Compared to Morrigan,
Cerberus is nothing but a dog.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
It's time for my
illusions to end this!

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Your wounds.
Are they life-threatening?

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
Yes. However...
It's still night out.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
The moon gives me the
strength to press on.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.662 position:50% align:center
Another facet of your ability?

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
Are you using its power
and the moonlight

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
to close your wounds?

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
The energy it gives
sustains my body.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
As long as it's nighttime,
I'm quite invincible.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
Well, at least that's
what I thought.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.428 position:50% align:center
For some reason, I was unable
to stop Fenrir's attacks.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
But...

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
No matter our injuries,
we must stop them.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
I hope you understand.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Yes. There's absolutely no way
that we can allow them to fight.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
No matter what. We must
find a way to stop them.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
"The Devouring Wolf."
Fenrir will come for them.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
It's only a matter of time.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
[RAN] What's wrong?
That all you've got?

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
Well, that's embarrassing!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
Guess you never really could
hold a candle to Eiji, huh?

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
I'm not done.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you
to protect him.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
He very well can't
rely on me to do it.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center

[YAMATO grunts]

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Some guys have it so easy.

[KAZUMA grunting]

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.993 position:50% align:center
Eat this!

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
This isn't over.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
Stay sharp!

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
You can do this, Kazuma!
You've just got to!

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Heh.

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.419 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I'm not gonna
let him beat me!

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.171 position:50% align:center
I won't be outdone by Yamato!

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
Heh. You're not half
bad when you try.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
Cat-sìth. Kazuma Arashiba!

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
That's Mister Kazuma
Arashiba to you.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
That's some good work.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.524 position:50% align:center
But it isn't over.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Not by a long shot.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
So show me your
true power! Let's go!

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Just give up, Cerberus.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
You've hung in there
pretty well,

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
but there's no way you can win.

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
And I really don't have all day
to play these games with you.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
I think I'd better end this.

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
He's holding his ground.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
Cerberus, I'm counting on you.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Are you out of your mind?

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Do you really think you can
defeat Morrígan's illusions

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
by trying the same old strategy?

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
Well, it's worth a shot.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
I see.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Just try and catch me, Cerberus!

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
I was the one thrown off
balance, not Cerberus.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
That's why I just had
to leave it up to him.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
And see if my body would
make the right moves.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Impressive. Normally,
someone wouldn't be able

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
to pull off something like that
in the middle of a fight.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
I thought we'd be a good
match-up but I guess not.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
Well then, looks like you're
tougher than I thought.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
Even so. No matter
how tough you are,

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
I can't let you stop us.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can let you go.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
Shoot them down.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
Done. You got my word.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Know what to do?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to
keep them off you.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
These are...

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa!

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
Huh? Kagami?
What are you doing here?

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Ran, Jin, I think
that's quite enough.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
But... Ms. Azusa! Are you okay?

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
She can't be doing well.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
Kagami?

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
I know that you had to
carry me to the hospital.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
There's only one reason we're
here fighting. It's Fenrir.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's right.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
The reason we confronted
Helios was to draw Fenrir

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
out into the open.
Out of Kazuma Arashiba.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center

What are you talking about?

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO gasps]

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
You didn't know?

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
We're trying to say
that he's Fenrir.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
It's the truth.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Kagami!

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
But it's complicated.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA laughing]

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO gasping]

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts, chuckles]

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:30.814 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
That damn wolf is responsible.

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Fenrir's really Kazuma Arashiba.

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
Now it all makes sense.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.334 position:50% align:center
It's as I feared. Fenrir.

00:21:05.932 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
Wait, this power...

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunting]

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I'm Fenrir's Scard.

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
Kazuma Arashiba.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:24.070 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] The warg of Norse
mythology. Fenrir.

00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:26.948 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA] He will be let
loose during Ragnarok,

00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:29.451 position:50% align:center
and devour all the gods.

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:32.120 position:50% align:center
That makes him our enemy.

00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:35.373 position:50% align:center
Are you having trouble
saying "that's correct"?

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
No, but...

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.294 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA]
Next episode, "Fenrir."

00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:42.881 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Then that,
I will say, is correct.
