[YAMATO]
Tokyo's Akatsuki Special Ward.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
A community forsaken
by its country.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
Here, beyond the reach
of law, the town saw

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.939 position:50% align:center
a steady influx of arms
and contraband.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
[SOLIDERS chattering]

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Caught up in the
conflict between corporations

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
seeking to monopolize
this trade,

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
many residents sought refuge
outside Akatsuki's borders.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
Even so, the orphans of war,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
and those unable to
survive on the outside

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
continue to scrape by
in this lawless district.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center
[SOLIDERS chattering]

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:09.361 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
But Akatsuki had its hero.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Despite being
abandoned by the state,

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki Ward manages itself,
just like any other town.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
The seediest part is called B1.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50% align:center
A dangerous place where
outcasts, criminals,

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
and those too poor to live
anywhere else end up.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
And that's where we live.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.152 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.445 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.488 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm home.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Welcome back, big bro.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
Guess what? They
ended up giving me

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:03.915 position:50% align:center
a big discount on the groceries.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
Every bit helps.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
That's no surprise.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
It's their way of thanking you

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
for all the help
you've given them.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
Protecting people is what I do.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.718 position:50% align:center
Plus, they already paid me
for my services.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.138 position:50% align:center
But it's still nice of them
to help us out like this.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

Things are tough here.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
Scraping by in B1 is pretty
hard to say the least.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.988 position:50% align:center
Everyone needs food,
a roof over their heads.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
Other essentials, too.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
I just feel like I'm
always depending on you

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
for all of that.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.495 position:50% align:center
So if there's
anything I can do...

Minato.

[MINATO grumbles]

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
Why don't you start
by making us dinner?

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
We can't eat out of the can.
That'd be real boring.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
Are you going out on a job?

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Yeah.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
Be careful, then!

Everyone in B1 are squatters
from the outside.

they got nowhere else to go.

Well, well. Looks like
you win this one.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
Did you come at me just so the
kid could make a break for it?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
You were the smokescreen that
gave the little guy his chance.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] That was the plan,
I've always wanted to see

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
how we'd stack up.
It wasn't even close.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Lucky you then.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center

wanted the same thing.

trying to save that kid?

Hm?

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
This guy asked me
to rescue his son.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Said he'd been kidnapped.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
Turns out the kid's
pretty clever.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:09.828 position:50% align:center
When I found him, he saw his
chance and ran. Smart.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad that we we're
both on the same side.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] You said you wanted
to fight me, didn't you?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Even if we're not
enemies, we can still fight.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.509 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] You got an
interesting point there.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what's
your name, fanboy?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
It's Yamato Kai.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
I really look up
to Akatsuki's hero.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
No, more like to you.
I just wanted to say that.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.354 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Take care, fanboy!

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:39.024 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wow! You fought Eiji Arashiba!

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Yeah. He was tough.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Of course he was tough.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
You can't just fight anyone
and everyone, you know.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
He's got a divine tattoo, right?

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
The kind that only
the Scard have?

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
Guns are useless against them.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
Even the mafia stays out of
their way.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I'm sorry that I'm
always making you worry.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
If you really mean that,

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
then just try to be more
careful next time.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
You got to talk to him.
What is he like in person?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
He's the Hero of
the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
And the protector of this town.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
That's what I used to think.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
But now? Meeting him was

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
even more amazing
than I even imagined.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
Don't forget he also
leads Helios,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
the team that helps him protect
the people of this town.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
They also saved us back then.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
It's his cafe's card.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
He runs it with the other two
members of Helios, apparently.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
When I told him about you, he
said we should stop by sometime.

You made a detour, didn't you?

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
I did, and now I'm hungry.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
Make me something good, Kazuma.

And what's so wrong with that?
No customers.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
But see, that's the problem.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
Plus Kagami's no help, either.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Tsk, just don't expect me
to make you anything fancy.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
my coffee later, too.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Seems as though
someone had a good day.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Huh?

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just met this
really strange guy.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
That child, when his
family asked for help,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
did they mention they
were hiding out here?

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
An organization on the outside
was putting the squeeze on them.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
And even threatened their lives.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
So, they had no choice
but to brave the journey

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
and seek shelter here
in Akatsuki.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] No low-lifes in the
outside can try anything funny

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
in the special ward with teams
like ours protecting it.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
But wait wasn't the boy abducted
before they got to Akatsuki?

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he was.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
But I still took the job,
went to get the kid.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
And that's where you ran
into the really strange guy

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
you mentioned, isn't it?

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
Funny enough, he was there
trying to save the kid like me.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
Even though no one
asked him for his help.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
'Cause of that, we ended
up fighting each other.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
He challenged you to a fight?

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
He knew that you
had the tattoo

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
and still fought you anyway?

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
Well, well, was he a Scard?

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Nope, the guy
did not have a tattoo.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
What? Is he stupid?

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Mmm. Looks delish.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
He was fighting you
of all people.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
The most powerful
Scard there is.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that he didn't
even know that much.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
He might be stupid.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
He knew me and
didn't hesitate at all.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
[EIJI chuckles]

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
I'm gonna dig in.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
Anyway, 's pretty
interesting, right?

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
Also, he fought to win.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Even acted as a shield
so the kid could

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
have a chance to get away.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
Actually, since the kiddo
managed to escape,

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
I guess he won that round.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
He didn't win squat.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
Only one guy's gonna outdo
you and that's me.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on it.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hmph!

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
Just clean your plate before
the coffee's ready.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
And eat all your salad!

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
By the way, this guy
I'm telling you about?

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
I told him that he
oughta stop by

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
with his little
brother sometime.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
Fix them a nice meal
when they come.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
It'll be on me.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
It sounds like they
live together,

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
even though they're
not related by blood.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
They might be just like us.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
Don't care.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
Don't go making
promises like that.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
All right.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA, EIJI]
Hm?

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
It's about time we got
down to business.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
Did you gather the intel?

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
On those guys trafficking
weapons into the special ward?

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And it's just
as I'd feared.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
It seems that Dusk
is behind it all.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
They never learn.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
Why can't all these
damn outsiders

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
just do their stupid
business outside?

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
The special ward
is self-governing

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.117 position:50% align:center
and almost fully independent
from the state.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
Sadly, it makes sense for
them to try and take over.

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
If they move in and
control Akatsuki,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
it would be very lucrative.

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
If that happens, they'd have
free rein over the place.

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
The town would become one
gigantic mafia paradise.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
I won't let them.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
Eiji. Kazuma.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
Sadly, there isn't
really any option.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
And it'll involve
considerable risk.

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
People bringing contraband in

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
is gonna lead to
trouble for the ward.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Just us Helios members.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we make our move.

Sharpen your fangs.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
And then snarl.

[DUSK MEMBER A]
It's Eiji Arashiba!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center

I really wish you wouldn't
force me to fight.

I'm no good at it.

[YAMATO]
We're caught in the crossfire.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
Now we can't get home.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] This happens
all the time in B1.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
But this looks pretty big.
Do you think it's the mafia?

Move it! Move it!

Send the coordinates!

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
So, these guys are
fighting him, then.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Do you happen to
know what the expression:

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
"One beats the bush,
another catches the bird" means?

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
It means one guy
does all the work,

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
and then some other guy
comes in to reap all the reward.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
That's correct.

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
If we made a move on Helios now,
what do you think would happen?

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
Just how do you think
Eiji would react? Jin?

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.327 position:50% align:center
Hey! Are you watching
anime again?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center

Hm? Yeah.

After all, it's not like we're
supposed to be working, Ran.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
Our orders were just to observe
and see what all the fuss was.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
Well. Yeah, I guess.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center

[RAN] That's how you're
gonna play it, huh?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
There wasn't any need for
you to come all this way.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
We're keeping an eye
on everything

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.860 position:50% align:center
that is happening here.

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
The ward's business
is Artemis's business.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
We can't ignore any
big moves by Helios.

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
It's crucial that we don't.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
And if those moves involve
outsiders interfering

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
with this town, even more so.

No one ever uses heavy artillery
in the middle of town.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] This little party's
being held in my honor.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
You two get moving.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.783 position:50% align:center
You'll be safer
outside B1 for now.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hm?

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Hm.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER H]
I've got him!

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.710 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER H yelling]

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
Did you get lost along the way?

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
You missed your chance
to escape, y'know.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
Well, you missed yours.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
That's kinda what happens
when you help other people out.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
It's much easier to take
'em all down than run.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
Where'd the little guy go?

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
He got the hell out of here.
Like he was supposed to.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] He doesn't take after
his crazy brother then, huh?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Yeah.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS yelling]

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Can you block all those bullets?

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Nope, and it starts
to hurt after a while.

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Then why don't you
try not to get hit so much?

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
Aren't you smart?

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Well then, as long as
you're here, give me a hand!

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
Sure thing!

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] These idiots don't
know when to quit.

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] This is our chance
to get out of here.

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Guess we can let them off easy.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't pick them all off.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
My kid brother gets mad
at me when I do that.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] So you've got a little
brother of your own, huh?

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
Yup. He's somewhere
around here

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
swinging that sword of his.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
Eiji!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] A Scard attack?
No, something else.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
A magic bullet?

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
Cerberus must've
been the target.

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
They definitely don't have
a second round to fire.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Why'd you do that?

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Because Akatsuki Ward
still needs to have its hero.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
You gave us all
something we need.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
A sense of hope for the future.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
You put your body on the line
every day to protect us.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
I just... didn't wanna
see you get hurt.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have forgiven myself.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
Hmph. I can't stand it when
people get sentimental on me.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
Your brother.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
What the heck is he supposed
to do without you?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER E] He's inside!
Surround the building!

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
No other choice.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] This is gonna hurt a lot.
Just deal with it.

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO groaning]

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.121 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO gasps]

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO screaming]

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Don't talk--
you'll be better off.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
Cerberus, you've always
had my back before.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
So protect him just
like you did for me.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunting]

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
A hero, huh?

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
Heroes are fools.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] They run into battle
without thinking.

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Even when they know
they can't win.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
As for me, I might think twice.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Dammit!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
Kagami! Do you read me?

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Have you got a visual
on my brother?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
No good.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
Dusk is jamming us!

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA coughing]

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
[FENRIR]
Devour... Heroes...

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.228 position:50% align:center
Who... Who the hell are you?

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
[FENRIR]
I'm Fenrir.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
The wolf who devours all heroes.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
[FENRIR laughing]

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
Bastard! [gasps]

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
Eiji... run.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[POLICE chattering]

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
They're really pulling
out all the stops.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
I don't care if they are Scard.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
There are things you
can and can't do.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
Agreed. So let's finish them.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
Easy, Itsuki.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA grunts]

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
We can't do that.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Don't forget it's not
in our jurisdiction.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
We can only sit tight and
let them do their thing.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] First, we call in the
police to clean up the mess.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
Everything else can wait
till they're done with that.

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
We'll make our move
later as members

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
of the Public Security
Special Service.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
This is...

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
Eiji.

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
You look like hell, fanboy.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
Let me lean on you for a bit.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
Hey, can you give me a light?

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Uh? Huh...?

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Why is your tattoo on my hand?

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
Why did you save
someone like me?

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:22.175 position:50% align:center
Because you were there,
all of us, we...

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:27.597 position:50% align:center
If you really look up to me,
you should use the tattoo.

00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:30.558 position:50% align:center
Protect Akatsuki Ward
in my place.

00:22:31.935 --> 00:22:34.437 position:50% align:center
Show me your fangs.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.483 position:50% align:center
You could try and walk away.
It's just...

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:41.528 position:50% align:center
Struggling in this town
might be a better fit

00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:45.782 position:50% align:center
for some other idiots.
But that's not you, kid.

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:52.163 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I've gotta say,
I'm a little tired.

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:54.708 position:50% align:center
Let me get some rest.

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] You could've at least
remembered my name,

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
crazy bastard.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.517 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
I'll never forget today.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.478 position:50% align:center
The day our town lost its hero.

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:24.279 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
There's a saying in the west,

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:26.906 position:50% align:center
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.366 position:50% align:center
You know it?

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.785 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Promise nothing before
you can actually deliver.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:32.412 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
That's correct.

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:36.458 position:50% align:center
The Japanese saying is
uh, well, never mind.

00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
Next episode: "Cerberus"

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
That's correct!
