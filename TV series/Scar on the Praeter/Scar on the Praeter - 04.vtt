It seems Helios and Artemis

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.311 position:50% align:center
had a little spat yesterday.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
They're making us work
way too much. Am I right?

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center

[doorbell ringing]

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.213 position:50% align:center
Hey, there! Let me in already!

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
Really sorry for popping
by so early in the morning.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Itsuki, are you serious?
Not this crap again.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
That isn't healthy, you know.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
It's all my daily nutrients.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.810 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
That's not the point.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
Uncle Kouga's got some treats
for you, so feel free to dig in.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
Young men have got to
eat to stay strong, right?

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
How come you don't drink coffee?
Black too strong?

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
Caffeine bothers me.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Stop coming every day.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] I'm a bit older
than you, so I worry.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
It's my job to look out for ya.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
You used to be a beat cop.
I've been here longer than you.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
Doesn't change the fact
that I outrank you.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] No, you don't.
Our job is exactly the same.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
And we don't need to
associate outside of work.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
You're so green.
Life's all about relationships.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
It's important for us
to have trust, after all.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Come on, I've been on
your case about this

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
for a while now, haven't I?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
I really didn't want
to have to say this.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
But you're really gonna
give us a lot of trouble

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
if you don't start to
speed up your investigation.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
Now compared to the sort
of stuff that we do,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
your job is small potatoes.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
Just think about it. Whose
work is more important?

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
I told you before that we
finished your investigation.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
Please go.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
And this is the
last time, okay?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
We're swamped enough here.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
Honestly, it's a huge help.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
But I don't know
whether I'm a fan

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
of that little attitude
that you've got there.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
We're mouthing off now, huh?

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
To somebody of my rank?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
A member of the PSSS?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
And a senior officer?

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA laughs]
I'm just kidding here!

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
Till next time!

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE A grumbles]

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
You used to work with us
at this precinct, you jerk!

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
You see? Relationships
are important. I told you.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
That was coercion.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50% align:center
Come on, you know the
Akatsuki Special Ward Police

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
is only there for show.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
Not to mention they're totally
useless against the Scard.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.575 position:50% align:center
Sure is nice to have the power
of the PSSS behind us.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
I just can't keep myself
from abusing it.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
Well, now we know where
Yamato Kai's hiding out.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
Just where I thought he'd be.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Oh, hey, Itsuki?
I'm going to grab some coffee.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
Want something?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center

Hm.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I know you're around
here somewhere Fenrir.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center

What do you want?

I don't have any time
to waste on you.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center

here looking for Fenrir.

Hmph.

He's also a Scard, but
he isn't like you and me.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center

until yesterday because
Kagami said so.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.172 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Yeah, I'm grateful
that you guys patched me up

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
and let me stay until now.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
All I need to do now is
go and grab my stuff.

Why don't you head
back to Titan then!

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center

to do all of this?

[YAMATO]
Give me a hand!

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Shut up.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
He's still breathing.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Yeah, but we've
got to move them.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
The hospital's too far away.
We need Kagami.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
No, I know a doctor that's
right around the corner.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hm? Wait, really?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
He always helps out
people here in B1.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
So he's unlicensed.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
There sure seems to be
a lot of people like that

00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
around this neighborhood.

[YAMATO]
Uh?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, could you
give us a hand?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
[BYSTANDER A]
Me?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Thankfully, they'll all make it.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Yeah.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
What's he doing?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
What's going on
in Fenrir's head?

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
Of all the victims, not a single
one was a Scard this time.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
Are all of his attacks random?

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
Or maybe there's a reason
that he chose to strike here?

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
Whatever. He's still here.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
And since he is, we've just
gotta corner him now.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there guys!
How're things, Kazu-boy?

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I told you that I
hate that nickname, jerk!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
Mind if I ask a question?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
The coffee you serve here
isn't instant, is it?

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
I'm in charge of the kitchen.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
We were closed, but guess you
didn't realize that, Officer.

Kazuma! Kagami!

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center

Hey, Itsuki. He just left.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
It's all up to you now.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Are you a cop?

Surrender now.

[ITSUKI] Justice without
force is powerless.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50% align:center
Force without
justice is tyranny.

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:14.299 position:50% align:center
And now, I shall bring
justice with force.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Thanks for the coffee.

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Too bad it was instant, though.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
I have a bit of a request.
Stay out of Itsuki's way.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's my partner.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to let him
do his thing

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
for right now if you don't mind.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
He's gone after
our friend Yamato.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
And what'll you do
when you get him?

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
Ah. What shall we do with him?

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Either he'll be a good boy
and join up with us,

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
or we'll be forced
to lock him up

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
and hold him for observation
in a white padded room.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
You guys just do
whatever you want, don't you?

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
Our job's to maintain
peace, order,

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
and public safety in Akatsuki.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
And we can't allow dangerous
individuals like the Scard

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
to have free rein of the place,
now can we?

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
On the other hand, we don't want
any trouble with Helios, either.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, I'm sure his hasty exit
was because he was being chased,

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
and he didn't want
to drag us into it.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
So, that amateur thinks he's
looking out for us then?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
Wow, he's so full of it.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
To start with, the guy
isn't a member of Helios.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
But still, that doesn't mean

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna let you have
my brother's tattoo.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
Kazuma!

00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.424 position:50% align:center
Now get lost!

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Kazu-boy, you shouldn't
swing that thing around

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
like that. Hmph.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
Someone could get hurt.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] If he's PSSS,
he must also be Scard.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
I knew I wouldn't
kill him, but...

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Oh, come on now!

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
You made me spill my coffee.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
That's Fafnir. A very
strong defensive tattoo.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
Don't give away the secret
now, Kaggy-boy!

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Then, I'll just have
to hack it to pieces!

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] That's funny. Did you
really think I'd just let you

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
use that little power-sealing
trick of yours on me?

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
Don't you move, Kaggy-boy.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.799 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Both the PSSS and
the country consider Scard

00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
to be a threat to society.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
Yeah, while they don't
look any different

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
from normal people,
they've got strange powers

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
and guns can't kill them.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind
wouldn't consider them a threat?

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
As they say, "force without
justice is tyranny."

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
But the PSSS doesn't crack down

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
on all the Scard,
especially in Akatsuki ward.

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
For instance, normally you'd
come down on factions

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
like Artemis who have
Scard on their payroll.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
Do you want us
to shut them down?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] The reason you can't
hold these groups in check

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
is because there
are so few Scard

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
among the ranks of the PSSS.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
You lack the strength needed to
take on all of the other Scard

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
at once and bring them to heel.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
It can't be helped.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
Scard are way too few
and far between.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.219 position:50% align:center
Even in Akatsuki ward,

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
where they say that
there's a quite a few.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
My guess is, there's
no more than 10 total.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
So it seems as though the PSSS
will knowingly tolerate Scard

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
who belong to small
manageable groups.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and so what?

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Helios will take
charge of Yamato Kai

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
and the Cerberus tattoo.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
We will comply with any
of the necessary formalities

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
as ward residents.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA growls]
Kagami!

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
That's what you're coming to
the bargaining table with?

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
I remind you, he's on the run.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] You can hush it up
any way you want, right?

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:42.090 position:50% align:center
Only if I have a reason to
and I don't. Am I wrong?

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
I understand PSSS agents
are quite formidable.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
But it's not like them
to roll the dice

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
and chance two against one.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
Kaggy-boy, I thought you
didn't like to play rough?

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
I don't have the stomach for it.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
Then again, I can
be formidable, too.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
My Ouroboros is
pretty well-matched

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
against your Fafnir.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know. If you're
able to close wounds,

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
then that means you're
also able to open them.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
Well, and there goes my defense.
Got me! Well played.

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Just what you'd expect from the
heir to Sakashima Holdings,

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
the company that tried
to manage Akatsuki ward.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
You're a good negotiator.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
The heir who stepped down
to defend the Special Ward

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
has quite a spine.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] The company went
under a long time ago,

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
and I've left home.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
Both then and during
the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
I merely sympathized with
Eiji and my father's cause.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
But now, I won't back down.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
Well, gosh darnit.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
If that's how you feel then
I guess I've got no choice.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
So, he runs on air, huh?
I can't lock on.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Cerberus sees
the intent to kill.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
But you're unable to keep up
with Qiongqi's superior speed.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
Surrender. If you don't,
I'll kill you.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
Sorry, not today.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
There's no way that I'm letting
you guys get Eiji's Cerberus.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.393 position:50% align:center
You refuse to part with it?

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
He left the tattoo's
power to me.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba is dead.

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
But his spirit didn't
die with him.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
If you really look up to me,

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
you should use the tattoo.

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
Protect Akatsuki
ward in my place.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center

Show me your fangs.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki's hero had
a code he lived by.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
You won't destroy
what he stood for.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center

So be it.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center

[YAMATO]
Gotcha!

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
We're done here.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
Even a Scard will die
at point-blank range.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
Surrender. Don't you
value your life?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
I do.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Itsuki, bud, pull out, okay?

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
Pull out? But that
makes no sense!

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Tell me why!

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Wow, you never ask why!

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]
Aren't you gonna shoot me?

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Ah, jeez. Itsuki's
really pissed at me.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
I'm letting you guys win!
C'mon, okay?

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Oh, and that speech
you gave before

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
about small manageable
groups of Scard

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
is correct, so we'll just
leave Yam-Yam with you.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
But we can still come
back anytime we want

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
to shut down Helios for good.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center

Calm down, I was
only joking, okay?

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Relay this message
to Yammy-boy for me will you?

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center

We'll be taking real good
care of him going forward.

If you catch my drift?
Buh-bye now!

[KAZUMA]
I can't believe that guy!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
Is every word out of
his mouth a threat?!

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
And he calls himself a cop?

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
That was exhausting.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Hmm...
Hey, Itsuki! Did you get hit?

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
Pretty weird.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Did Yammy-boy give you
that much trouble?

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
Why'd you stop me?

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Itsuki,
you never get emotional.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to get you
sweetened next time.

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
Not necessary.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
All of this is my fault.
I'm sorry, guys.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
I didn't think it was a good
idea for me to come back,

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
but I forgot to return
these to you.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center

We've decided that we
would take you in.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
As a member of Helios, you must
wear that on your left arm.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
It's an ID band that's also worn

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
by the Scard in Artemis
and the PSSS.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
Come on then,
just put it on already.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
Even you can do
that much, right?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.993 position:50% align:center

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
I hope this case,
ends up like that.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
[RAN] That, and your little
editorial at the end,

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
is correct. Smartass.

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Got it right, though.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Ever since that skirmish
in B1 between Dusk and Helios,

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
there've been more than ten
of these attacks and counting.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Either some of the
traitors hiding within

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
Artemis are Scard, or
we've got a new enemy

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
to start worrying about.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Oh, please don't make
me work too late!

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[ARTEMIS MEMBER A grunts]

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Hm?

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us what happened?

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
He had a wolf tattoo.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
A wolf?

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
Cat-sìth said something about
that the other day, didn't he?

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
Said it was Fenrir.

00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:24.821 position:50% align:center

Ran. Jin. In the old saying

00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:27.866 position:50% align:center
"It's so quiet you can hear
the kankodori cry,"

00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:29.743 position:50% align:center
do you know what
kind of bird it is?

00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:31.494 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Huh? Ms. Azusa?

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:33.288 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
It's a cuckoo, I think.

00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.581 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA]
That's correct.

00:23:34.664 --> 00:23:37.542 position:50% align:center
This is how you do it,
my wings, yes?

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:41.755 position:50% align:center
Next episode: "We the Twin
Wings Do Solemnly Swear."

00:23:41.838 --> 00:23:44.007 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Now that's correct.
