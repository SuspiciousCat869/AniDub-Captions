[YAMATO]
Kazuma.

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.730 position:50% align:center
You're not... No...

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.232 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
The Fenrir tattoo
was his secret weapon--

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
he's been behind all
of it from the start!

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
He hid this second tattoo and
carried out attack after attack!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
Isn't that what this whole
thing has been about?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.828 position:50% align:center
[JIN] That's why Ran and I
were hunting him down.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.664 position:50% align:center
We were trying to
smoke Fenrir out.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] You have all your facts
straight, that's for certain.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Kazuma does indeed
bear two markings.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.423 position:50% align:center
You're right about that.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.884 position:50% align:center
But there's more to Fenrir's
concealment than you realize.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50% align:center
The original purpose of
giving Cat-sìth to Kazuma

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50% align:center
was to seal away
the power of Fenrir.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.270 position:50% align:center
A violate tattoo.
That's what Fenrir is.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
I understand.
That explains it then.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:29.816 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI grunts]

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
It all happened out of nowhere.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
One day during the
Akatsuki Conflict,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.364 position:50% align:center
Fenrir suddenly appeared
on Kazuma's body.

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
Maybe the tattoo was
drawn to him by the horrors

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
of the conflict.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Or even darker still, something
within Kazuma called out to it.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
In that moment, Fenrir
came to possess him.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
It robbed him of his self.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
A tattoo gone berserk.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.592 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Something like that.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, Fenrir
possessed a will of its own.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.973 position:50% align:center
A sinister will.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
He finally settled down.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
Yes, but when he
eventually comes to,

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
Kazuma will be possessed
by Fenrir again.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
He isn't himself anymore.
It's the god-devouring warg.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
The harbinger of the apocalypse.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Eiji.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Let me handle this.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
With Uroboros, I can assure
that his death will stick.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
Not like this, there
must be another way!

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
There is.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
[BANRI panting]

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
Idiot! Stay there!

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] I appreciate
the concern, you guys.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
But you see...

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:52.774 position:50% align:center
There's one more thing that I
think I can still do for him,

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
so just leave it to me, okay?

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
I see. You'll use Cat-sìth!

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
That's right. It should be
enough to seal Fenrir away.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
That's what Cat-sìth is for.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
If I'm right, it should be able

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
to keep even Fenrir
under control.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
And now I can kill two
birds with one stone.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
Sorry Eiji, but I always wanted
Kazuma to inherit my tattoo.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't do that
without asking first!

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center

Heh. You're a
naughty boy, Fenrir.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
We should stop this!

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
We're up against the
ferocity of a violate tattoo.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
Not even Cat-sìth may
be able to seal it!

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
Its power is too strong!

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center

Hang on now.

Cerberus says you're not
doing this without him!

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
Guess he's a bit of a goody-two
shoes, like his owner.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
Ha.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
I'm also a part of Helios.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
We can do this!

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.853 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You'll do fine, Banri.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center

Sharpen your fangs!

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center

You just have to bare your

Thank you Cat-sìth. So long.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
What happened that fateful day

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
would prey upon Kazuma
Arashiba's fractured mind.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
Not only was Fenrir's
power sealed that day,

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
Kazuma's memories
were locked away too.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
So that's why he believes
all those lies you told him.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
Especially about Banri Mikado,
that he's alive and left town.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
Well, he used to
believe that. Once.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Kazuma? Is that you speaking?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
Kagami. The power
your Uroboros stole

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
all those years ago has
finally been returned to me.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
[RAN] So, you're saying
the guy in front of us

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
isn't Kazuma Arashiba.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:47.741 position:50% align:center
It's the Fenrir tattoo itself
that's talking to us?

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
In the end,
Fenrir's only a tool,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.996 position:50% align:center
and a tool is something
to be used, right?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
All of my actions are based
on Kazuma Arashiba's will.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
What do you mean?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] His voracious hunger
for power and destruction.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
That's what Kazuma
Arashiba sought.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.012 position:50% align:center
For years he longed to
possess a great power,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
one that would be
worthy of his brother.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
The Fenrir he saw
that day was a vision

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
gifted by his innermost desires.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
The flames proved
to be far too much.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
They prevented him from going
to his brother's rescue.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
And Eiji perished.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
Kazuma's self-directed anger
at his own weakness--

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
that's what finally awakened me.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
I can see it now.
It all makes sense.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
You're Fenrir!

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA chuckles]

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
These tears are Kazuma's
weakness made manifest.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
Well, enough of all that.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
Kazuma has obtained a power
even greater than his brother's.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
A power to destroy the
injustice of this world.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
This hunger... That alone
is what drives me.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
Now face the might of
the god-eater. Fenrir.

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
You're wrong, I know Kazuma
doesn't want that.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
He does. Power... Carnage...

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Kazuma's abilities
aren't meant for destruction.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
That's not who he is!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
He uses them to defend the town
and all those he cares about.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're that naïve?

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
Fenrir's resurrection is proof
that you're wrong about him.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
Do really think I broke
the seal on my own?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
They robbed me of my power.
I'm only free for one reason.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
Despite Banri's final gift,
Kazuma never wanted Cat-sìth.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Kagami knew I had reawakened.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
That's why you tried to kill me,
isn't that right?

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I know why you feel
responsible for all of this.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center
That crushing guilt you carry.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:29.027 position:50% align:center
Impossible. You don't.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
Because you were the
one who started it all.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
The magic bullet that
killed your best friend?

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
The man who fired that shot...

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
...was you, Kagami.

[YAMATO gasps]

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
[JIN, RAN grunt]

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] You knew that Kazuma
would one day learn the truth.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Despite your best efforts.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
But Kazuma was sneaky.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
While pursing Fenrir,
he did his own research

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
on the bullet that led
to Eiji's death.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
He also knows the information
you kept hidden.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
Crafting a magic bullet requires
immense time and skill,

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
but also a part of
the victim's body.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
So, only a member of Helios
could do it. Someone close.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
The only member who
possessed the skill

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
and knowledge to do such a thing
was Kagami Sakishima.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
Only he could've
crafted the bullet.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
So... Back then,
Kazuma already knew.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I can try to buy us
some time at least.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Just forget it.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.760 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] He continued to learn
more about the magic bullet

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
and was left with no choice
but to suspect you.

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
Kazuma continued to hunt Fenrir,
believing that I was his enemy.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
A faith too far from the truth.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
And all the while I felt his
spirit continue to crumble.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
The weight of Kagami's betrayal
and Eiji's death was too much.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
It turns out you triggered
it all, didn't you?

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
Yes, I did. I admit it,
the magic bullet was mine.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center

[BOTH gasp]

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
That said, I never
dreamed of killing Eiji!

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
I have had no reason for wanting
him dead! He was my friend!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.887 position:50% align:center
Yet... Eiji is gone.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
That bullet is the very
reason he's now dead,

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
and his death is what
woke me from my slumber.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
That's the reason you
felt so responsible,

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
and why you attempted
to kill Kazuma.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, we get it.
But I couldn't care less.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
I want to know one thing.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Why did you try to
go after Ms. Azusa?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hmph.

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
I wanted to upset the
public order in this town.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
And look, see how
easy it was for me!

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Child's play. You did
exactly as I wanted you to.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
[RAN] So, that's the reason
behind all your random attacks.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
But tell me,

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
do you know what Fenrir's
fate in Norse mythology?

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
The wolf's set loose, devours
god, marking the end.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
That's correct.
But somewhat incorrect.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, the wolf
is ripped apart

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
by the god of the new world.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
He's beaten.
That's Fenrir's fate.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
You tried to kill Ms. Azusa--

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
and that's reason enough
for us to end you!

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center

I was about to as well.

If we hadn't stopped
him then and there,

He carried with him the hopes
and regrets of the dead!

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center
The man held himself responsible
for the well-being of the town

and for everyone
who lived there!

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.273 position:50% align:center
The truth is, Eiji was
torn apart inside!

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
That's why I tried
to unburden him!

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
That's why I had
to kill his tattoo!

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to free him

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center

If I was going to use
the magic bullet,

00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
then that was the right moment.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
Even if it somehow slipped
under Cerberus's radar,

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
that was my only opening.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
For a man of my skill,
it was truly

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
my one shot to
catch Eiji off guard.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Without the power of his tattoo,

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
I'm certain he would've
thrown in the towel.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
Eiji should've managed to escape
that day. He'd have lived.

Eiji didn't end up actually
losing Cerberus.

And then, Eiji passed
on his divine tattoo.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center

So why did it?

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
Go on. Please, I'd like
you to explain to me

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center

fair warning of

Or at least strike back?

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center

Your life, Kagami. You
don't have long, do you?

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
You risked everything you
had for a chance to save Eiji.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
But surely you knew
this was a gamble.

I don't think Eiji would simply
stop trying to help people.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
True enough. He never did
do things the easy way.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
Nonetheless,
you must have reasons.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you
wouldn't have tried

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
to rob him of his power.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
There must've been a plan.
A course of action

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
you'd take after Cerberus

When they were trying
to target Eiji Arashiba?

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I guess since then.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
It was a reasonable
proposition for both of us.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Here's some history. Way back,

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
corporate fighting turned
into armed disturbances.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
This led to the collapse
of the Ward Concept

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
and the start of
the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
But after all that,
things began to settle down.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.002 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] The Hero of Akatsuki
himself brought back peace.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, and we can't forget
about Artemis running the town.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki Special Ward is a
problematic little place.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
It's governed from within, too.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
Not even the powers
that be in this nation

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
can intervene in its affairs.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
But don't you find it
a little strange?

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
First, you've got Eiji
Arashiba and Helios,

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
and then there's those
meddlers from Artemis Finance.

00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
See, these guys all
try to play Sheriff,

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
but none of them should
be protecting the town.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
It should be the government.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
In other words,
Tokyo's police force.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
So you colluded with
Kagami Sakashima,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
and it was the two
of you who tried

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
to eliminate Cerberus
with the magic bullet.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
Were you the one who
provoked Dusk's actions

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
in the first place?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Not even I would go that far.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
It's those pesky corporations.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Dusk was their way to
try and seize control.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
I just took advantage of
the situation. That's all.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
But boy did our plan
go south and real fast.

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.228 position:50% align:center
Originally, Kaggy-boy was
supposed to take out

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
Eiji-boy's tattoo with
the Deicide bullet

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
and then Dusk was supposed
to finish off Helios.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
With Eiji and his friends
out of the way,

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
Dusk was supposed
to clash with Artemis

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
and disturb the peace.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
Well, that's how our
simple strategy

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
was supposed to play out.

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
But then, a new Cerberus
and crazy Fenrir guy

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
pop up outta nowhere

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
and that threw a big
wrench into things.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
In the end, the Warg's
return sped things up,

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
so that actually worked
out quite well for us.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Good morning, brave
officers of the SWAT team!

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
So, the national government

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
is seizing the special ward.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
All in the name of
keeping the peace.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
Is this part of the PSSS's plan?

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
I wonder.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
As low-level civil servants,
we may never know.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
But regardless, your job is on
our side of this thing, Itsuki.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
You don't have to tell me that.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] To be honest,
I don't really believe now

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
is the best time to do this,
but it is a step towards

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
the town being governed,
this time,

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
by its rightful leaders and
not Artemis or vigilantes.

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
Oh well, then.

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
The sun has risen.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
The final hour of dawn
has come to an end.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.887 position:50% align:center
Time to get a move on.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
The Blockade of Akatsuki begins!

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:22.235 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Yamato Kai.

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.696 position:50% align:center
Ever heard of "the
burglar's midday nap"?

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:26.197 position:50% align:center
Know what it means?

00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:29.117 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] He's tired from a night
of thieving or something?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.870 position:50% align:center
[JIN] That's not right.
That wasn't even the question.

00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:35.665 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Next episode,
"The Blockade of Akatsuki."

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:38.376 position:50% align:center
I can't go around helping people
commit crimes, but c'mon,

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.128 position:50% align:center
there's gotta be something
that I could do?

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.379 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
That's correct!

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:44.507 position:50% align:center
Even though, that wasn't
the question, either!
