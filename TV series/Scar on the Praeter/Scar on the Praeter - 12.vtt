[NEWS ANCHOR A]
And now for the news.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.638 position:50% align:center
We begin with Akatsuki Ward.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
Following a spate
of squatters' riots,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
the city's leadership has
decided to take action.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
In response, the Metropolitan
Police Department

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
has sent in their SWAT Team

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
to forcibly remove
squatters and looters.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Kouga... Itsuki... Brother...

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
We've set up the blockade.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
So far, so good.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center
Only one thing left,
we'll have to work

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
with the Akatsuki PD on this.
We'll need to go root out

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
the squatters and any other
unsavory elements.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] This isn't going to
be easy, you know.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
If there's any resistance,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
we'll just have to send
in the SWAT Team.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.018 position:50% align:center
Helios and Artemis
will be there.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
And worse. Fenrir, too.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
Well then, I guess the SWAT
Team won't be of much use.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
Put them on standby, we wanna
try to avoid casualties.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.911 position:50% align:center
Truthfully, I guess there isn't
much we can do about that.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
We are the PSSS.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] Yes. It's our job
to bring down the Scard.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
That's what we're here for.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
That's the situation in town
at the current moment.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Right. That will be all for now.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
Of course, take care.
Sorry you're dealing with this.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
Tch. A total blockade.
That's weird.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
They seem unusually
eager to fight.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.369 position:50% align:center
How's Ms. Azusa?

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
She's sleeping upstairs.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
She pushed herself too hard.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
She was in no condition
to be doing so much.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
[JIN] The timing of
the PSSS was just right.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
They made their move
in the early morning

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
when she's powerless.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
Ha.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.051 position:50% align:center
Of course they'd pull
something like this.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
It's just like the
cops to play dirty.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
So? Exactly when did you
start working together

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
with that guy from the PSSS?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
[JIN] It must've been before
Dusk went after Eiji Arashiba.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
Which then led to all this
recent activity from them.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
I'm right about that, aren't I?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
You are. That's when it started.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
About a year ago, Kouga
Tatsuma reached out to me.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
I'm hearing you out because
you said it was for the town.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
You want me to turn on Helios?

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
To betray Eiji? Yes?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, no, no!
That came out wrong.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
That isn't what
I'm suggesting here.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
You said to deal with Eiji.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
What is that supposed to mean
if not stab him in the back?

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
You're misunderstanding me!

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
Look, it's just that Eiji's
kind've in the way.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
Er, I mean...

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
If something made it so that
he couldn't fight anymore,

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
that'd be good.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
Listen, you gotta admit, it's
pretty odd, this hero business.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
I just thought you of all people

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
would understand where
I'm coming from.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
This is the failure of
Sakishima Holdings.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
That's the whole reason
we're in this mess.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
The freedom Akatsuki Ward has,

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
it's all built on one man and
one man only: Eiji Arashiba.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
But it won't last. Things can't
go on indefinitely like this.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Us Scard, we're not
all-powerful or immortal.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
Look what happened to Banri.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
Surely you must be aware
of this after his death.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
See my hand? I inherited
this from a senior officer.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
He was one of those
old-school detectives.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
A real firecracker,
you might say.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
I was pretty young,
so I worshipped the man.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
But that's just it.
Flames burn fast.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
Guy's like that don't live long.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
You know what I'm trying
to get at don't you?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
So he was...
Sorry, for your loss.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
It's fine. It's all in the past.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
Things might be okay left alone.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
That is, as long as
Eiji-boy can handle it.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
Just know, sooner or later,
he's gonna fall to pieces.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
Trust me, Kaggy-Boy.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
No one else can free him
from being Akatsuki's Hero.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
You're the only one who can.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
After, I poured through
books I had on the subject.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
I paired it with sorcery I knew.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
Tattoo magic I'd learned
long ago was the key.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
That's how I crafted the bullet.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
Eiji'd be free. I'd rob him
of his power as a Scard.

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
With Akatsuki's hero gone,
the PSSS can move in.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
So the government wants
to control the town, huh?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
What do they take Artemis for?
They think we're idiots?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
All I cared about
was saving Eiji.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
It didn't matter to me what
happened to the town.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
There's one thing
you didn't say.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
Using the bullet will kill you.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa told us.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
Actually, I asked her about
that before she fell asleep.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
A person loses their life force
after firing the bullet,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
and their body eventually dies.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
It won't be very long now.
You know that.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
I never cared!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
If it meant that I could save
Eiji, I'd gladly give my life!

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
But I failed, and everything
went so horribly wrong.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba, the man
you were hoped to save

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
by doing all of this, is dead.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
But everything else?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
All of this is giving the PSSS
exactly what they wanted.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center
[JIN] All the previous
run-ins with Dusk,

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
along with our
conflicts with Helios?

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
They're going to chalk it all up
to the rioting in the area.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
They'll send in the
SWAT to intervene,

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
who'll then proceed to
suppress the violence

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
and rid B1 of all the squatters.

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
There was one element
of this that these guys

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.082 position:50% align:center
couldn't anticipate. Fenrir.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
What's his game?
The hell is he trying to do?

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
The same exact thing he did
during the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
Destroy every single thing
he lays his eyes on.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
The people. The town.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
He has no concept
of allies or enemies.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
He is truly a tattoo
that's gone berserk.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
Ha! Well, if he
took out the PSSS,

00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
he'd just be doing us a favor.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
Wait, is that
Fenrir's objective?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
Hm. He did say that he was
trying to upset public order.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
If he does, it would give the
government a chance to step in.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
That's the current situation.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] To Fenrir,
none of that really matters.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
He'll wipe out both the
SWAT Team and the PSSS.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
He'll obliterate them and
anyone else they send.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
That's what he does.
He prefers sticky situations.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Guy's out of his damn mind.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[JIN] If he continues using
his immense power,

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
and goes on fighting like this,

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
he's eventually going
to meet his end.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
So he's just gonna keep
fighting, keep on destroying,

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
until he kicks the bucket
and takes the town with him?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
Exactly. That's the
sort of creature he is.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
Ha. He can die alone!

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let him do that.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
I'll stop Fenrir.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
I won't let Kazuma die.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Hm...

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
[RAN grunts]

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
He's not at full strength.
Something's missing.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
You're correct.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
It happened when we sealed
him during the Conflict.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
When Ouroboros and Cerberus
robbed Fenrir of its might.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
As of now, it's regained the
power it lost to Ouroboros.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Fenrir is weaker than
when Eiji first fought it.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
That's good news, at least.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
I'm going out there.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
Fenrir will try to
get its power back.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
That means it's gonna
come for Cerberus.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
--[phone ringing]
--Huh?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
I see. Thank you.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
It looks like the PSSS
is on their way here.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
They're headed towards the cafe.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
They're coming for her.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yamato Kai.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
Tell me, think you
can take on Fenrir?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Heh. No hesitation? You're
awfully cocky, aren't you?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
Ha! You're one to talk!

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
Huh? Never mind!
We're leaving!

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Got some urgent
business to attend to.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
We'll take care of Fenrir
after we're done.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
Oh, and please do your best not
to get in our way, all right?

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
I'll be back.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Did you know this whole time?

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Hmm?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
I was assigned here
by the government

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
to kill Eiji Arashiba.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
Really? I had no idea!
That's news to me!

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Itsuki, of course I knew that.

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
The PSSS planned to kill Eiji.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
Once he was gone, they'd
seize control of the town.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
You've been acting alone,
on your own authority.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
Do you really think I'm
that capable a person?

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
Based upon your actions,

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
you're trying to
minimize the damage.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
You used Kagami Sakashima.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
The two of you attempted
to neutralize Eiji

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
before I could make my move.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
We have the same goal in mind,
and that's why we're moving

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
out now ahead of the SWAT team.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Normally, we'd intimidate them

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
with the SWAT Team's
sheer numbers, yes?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
I just hate it when
there's no point to things.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
And the brass is quick
to do stuff like this.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:29.814 position:50% align:center
Such as launching an attack with
an unknown variable like Fenrir.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
What's with you today? You're
giving me all this credit!

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
Don't act without you.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
That's what you're
telling me, right?

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA grunts]

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
[RAN] There's this old
expression that comes to mind.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
"The burglar's midday nap."
Know what it means?

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.456 position:50% align:center
[JIN] A thief will nap
during the day

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
so they can be active at night.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
It basically means
that there's a reason

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
behind everyone's actions.

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
Oh, good morning!

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
The esteemed Ran Washimine
and Jin Karasue.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
So tell me, who's this burglar
you're talking about?

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Is Artemis in need of a
little police assistance?

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
We appreciate your concern.
But we're good.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
They do say looters come
out when there's a fire.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
you're getting at.

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
That reminds me!

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
I heard Ms. Azusa Yuki
isn't doing too well.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[RAN] She accidentally
nicked her finger

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center
while she was cooking.

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
She's adorable sometimes.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
[RAN] If you got her a get-well
gift, we can deliver it.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Oh, no, no.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
We were thinking that we
could visit her in person.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
Pay her a little sympathy call.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
You got some nerve.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
She's over at Cafe
Titan, isn't she?

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
We'll be on our way, then.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
She ain't there. Run along.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
Enough with the chit- chat.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
Move aside.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center
Huh. Pretty sleazy
to try and take out

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa before nightfall
and petty. You bastards.

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
Your plan was pretty obvious.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
With her out of the way,
the PSSS could overwhelm us

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
with sheer numbers.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
They wouldn't have to
be afraid of the dark.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
Then you should know to
step aside. Run along.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
We could start with you.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
I bet we could find all sorts
of dirty little secrets.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
You're outmatched here.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
It's about time.
You're speaking my language.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
That face is what you
should've opened with.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Justice without
force is powerless.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] And force without
justice is tyranny.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Surrender, or we shall
carry out justice with force.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
[RAN] We, the Twin Wings,
shall be the halberd

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
that pierces all that
defiles the moon.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
[JIN] The Twin Wings,
shall be the shield

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
that repels all that
dishonor the moon.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] We the Twin Wings
do solemnly swear this,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
even if we are scattered
and torn to pieces.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Here we go!

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
What's the matter, huh?

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
Is that all you got?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
You're funny!

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
Want some more?
Comin' right up!

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
This is great!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Oh, it sure is!

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
You sure know how
to spice things up!

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
What ya got there?

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
Have you been swinging
around a popsicle

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
this whole time? That it?

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
So this is the power of Fafnir!

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Take this!

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
That won't work on me!

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Here goes!

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Whoa!

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
You won't escape!

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.941 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
He's way too fast for Morrígan.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
And on top of that,
making illusions

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
is really delicate business.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:07.240 position:50% align:center
Once this is all over,
I'm taking some time off!

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I'm surprised you
decided to stay here.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:18.585 position:50% align:center
If I were you, I would've
left this place.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for you.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
I don't understand you.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
Is this some sort
of hero complex?

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
Or is this atonement for the
death of Eiji? Is that it?

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I'm here for you.
I came to save Kazuma.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:44.486 position:50% align:center
But I'm him.
And Kazuma is me.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
All my actions are based
off of his desires.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
They're the hopes and
dreams of a hero's brother.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
A boy trapped in an unending
search for power.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
That is why I am going
to destroy everything.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
The town's defenders.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
And the town's destroyers.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
All the people on the outside
living in ignorance.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
If this town hadn't existed,
Eiji wouldn't have died.

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
That's why I'll destroy it all.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
I'll destroy everything,
here and now.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
This fate...
It's what Kazuma wants.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
All of it's just an impulse,
nothing more!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You think you know so much.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
I understand everything there
is to know about Kazuma.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
So then, what could
you know that I don't?

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
Ever since we met,
I knew who he was.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.165 position:50% align:center
That's enough for me.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. It doesn't matter.
My mission is the same.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
I shall take back the power
that Cerberus stole.

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
Once more, I'll be complete.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
I will become the
god-devouring warg.

00:16:55.348 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
I'll chew it up
and spit it back out!

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
The town. Its people. Myself.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
All of it!

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
I won't let you!

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Can't believe
you're such a pushover!

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:23.585 position:50% align:center
You all right there?
Got any fight in you?

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Damn! Your defense
is solid as a rock!

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
There's no way you can
win. Just give up.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
Ha! I admit this is
a grueling fight.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:42.312 position:50% align:center
But who's saying
we can't still win?

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
This job's starting to
wear me down a little.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
Let's finish this!

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
[JIN] You don't know
when to quit, do you?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Someone's getting worked up!

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[JIN] I was really hoping
to go home early!

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
[RAN] You idiot!
Defense doesn't matter!

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only idiot here!

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
Had a feeling you'd pull that!

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
I read you like a book!

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
Now let's wreck 'em!

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Hraesvelgr!

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
Crap!

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
Too bad that didn't finish
the job. I was hoping it would.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
That was close.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
Kouga. You saved me
from that blast.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Yeah, well,
what are friends for, right?

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
That one came in fast.
At that speed,

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
there was no way you
could've stopped in time.

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
But anyhow...

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
I'm tired of this.

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
Enough with the
stubborn routine.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
Funny. That's what
I was gonna say.

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
Okay, now I'm pissed off!

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
I'm finishing this--
once and for all!

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
--[buzzing]
--Hm?

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:01.975 position:50% align:center
You guys mind if I take this?

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
It's a call for me.

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
Go for Kouga.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA growling]

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
Argh, those morons!

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
They're ignoring the
facts on the ground!

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
So I take it the brass have
moved the SWAT Team in?

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
You don't say.
Sounds pretty bad.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
If Fenrir has his full strength,
he'll engage them.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
The SWAT Team's no match
for his power.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
You'll lose a lotta men.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.176 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Aren't you going to pull back?

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
You don't want any
casualties, right?

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's something
we'd like to avoid.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
But at the same time,
subduing you two

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
and securing Azusa
is our top priority.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Guess we've got only one choice.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
To crush you two
and return the favor.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Best of luck... Yamato Kai.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO groaning]

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] It's over.
You almost won, too.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
I'm not done yet.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.501 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO gasps, groans]

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
Poor fool. You will
never become a hero.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO groans]

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
Give back what's mine.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO screaming]

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO groaning]

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
I've reclaimed the rest of it.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
My strength has been restored.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
The fangs of the devouring
warg are sharp once more.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
I shall destroy it all.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
You. Me. Everything.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
I'm the one who killed Eiji.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
The town he worked so hard
to defend. I ruined it.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
After all that, I couldn't
even save Kazuma.

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Eiji... Banri... Please.
Where did I go wrong?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.864 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to do, Eiji?

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
No, it can't be!

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kagami. I'm back.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.618 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Here's a good one.
All's well that ends well.

00:23:30.702 --> 00:23:33.246 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Here, it's "Owari
yokereba subete yoshi."

00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.123 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Yep. That's correct.

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.667 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Next episode,
"Hero of Akatsuki."

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Yeah, that's also correct.

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:42.630 position:50% align:center
Okay. Time to bite!
