[HOKUTO]
Cat-sìth has been neutralized.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
And Ouroboros will fall
if we attack him head-on.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
Take all of our forces
and hunt Helios down.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
Kill anyone who gets in our way.

[MALE A yelps]

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
[MALE B]
Please help us!

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
So somebody new has
inherited Cerberus.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
It doesn't really matter. It's
not like he's Eiji Arashiba.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
There shall be no dawn for him.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
Ashes to ashes. Dust
to dust. Dusk to dusk.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.674 position:50% align:center
Any Cerberus who isn't
the Hero of Akatsuki,

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
hmph, is just swine.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.023 position:50% align:center
Dusk's Scard leader
lured you out.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.817 position:50% align:center
He must've wanted to isolate
and incapacitate you.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
With you out of the way,

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
they could invade with
the rest of their forces.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
Eiji's not with us.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
And I'm not the strongest
of Scard by any means.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.994 position:50% align:center
Their strategy accounted
for all of these factors.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.289 position:50% align:center
I'll be damned
if I let them win!

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, don't!

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
Your injuries are too deep.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
And if you continue to use
your tattoo in this condition,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
it might go berserk.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
Didn't Ran from Artemis
say something like that?

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
That if you're tired,
it'll act up.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
It happens when you
get weak. Like now.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Your tattoo
seals a divine being.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.310 position:50% align:center
So, when the Scard is fatigued,

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
the seal becomes
worn out as well.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
And worst case,
it'll consume your mind.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
You'll go mad with
rage until you die.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I'm fine. I'll manage!

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, rest up.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
I'll go instead.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kagami,
if you're not too beat,

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
can you evacuate
any B1 residents

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.372 position:50% align:center
who might get caught in this?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Right.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA groans]
Who put you in charge, huh?

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Dusk forgot me.
For all their planning,

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
it looks like I wasn't
counted as part of Helios.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Well, at the very least,

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
they don't seem to think
that I'm a threat.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's cause
you're not a threat.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] And as long
as they believe that,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
I've got the advantage.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
The bastards have been coming
into the special ward

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
through B1, the neighborhood
where I used to live.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
No more. I'm not gonna let
them have free rein with us.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
I have lots of reasons
to fight these Dusk guys.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
And plus...

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
I know B1 better than them.
It's my home turf.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
I can try to buy us
some time at least.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hey!

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
They're tough.
Don't push yourself.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
I just mean. You're nowhere near
as strong as Eiji, y'know?

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
I won't let them
terrorize us anymore.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
Not in B1. And not with Helios.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Yeah. We've just confirmed it.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we'll handle it.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
And I was just about this close

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
to calling it a day
and this had to happen.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Do we really have
to work overtime?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
Quit your whining, Jin.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
Take an extra vacation day.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Hm?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who is this?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
[ANIME BOY A] I guess it's time
for us to say goodbye, Tanucal.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
[RAN grunts]

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
Who was that just now?

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Oh, just Dusk.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
You're in luck. Sounds like you
can go home if you want to.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Ah! I know why they called.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
They wanted to tell us
they only came here

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
to fight Helios, and that we
should stay out of it, right?

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
Way to give us a head's up.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
His words were:
"Both of us want to avoid

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
unnecessary bloodshed."
Do you believe that?

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Should we go home then?

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
Tanucal's getting to
an important part.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
[ANIME BOY A] So long!
Goodbye! Live well, now!

[DUSK MEMBER A]
Our target is Titan.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
Though I gotta say,
we're being treated like

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
we're expendable or something.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER B] That's the way
Hokuto sees us, always has.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
It's just the way he is.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
But enough chit-chat.
Titan still has some Scard left.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER A]
Heh, heh. Strength in numbers.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
If we overwhelm 'em
like we did with Cat-sìth,

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
odds are they're not
gonna be-- Huh?

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center

It's Cerberus!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER A]
It's not Arashiba!

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
Just some other guy!
Nothing to worry about!

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
Let's take him out, boys!

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
Attacking us head on?
What an idiot!

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER A]
I can't hit him!

What are you doing?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Hmm?

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
Oh, just keeping
an eye on things.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
We're talking about B1 here.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
Most of the people that
live in this neighborhood

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
are squatters or criminals
who're on the lam,

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
so it could become a riot.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
And dealing with Dusk is outside
our jurisdiction anyway.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Well! Guess we better put
the regular cops on this one.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI grunts]

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center

[DUSK MEMBER E yelps]

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
[sighs] There's so many.
This'll be tough.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
You can follow that
path to safety.

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center

Thank you.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center

[KAGAMI] Hey! Better
make your escape, too.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
What about Yamato and
Kazuma. Are they okay?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Yes.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Kazuma's fine, thanks to you.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure Yamato's
all right as well.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
So, hurry along now!

Cerberus?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
It isn't like
it's Eiji Arashiba.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
Use your numbers to box him in.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
That's how Eiji
finally went down.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.115 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
Trying to be like Arashiba, huh?

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
Does this idiot think he's
a hero or something?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Akatsuki's hero. He's gone.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:22.228 position:50% align:center
But even so, I'll protect
as many I can.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER F]
All right.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Since Cerberus went to
intercept the other squad,

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
this should be a piece of cake.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
The only ones there are
Cat-sìth and Ouroboros.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER G] It's gonna be
a breeze to bag Cat-sìth.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER F]
Yeah.

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER F]
Huh?

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
I realize that close-quarters
combat isn't my forte.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
However, the true
power of Ouroboros

00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
lies not in healing, but
in physical manipulation.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center

to fine-tune my attack.

So I apologize for
any lasting pain

that you may experience.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
Well, it'd be impossible
for one person

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
to take out all of them, right?

Ms. Azusa, I know we began

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
without your
permission, but uh...

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
It was a decision that you were

more than free to
make, my wings.

What is this?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Ms. Azusa has the power
to control moonlight.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
The moon's beams take
on physical substance.

They can become any
degree of hardness.

Ms. Azusa is
basically unstoppable.

All right, Jin,
I think that's our cue

to go take out the trash.

I shall finally return the favor
I had left unpaid. Tonight.

It's Artemis.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa finally shows herself.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
It's everywhere. This is
the power of Azusa Yuki.

coming all the way

out here again? I'm serious.

We could've just stayed
back at the precinct.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
[RAN] You just want to watch
more anime, don't you?

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Uh, duh! I'm taking
tomorrow off, so...

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Heh. Do you know
who Judas Iscariot was?

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
What kinda question is that?

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
The name is literally
synonymous with "traitor."

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Who's being compared to him?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Oh, well, if you don't
know, then that makes sense.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Oh man, I really overdid it.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.195 position:50% align:center
Itsuki, you're still young,
so you don't know this,

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
but trust me. When you
get to be my age,

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
pulling all-nighters gets
to be a little too much.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.204 position:50% align:center
It stays with you the next day,

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
and it takes much
longer to get over.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
Worried about Yammy-boy?

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
No.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] I haven't heard any
reports of casualties

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
from last night yet.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
So I've got no idea
whether he's all right.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
Catch!

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
Nice work last night!

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
I've got no reason
to accept this.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
I have water.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
I'm your senior officer and
I'm gonna treat you, 'kay?

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
Please, just take it.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Can't even
handle a cafe au lait?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
I can.

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
You didn't have to
drink it, you know.

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
Shall I go inside and make
us a little breakfast then?

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
We've got some stuff
in the freezer.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds good.

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:24.988 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Kazuma, have you ever heard

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:27.240 position:50% align:center
of the urban legend of
the Saru Yume nightmare?

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:28.783 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Why are you
asking me all of a sudden,

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.076 position:50% align:center
how should I know?

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Well, that's incorrect.

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:32.829 position:50% align:center
Saru Yume's actually about--

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.999 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] N-Next episode,
"The Warg's Claw Marks"!

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
That's correct! So, anyway...

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.920 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Ah! Can't hear you!
I can't hear you!
