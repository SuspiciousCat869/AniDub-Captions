[ITSUKI]
Yamato Kai.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
What the hell's
wrong with him?

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Hello? Itsuki?

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
I'm on my way but I'll
be late picking you up.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
I'm going to see Natto-boy.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
Y'know. Yammy-boy's
cute little brother.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
Huh? I don't have to come?

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't you need
anything from the store.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
Natto.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
Minato Kai?

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
Yamato Kai's little brother.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
The ward's out there.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm just
not like Yamato.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.372 position:50% align:center
I could never be a hero.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.583 position:50% align:center
[doorbell rings]

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:52.339 position:50% align:center
This is Itsuki Torataka
of the MPD's PSSS.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
Could I have a moment
of your time?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
You're that partner Kouga
told me about earlier.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
Is there something
I can do for you?

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
Kouga just stopped
by here this morning.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
I'm not here because of him.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
Yamato Kai is the
reason I've come.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
But Officer Torataka, I've
told Kouga this many times.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
I really don't know
where to find Yamato.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
I just don't.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm fully aware
that you're not

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
in possession of
that information.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.911 position:50% align:center
Then if you don't mind
what did you come here for?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
What kind of man
is Yamato Kai?

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
He and I fought the other day.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
You fought him?

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
Is he okay?

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
Actually, when Kouga was here,
he mentioned he was fine.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
I didn't kill him,
so there's that.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Kill him?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
That's good. Anyway,
I'm glad that he's okay.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Does he not value his life?

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
Normal people usually beg for
their lives when at gunpoint.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
But he... he didn't.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
To tell the truth,
I think he is normal.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
B1, the place where
we used to live,

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
was dangerous--even by
special ward standards.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, but you knew that obviously.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
Yamato was constantly pushing
himself really hard

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
so he could support
the both of us.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
Also, if someone was in trouble
he couldn't ignore them.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
He was always getting hurt.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
But he always managed
to make it home.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
You said before that Yamato
didn't beg for his life

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
when you held him
at gunpoint, right?

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
If that's true, well, I think

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
it's likely because he
was planning on winning.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.043 position:50% align:center
My big brother isn't a quitter.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
That's why I know this.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
He never gave up, even then.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
He still believed
that he could win?

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
Is he really too dumb to know
when he's been beaten?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
[MINATO laughing]

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
On my way.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
Pardon me.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] I'm glad you
told me about Yamato.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
You're saying that even
though I fought him?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
That law book.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
Did Kouga leave that here?

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
[MINATO] He wanted to know if
there was anything I wanted,

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
so I asked him for it.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
That's all.
And he brought it here.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
That was something you wanted?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
I'd like to be useful
to someone someday.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
Until now I never really
got the chance to study.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
I hope that one day I'll
be able to help others

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
like my brother does,
without fighting.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
You realize you're
under house arrest.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
Leverage to be used
against Yamato Kai.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
Frankly, it comes as no
surprise you two are siblings.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
Yep. I'm his brother.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Well, this is a first!

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
You never get out of
bed later than me.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hmm?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
What? What's up?

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
Get off!

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
You're real hot.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
You sick?

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
Kazuma's run himself ragged.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
He's been going out at night.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.891 position:50% align:center
Scouring Akatsuki
Ward for Fenrir.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
And he's been using his
tattoo's power far too much.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
Hey, this is nothing.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
Fenrir is the priority.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
He's still out there.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Plus, there've been more
and more attacks.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
And still we've had
no luck finding him.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
You need to rest, man.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
What?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
You know that Yamato is correct.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Taking his side, huh?

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Yes. Think you'd win if
you fought Fenrir now?

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
If he's the real deal,
you'd be going

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
toe to toe against
a violate tattoo.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
Even so.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
Sit down.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Ugh.

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] What are you
doing back there?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
I heard about this from Minato.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
When someone's got a cold.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center
Then you should make
them some sake eggnog!

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Wait. That's
my special magic wine!

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Huh? What'd you say?

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
So, what do I need?

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
Let's start with sake
and eggs first.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Wait a second!

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
Do you even know how to make it?

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
Hey! Stop! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
Kazuma!

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Wha--?

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
I was really happy...

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
...to have finally met Eiji!

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
I looked up to him.
For so long!

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's happening here?

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
My parents were good folks.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
They taught me to help others,
even if they were in trouble.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
That it was the right thing.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Cool yeah, uh-huh.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I... I also believed
that it was right.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
But when the Akatsuki conflict
hit, I felt completely helpless,

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't save anyone!

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
I was just so weak!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
But who came along and saved me?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
Eiji did!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.835 position:50% align:center
He fought and he bled for us!

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
He saved this town
and he gave us all hope!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
Take it easy.
What's wrong with you?

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
I was useless!

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was to help
people just like Eiji did!

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.972 position:50% align:center
So, I just kept on thinking
of different ways

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
that a weak weakling
like me could fight.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
Eiji changed my life!

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
Kazuma. I will save you!
I help you get well!

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
The hell is wrong with you?

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
Wait, stop! I'm not even
old enough to drink yet!

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Cuz I'm old enough!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
How is that not supposed
to make me worry?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO laughing]

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Oh, dear.
Looks like he got drunk

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
just from the smell of it!

00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Bottoms up!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[VOICES]
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.756 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
H-Hey?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Kazuma.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
Those...

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
...are nice pajamas!

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
You know why?

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Cerberus can also
tell the difference

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
between people's intent to kill.

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
Fenrir never wavered
for a second.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
But you? You were different.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] When you pointed
your gun at me,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
Cerberus sensed hesitation.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
You couldn't just kill someone
without having some doubts.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
You're not a bad guy.
I know that much.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
So I... had doubts?

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
I've got a lot of dreams.
That's why I fight.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
And I've also gotta make all of
Eiji's dreams come true, too.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.335 position:50% align:center
I fight whenever I believe

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
that it'll help turn these
hopes into reality.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.881 position:50% align:center
And only I can decide
when that is.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanted to save you.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Uh, I mean, I know
you're strong, but...

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
Honestly?

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
Are you...

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A]
Listen well.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
You and your tattoo are a
blade defending this nation.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
No. You are a blade
defending the world.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Me and Qiongqi.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
From now on, you no
longer need to think, boy.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
Blades do not hesitate, ever.

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
All thoughts and
feelings are useless.

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
Blades only exist to cut
evil out of this world.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
"Justice without force
is powerless.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
Force without justice
is tyranny."

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
"Justice With Force." That is
the blade named Itsuki Torataka.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
I am a blade.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
"Justice With Force."

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Looks like you two
you are getting along well.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI groans]

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
Itsuki! Hey, are you okay?

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
They look more painful
than they are deep.

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
There's a lot of blood.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
I'm aware.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
I'll say this.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
Minato Kai is fine.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Hm?

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
It's okay for you
to tell me that?

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
It'll keep you in check.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
You have no proof
if I'm lying or not.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.179 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it.

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI chuckles]

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
So, that was Fenrir.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] It's only a little
bit farther to the car.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
Just hang in there, okay?

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Don't make a fuss.

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
All right, all right.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI grunts]

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Why did you join the PSSS?

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
Finally showing an interest
in your partner?

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
You know about my past, right?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
That I was just a cop at the
Akatsuki Police Department.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] You inherited Fafnir
from one of your colleagues.

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
The PSSS found out, and you
were transferred there.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
I lucked out.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
Not only did I gain these
fancy Scard powers,

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.355 position:50% align:center
but now I could boss
around my old coworkers!

00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
Imagine!

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
About our duty as officers.
What do you think of it?

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
Is this the blood loss talking?

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I should feel
thankful or irritated

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
that you're chatting me up.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
Hey, Itsuki.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.328 position:50% align:center
If you can, try not
to let guys like him

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
rub off on you
too much, all right?

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
Rub off what?

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
Nothing, never mind.

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
But now it's bed rest
for you, young man,

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
so you can get better
as soon as possible.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.217 position:50% align:center
Then we'll act?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Yeah. Dusk'll be back.
Sooner than we think.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS chattering]

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
[HOKUTO] Last time,
we took out Eiji Arashiba.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Even though it cost us
a lotta men to do it.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
Still, I would've loved to
have killed him myself.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
Next is Cat-sìth.
Kazuma Arashiba.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
Once we finish him,
that's it. Helios falls.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
Play time.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
Helios will be herded, boxed in,

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
and slaughtered.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.363 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Have you ever heard that
expression westerners say,

00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:28.825 position:50% align:center
"Let sleeping dogs lie."
Know what it means?

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:31.286 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI] Dealing with a problem
could make things worse.

00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:34.080 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Huh? That's correct.

00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:35.999 position:50% align:center
You know your Western idioms.

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.626 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Next episode, "Dusk Arrives."

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.794 position:50% align:center
This is correct.

00:23:39.878 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
You even took my line.
