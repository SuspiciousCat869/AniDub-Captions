Hey, I have a question for you.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
the Moon card means in Tarot?

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
If upright, it means deception.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
But if it's reversed, it means
a break with the past

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
and a promise of new
hope for the future.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
What an ambiguous question.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
That's correct.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
And fortune-telling is
always pretty ambiguous.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
Though with the Moon,
everything but

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
the deception feels
like it makes sense.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.211 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
I don't know what that means.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
[AZUSA]
A hero has died.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
And the night is astir
with the news, it seems.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Regarding the recent
Dusk incursion

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
that took place in
B1 the other day,

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
I don't have a single
doubt the invaders

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
were after Eiji Arashiba.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.484 position:50% align:center
Yes, all that's already
common knowledge, though.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
But what's really cause
for concern is the route

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:13.198 position:50% align:center
by which the weapons were
imported. A vast arsenal

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
was brought into town, and we,
Artemis, didn't know about it.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.121 position:50% align:center
They slipped right through.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
Normally, this wouldn't
ever happen.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
Artemis is always on
the lookout for things

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
of this sort being trafficked
into Akatsuki ward.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
And with only three members,

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.216 position:50% align:center
Helios is barely
an organization,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.426 position:50% align:center
so it's often one step behind.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
But for a large group
like ours to have

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
somehow completely
missed this...

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.851 position:50% align:center
A Dusk spy, within
the organization itself.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
Yes ma'am.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
We know who's involved here.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
It's those Dusk bastards.
Damn them all.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
So Eiji's gone.
Do they think that means

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
the town's theirs
for the taking now?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.448 position:50% align:center
We have nothing
to worry about.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:58.743 position:50% align:center
As long as they make
sure to leave us alone.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.871 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa, we'll handle this.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.249 position:50% align:center
I honestly believe that
it'd be far more efficient

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.376 position:50% align:center
for our subordinates
to deal with it all.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
That's why we're set up
as a company, right?

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
Except it's our job to deal
with the important cases

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.590 position:50% align:center
that only Scard can take on!

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:16.094 position:50% align:center
You wanna clock out on time?
Then let's get on this!

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
But if I get tired,
I'll take the day off.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:20.849 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
[JIN laughs]

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50% align:center
You should do as you
both see fit.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.938 position:50% align:center
After all, you are my...

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
Or rather, Artemis's dual
pinions. The Twin Wings.

[RAN grunts]

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
We shall live up to
your will of course.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
As your Twin Wings.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
[RAN, JIN] The Twin Wings
shall be the halberd

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
that pierces all that
dishonor the moon.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
The Twin Wings
shall be the shield

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.086 position:50% align:center
that repels all that
dishonor the moon.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.213 position:50% align:center
We the Twin Wings swear this.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
Even if we are scattered
and torn to pieces.

[YAMATO grunts]

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] So this Scard appeared
around when Eiji was attacked?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm positive.
And he had a wolf tattoo.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
He said that his name is Fenrir.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
Fenrir.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
Then there's him.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
As far as we know, he might have
some connection to Fenrir.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
Had a nice nap now, didn't ya?

[KAGAMI] I wouldn't start moving
around much yet if I were you.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
It's been a week since
you passed out.

[YAMATO]
That long, huh?

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
Well, you had a
life-threatening injury.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
And you didn't give it
proper time to heal.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
I used my tattoo
to sew you up.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
Ouroboros allowed me
to tend to your wounds.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center

Is this Helios's hideout?

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Yes, Cafe Titan.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
Are you in Helios, too?
Are you one of the Scard?

I'm Kagami Sakishima.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
About all my tattoo can
do is suture and salve.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, that's about the
extent of Ouroborous' abilities.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you. You saved me.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI grunts]

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
It can only repair
external trauma.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Ouroboros' power,
it allows me to perform

surgical treatment
without instruments.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center

for blood loss.

[grunts] Don't get
the wrong idea.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center

what happened to Eiji.

It wasn't to save you.

So talk. How exactly did you get
that Cerberus Tattoo, huh?

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you said you're
Eiji's brother, right?

It's all your damn fault!

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
You killed him. My brother's
dead because of you.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
You can't say that for sure.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] They used a magic
bullet. Am I right?

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what Eiji
told me. And that cop, too.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
The Deicide--

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
a magic bullet that can
destroy divine beings.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
It's a magic weapon that
kills the sacred deity

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.787 position:50% align:center
sealed within a tattoo.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
Once shot, it never
misses its target.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
It breaches the
tattoo's defenses,

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
and kills its
divine being within.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
What? Wait a minute,
are you serious?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
Right. I keep forgetting you
practice magic and stuff.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
I've only dabbled a bit in it.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
the magic bullet,

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
I've only heard stories of it.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
Even if one actually existed,
I'm uncertain

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
whether it'd be powerful
enough to kill a divine tattoo.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
And I can't begin to
imagine how much

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
time and money it would
take to create one.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Eiji was positive that there
wouldn't be a second round too.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Well, there you have it.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
Something's not right.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
You just said that bullet
can destroy tattoos.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
But Cerberus is
right there on him!

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Yes. It is on him.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
And that's exactly why
you can't say for certain

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
that he killed your brother.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
Wait, why?

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
Because he took the
bullet instead of Eiji.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
The PSSS told you, right?

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
That the Deicide lost its power
when it passed through you?

[YAMATO]
Mm-hm.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
So what? Eiji would've
just lost Cerberus

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
if this guy hadn't been there?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
And he ended up saving
my brother's life?

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're
trying to say?

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not saying that.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
But at the very least,
he protected Cerberus.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
Eiji left Cerberus with him.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
It's impossible to take a

told me a little bit about you.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Eiji told you about me?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
He told me about how the two
of you first came to meet.

And even if you
did protect Eiji,

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
why did he leave
Cerberus with you?

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
Why did Eiji allow you
to be his successor?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Why would he save you even if
it meant he'd lose his tattoo?

Kazuma, you're

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
A ritual must be performed

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
So just teach it to him already!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that's not all.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
You will also
require both the will

Cerberus itself.

And at the very least, it seems,

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
both Eiji and Cerberus
have approved of him.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
Then the answer is simple.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
Approve the transfer.

that I should go
straight to Cafe Titan.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
They told me that Mr. Eiji

Outside Akatsuki?

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center

Hm?

You call that the flames

What a loada crap.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
That's not what
your tattoo does.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
It's something else, I bet.

Don't distract me, all right!

I'm trying to work here!

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no, the whole thing's
over. There's absolutely no way

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center

Sorry, jeez.

next time, Yamato.

What the hell was that, huh?

00:19:56.446 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
You used Cerberus.
And that's all you could do?

to gather a bit more intel.
It looks like we definitely did.

[RAN] Helios complicated things
