[HOKUTO] Last time,
we took out Eiji Arashiba.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS chuckle]

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
Still, I would've loved
to have killed him myself.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
[HOKUTO sighs]

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.407 position:50% align:center
Next is Cat-sìth.
Kazuma Arashiba.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.119 position:50% align:center
Once we finish him,
that's it. Helios falls.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBER A]
Move it!

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
[HOKUTO] Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust. And dusk to dusk.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
For Helios there
shall be no dawn.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
We're going to herd
them, box them in.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
And slaughter them!

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:09.986 position:50% align:center
Without Eiji Arashiba, Helios
is nothing. Just swine!

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
So that was Fenrir.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.510 position:50% align:center
The ferocity of
a violate tattoo.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
Not even Cerberus
can withstand its power.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO exhales]

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Eiji was so much faster than me.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
He was fiercer, too.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Feeling better already?

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
Forget about how I feel.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
I heard you just fought Fenrir.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts] Why didn't you
call me then, huh?

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
You and that freak from
the PSSS fought him?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
Why'd you let him escape?

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
You're totally useless!
Two on one and you couldn't win?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO exhales]

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center
This your idea of
being thoughtful?

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
After fighting him, it's pretty
clear. Fenrir is powerful.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
Who gives a crap?

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] His attacks are strong
enough to breach tattoos.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
His intent to kill
was sharp as a knife.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
He was using lethal force
and didn't hesitate.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
And though his attacks
seem like they're random,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
there's a method to
the madness, for sure.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Your point?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous for any
of us to fight him alone.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
We should patrol in pairs.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You're so full of yourself.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Hm?

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You're such an arrogant bastard!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
You think you're all that just
because you fought him

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
and lived?

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
And since some guy
couldn't kill you,

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't stand a
chance against him?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
Because you have Cerberus,
you're a hero?

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
I bet you think that you're
the new Eiji in town, don't you?

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
You really piss me off!

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
You have since that start!

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
Who the hell do you
think you are?

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who's gonna
take over for Eiji!

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna lead Helios!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Yeah.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Don't you "yeah" me!

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
Why the hell are you
even here, huh?

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
I try to do what
I think is right,

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
and what Eiji thought
was right, too.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA growls]

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, there's no way I'm
gonna let you fight alone.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Then get ready
to defend yourself.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
You didn't fight back last time.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] And now you've got
this weird look on your face

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
like you wanna come save me!

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
All of that makes me sick,
you hear me!

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
C'mon then!

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
Show me what you
and Cerberus can do!

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
All right then.

damn strong, y'know?

Uh-oh, did you lose again?

Well... Kinda!

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
"Kinda"?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
[BANRI] Listen, Eiji is really
bad at explaining things.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder no one
can understand him.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Think fast!

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
Let me translate for you.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
Here's what Eiji
was trying to say.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center
First off "It's because
I'm just so damn strong,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
y'know," means that
no matter what,

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:05.068 position:50% align:center
he's always gonna be more
experienced than you are.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
When he says, "You're not that
good at imitating me,"

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
what he really means is that
you've got your own style

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
of fighting.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
And since you do,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
maybe that's what you should
really focus on when training.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
Just face it. The two of
you are different people.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
This will always be true.
No matter how strong your bond.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
Fight like me. Not like Eiji.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
that's what Eiji

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
was trying to tell me
when he said all that?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
Eh. Could be crap.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Crazy cat!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
What I will say however is that
I've known Eiji longer than you.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
Oh, and uh... Another thing.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
Even I can see
you suck with guns.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
Looks like my guess was right.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
So, wanna try that sword?
Could be interesting.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
I'm useless.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
Getting sick, how stupid.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
Idiot. How can this be
the best I'm capable of?

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
Damn. At this rate, I'll
never be as good as Eiji.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
If he saw me,
he'd hang his head.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
And if Banri came back,
he'd laugh at me again,

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
like he always did.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.180 position:50% align:center
[FENRIR]
I'm Fenrir.

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
Guess I lucked out.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
You do exist.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
You're mine now, Fenrir!

This time you're dead, for sure!

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting you get away!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS laughing]

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
Why's Dusk here?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
Out of my way!

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
You scum!

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
I followed up with
my contacts in B1.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
It's like Fenrir's a ghost.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
Nobody knows anything about him.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Not surprising.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
If possible, I'd
rather that you don't

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
concern yourself
with that Scard.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
That's my opinion at least.

You'll look, though.
I can't stop you.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
So, you feeling better now?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
It was just a cold, that's all.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to
worry you. I'm sorry.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
It's how I am.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
Back in B1, a lot of people
would get really sick.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
And never completely recover.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
Can you point to
where you saw him?

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
I think...

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
Around right here.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
Kagami. If you were gonna
corner Kazuma, it'd be here.

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
If a big group were to attempt
to take on Kazuma and his sword.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
That's why, I need a favor.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] So, Kagami's
our sniper then, huh?

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] I asked him to
thin out Dusk's forces.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
But I didn't know he'd
be so good at it.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
Kagami does come from
the Sakashima family.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
Though he hates
talking about that it.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
He's a pretty talented guy.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's been a big help.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Once these guys have
been thinned out,

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
let's clear a path
from the inside.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Tell me something I don't know!

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS gasping]

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
This did not turn out
the way I expected.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
Well, let's call it a day.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
[DUSK D]
Huh?

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
I'm think I'm gonna
leave you guys.

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
Just go ahead and
retreat however you can.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50% align:center
[DUSK D]
Wh-What?

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.613 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS groaning]

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
This was good enough
for a start, I think.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I didn't ask
for your help, you know.

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Yeah. Kinda stepped
on your toes there.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
I don't owe you any favors.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
Always gotta have
your way, right?

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, you don't owe
me anything, okay?

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
See, this is the reason
you drive me nuts.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
I didn't ask for
your help, you know.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
Ya dope. Just don't forget
you owe me triple for this.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I don't remember
owing you anything!

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
[EIJI] Ah, I must've hit you
harder than I thought.

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, you two.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Are you all right?

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
Just shut up. I'm fine.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
You two are the nosiest
people I've ever met.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
We might be. But I'm
glad you're okay.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
You look beat. Seems Cat-sìth
has had it as well.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
What's done is done.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
I guess I should
at least thank you.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
I only did what I wanted to do.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
The kid told us what
happened. Thank him.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
You, kid?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[BOY A gasping]

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Tch.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
And plus. It isn't over yet.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.000 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
Considering the size
of Dusk's forces,

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
the number we encountered
there was too small.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
[DUSK MEMBERS screaming]

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
[HOKUTO] With Cat-sìth
down for the count,

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
Helios will fall quite easily.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.267 position:50% align:center
Time for phase two of the hunt.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] These guys again.
Can't they just give it a rest?

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
We should call in the police
to take care of this.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
It's Dusk.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
Think they're finally trying
to snuff out Helios?

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
This whole thing is such a pain!

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
I just clocked out
for the day, too.

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Well, it's all fine
if they leave us alone.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
You know the phrase, "It is
ill to wake sleeping dogs"?

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it means you
shouldn't stir up trouble

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
where there isn't any.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
In other words, you'd
only be giving yourself

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.922 position:50% align:center
a big old headache for nothing.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
[JIN] It looks like the dogs are
already pretty awake, though.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
But that's not what you
were saying just now, is it?

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
[RAN]
Honestly, not sure.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.238 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Hey there, Yammy-boy!

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.115 position:50% align:center
You happen to remember
what Judas

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:29.034 position:50% align:center
from the Bible is famous for?

00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.952 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] He's the man who
betrayed Jesus Christ.

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:32.370 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
That's correct.

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:33.747 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Sometimes I wonder...

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.789 position:50% align:center
He must've had some kind've

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:36.332 position:50% align:center
reason for doing
it though, right?

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.543 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] That's what troubles
you about Judas?

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.086 position:50% align:center
Interesting take.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.963 position:50% align:center
Next episode, "Dawn."

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
That's the right answer?
