No.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
I should've said
something sooner.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
I can tell you Fenrir
is a violate tattoo.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
First off, the tattoos
that we each possess

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
are objects that can barely tame

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
the uncontrollable power
of a divine being.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
They're able to bend it
to the bearer's will

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
by giving it a name and sealing
it within a beast's form.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
It'll act up though,
whenever you get weak.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
It is necessary for the
tattoo to approve of you,

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
but considering the
seal is holding back

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
a divine being,
I think it's a fair trade.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
But there's another type
of tattoo that remains

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
uncontrollable, even after
the deity is sealed.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
And those ones are
the Violate tattoos.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
Due to their immense power,

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
these tattoos are quite
difficult to control

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
and they consume the Scard
who own them in the end.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
Hence the use of
the term "violate."

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
For instance, Azusa Yuki's
Artemis is one of them.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
On top of that, the Artemis
tattoo chooses its own bearer,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
so that's another difference.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Regardless. Fenrir
is also a violate tattoo.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center

Fenrir versus Helios.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center

myself, and Banri,

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center

you ever talk about this?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center

I should've told you earlier.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
However, there's
absolutely no way

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
that Fenrir could
be alive today.

And why is that?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center

Eiji killed Fenrir.

with my own two eyes.

did I run into?

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center

Artemis is looking for?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center

that this warg Scard

with Eiji's death, Kazuma.

You're passing it off?

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.550 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
Okay, to recap.
First, there's Fenrir.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
He showed up in
the middle of the

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki Conflict
and Helios killed him.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
At some point during that time,

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
he attacked Ms. Azusa but she
never learned his true identity.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR] Yes,
that's all right on the money.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
I hate to say this,
but I also thought

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
that Fenrir was dead
this whole time.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Next, there's Dusk's
connection to the traitor.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
Dusk made contact with
some Artemis members,

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
threatening them to
give up information.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
But one thing doesn't
make any sense.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
[RAN] All the contact with
Dusk took place in my...

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
Hraesvelgr's jurisdiction.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
One person's family was
kidnapped to intimidate them,

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
but they weren't exactly
the kind of person

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
who would ever try and
leak intel to the outside.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
So this the part where you say,

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
"you've gotten careless,"
is that it?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
That's exactly what
part it is, old man!

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
It looks like I would've been

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
a lot better off if
I'd just left town.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
Ran!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR]
If I'd done that,

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have had to
kill my favorite student.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
You two have been feeling
me out from the start.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
Your whining was way too forced.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
It isn't really like you can
pull off the lovable brat act.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
What's more, you got careless.

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter
if you're a Scard.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Because even if
you're tough to hurt,

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
poison works on you
like anyone else.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
You put too much faith
in the tattoos.

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
How could you?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR] I was
Hraesvelgr of the Twin Wings.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
I don't hate the way
Artemis does things.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
Or how it manages the finances
here in Akatsuki ward.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
They spend it on the kids.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
Things were good
when I was young.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
I thought we were
doing what was right.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
I was always proud of my role

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.361 position:50% align:center
as one of the
Goddess' Twin Wings.

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
The last Artemis died
at such a young age.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
And there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
Hraesvelgr abandoned me, too.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
What did I have then?

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd feel proud to let
the two of you take our places

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
as the Twin Wings,
but the only thing I felt

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
was a growing sense
of regret and misery.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
[JIN] So you welcomed
Dusk in with open arms

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
and brokered this betrayal.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
I know Artemis like
the back of my hand,

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
and I still hold quite a bit of
sway within the organization.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
I told you before. I'm an old
hand at this kind of stuff.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
Was it for the money?

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR]
I don't know.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
Does it matter?

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
Don't do this!

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR]
A Scard who's unconscious

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
is just another ordinary human.

No, it's your turn.

00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
[PREVIOUS HRAESVELGR]
I see.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
So, it was Jin.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
One of Morrigan's illusions.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
I should've known better.

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
Old man, you really
have aged. Poorly.

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
Large and detailed ones
sure tire me out.

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
I usually hate making them,
but I had to go all out because

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
you're the one we're up against.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
[RAN] We figured you'd
pull something like this

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
if your back was
against the wall.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
Looks like you saw
through everything.

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
So, when did the illusion
actually begin?

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
We knew that we
couldn't challenge you

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
without having any evidence.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
We let our suspect go,
nabbed some Dusk,

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
and forced them to talk.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
We took our time.

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
Still, I wish we
hadn't been right.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center

said earlier honestly the truth?

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Fenrir supposedly died during
the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
If Helios isn't lying about
defeating him, that is.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
Now boys. What will
you do? Kill me?

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center

There's one thing that
we know for sure, Ma'am.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
Fenrir and Dusk are definitely

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center

Big enough to win
