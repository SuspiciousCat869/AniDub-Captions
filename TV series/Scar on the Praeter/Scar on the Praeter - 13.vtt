Everyone's got that.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Kazuma hasn't given in to it.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
And he hasn't
surrendered to you.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
More than anyone else I know,
he's trying to stay a hero.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
And that's not all. He's trying
to protect this town.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
That's what Kazuma's real
hopes and dreams are.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Kazuma?

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
Well, then I guess I'll
kill you here and now.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.877 position:50% align:center
Not one speck will be left
after I've obliterated you.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
By your death...
I'll prove I'm right.

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
Just you try it!

Where'd you get my
brother's tattoo? Talk!

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
Also, it doesn't taste great.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
The hell is wrong with you?

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
I'm asking you, too.
Please, guys!

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
What's done is done.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
I guess I should
at least thank you.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
Blast me to smithereens
for all I care.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Kazuma! I will
bring you back to us!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
You've tamed Cerberus.
Good work, fanboy.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA yells]

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Hang on, Kazuma!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Cerberus, let's take
this bastard down!

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] You're a stain.
Get out of my sight!

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Now I'll stop you!

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You're a real pain.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
It's time to die!

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
You read my move?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
So that's the best you could do?

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Kazuma's much stronger.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
The power he's built up
outshines yours.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
You're not the one I want
to fight right now, Fenrir.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Where's Kazuma?
I want him and Cat-sìth!

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
Shut the hell up!

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA screaming]

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] But you never wanted to
take me on before all of this.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.448 position:50% align:center
You've finally come
back to us, Kazuma.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
Looks like Cat-sìth is
keeping Fenrir under control.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
Even this defective
magic bullet should work.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
You were preparing for this

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
since you figured out what
Fenrir could really do, right?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] The magic bullet
I shot you with.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
I'm going to use it
on Kazuma now.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
But first, I have to ask
your forgiveness Eiji.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[EIJI exhales]

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
You're always saying stuff
like that, Kagami.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
But you having stuff like this
ready has been a life-saver.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Wha--?

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I think it's safe to say
you don't have enough

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
life force left to give
to this magic bullet.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA gasping]

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
Damn it all! I won't let you!

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
Eiji! Shoot me now!

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
All right. Time for you
to wake up, Kazuma!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA yelps]

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Kazuma?

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA gasping] Hey, what the
heck do you think you're doing?

Huh?

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
Here comes trouble. Ugh!

Eiji!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
You up for this?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
Who do you think
you're talking to?

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
Kazuma.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
I'm sitting this one out.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
--Right.
--Just leave this one to us.

Sharpen your fangs!

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center

[YAMATO, KAZUMA]
Bark... and bite!

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Look, I'm really sorry

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
but at this point,
it's just not feasible.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
What? Reinforcements you say?

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
They're not gonna be
ready before nightfall.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
And since we weren't
able to take Azusa Yuki

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
into custody,
that wouldn't be wise.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
We should give up.

Damn it Kouga!

reporting in after we lose?

angry over here.

No, no, just listen to me.

Make an announcement.
All you have to say

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.905 position:50% align:center
to the public is that we
put down the riots,

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center

tell you how to recover

way to cancel out

who shot you, Eiji.

bite it, just like you will.

on you to help me out.

They need to start learning
who's in charge.

educate them.

00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Hey there, Itsuki!

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if you
were gonna drop by.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Had a feeling that you might!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry at all?

00:19:55.403 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
I was actually just thinking
about having some lunch.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
That's it? Not a
very balanced meal!

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
There are no vitamins,

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
but you can make up with these.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
Thanks for bringing
all this, Itsuki.

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
Not a fan of coffee?

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
I'd like do something
in the field of law,

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
but in a job that
relates to the town.

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll become a police
officer. I'm mulling it over.

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
a good idea.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
But I guess you
and I are different.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
Is that your dream, then?

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
One of your hopes
for the future?

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
Yes! I want to help Yamato
and everyone else.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
I'd better get going.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
[MINATO]
Wait!

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
Is Yamato doing all right?

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
I'm glad. I have a request.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
If it's all right, can you tell
him that I'm doing okay, too?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
That's all you're asking?

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
I guess it wouldn't be a
leak of classified intel.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Itsuki!

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI exhales]

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back!

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Hey.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
Next time, don't keep
things from me.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it's better
if I take action.

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
You know this means
I can't trust you.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
Itsuki, you're an
excellent officer.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'll only keep

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
the secrets that I
have to, all right?

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
You're unbelievable.
Honestly, Kouga.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
I am your partner, after all.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
What? No witty comeback?

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Minato...

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Little bro, give me strength!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think?

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
Oh, gross! Why does it
taste like that?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
Did you follow my recipe?

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
I thought it turned out okay.

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what's with the commotion?
Hey, something smells good.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:06.201 position:50% align:center
Kazuma was checking my cooking.

00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
Pretty good!

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.582 position:50% align:center
--You think?
--You're insane!

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.417 position:50% align:center
Kagami, you try it!

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
I thought it came out
pretty good, too!

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
That's okay. I'm not hungry.

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:22.342 position:50% align:center
Hey, now we got two chefs!
Cafe Titan's in good hands.

00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.760 position:50% align:center
Quit joking around!

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.596 position:50% align:center
Jeez. Like I don't have
enough on my plate.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.014 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:30.016 position:50% align:center
I really do think I can do
better next time, though.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
Just don't go easy on me!

00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:35.188 position:50% align:center
Fine, but if you can't get
it right on your next try--

00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.359 position:50% align:center
Hi, welcome to...

00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:41.361 position:50% align:center
Looks like we've got trouble.

00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:42.779 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:50.412 position:50% align:center
You good, Kazuma?
And you, uh, fanboy.

00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:51.788 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:54.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We got this.
And it's about time

00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:58.253 position:50% align:center
you learned my name,
Eiji Arashiba.

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:01.131 position:50% align:center
You better not slow me
down this time, Yamato.

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:05.051 position:50% align:center
Right. I've got your back--
no matter what, Kazuma.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:11.224 position:50% align:center
It's on you, Kazuma... Yamato.
