I wanted to ask--what made you
decide to join the police?

Why are you asking me
that question?

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
Me and Yamato.
We used to live in B1,

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
also known as the
squatter's district.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center

the police doing
terrible things.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
But I get the impression
you're not like other cops.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
So it got me wondering, what's
the reason you become one?

You want my reasons?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center

was quite the fiasco.

And while they may still be

Looks like he was up here
last night, watching us.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
So then...

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Fenrir must've attacked Dusk's
Scard and subdued him.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing he was picked
up by the PSSS, right?

defend the town?

Is that why he was
fighting Dusk?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
Or maybe it was just random?

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he had cause?
Could it be Dusk and Fenrir

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
were collaborators, but had
a falling out? [gasps]

If I left you alone, you
would've completely overslept.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
I don't get how you
could take time off

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
when we're still in crisis mode.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
That's what people do when they
work straight through the night.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you try and get
a little recharge time?

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
Because you did, that's why!

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have taken
time off, anyway.

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
You're kind of a workaholic.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
So were those files I sent
over to you useful at all?

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
[RAN] Hm. Well they certainly
made the clean-up painless,

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
so I got the job
done real quick.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
The food's my thanks.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
Glad to hear it.

All right, guess
vacation's over.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
You look exhausted.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was on clean-up duty.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
I did manage to
clear out what Dusk

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
had left behind
during the conflict.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
Yup. All the loose ends have
been tied up and dealt with.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
Ran, you're way too
meticulous you know that, right?

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
It's okay to relax sometimes.
It wouldn't kill you.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Easy for you to say, slacker.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
[JIN] Thankfully, I was able
to catch up on everything

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
I recorded the past few days.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
[yawns] I hadn't been able
to watch anything

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center

so busy dealing with Dusk.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
You took the day off.
Why do you look so tired?

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
I didn't really sleep much.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
Why would you take time off if
you're not going to spend it

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
on your hobbies?

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
Think of how much of our
lives we waste sleeping!

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
Are we just supposed to
work until we're dead?

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
[RAN] What the hell
are you talking about?

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
That reminds me.
During my time off,

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
I rewatched this anime
they started streaming.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
You like real "feel-good"
stories, right?

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
It's called <i>A Dog</i> --

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
No anime recommendations.
I'm not interested.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
I even broke down and
ordered the box set.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
Since you're done
with Dusk cleanup,

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
wanna clock out early
and go watch it?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
Honestly. You can be
real pushy sometimes.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, Ms. Azusa
has been resting all day.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
She's doing better now
that it's night again.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Good to know.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
Guess we don't have much
time to slack off.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center

00:12:56.776 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center

What the hell?

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
What happened here?

Good.

Yes, sir!

Every member of Artemis is a
highly trained professional.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
So you're saying this must
be the work of a Scard.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
Whoever it was repulsed
our people's attacks.

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
And then wiped them out

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
not long after
we first got word.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center

There was a full

Even if she was drained, she...

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
How could this have happened?

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
I called for a doctor.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
Ms. Azusa is going
to be all right.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
It was Fenrir.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center

My job is to protect Ms. Azusa!

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
inherited this tattoo.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
I even smoked out that traitor!

But when she needed me
the most, I wasn't there.

one of the Twin Wings?

Would you mind looking

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
So, you guys want to
fight for real then?

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
I knew this would happen
once Dusk was gone!

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
We don't need a reason to hunt
you down. Right, Hraesvelgr?

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you doing?

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
I'm asking for a favor.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Our friend Kagami is dying.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
Please let one of us
take him to the hospital.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.021 position:50% align:center
Yamato.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.648 position:50% align:center
I'm going to stay
here with them.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, you gotta
take him, okay?

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
[JIN] And why should we go along
with any of that any of that?

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
You're in no position
to bargain here.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
We've got no guarantee
he'll return.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
He will.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center

I'm asking you, too.
Please, guys!

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
We don't have to
let you do anything.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
--Just go.
--Ran!

Yamato.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
Do you really trust Kazuma
to come back for you?

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
That's why I stayed behind.

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna wait long.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't come
back here quickly,

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
then it's your life to pay.

[KOUGA] Oh! That's an old
Chinese "divide and conquer"

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.662 position:50% align:center
strategy, or something
like that, right?

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center
[ITSUKI]
Yes.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.915 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] You're supposed
to say, "That's correct!"

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:38.418 position:50% align:center
