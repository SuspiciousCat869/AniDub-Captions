[YAMATO gasping]

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Why is your
tattoo on my hand?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
Why did you save
someone like me?

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
[EIJI]
If you really look up to me,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
you should use the tattoo.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
Protect Akatsuki Ward
in my place.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
Show me your fangs.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] You could've at
least remembered my name,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
you crazy bastard.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center

[KOUGA]
Oh! I'm so glad you're awake!

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
Itsuki kicked you because
you were giving him trouble.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
Kids these days, they can be

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
a little hot headed
sometimes, huh?

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
And you are?

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Oh, where are my manners?

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
Pardon for not saying sooner.
This is who I am.

[YAMATO grunting]

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Now, now,
there's no need to worry.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
Yammy-boy. You're under
our protection now.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
Ever since that little skirmish.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Of course, you know
what I'm talking about.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
That bloody battle
that just happened

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
between Helios and Dusk.
You know, Helios,

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.299 position:50% align:center
the vigilante team led by
everyone's favorite hero,

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba--
maybe you've heard of them?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
Then there's Dusk, those
troublesome outsiders.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.475 position:50% align:center
Well, to the police,
they're practically the same,

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
all a bunch of delinquents.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, sorry.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba was kinda
your idol, wasn't he?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
What happened to Eiji?

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
He's dead.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
But you knew that, didn't you?

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I gotta say,
I'm a little tired.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
Let me get some rest.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO growls]

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
Jeez, that didn't come
out the right way.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard,
you'd think that there was

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
absolutely no way he
could've died, right?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
Fact is, those guys
with the magic tattoos?

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
"The Scard,"
I think they're called?

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
They've got these strange
powers that make them

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
able to withstand gunfire.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
More often than not,
they don't die

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
when they're caught in
situations like before.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
On top of that, this is the Hero
of Akatsuki we're talking about.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
We picked up this little guy
at the scene of the crime.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
They call it a "deicide bullet,"
a magic bullet

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
that can kill divine beings.
Pretty crazy, right?

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
They say one of these can punch

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
right through a
tattoo's defenses

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
and completely neutralize
the tattoo itself.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
It sounds kinda
suspicious, doesn't it?

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
Can't say I know too
much about it myself.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
Anyway. Eiji Arashiba was
hit with this magic bullet,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
lost his invincible
tattoo powers,

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
and became a regular guy
who could be shot and killed.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
Though it's strange he'd
take on all those goons

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
from Dusk with no
protection, isn't it?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
At any rate,
Eiji Arashiba's dead,

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
and that Cerberus tattoo
of his died along with him.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
At least, that's
what you'd expect.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
So tell me, why do you have
Arashiba's Cerberus tattoo?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
Yammy-boy, did you
know about this?

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
Now from what I've heard,
these deicide bullets

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
are unbelievably troublesome
for such delicate things.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
For instance, one
could be stained with

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
someone else's blood
before reaching its target.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
If that indeed were
the case here,

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
the decide bullet would
lose its magic properties

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
and flat-out fail
to kill the tattoo.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar
at all to you?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
The thing is, given
the power of the tattoos

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
we can't just ignore them.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
The state can't just
gloss things over.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Are you a Scard?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA] Oh, sorry. I still
haven't told you who I am.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
I'm with the Metropolitan Police
Public Security Bureau,

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
the Anti-Scard Special Service.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
Also known as the PSSS.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
My name's Kouga Tatsuma.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
And this here is Fafnir,
my tattoo.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet ya, Yammy-boy.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] This is it.
This is where they took Eiji.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
I had a really hard time

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
getting those Dusk goons
to spill their guts.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
You were very persuasive.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
We were barely able to avoid
the police ourselves though.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
I got it out of them, didn't I?

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI sighs]
I'll distract them.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
Use that opportunity
to sneak in.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
Although, if the PSSS
decides to show up,

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
we'll have to withdraw.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
What, you don't think
I can take those guys on?

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
The PSSS are
anti-Scard specialists.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
I'll remind you,

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
even Eiji deliberately tried
to stay clear of them.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it'd be
a pain to fight them.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's go.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
Wait, look over there--
it's Dusk.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
So, not all of those
bozos ran, huh?

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
Now, now, don't get
all worked up.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
We just want to welcome you
into the fold, Yammy-boy.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
That's all we're
talking about here.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] So, you're telling me
to join your PSSS?

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
Right on the money!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
It's a hell of a lot better
than being kept under

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
constant guard in one of our
facilities, don't you think?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
So you're saying I should
become a guard, huh?

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
I'd never--

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
You've got it all wrong!

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
You squatters are
just clay in our hands.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center
You're ours to mold, got it?

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
So, just shut up!
And do as you're told!

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
That's all I'm saying.
You understand now, don't you?

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
Itsuki, let him in.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
Hey there, bro.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
Minato.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
We're keeping him
under our protection.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous out there in B1.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Now, now, no thanks needed.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
It's all in a day's work
at the PSSS.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:00.165 position:50% align:center
Brothers, unrelated
by blood, who both lost

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
their families in
the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
While squatting in B1,
the two of you

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
have supported each other
all this time to survive.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
I don't think it would be right
for those two brothers

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
to be unhappy now, do you?

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
Let me share some wisdom.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
"Justice without
force is powerless.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Force without justice
is tyranny." Make sense?

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
All right, we'll give you
two some time alone.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
You talk things over now, okay?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
[KOUGA]
The hero is dead. And you?

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
You definitely aren't
the hero type. Right?

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
[MINATO grunts]

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO grunts]

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
Is it all right to leave them?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
Though he's basically a newborn,
he's Scard nonetheless.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
You're right. But it'll be fine.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
Being the "good big bro"
is his MO.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
Oh, also. I told
his younger brother

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
where B1 squatters like
them stand in all of this.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that the two of them
will know what choice to make.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad you're
all right. What a relief.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
That detective just filled me in

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
on what happened
to you yesterday.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
Eiji. He's dead 'cause of me.
The Hero of Akatsuki Ward.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
The one person
who brought us hope.

the Akatsuki Conflict.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.516 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] The ward was designated
a special economic zone.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
To encourage growth,
the private sector

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
was put in charge and
granted special rights.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
Taxes were low, and
people made more money

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
here than anywhere else.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Akatsuki Ward quickly
became a dream town.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
But then that dream ended.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
A lot of the businesses
with a stake here

00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
conspired to control the
rights to the special ward.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
The escalating conflict
soon turned violent,

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
and riots broke out.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
That ended up attracting
criminals here.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
Law and order in the
ward quickly fell apart.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
Beyond the help of the state
and the private sector,

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
the town quickly succumbed
to lawlessness.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
Countless children became
orphans in the ward,

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
after losing their
parents in the riots...

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid! Just hold on,
I've got you!

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
...that's how Minato and I met.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Then on that fateful
day, the Hero of Akatsuki...

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
He saved us.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] Eiji's group Helios.
And Artemis, too.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
They risked their lives
fighting all the thugs

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
that came in from the outside.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
It took a year to drive
them all out and put

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
the special ward back into
the hands of the people.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
The Akatsuki Conflict
finally ended.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Yeah. B1 really changed, too.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO] We thought that we
were too powerless

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
to do anything,
but then we saw Eiji

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
and the other Scard fighting.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
Seeing their courage in the face

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
of such overwhelming
odds encouraged me,

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
all of us, to fight
and take back

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
our home from the outsiders.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
The Hero of Akatsuki gave us
the strength to keep going.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
And it's all my damn fault.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who killed Eiji.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.716 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Akatsuki's hero is dead.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
Eiji Arashiba's dead
because of me.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
So then. What is it
you want to do?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
[YAMATO]
Huh?!

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
If you really look up to me,
you should use the tattoo.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
Protect Akatsuki
ward in my place.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
Live the life that you want.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
And make sure you
stick to your choices.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
That's all I ever
hoped you'd do.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
Minato.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
from the skirmish
being treated here.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
And those guys...
They've come here to get them.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
Go, Yamato.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
You gotta be true
to yourself, okay.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
You're way too nice of a
person to just stand by

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:28.558 position:50% align:center
and do nothing.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
We both know it's
not who you are.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center

to give me a little push

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Right! I won't, thank you!

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
I think Eiji's been dead
for about a week now.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
If I had known he was
about to kick the bucket,

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:28.228 position:50% align:center
I would've put him in the
ground myself years ago.

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
Looks like Helios
is finally done for, too.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
It's out of the way but should
we go break the bad news?

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
I'll pass on that, thanks.
Just sounds like a hassle.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't even go
if it was work.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
Wait hold on. What are you
watching right now?

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
We're working here!

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
What else? It's Tanucal.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
It's relaxing. Animated
animals are so darn great.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
[TANUCAL coos]

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
[RAN grunts]

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Masterpieces really
do transcend time.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
Wanna watch with me?

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.184 position:50% align:center
I'm recommending
something you'd like!

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
I gave it a lot of
thought, you know.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
It's up your alley, right?

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
I know you like moving
shows and animals.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
So, are you a fan of dogs?
Or do you prefer cats?

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
There's a saying in the west,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
"Don't count your chickens
before they hatch."

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
You know it?

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
Promise nothing before
you can actually deliver.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
The Japanese version is:

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
"Don't sell the fur before
you catch the tanuki."

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
Now why did you bring that up?
Those poor adorable tanuki.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
[RAN] That's the right answer.
Now let's switch gears.

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.258 position:50% align:center
We've got a job to do.

00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
[JIN]
I'm definitely not working late.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
There's some anime you just
have to watch when it airs.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
[RAN sighs]

00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:27.449 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Hey, do you know what
the Moon card means in Tarot?

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Of course you're
into that kinda stuff.

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:32.537 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Night?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI] Hmm, that's
not the right answer.

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:38.043 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Like I really
give a crap, Kagami.

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
Next episode:
"The Twin Wings of Artemis"

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.590 position:50% align:center
[KAGAMI]
Now, that's the right answer!
