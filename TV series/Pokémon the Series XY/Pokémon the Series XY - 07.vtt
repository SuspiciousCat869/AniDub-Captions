the Santalune
City Gym Leader

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.946
and earned his first badge
in the Kalos region!

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:17.985
So, Serena,
where are you headed from here?

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.720
Uh, me?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.889
Well, I, uh, I‐‐

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.991
Why don't you just
come along with us?

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.325
[EXCITED]

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.195
Yeah, that'd be fun!

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.330
Come with us.
We'll have a great time!

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.133
Yeah. Sounds
like an excellent idea to me.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.036
Thanks to you, I came up
with my Santalune Gym strategy.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.671
And if you could help me
from here on out

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.740
uh, it would be great.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.507
Hm.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.712
Sure. How could I say no
to all that?

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.347
‐ Alright!
‐ Yeah, that's the spirit!

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.315
[chuckles]

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.454
Come on!

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.790
Ash, you're planning to travel
to the Cyllage Gym next.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.559
‐ Aren't you?
‐ Yeah.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.227
Well, I can show you
how to get there.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.596
'Ta‐da!'

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:06.433
Here's where we are now.
Santalune City. But look here.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.803
Lumiose City
is between us and Cyllage City

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.072
so we have to travel back
through Lumiose City

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.509
‐ before we get there.
‐ I guess you're right.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.244
[chuckles]
Great!

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.479
There's a boutique
in Lumiose City

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.982
with the cutest clothes,
and there's an awesome bakery

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.417
that has the best pastries
you've ever tasted!

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.586
[chuckles]

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.988
What are we waiting for?
Let's hurry up!

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.756
‐ Yippee!
‐ Clemont, step on it!

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.660

Long as we're going
to Lumiose City

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:43.971
I'd really like to take a shot

[EAGER]

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.342
Well, it's probably a good idea
to keep in mind

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.043
that you haven't been
in the Kalos region long.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.212
I've got an idea.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.215
Why don't you utilize this time
to catch another Kalos Pokémon?

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.184
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:01:57.184 --> 00:02:00.253
Now, where is my next Pokémon
hanging out?

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.456
‐ Huh?
‐ Hey, Ash?

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:03.757
If you catch
a really cute Pokémon

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.459
will you let me take care of it?

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.595
‐ Sure, of course.
‐ Yippee! Yay!

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.931
So why did you decide
to go on a journey, Serena?

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.265

Sounds good. Then I choose you.
Nice to meet you, Rhyhorn.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.113
[FRIENDLY]

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:02.082
Wow, I'm impressed!

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.050
Serena, you're so good
at handling Rhyhorn.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.086
Thank you.

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:08.655
See, the truth is
my mother was a Rhyhorn racer

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.890
and so she made sure
I knew how to handle them

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.659
from the time
I was a little girl.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.994
Whoa, does that mean
you want to be

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:15.729
a Rhyhorn racer too, Serena?

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:17.964
Whoa‐ho.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:21.634
Rhyhorn racing is fine,
but I wonder.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:24.704
There may be something
I might like to do even more

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:27.574
so I haven't made any decision
just yet.

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.275
If you ask me,
I'd say it sounds like

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:31.711
you want to find your own path.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:35.015
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Hey, Serena.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.650
Since you know so much
about Rhyhorn racing

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.052
do you think you could teach me
some of the basics

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.854
like the rules and how to ride?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.390
‐ You mean, me?
‐ Yeah. Please?

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.159
‐ Uh..
‐ You have so much experience.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.061
It would really be a big help.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.030
We don't really know
anything at all.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.898
Please, Serena?
You're the expert.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.401
‐ Well, I guess so.
‐ Alright!

The Twerp and the Pikachu.

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.607
We've been looking

And they've got Rhyhorn racing
on the brain.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.512

Of course. You need to practice.

All aboard the Rhyhorn express!
Do we have Rhyhorn? Yes!

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.984
And just what do you think
you're gonna do with them?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.320
It's such a bore
if you have to ask.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.623
They'll help us
conquer the world, silly.

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:33.359
And don't forget Pikachu.
That will help, too.

Wow! Am I glad to see you.

I had a feeling
something bad was happening

it would be like this.

Bad is right! It's Team Rocket!

Huh? Oh. Right!

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.616
Pikachu and the others
are in trouble

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.485

All of a sudden
I don't feel so good.

It feels kind of drafty
out here.

the winds of wipe out.

I hope you'll take good care
of my daughter.

You know what Serena did?

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.922
She taught me
how to ride a Rhyhorn!

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.759
Ash, you didn't have
to tell her that, did you?

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.061
Hey, it's the truth.
And there's more!

00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:23.729
She told me to be one
with Rhyhorn

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.364
and that helped the most! Ugh!

It will be a wonderful

‐ Here, for you.
‐ Huh?

Don't worry.
