Wow! Are you gonna groom
your Furfrou?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.902
I really want to,
but every time I try to do

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.571
anything with its fur,
it runs off.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.206
I only tried to brush it
a bit earlier

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.741
and that's when it ran away.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.277
I get it now.

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:33.013
Furfrou are very intelligent
and know exactly what they want.

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.748
'They won't listen to a Trainer'

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.750

as their partner.'

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.919
So, does that mean
Furfrou doesn't see you

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.320
as its real Trainer yet?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.355
Hey, Bonnie!

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.057

It's okay, Bonnie.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.228
You've got it exactly right.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.697
Now, I wanna see
how Pokémon groomers

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:54.000
‐ style Furfrou even more.
‐ I do too! I do too!

unbelievable coincidence.

your Furfrou a walk?

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.903

you to Clemont and Ash.

'And Bonnie and Serena.'

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.007

in the guidebook!

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.176
You're a grooming superstar!

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.879
It's such an honor to meet you!

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.782
I do think "Superstar"
is a bit of an exaggeration.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.919
Huh?
Look at all those scissors!

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.789

learning about Pokémon groomers.

Look at all the berries.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.303
You noticed,
well, Bonnie, there's a lot more

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.106
to grooming Pokémon,
than simply grooming their fur.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:08.975
We give each Pokémon
a thorough health exam.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.011
You can tell if a Pokémon
is eating well

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.013
simply by feeling its fur.

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:14.748
So the amount of fur
that gets cut

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.449
depends on how healthy it is.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.085
SERENA You have to know
all about that too?

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.454
Learning about nutrition
is a must!

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.157
For example, we recommend
a Rawst or a Lumberry

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.560
for when a Pokémon 's
not feeling well.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.296
And see? A Tomatoberry can help
stimulate their appetite.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.598
‐ Aah..
‐ Wow!

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.600

as well?

They don't look like the same
kind of Pokémon at all.

You can say that again.

00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:31.992
They're both just so elegant!

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.694
I wanna style my Furfrou
like that.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.897
I just hope
it'll let me someday.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.666
Of course, you'll be
able to style Furfrou!

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.435
Oh, this is all so dreamy.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:45.472
She's right, Jessica.
It's important to be confident!

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:48.208
It is true her Furfrou
is quite stubborn, though.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.043
It won't let her
groom it at all.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:52.112
Yeah, that's what she told us.

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:54.281
It is my wish that
Jessica's and Furfrou's hearts

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.516
will become one someday.

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.451
But still,
there's no need to rush things.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.087

'Jessally has now become
a Pokémon groomer!'

That's right. Why not take
a look at my creations?

[SURPRISED]

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.660
Watch Jessally transform
the most unsightly Pokémon

[DEMURE]

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:46.726
‐ They're all kind of boring.
‐ The Curly Top was cute!

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:49.329
And that's only the tip
of the styling iceberg.

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.831

We are the last word in styling!

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.817
[chuckles]
That wasn't so bad.

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.986
When it comes to styling sass,
I'm the top of the class!

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.255
You there, Pikachu.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.323

[SURPRISED]/[SHEEPISH]

‐ Aw.
‐ Ha‐ha.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:29.035
Serena, how about Fennekin?
I know it's already a cutie pie

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:32.372
but maybe some styling
will make it an even cutier pie!

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:35.108
That sounds like a good idea!
Come out, Fennekin.

[EXCITED]/[EXERTION]

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.046
How would you like to do some
styling on my Fennekin?

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:42.715
Uh, we want Pikachu.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.452
This is the chance to catch
a Kalos region Pokémon!

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:47.487
‐ Ah!
‐ I accept.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.222
My grooming skills
are second to none!

I'll happily style
your Fennekin!

Jessally performs
her magic in private

so please come back in an hour.

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.101
But I wanted to watch her
perform her magic!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.136
Um‐um‐um!

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:05.305
Jessally's grooming magic
is an industry secret

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.307
so it stays hush‐hush!

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.442
But it will only take an hour

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.377
'well worth the time
to create Fennekin fashion!'

[giggles]

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.928
I really wanted to watch
how Jessally styles Fennekin.

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.531
‐ I'm sure you did.
‐ Huh!

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.100
‐ It's Officer Jenny!
‐ Huh?

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.903
Thank you for all your help
during the Rhyhorn race!

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:39.739
You must be talking about
my second cousin.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:42.175
Here's a picture of me,
when I was a cadet

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.545
attending the Officer Jenny

Wow. There certainly
are a lot of you.

‐ Now, if you don't mind

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.218
there's something
I'd like to ask you.

‐ What's that?
‐ Have you seen any con artists?

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.990
‐ Con artists?
‐ That's right!

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.926
There's a woman who claims
to be a famous Pokémon groomer

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.295
but once she gets a Pokémon,
she and her gang vanish!

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.931
‐ Ah!
‐ Tell us more!

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:07.233

Of course, by that
you mean catch Pikachu!

‐ No prob!
‐ Hey, Clemont?

Didn't we just see Furfrou
listen to Jessica?

Yeah, you're right!
[EXCITED]

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.249
Maybe that means
Furfrou's starting

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:41.220
'to see you as its partner now!'

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.223

Mm‐mm, it's because you
connected with Furfrou's heart!

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.573
I'm going to make the bond
