A long journey

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.561
and lots of training

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.663

and the rest of our Heroes

to his second Gym badge

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.335

Ah. It looks like it's
way up there on that mountain.

Grant, it's Ash.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.822
I'm here to challenge you
to a Gym battle.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.491
‐ 'Are you ready?'
‐ Sure. No problem.

‐ 'No way!'
‐ 'Yes way.'

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.807
You see, my Cyllage Gym

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.743
specializes
in Rock‐type Pokémon.

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.277
I feel all challengers should

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.446
experience
my great love of rocks.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.515
'So I designed the Gym
to accomplish that'

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.184
'by allowing you to
climb up on your own power.'

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.686
You don't mean all of us,
do you?

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.855
No. Not to worry.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.057
We've got an elevator
over there as well.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:39.226
'The choice is yours.'

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:41.628
Now, just because
you don't scale the wall

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.697
doesn't mean
I won't accept your challenge.

Hey there, Grant. I made it.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.771
Well done, Ash.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.712
So, what were you thinking about
when you were climbing?

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:10.050
Huh? Uh, well, I wasn't
thinking about anything.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.219
That's perfect.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.187
‐ So, what were you looking at?
‐ Huh!

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.458
Hmm.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.060
Straight up,
where I was going.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.162
Excellent.

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:24.564
That means you achieved
a state of enlightenment.

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:28.468
Your mind was crystal clear.
Unclouded.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.104
Now that you've
successfully conquered the wall

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.707
the next wall
you will need to conquer is me.

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.876
And that's what
you came here for, challenger.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.879
Right.
[DETERMINED]

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.781
A question.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.216
Why do you have challengers
climb the wall?

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.852
So that inner peace
can be achieved.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.855
‐ Inner peace?
‐ What's that mean?

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.758
Scaling the wall.
It's the best way I know

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.227
to achieve a state
of enlightenment.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.063
When I do that, I forget
about everything else

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.532
and the only thing
I concentrate on is

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:00.300
reaching the top.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.869
That is my one
and only goal.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.039
The only thing I want is to
arrive at my destination.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.941
As long as there
is a wall for me to climb

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.677
I will rise to the challenge.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.280
I want challengers to achieve
the same state of enlightenment

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.848
when they climb up here to me.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:17.951

‐ and their Pokémon can do.
‐ Oh. Got it.

I'll win that Gym badge.

will be allowed to substitute

bring out your Pokémon.

since I first saw you battle
back at the Battle Chateau.

Now let's see which Pokémon
you plan to use

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:14.241

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:38.731
you can never count
Ash and Pikachu out.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.267
Look at that!
Tyrunt, Dragon Tail!

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:42.735
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

‐ Hmm.
‐ Hmm.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:00.086
Excellent. Quite well‐executed.

00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:02.622
We keep on getting stronger
even while we're battling.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:05.424
And an exciting battle it is.

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:07.727
To show my respect
for your passion

00:17:07.727 --> 00:17:10.496
I'm going to wrap this up
with my favorite move.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.632
‐ Time for Rock Tomb!
‐ Well, I'm ready for it.

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:16.068
[ROCK TOMB MOVE]

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:17.670

‐ Tyrunt!
‐ What a mouthful.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.453
Now Tyrunt can't use Crunch.

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.489
Pikachu can get in close.

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:38.691
Now, I'll wrap this up
with my favorite move.

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:40.059
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

'Which means the match goes
to the challenger, Ash.'

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.276
You were so awesome!

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.478
Pikachu, we won!

ceases to amaze me.

[EXERTION]

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.562
That certainly
turned into a heated

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.397
and fearsome battle, didn't it?

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.665
Thank you so very much.

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:20.600
[GRATEFUL]

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:25.771
Your Rock Tomb Climb
really surprised me.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.840
But the biggest surprise
of all was having

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.142
Pikachu use Thunderbolt,
which shouldn't have been

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.979
'that effective on Tyrunt,
a Rock and Dragon‐type.'

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:34.380
Everyone was awesome.

Fletchling and Pikachu.'

This's a victory
for all three of you.

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.525
Wonderful!
By working together

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.427
you all managed to scale
the wall that is known as

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.729
the Cyllage City Gym battle.

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:55.501
As a symbol of that, I present
you with the Cliff Badge.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.236
[EXCITED]

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.005
Thank you so much, Grant.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:01.273
We did it, Pikachu.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:03.009
All that hard work paid off.

‐ Congratulations, Ash.
‐ That battle was so cool.

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:22.928
I've never seen
a battle of yours

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.231
when I wasn't completely
amazed and impressed by you.

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:26.365
Thanks a lot, you guys.

'Tell me, Ash,

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.039
have you already decided'

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.242
which Gym you'll challenge
for your third Kalos Gym badge?

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:38.010
Nope. Guess I'd better
start thinking about that.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.279
I've got an idea.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.214
I know the perfect place
we should go to next.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.350
'The Shalour City Gym.'

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.419
'There's the Tower
of Mastery nearby'

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.154
'and I've always wanted
to go see it.'

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:49.889
Yes, Shalour City.

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:51.891
Good choice.
It's quite nice.

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:54.694
Shalour City, sounds good to me.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.962
I think you'll have
quite a different battle

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:00.199
experience at the Shalour Gym
than your typical battle.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.102
What kind of different
experience is that?

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:04.770
You'll find out
when you get there.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.972
But I can guarantee you
another challenging

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.507
and fierce wall
for you to climb.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.642
Hah!

00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:11.877
[EXCITED]

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.680
Great. Then I'm going to Shalour
City for my next Gym badge.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.116
And that's that.
More adventures.

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:18.918
This should be fun.

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:20.686
I'm just wondering
what kind of Gym it is.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.455
One more thing.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:23.756
Let's have a rematch
at the Battle Chateau.

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.758
You bet.

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:27.960
Ash, if you want to have
a battle with Grant

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.729
at the Battle Chateau,
don't you need to

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.430
have the noble title
of Grand Duke?

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.965
Yeah. You're right.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.468
I can do that.

00:20:35.468 --> 00:20:37.303
It's all part of becoming
a Pokémon Master.

with Grant
at the Cyllage City Gym

Ash has earned his second
Kalos Gym badge, t he Cliff
Badge.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.648

their sights on Shalour City
