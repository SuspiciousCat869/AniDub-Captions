Bonnie, Clemont has told me

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.324
how cute and sweet you are.

It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.429
And Clemont's told me
a lot about you.

nice Professor Eclairisse is.

‐ I'm a keeper?
‐ Right.

You'd be perfect for him,

‐ Ah! Uh, what?
‐ Oh.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.147
I told you to stop this
a million times.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.317
Aah! I was just
trying to help you. Come on.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.486

my father who told me

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.880
I needed to go to this school.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.783
"Meet lots of Pokémon Trainers
and make lots of friends.

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:11.852

your horizons."

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:14.755
He told me to do that
and off I went.

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.857
So, how did it work out?
Did you make lots of friends?

and Pokémon too.

But all that studying
and research

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.666
was tough, to say the least.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.535
The curriculum here
is quite rigorous.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.103
It's a challenge to do the work

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.305
and make it all the way
to graduation.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.008
Yes, and my graduation research
was particularly tough.

Graduation research?

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.380
I studied the power
of Electric‐type Pokémon

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.716
and how the power of science
can build the future.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.951
That was my major focus.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.554
I recall you did struggle
with that.

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:50.123
You said you couldn't come up
with any good topics.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.859
Right, so I used to go for walks
and try to clear my mind.

This Shinx

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.419
so it took an exceptional
amount of time to recover.

It appears to have something to
do with the local environment.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.065
If only there were a place
where these Pokémon could easily

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.334
absorb electrical energy..

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.205
A place where they could easily
absorb electrical energy..

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:41.374
That's it. I've come up
with a great idea, Shinx.

store it in a battery

send it by cables
throughout the town

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.054
and make an electricity shower
for Electric types.

I'll call it
the Clemontic Shower.

With my new system,
you'll be able to absorb

all that electricity

No, a world where
all Pokémon can live happily.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.519
That would be
my dream come true.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.422
Shinx, you'd live there,
now, wouldn't you?

That's how I completed my
graduate research project.

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.867
The electrical transmission
system that Clemont invented

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:43.536
was well received
not only by the school

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.305
but by the entire town's
population as well.

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:49.809
What a great story.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.478
That's the very first time

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.512

So, this town has an ample
supply of electrical energy.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.623
In that case, let's steal

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.192
every last bit of that energy
for ourselves.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:09.296
Since electricity isn't cheap,
we could make a fortune

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:11.564
selling it to chumps
or if we gave it to the Boss.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.600
He'd be shocked but happy.

Not sure

you control the world.

Our ticket
to a high‐voltage future.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.940
Right, we can lure Pikachu in

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.142

and then we'll catch it.

Don't worry, Luxio.

Just stay down
and we'll take care of this.

Why do you insist on

where all Pokémon
can live happily.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.706
It's protecting the place the
science Twerp helped change.

Where all Pokémon
can live happily? Huh?

I wanna make a town where
Electric‐types can live happily.

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:55.748
No, a world where all Pokémon
can live happily.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.650
That would be my dream
come true.
