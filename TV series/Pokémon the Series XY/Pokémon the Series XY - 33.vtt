all those flower arrangements

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.898

Save the mushy stuff for later!
Pumpkaboo, use Dark Pulse!

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.677
[DARK PULSE MOVE]

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:27.380
[EXERTION]

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.551
Lucario.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.252
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:35.154
Haha. Korrina's voice
got through!

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.923
[chuckles]

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:38.558
Alright, ready?

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.160
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.063
Now, Inkay,
the third Psybeam's the charm!

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.631
Okay, counter it!

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.934
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:50.369
Shadow Ball again!
[SHADOW BALL MOVE]

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.672
It's attacking from the left!

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:54.540
Dodge upward
and hit the Shadow Ball!

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.908
[EXERTION]

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.677
[PAINED]

00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.412
Now, Bone Rush!

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.582
[BONE RUSH MOVE]

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.051
INKAY
[PAINED]

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:11.591
[screaming]

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.392
[FEARFUL]

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.561
‐ Pikachu!
‐ Mawile!

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.064
[AFFIRMATIVE]
[chuckling]

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:20.132
We're not gonna
take that lying down.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.801
[AGREEMENT]

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.736
MABEL
Now isn't that a coincidence.

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.872
Neither are we.
Mawile, Mega Evolve.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.841
[EVOLVING]

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.510
[EXERTION]

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:36.649
Wrap it up with Dark Pulse!

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:38.684
[DARK PULSE MOVE]
Now use Fairy Wind!

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:41.220
[FAIRY WIND MOVE]

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:45.791
Inkay, use Psybeam!

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.660
Pikachu, Thunderbolt. Go!

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.196
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:53.566
[STUNNED]

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:57.803
Lucario.. That's it.
You learned a new move!

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.172
Then, let's let them have it.
Aura Sphere!

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.041
[AURA SPHERE MOVE]

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.277
[screaming]

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:08.481
[yelling]

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.082
We're blasting off..

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:13.586
[AGREEMENT]
Again!

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.588
‐ Yay!
‐ Wow.

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:17.523
That Aura Sphere happened
because their hearts became one.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.458
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.893
[chuckling]

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.498
Lucario, we did it!

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.599
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:34.807
KORRINA
'Thank you for everything.'

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:37.343
We're really glad
we came here to see you.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.811
You're most welcome.

00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:40.479
Remember, although
you're now able

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.782
to control Lucario's aura

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:44.750
you must continue
to work hard and improve.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.119
Right! We sure will.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.455
Hmm.

00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:52.291
Korrina, guess this is goodbye.

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.760
‐ Huh?
‐ Why?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.562
Aren't we all going
to the same place?

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:58.397
Yeah, we're all going
to the Shalour Gym together

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.532
so you can challenge Korrina.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.333
Serena's right.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.935
Korrina and Lucario
can control its aura.

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.037
So we need to train even harder!

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.239
We'll get stronger and stronger

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.175
then we can challenge her
and win that badge!

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:10.843
We'll do our very best to win.

00:20:10.843 --> 00:20:12.845
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.814
I understand.
Then we'll see you there.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:15.981
LUCARIO
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:17.516
KORRINA
Come on, Lucario!

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.720
See you later!

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.122
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:26.292
Bye, Korrina.
Bye, Lucario. See you soon.

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.294
Take care of yourselves!

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:31.030
Don't forget to say hi
to your grandfather for us!

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.131
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:36.802
Let's move it!

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:37.837
NARRATOR
Thanks to Mabel's guidance,

00:20:37.837 --> 00:20:39.872
Korrina and Lucario

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.374
have learned how to control
the power of Lucario's aura

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:44.877
during Mega Evolution.

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:47.847
Now, with Ash's Shalour Gym
battle on their minds

00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:49.648
our heroes' journey
continues.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:57.056
