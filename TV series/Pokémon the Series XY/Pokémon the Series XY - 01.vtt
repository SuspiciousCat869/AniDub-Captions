WEBVTT

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.471
Fletchling.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.839
[humming]

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.510
Fletchling! Wake up Serena
for me, won't you?

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.912
Of course I already tried once

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.848
but, as usual,
once is never enough!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.817
[chirping]

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.798
[bell ringing]

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.302
[screaming]

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.008
Good! Looks like
we're all ready!

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.809
[chirping]

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.278
[grunting]

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.581
I've told you a million times
not to wake me up like that!

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.550
[chirping]

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.885
[grunting]

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.355
(Grace)
'Serena!
Time for morning training!'

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.723
Right.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.493
[sighs]
Not again!

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.332
Morning, Rhyhorn!

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.967
[growling]

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.871
Um. Ah.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:11.905
[chirping]

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.740
Hope today's interesting.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.309
[chuckling]

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.880
(narrator)
The Kalos region!

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.449
Like the other regions,
a beautiful place

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.319
where people
and Pokemon live in harmony

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.387
reflecting each other's
thoughts and feelings.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:30.090
When people smile,
Pokemon smile

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.494
and when Pokemon cry, you'll
find that people cry as well.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:38.498
And here, a certain
young man is about to arrive

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.736
a young man seeking
new dreams and new adventures.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.172
Yeah, we'll be
on the ground soon.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.041
Ash, you and Pikachu
must be really excited.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.577
We're starting
a brand new adventure.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.714
There's nothing more exciting
to a Pokemon Trainer.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.282
Pikachu.

(narrator)
Kalos, where dreams
and adventures begin!

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:36.323
[tire screeching]

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.967
Pikachu! Pika!

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.804
Hey Kalos region!

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.940
Ash from Pallet Town
is finally here.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.009
[Pikachu screaming]

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.577
What's with all the yelling?

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.813
Just saying hiya
to the Kalos region.

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:03.083
And as soon as I walk down these
steps, we'll finally be here.

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.217
Pikachu.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.454
[chirping]

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.289
Never seen those Pokemon before.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.324
[grunting]

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.795
[crashing]

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.231
‐ Pikachu.
‐ Are you alright?

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.700
Pika, pi..

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.568
[grunting]

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.703
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.771
Alexa, who are those Pokemon?

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.574
(Alexa)
'Oh, those are Spritzee.'

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.710
(Ash)
'Spritzee. Awesome.'

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.284
[chuckling]
A typical Twerp entrance.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.352
And with Pikachu, too.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:41.855
Then it's all in place.
Let's get to work.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.523
[wailing]

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.493
(Ash)
'First thing I want to do
is have a gym battle.'

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:49.262
‐ 'Just a minute!'
‐ Huh?

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.132
So where do you plan
to go for a Gym battle?

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.834
Oh, that's an easy one.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.336
Your younger sister's
a gym leader, right?

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.204
At her Gym.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:04:00.107
Wait. I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:02.776
but, her Gym
isn't here in Lumiose City.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.779
I'm afraid it's located in
Santalune City.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.882
What? What do I do now?

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.618
Hold on. I'll go and give her
a call right away.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.520
I'll see you in the lobby.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.955
Thanks.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.429
Pikawee.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.832
I wanna see if there
are any other Pokemon around.

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:29.903
Huh?

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.450
Oh.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.753
‐ Hey, Pikachu. See that?
‐ Piku.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.255
Oh yeah!

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.192
[yawning]

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.296
Helioptile, we just saw
the coolest thing.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.397
Where did Alexa go?

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.232
[purring]

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.504
(Ash)
'Alexa.'

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.807
What's with
all the excitement?

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.342
We just got a look
at another new Pokemon.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.877
It was so amazing.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:13.747
It made this jump
and flew right over our heads.

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:16.383
I see, I guarantee
you're going to meet

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.251
lots and lots
of new Pokemon.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.588
So cool! I'm glad we're finally
in the Kalos region!

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.424
I can't wait to win
that Gym battle, too.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.327
Uh, you see,
I managed to get through

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.262
to that sister of mine

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.932
and she let me know she's away
from her Gym right now.

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.366
She's away?

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.702
So when is she
gonna be back?

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.337
Once my sister
goes on a trip

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.806
she's usually away
for quite awhile.

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:40.907
Oh man.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:43.376
‐ Pika.
‐ Huh.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.812
Sorry Ash, I know
you must be disappointed

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.614
after coming all this way.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:51.418
Aw, no way!
This is bad!

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.519
I want to win
the league this time

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.755
and I wanna become
a Pokemon Master!

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:00.760
I know, why don't you channel
that energy into challenging

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.863
the Gym here in Lumiose City?

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.632
So there's a Gym
in this city, too?

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.401
(Alexa)
'See? It's right there.'

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.805
The Lumiose Gym is located
just inside of Prism Tower.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.607
Prism Tower, got it.

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:17.210
We'll just have our first battle
here in Lumiose City!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.813
I'm afraid this is where
we'll have to part ways.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.147
Are you gonna be alright?

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.284
‐ Yeah, we'll be just fine.
‐ That's great.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.754
Well then, once again,
welcome to the Kalos region.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:31.191
You've really been a big help.
Thanks a lot.

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.727
No, thank you.
It's been great fun.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.397
Yeah...it sure has.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.034
See you later, Alexa.

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:43.403
Right. See you.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.106
Alright! Pikachu let's go!

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.674
[chuckles]

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.042
So much energy.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.243
Go get 'em, Ash!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.845
[laughing]

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.583
Yeah!

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.389
Check it out.
Another new Pokemon.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.059
Oh wow, Pikachu,
this city's gigantic.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.064
[panting]

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:13.700
Look at all the new Pokemon.
Woah!

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.036
Huh, never seen
that before either.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:18.038
Look, Pikachu, Ampharos.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.340
Wow, and Medicham.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.809
There are Pokemon
we know.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.145
Pikachu.

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:26.112
[gasps]

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.180
Wow, Pikachu.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.683
That's Prism Tower,
I'm sure of it.

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:30.917
That's where our first Gym is.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.419
Pika.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:37.524
Uh, yes, this is it,
the Lumiose Gym.

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:39.192
Pika.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:43.229
Our new challenge is just
beginning, right Pikachu?

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.600
So, let's move.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.035
Pika.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.708
Boy oh boy! I'm so psyched!

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.979
Anybody here?

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.948
(Clembot)
'Welcome to the Lumiose Gym.'

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.084
My name is Ash
and I've come all the way

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.219
from Pallet Town
in the Kanto region.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.755
I wanna have
a Gym battle, please!

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:10.790
(Clembot)
'How many badges do you have?'

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.060
Badges? This's the very first
Gym I'm challenging here

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.862
so I haven't won any yet.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.698
'You have none?
Not a single Gym badge?'

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.767
'In order to challenge
the Lumiose Gym'

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:24.170
'you must have accumulated
at least four Gym badges.'

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.071
[gasps]

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.574
Hey, give me a break.
Wait a minute!

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.409
[screaming]

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:41.621
Huh, oh no no.

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.790
I'm gonna try
to catch that boy!

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.025
(Bonnie)
'I'll get Pikachu!'

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.426
[screaming]

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:49.329
Right, let's go.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.765
Woah!

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:53.967
I've got you Pikachu.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.369
[chuckling]

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.139
Are you alright?

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:02.709
Yeah. I'm okay.
Thanks to you.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.310
Take a look at this, Clemont.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.514
A Pikachu. And what a cutie.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.983
[all gasp]

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.556
‐ Bonnie, no!
‐ Hey!

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.124
[grunting]

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.060
[laughing]

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.831
I'm really sorry
about my sister.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.699
Hey, don't worry about it.

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.201
Bonnie, you apologize too.

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.338
I just wanted to give Pikachu
a hug 'cause it's so cute.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.107
Hm.

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:36.509
But did Pikachu like it?

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.978
Um.

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.714
Alright, I'm really sorry,
Pikachu.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.183
Everything's okay now.

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.819
Pikachu was just
a little surprised.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.120
Pika‐pika.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.355
But I still haven't
thanked you yet.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.025
I really appreciate
that you saved Pikachu.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.127
Pika‐pika.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.429
[chuckles]
You're very welcome!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.799
What a weird Gym.
What's up with that?

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.701
You got kicked out, right?

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.270
(Ash)
'Right, and after coming
all this way.'

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.239
'Some Gym Leader.'

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:07.874
Yeah, he's something, alright.

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.676
The Gym Leader
of the Lumiose Gym

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.879
is this really
super‐duper strong person.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.215
So, they asked you how many
badges you have, right?

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:16.483
That's right.

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:19.586
But when I told them I didn't
have any, I got zapped, bad!

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.788
[gasping]
You don't have
any badges?

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.657
You see, I just arrived
in the Kalos region.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.559
This's the first Gym
I've been to!

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.928
Pardon me but,
where are you from?

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:32.499
I'm from Pallet Town in Kanto
and my name is Ash.

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.435
This is Pikachu, and my buddy
and I are on a journey together

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.138
so I can become
a Pokemon Master.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.539
Pika‐pikachu!

00:10:39.539 --> 00:10:42.375
(narrator)
Who's that Pokemon?

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.849
It's Spritzee!

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.590
(Clemont)
'And now it's time
for us to introduce ourselves.'

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.827
My name's Clemont, and this
is my little sister, Bonnie.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:01.561
Nice to meet you!

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.997
Nice to meet you, Clemont.
Bonnie.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.298
Pike‐pika.

00:11:05.298 --> 00:11:08.067
You and your Pikachu
look like such good friends.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.270
If you weren't,
Pikachu wouldn't be sitting

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.505
'on your head like that!'

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.842
Yeah, we've known
each other for a long time.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.143
Pikachu.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.547
Actually, Pikachu was the first
Pokemon I ever got.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.115
We're continuing our journey

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.984
and looking
for more Gym Battles!

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:28.254
So are you and Bonnie
on a journey too?

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.822
Journey? Well, you see..

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.859
That's something we'll be doing
sometime in the future!

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.827
A family adventure sounds great.

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.697
After all, I don't have any
brothers of sisters.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.733
But you've got your special
friend Pikachu instead.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:44.237
Bonnie's a little bit too young
to have any Pokemon yet

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:47.006
so she's really impressed when
she meets someone who does.

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.741
I know just what it's like.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.312
I could hardly wait to grow up
and become a Pokemon Trainer.

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.048
You totally understand
how I feel.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.251
So, what kind of Pokemon
do you have, Clemont?

00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:02.822
Hmm. Okay, here's a Pokemon
that I recently caught

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:06.326
Oh please, can I see it?
Then, let's battle!

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.629
Battle for real?

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:12.131
Yeah! If I can't have
a Gym battle

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.168
I'd like to have my first battle
in the Kalos region with you.

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:16.769
What do you say, Clemont?

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:20.240
Let's do it! It'll be a great
test of strength!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.275
Okay. You're on!

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:28.681
Alright, Bunnelby, come on out
and let's have a battle!

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.384
‐ Bunnelby.
‐ Awesome.

00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:33.253
I've never seen
that Pokémon before!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.821
Pika‐pika.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.723
Pikachu, let's give it our all!

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.224
Pikachu.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.726
Hm.

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:43.463
Lots of luck to both teams! Yay!

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:50.270
Now, Bunnelby, this will be
our very first battle.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.305
Just relax,
and you'll do great.

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.308
Okay, Pikachu! Use Thunderbolt!

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:57.410
Ah!

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.182
Now, Bunnelby, use your ears
to stir up the sand.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.584
Bunnelby.

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:07.086
[explosion]

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.257
Yes, Bunnelby is a normal‐type
Pokemon,

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.526
but it's more
than prepared to deal with

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.295
any electric‐type moves.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.597
Huh, Bunnelby's really strong!

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:18.631
Pika.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.900
So now it's our turn.
Bunnelby, dig!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.236
Bunnelby.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.371
Take off, Pikachu.

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:28.574
'Don't let them know
where you are.'

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:32.945
Trying to use speed to confuse
us, eh? Well, it won't work!

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.415
Now, go!

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:38.284
[grunting]

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.087
No!

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:45.325
‐ You okay, Pikachu?
‐ Pi.. Pika‐pika!

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.593
Yeah, okay, that's the spirit.

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:50.763
Alright, Pikachu,
use Quick Attack!

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.166
[grunting]

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.641
Double Slap, let's go!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.410
[grunting]

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.413
Look at Bunnelby's ears.
They're just like hands.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.881
[grunting]

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.216
Pretty neat, huh?

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.418
Bunnelby's ears can do
lots of great things.

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:15.021
[grunting]

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.123
You're still fine,
aren't you, buddy?

00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:18.891
‐ Pika‐pika.
‐ Awesome.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.893
Now use Iron Tail!

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.596
[grunting]

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:26.232
Look at that. Pikachu knows
a steel‐type move.

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.667
Use your ears and catch it!

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.435
[grunting]

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:31.504
Pika‐pika.

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.040
‐ No.
‐ It worked, like it should!

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.642
Yeah, it was good that you
caught it but now

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:39.011
'it's too bad
you can't use your ears.'

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.446
[gasping]

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.683
You're strong alright,
but you can't move anymore.

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:45.251
Electro Ball!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.453
[grunting]

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:57.430
Oh wow, Ash and Pikachu
are pretty amazing.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.834
[Clemont thinking]
Hm. By battling him,
I understand him even better.

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.436
Use Quick Attack!

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.639
Heads up, Bunnelby.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.207
[panting]

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.209
[gasps]

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:13.179
[all gasping]

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.581
‐ Are you okay, Pikachu!?
‐ Pikachu.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.985
Alright! What do you think
you're doing?

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.587
‐ That was dangerous!
‐ Who are you?

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.123
Prepare for trouble,
our middle name!

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.359
And make it double,
it's a high‐stakes game!

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.861
To protect the world
from devastation!

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.664
To unite all people
within our nation!

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:34.634
To denounce the evils
of truth and love!

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:37.303
To extend our reach
to the stars above!

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:40.440
‐ Jessie!
‐ And James!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.376
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light!

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:46.612
Surrender now or prepare
to fight, fight and fight!

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.680
Meowth is right.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.482
[wailing]

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.253
Team Rocket!

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:57.089
‐ You would follow us here.
‐ Wait, do you know them?

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:59.125
I've never seen
a talking Meowth before!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.393
That's incredible!

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:02.595
Wait, those are a group
of really bad guys

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.298
who are always trying
to take my Pikachu.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.800
Excuse me, Twerp,
but you're selling us short.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.102
Catching Pikachu is but
one of our numerous

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.671
yet glorious goals!

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:14.540
The rest of them include the
confiscation of all the strong

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.275
and rare Pokemon in Kalos.

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.911
Forming a formidable
Pokemon army is inevitable.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.615
But catching Pikachu
is job one.

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:26.085
There's no better way for us
to begin our Kalos kingdom.

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:27.253
[wailing]

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:29.355
And I'll take the one
with the ears.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.424
[gasping]

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.593
Like that's gonna happen.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.995
I will not sit idly by
and let you steal

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.630
other people's Pokemon.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.533
That's right! Who do you think
you are, anyway?

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.934
Team Rocket, that's who!

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:45.137
Alright, Pikachu!
Use Thunderbolt!

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:47.406
Pikachu!

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.308
Wobbuffet, time to shine!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.277
[wailing]

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:53.779
Hey, that's Mirror Coat!

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.381
[grunts]

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.684
Pikachu!

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.453
[grunting]

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.155
Hey buddy, are you okay?

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.825
‐ Pika.
‐ Poor Pikachu.

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.995
Excellent. I give you an eleven!

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:10.429
[wailing]

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.164
‐ Oh.
‐ We'd better retreat!

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:14.500
Using Mirror Coat
reflects special attacks

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.202
with double the power.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:18.671
We can't withstand
that kind of strength.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:22.341
We've always stood up to them
before, and we always will.

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:26.012
As long as Pikachu is okay

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:27.980
long as Pikachu
doesn't give up

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.483
I'll be right here,
battling to the end!

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.318
Pikachu!

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.887
[gasping]

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.590
All you'll end up
with are reruns.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.026
Now, Pikachu, Electro Ball!

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:40.993
Pik.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.662
Pika, pika, pika, pikachu.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:46.132
We'll help you out, too!
Bunnelby, use Mud Shot!

00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:47.767
[grunts]

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:50.770
You're on, Wobbuffet!

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.471
[wailing]

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.242
It dodged them all.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.311
[wailing]

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:00.279
Uh oh.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.581
Pikachu.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.116
[grunting]

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.788
Pikachu!

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:12.091
You okay, Pikachu?

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.960
‐ What's that?
‐ A Pokemon.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.862
[groaning]

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.231
‐ It's a Froakie!
‐ Froakie!

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:22.435
(Clemont)
'It's a Water type Pokemon new
Trainers can get in Kalos.'

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.171
'So that Electro Ball
must have done lots of damage.'

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:26.939
Are you okay, Froakie?

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.474
So where is its Trainer?

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.543
[gasping]

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:32.111
Where's Froakie going?

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.813
[croaking]

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.948
(Jessie)
'What's with the yapping?'

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.684
I think Froakie
wants to help us.

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.753
[groaning]

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:43.589
Uh, Froakie's saying bad guys
rub it the wrong way!

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.559
You can't take them on
if you've been hurt! Stop!

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.960
Woah.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.828
Froakie!

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:51.163
[groaning]

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:52.765
Wow, Froakie just
used its Frubbles!

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:55.568
Big whoop! We'll just send
that right back at you!

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:57.269
[wailing]

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:05.411
‐ What's this?
‐ I can't get this gunk off!

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:07.246
How come it didn't bounce back?

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.447
Of course!

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.616
Froakie's gummy Frubbles
isn't a move

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.519
so Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat was
completely ineffective!

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.354
Awesome, Froakie, way to go!

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:18.357
Pikachu and I
can take it from here.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.026
We'll lend a hand, too!

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:21.594
Bunnelby.

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:23.896
You guys better
not forget about me!

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.931
Now, Bunnelby, use Dig!

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:30.970
[indistinct shouting]

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.306
Yeah! Way to go!

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.508
Nice work, Bunnelby!

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.176
[grunting]

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.513
Let's wrap this up!
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, go!

00:19:40.813 --> 00:19:43.215
[grunting]

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.689
We're blasting off again.

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:55.127
Wow! Awesome power!

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.063
Thanks, everybody!

00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:58.564
Bunnelby, you were just great!

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:01.267
[groaning]

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.968
Froakie!

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.670
Something's wrong!

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.273
‐ Uh, Froakie.
‐ Froakie needs help right away.

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:09.041
Is there a Pokemon Center?

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.410
Well from here,
I'm trying to think.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.913
I think it would be whole
a lot quicker if we brought

00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:16.282
Froakie to
the Professor's lab instead.

00:20:16.282 --> 00:20:18.084
The Professor?

00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:20.653
Yeah, Professor Sycamore's
research lab.

00:20:20.653 --> 00:20:23.122
There's no doubt
he'll know how to help Froakie!

00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:25.224
Alright, Bunnelby, return!

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.195
Thanks a lot!
You really helped out!

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.131
Come on Ash, this way!

00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:33.699
I'm coming, Bonnie!

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:38.270
Just hang in there, Froakie!

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.639
You're gonna be feeling
all better really soon!

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:44.510
(narrator)
A new region! New Pokemon!
New friends!

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.213
And this is only the beginning
of Ash and Pikachu's

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:51.484
exciting new adventures,
as the journey continues!
