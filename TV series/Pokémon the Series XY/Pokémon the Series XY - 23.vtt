she still lost to Grant.

So what's the Fossil Lab?

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.827
The Fossil Lab

What kind of place
is a fossil lab, anyway?

It's a place where researchers
study the fossils

of Pokémon
from ancient times.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.371

as much as they can

'about how Pokémon lived then.'

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.476

Prepare for trouble,
you know us well.

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.610
With our style you should've
been able to tell.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.946
To protect the world
from devastation.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.982
To unite all people
within our nation.

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.652
To denounce the evils
of truth and love.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:55.688
To extend our reach
to the stars above.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.458
‐ Jessie.
‐ And James.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.727
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.497
Surrender now or prepare
for a well‐researched fight.

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:06.799
Meowth, that's right!
[AGREE]

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.703
Team Rocket!

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.972
I should've known you'd
do something like this!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.942
‐ 'Give us back Amaura!'
‐ Dream on, twerpette.

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:18.678
Amaura's a very precious
restored ancient Pokémon.

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.279
One that will be
put to good use.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.347
I won't let you!

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.149
[ANGRY]

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.218
Then let's see what
you've got, young Twerp.

00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:28.454
[ANGRY]
Ash, we've got to hurry!

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.723
‐ Let's do this fast!
‐ Only in your dreams.

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.091
Alright, Chespin, let's go!

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.096
[READY]
Okay, Inkay, out!

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.531
[READY]

00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:40.199

[PAINED]

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.677
‐ Quietly.
‐ Oh, no, you don't!

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.479
Out of our way.
We don't have the time.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.481
Fennekin, let's go!

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.149
[READY]

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:59.151
Alright, Hidden Power!

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.854
[HIDDEN POWER ATTACK]

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:05.124
[snarling]

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.726
You and your fur ball
are out of luck!

00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:07.927
Huh!

00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:09.896
[ANGRY]

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:12.331
Give it up.
[ANGRY]

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.232
Aurorus?

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.601
[EXERTION]

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:16.369
[Meowth grunts]

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.374
Huh! Amaura!

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.309
‐ Ash, it's in here.
‐ Hurry, before it's too late.

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:24.744
[groans]

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:27.413
Let's go, Pikachu!
[AGREE]

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:30.416
Use Thunderbolt!
[THUNDERBOLT ATTACK]

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.618
Wobbuffet. And action.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.120
[THUNDERBOLT ATTACK]

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.755

ASH
'Aurorus!'

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:44.897
Now it moves.
[PANIC]

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.300
[EXERTION]

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.235
[all groans]

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.202
MEOWTH
I need a blankie.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.138
[UNCOMFORTABLE]

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:53.539
Thank you, Aurorus!

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.408
[HAPPY]

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.777
Alright, Pikachu,
Thunderbolt, let's go!

00:17:57.777 --> 00:18:00.346
[THUNDERBOLT ATTACK]

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.317
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
We're blasting off again!

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:05.651
MEOWTH
Flash‐frozen to boot.

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:06.419
[AGREE]

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.891
Hang in there, Amaura.

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:12.892
[WEAK]

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:18.064
Whoa! Amaura's temperatures
gotten much too high.

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:19.198
Amaura!

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.033
[panting]

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.002
[grunts]
Please, hang in there.

Amaura!

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:30.977
We've got to get it back
to the lab, now!

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.079
[WEAK]

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.981
‐ Huh?
‐ Aurorus?

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:38.117
CLEMONT
What's it going to do?

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:48.127
[all gasping]
I see.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.863
'Aurorus is chilling the air
to help Amaura cool down!'

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:56.969
[HAPPY]

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.739
Thank goodness!

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.474
Amaura looks a whole
lot better now.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:02.742
That was great, Aurorus!

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.313
[GRATEFUL]

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.882
Now, let's hurry and get
back to the Fossil Lab.

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.517
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/ALEXA
Huh?

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.219
Look, the truck.

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:13.886
ASH
'Over here!'

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.123
‐ 'There they are.'
‐ 'Right.'

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.091
THADDEUS
You're going to be

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:19.992
just fine, Amaura.

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:28.000
Are you back
to feeling great, Amaura?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.168
[CURIOUS]

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.137
[HAPPY]

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.973
Amauras' body temperature
is back to normal.

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:36.942
‐ And we're so glad.
‐ Wow, that's great!

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.045
Right, buddy?
[AGREE]

[exertion]

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:56.896
‐ Hey, you're freezing.
‐ Well, Ash. You're so lucky.

00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.597
I really want
to get nuzzled, too!

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:01.534

Hey, that's cold!

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.335

Oh, that is cold!

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.372
I love it!

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.340
Say, mind if I join in?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.077
[laughing]

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:13.012
I think it's the perfect time
for a snowball fight.

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:14.814
Alright!

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.048

have been in ancient times'

00:20:28.828 --> 00:20:30.629
it's beautiful to see
people and Pokémon

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.631
having fun together.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.768
