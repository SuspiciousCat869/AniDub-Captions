we train for our Gym battle?

So, I think I'll
work on some new inventions!

Hey, Clemont? Is it okay
if I go and explore the forest?

I guess so.
But don't get into any trouble.

Of course, I won't!

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.168
Dedenne will be with me.

I think you mean our dominion.

Yeah, that's right,
it's our dominion.

Okay,
what do you mean by that?

You see, our dominion means

that this place belongs
to us and us alone.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.997
That doesn't make sense.

The forest doesn't belong

there's a Lapras around here?

How could you
possibly know that?

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.513
Huh, because
you called yourselves

the Lapras Defense Force.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.417

you were just a dumb kid.

But it turns out
you're really smart.

Maybe it would be better
if she were on our side.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.457
Tell me your name.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.292
I think it's rude
if you don't tell me your name

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.927
before I tell you my name.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.896

Well, Dedenne is my
big brother Clemont's Pokémon

but he asked me
if I'd take care of it.

He asked you to? Wait,
Bonnie, are you a grown‐up?

‐ That's incredible.
‐ Oh, I've got an idea.

join the Lapras Defense Force

Only a true grown‐up
could go through all of that.

Ah! Thanks!

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.911
And one for Dedenne.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.612
[HAPPY]

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:03.283
Hey,
there won't be any left.

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:04.818
‐ Thanks a lot, Jay.
‐ Huh?

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.720
That's really nice of you.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.522
Nice? Well, I guess
you could say that.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.258
Ready, Lapras Defense Force?
Eat candy, now!

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:13.660
Roger!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.663
Yummy!

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.601
'Look, it stopped raining.'

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.270
Great! Let's play
some more, Lapras!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.839
‐ Huh?
‐ Ah?

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.540
Not again.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.843
Sometimes Lapras
will start to cry

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.178
like it's really, really
sad about something.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.715
But the problem
is we have no idea why.

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.250
Lapras, what's wrong?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.085
[SAD]

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.488
Hey, its skin feels warmer
than it should.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:43.523
‐ Huh?
‐ Well, you're right. It's hot.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.926
Maybe its wound
didn't heal completely.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.862
Then we need to get
someone to help us.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.997
No way!
We can't tell the grown‐ups!

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:53.533
'Hey! Bonnie!'

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.269
'Where are you?'

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.171
We can tell if they'renot
grown‐ups, right?

00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.239
[all gasp]

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.111
POKEDEX
Lapras, the Transport Pokémon.

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:07.113
Lapras enjoys carrying people
on its back

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.983
'and it understands what people
are saying.'

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.285
It's really burning up.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.254
It's not something
we can deal with.

00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.688
[CONCERNED]

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.590
Oh, that poor Pokémon.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.293
I think we'd better
get Nurse Joy right away.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.462
‐ Good idea.
‐ You can't do that!

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:25.098
But...why can't we?

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.533
Because you can't trust
any grown‐ups!

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.835
They're all liars!

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.671
We once found an Eevee
that someone had abandoned.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.473
We hid it behind
our classroom

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:35.375
while the three of us
took care of it.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.177
But one day
our teacher found out

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.712
when we were bringing Eevee
some food.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.548
She promised she
wouldn't do anything

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.384
as long as we told her
what we were doing.

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.885
JAY
But as soon as we did,

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:48.021
she took Eevee away.

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.824
And those grown‐ups will
take Lapras away, too/

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.526
I see, but you know
Lapras needs help.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.628
Oh, Lapras, are you okay?

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.697
We can't just stand around
and do nothing.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:59.732
Lapras is going downhill fast.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.469
[ANGRY]
Oh, no, does that mean..

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:05.371
Uh, I'd rather
not think about it.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.474
‐ No way.
‐ No. That can't be true.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.009
Don't lie to us.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.644
No, I won't believe it.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.180
I won't!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.082
You're all
a bunch of meanies!

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:19.252
Hey, I'm sorry! Oh, man.

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:21.454
Ash said everything he said
because he really cares

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.389
about Lapras like you do.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.024
Getting the help
that Lapras needs

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:27.393
is the best thing
we can do.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:28.995
So is it okay if we go
and get Nurse Joy?

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.997
[crying]

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.165
'Okay.'

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.570
'What good is just one
going to do us?'

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.973
I'm afraid one
is all they had left.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.875
Shall we split it
into thirds?

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.977
Don't go mathematical on me!

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.645
Rock‐paper‐scissors
wins it all!

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.680
‐ And that's that!
‐ Fine with me!

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.782
And the winner chows down!

but some germs
must have gotten in.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.017
That explains the fever.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.952
‐ Nurse Joy?
‐ What does that mean?

00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:28.121
‐ Will it be alright?
‐ Oh, don't worry.

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.789
Lapras will be just fine.

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.524
‐ Really?
‐ Promise.

Wow! Looks like it's fine.

I'll be getting on back
to the Pokémon Center now.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.206
‐ Thanks, Nurse‐‐
‐ Nurse Joy!

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.440
Thank you!

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.576
We're so happy!

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:52.412
‐ Guess some grown‐ups are nice.
‐ You're wonderful!

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:54.847
Don't forget,
the three of you are the ones

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:55.615
who gave Lapras
such excellent care.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.318
But thank you.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.920

You're making me crush.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.489
‐ Kye, you mean blush.
‐ Oh, yes!

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:06.059
The Eevee that you found
and took such wonderful care of?

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.860
I returned it
to its Trainer

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.396
and I'm happy to report
it's doing very well.

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.899
Uh! How do you know
about our Eevee?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.434
Well, your teacher
brought it to me

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:16.069
to see
if I knew its Trainer

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.805
so I took it back to its home
as soon as I could.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.773
‐ Our teacher?
‐ So she didn't...

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:21.541
Take it away from us.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.111
Lapras on the loose.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.814
A Pokémon we could put
to very good use.

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:30.149
Let's catch it. Without excuse.

[SAD]
It sounds so sad.

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:45.999
According to the story
we were told earlier

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:48.301
Lapras was swept into
the forest during a storm.

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:52.872
‐ Um‐hm.
‐ Forest, River. Hm.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.808
Maybe it wants to return
to the ocean.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.977
I wouldn't be surprised
if its family and friends

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.746
are living out at sea.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:03.049
‐ You might be right.
‐ Of course.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:04.784
Hey, Lapras?
Do you miss all your friends?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.652
[CONCERNED]

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:11.057

You can't do that!
Lapras is our friend!

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:18.531
We won't stand for it!

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:21.067
But think for a moment about
how Lapras feels right now.

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.936
‐ How Lapras feels?
‐ Mm‐hm.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.706
There's no doubt that
Lapras cares about you a lot

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.741
but I think it's feeling
pretty homesick

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:30.743
and wants to go back
to where it comes from.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:33.079
Lapras wants to go home?

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.881
'After you finish
playing together'

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:36.416

go back home, right?'

‐ Heidi?
‐ I love Lapras.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.391
So, if it's homesick,
I wanna help.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.760
Whatever it takes.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.595
I want to help
Lapras get back home.

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.964
It's the right thing to do!

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.400
‐ That's right!
