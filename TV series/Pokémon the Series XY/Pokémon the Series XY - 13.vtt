Is something wrong
with Froakie?

It's because it lost
the battle to Sylveon.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.757
I think Froakie's a little
embarrassed about the Attract.

those folks to come here?

No. I didn't.

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:47.480
One of our favorite pastimes
is volunteering to travel around

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.048

Yeah. Maybe he didn't get off
