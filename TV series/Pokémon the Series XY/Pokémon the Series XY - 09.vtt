I guess it's okay.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.155
The Lumiose Gym
is inside that tower.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.658
Oh, so you've already challenged
that Gym, huh, Ash?

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.460
Well, I showed up there
and tried to.

CLEMBOT In order to
challenge the Lumiose Gym

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.971
you must have accumulated
at least four Gym badges.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.040
‐ Oh! Hey, give me a break.
‐ Please leave immediately.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.177
That's what happened.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.479
I didn't have four badges,
so I couldn't get in.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.950
I had no idea there were Gyms
where you need four badges

just to be able
to challenge them.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.353
Well, since
that's the way it is here

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.321
why don't we get out
of Lumiose City?

Wait, Clemont!
I've told you this before.

It's true you need to be
tough on challengers

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.559
but that alone
isn't going to help them

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.761
become better Trainers.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.197

‐ You see, it's like this.
‐ Ah..

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:45.525
Well, we might as well
just tell them the truth.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.395
The truth is..

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.431
...that I really am the
Gym Leader of the Lumiose Gym.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.166
Why didn't you just tell us?

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.935
The thing is,
I really was planning

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.269
on telling you eventually.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:03.610
I'm sorry. It's a long story.
I was so busy as a Gym Leader

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.779
I never had the time to invent
things like I wanted to.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.885
So I decided to construct
a Gym Leader robot

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:13.887
who could help me fulfill my
Gym Leader responsibilities

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:14.888
and give me more time.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.559
Okay, all done.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.995
Now for the next step,
programming.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.364
The first thing to do
is gather up my ideals

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.632
and then put them all
into your AI.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.269
'I want all challengers
to have won'

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.471
around four Gym badges.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.940
And you need to be kind
to the challengers

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.042
but at the same time, you need
to be tough when necessary.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.914
Now I just need to set
the voice code.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.917
Anything is fine,
so, uh, sandwich.

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.386

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.214

in a Pokémon battle.

00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:16.716

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.796
None? In order to challenge
the Lumiose City Gym

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.832
you are required to have
a minimum of four Gym badges!

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:34.301
Huh? What?

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.736
Your programming should say
you'd prefer four Gym badges.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:39.139
Please try again later.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.708
Stop this! I'll just
have to reprogram you instead.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.044
Can you really do that?

00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.980
I prepared a special mechanism
in case of emergency.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.717
Now, Clembot, activate
master recognition battle mode!

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.320
Voice code will be needed
for activation.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.922
If I remember correctly,
it was sandwich.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.958
No, you are wrong.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.359

You're wrong.

Incorrect.

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.530
Hey, Clemont,
is there any other way

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.599
to get your robot to behave?

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.002

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.384
And that's why.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.820
So now you can't get back
into your own Gym?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.656

without four Gym badges
through the entrance.

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:58.251
You bet there is.
It's this Gym.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.854
Did they say you need
four badges to challenge?

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.555
Yeah, but that
wasn't any problem

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.925
because I already
had four of them.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.861
My opponent was this crazed,
powerful robot.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:10.630
After I lost, it zapped me,
the floor opened up

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.965
and I was thrown
out of there.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.367
‐ Oh!
‐ I've had enough of this place.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.336
I'll never come
to this Gym again.

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.438
[sighs]

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.274
Being tough alone
won't help Trainers get better.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.109
Now, I understand
what daddy was talking about.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.744

‐ Uh..

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.481
‐ We know what to do.
‐ Huh?

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.283
We'll just stop
that crazy robot. Now!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.085
But how?

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.887
We can't do a thing
without the voice code.

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:36.423
Now try to relax
and think carefully.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.558
Even if I remember the password

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.460
I still have to defeat it
in battle.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.862
But you won't know
unless you give it a try.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.131
No way!
Clembot will have all of my

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.434
Pokémon partners
to battle me with.

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.936
I can't win
with my inexperienced Bunnelby.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.604
Well, maybe you can't win

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.074
but you can give it
your best shot!

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:56.609
I don't know much about robots

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:59.446
but since you made Clembot
in the first place

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:00.914
maybe you'll come to understand
each other in battle.

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:02.749
[EMPHATIC]

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.952
Battling Clembot,
to understand each other?

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.254
Clemont, why did you become the
Gym Leader in the first place?

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:09.889
Not sure how to explain.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.458
I'll tell them.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.626
In Lumiose City,
they call my brother

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:16.429
the boy genius
of electric types.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.231
I wanted to be
an electric‐type Trainer

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.000
like the world had never seen

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.901
so I became
the Lumiose Gym Leader.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.070
By running an electric‐type Gym

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.239
challengers would plan
their strategies accordingly.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.108
I figured if I could still win

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.110
in spite of
the stiff competition

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.945
perhaps it would make
me grow a lot stronger

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:35.015
as an electric‐type Trainer!

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.584
All the more reason why
you need to get your Gym back.

00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.686
‐ Huh?
‐ She's right.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.355
Taking back this Gym is going
to help you grow stronger.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:46.393
‐ And we'll help.
‐ Hm. You're right.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:47.660
Let's go see Clembot.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.965
‐ Hey, Clemont?
‐ Huh?

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:54.701
Isn't it awesome that
Ash and Serena are here?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.802
‐ Yeah.
‐ Heh.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.106
If we can get to the battlefield

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.674
we might be recognized
as challengers.

Yeah, but because Clembot
is now the Gym Leader

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.852
I would guess
it ordered Magnemite

to get rid of any intruders!

Clemont was so great. Ha‐ha‐ha!

00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.059
Mm. Oh, Heliolisk, are you okay?

[PLEASED]

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:03.329
Hmm. Thank goodness!

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.466
But, I'm so sorry. Huh?

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.935
I recognize you now, sir.

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:11.671
Welcome back to the Lumiose Gym.

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.906
I'm glad to be back, Clembot.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.741
[grunts]

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.144
Because of my faulty programming

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.713
I realize I made
a lot of trouble for you too.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:22.615
It's all my fault.

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:23.716
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:30.490
I think I'll begin work
on reprogramming you right now.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.961
First rule, be modest.

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:38.564
It doesn't matter how many
badges a challenger has.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:42.435
Second rule, be kind, even
while you're being tough.

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:44.136
And don't forget
to give the challenger

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.506
constructive advice
after the battle.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.175
And the third rule,
be thoughtful.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.711
Try to help challengers
grow their skills.

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:53.179
These are rules every
Gym Leader needs to follow.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.857
I've learned so very much
from all of you.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.427
And I want to keep on learning!
Right, Clembot?

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:11.097
Well put, sir.

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:14.200
Uh‐uh, sorry. Now I'm feeling
kind of embarrassed.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.903
Hey, I want to keep learning
with you.

Daddy, wait until you hear
the end of the story.

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:42.361
That's how it was before,
but everything's alright now!

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.097
It's okay to leave it to Clembot
to be the Gym Leader.

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:46.699
Well, I sure hope
that you're right.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.067
So does that mean
you'll be coming by

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.168
the house more often now?

Well, you see, the thing is‐‐

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.675
Is there some sort of problem?

00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:58.644
Kind of, because..

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:02.715
‐ Just tell him, Clemont, now!
‐ Uh‐huh. Here's the thing!

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:05.985
I'm...going on a journey.

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:07.553
Since I first met Ash

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.388
I've been gaining
more and more courage

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:10.990
the longer I travel
around with him!

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.225
‐ Courage, huh?
‐ That's right.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.794
I've always been afraid
to find the courage

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:16.929
to try out new things

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.664
but now I'm feeling
completely different.

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.900
Wow, Clemont.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.403
I've only been feeling this way
for a short time, but I get it!

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:27.406
I've experienced so much,
so quickly.

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.009
I've had fun,
I've been sad

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.712
I've been happy
and scared.

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.214
That may not sound like
such a big deal

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.683
but I've really started
getting in touch with
myself.

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.585
And that's really,
really important to me.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.590
Even if it's only till Ash
gets to the Kalos League

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.993
it's really important
that I travel with him there.

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.961
Daddy, I want to go
with Ash and Clemont too.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.296

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.864

‐ Dad?

Please, daddy? Please?

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.668
I'll watch over Bonnie,
I promise.

We both promise.

00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:00.239
I give you my word
that I will take care of the Gym

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:01.807
and help out
with the house as well.

I'm just so proud
and happy for you both!

Hmm. What a joy
to have such great kids.

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.920
I know I've told you this before

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.522
the most important thing
in the world

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:19.225
is to have real friends.

'As long as you have great
friends like Ash and Serena'

I'm not worried about a thing.

Alright. You can go.

Hmm. I love you too.

you'll keep an eye on these two

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.432
you weren't able to challenge
the Lumiose Gym?

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:01.534
Yeah, but back then

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.602
you decided that challengers
should be strong enough

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.337
to have earned
four Gym badges first, right?

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.540
Huh? Well, yeah.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.608

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.410
I'll just come back
when I've gotten four of them.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.680

‐ One thing.
‐ Huh?

I want the battle to be
against you instead of Clembot.

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:21.721
Huh? Deal.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.256
I'll make sure I get stronger
so I can give you a Gym battle

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:25.558
you'll never forget
for the rest of your life.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.928
That sounds good to me!

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:32.698
Great! That's what we'll do!
