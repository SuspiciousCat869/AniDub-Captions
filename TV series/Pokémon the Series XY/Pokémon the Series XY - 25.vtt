I'm Miette. And this is

Hot.

Aw, that didn't taste good.
What was it?

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.262
That was for Fire‐types.
Poké Puffs are made for Pokémon

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:17.164
so they're not all going
to taste good to people.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.132
Like that one.

The first round's today

the hearts of people

Little? We're going to explode.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.855
