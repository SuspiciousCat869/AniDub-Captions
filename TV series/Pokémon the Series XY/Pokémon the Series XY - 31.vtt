00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.776
GURKINN
The power of Mega Evolution

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:03.877
can be too much to
handle at first.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.746
By power, do you mean its aura?

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:13.653
Ash and Pikachu, I'm so sorry.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.056
It got to the point where
I didn't know what to do.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.792
I think that surprised
all of us, but that's okay.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.593
I'll tell you something else.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.462
It was probably
a surprise for Lucario too.

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.997
[AGREEMENT]

00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:26.132
Ash is right.
After evolving

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.434
this kind of situation

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.269
happens all the time.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:30.670
'So you shouldn't
think what happened'

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.638
'to your Lucario was unusual.'

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.642
Look on the bright side!

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.578
Lucario was able to Mega Evolve!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.280
I know the two of you
will work all of this out.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.182
[AGREEMENT]

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:43.550
You're right, Ash.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.251
If any Pokémon will be able

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.655
to control its new power,
it's Lucario.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:51.558
Please, take good care
of Lucario. And thanks.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:53.726
Right.
You can always count on me.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.694
[AGREEMENT]

00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:01.201
Mega Evolution's a lot
harder than I thought.

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.203
That's exactly
why it's so incredible.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.776
Was your Lucario like that in
the beginning too, grandfather?

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:13.613
In a way. No one gets everything
perfect on their first attempt.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.448
‐ But still..
‐ But still?

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.950
What are you saying?

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.751
That battle you had
with Ash earlier

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.122
was hardly worthy of praise.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.757
But didn't you hear what
Ash and the others said?

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.826
We're just getting warmed up.

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.561
Mr. McGinty.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.163
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Gurkinn.

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.398
So, is it finished?

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:34.300
Aye, and it came out great.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.406
The Lucarionite.
Thanks, Mr. McGinty.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.308
And this is for you too.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.379
Thanks so much.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.548
It's such a great photo.

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:51.251
And now we have a complete set.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.820
Like the one
Grandpa's Lucario has.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.389
Mr. McGinty,
did you make that one too?

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.491
I did, and I'm proud
of my handiwork.

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:06.533
CLEMONT
So what do you think

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.734
happened to Mega Lucario?

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.770
It just Mega Evolved
for the first time

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.972
so it probably got carried away.

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.542
I wonder.
What do you think, Ash?

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.044
Hmm, well, it did feel like
we were up against

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.812
a completely different Pokémon

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.414
than the last time
we had a battle.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:25.251
[AGREEMENT]
[AGREEMENT]

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.887
It was a little bit
scary to watch.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.756
Lucario just went a little wild.

00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.524
Each Pokémon reacts

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.660
to Mega Evolution
in a different way.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.695
Oh, yeah.
The other day, we actually met

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.964
Diantha, the Champion.

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:41.401
I believe Diantha's Gardevoir
also Mega Evolves, correct?

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:44.103
Yeah.
We met Mega Gardevoir too.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:46.839
They do both Mega Evolve,
but Mega Gardevoir

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:49.509
seemed completely
different from Mega Lucario.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.078
You're right. Mega
Gardevoir was so elegant.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.479
Calm and in control.

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.149
On the other
hand, Mega Lucario

00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.017
became super strong

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.452
but totally
ignored Korrina's commands.

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:05.258
I wonder. What was
happening with Lucario?

00:12:05.258 --> 00:12:07.827
KORRINA
I need to find out.

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:10.663
When Lucario
refused to listen to me

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.166
it felt so strange.

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.602
It could mean
the power of Mega Evolution

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:18.104
is simply too strong
for your Lucario to handle.

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.540
Too strong?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.243
It's believed the
strength of Lucario's aura

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.612
is heightened to its limit
when it Mega Evolves.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:27.947
During a battle,
every nerve in its body

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:29.983
is concentrating
on battling

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.151
so it's unable to think
about anything else.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.753
That's why its
heightened aura

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.956
awakens its
battling instincts so strongly.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:40.693
You're right.
That instinct totally took over.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:43.363
It's not unheard of
for a Mega Evolved Pokémon

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.098
to lose control during a battle.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.634
Okay, so you're saying Korrina

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.636
needs to figure out
how to to control that.

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:52.038
[AGREEMENT]
That's right.

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.806

she must make her own

Lucario, Swords Dance.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.908
Lucario, what are you doing?

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:23.509
It ignored her command again!

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.711
[EXERTION]
Stop it, now.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.246
[ATTACK]

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.281
[IMPACT]

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.150
Dodge it with your aura.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:37.356
Lucario, listen to me.
Bone Rush!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.324
Aura Sphere.

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:41.894
[AURA SPHERE MOVE]

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.630
[PAINED]

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.574
Our battle's over.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.511
Lucario. Lucario, wake up.

00:17:58.511 --> 00:17:59.478
GURKINN
Well done.

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:05.117
We've got a lot of work ahead.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.819
Hmm.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.654
Lucario, wake up, please.

00:18:10.523 --> 00:18:11.958
I'm so glad you're awake.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:19.932
Huh?
It's hard. But why?

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.969
It Mega Evolved again, but we
still couldn't control it.

00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:25.037
I'm afraid
the only ones to blame

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.872
for the lack of change
are you two.

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.409
Now, Lucario.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:33.412
The reason you're consumed
by your aura is because

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:36.082
of your overconfidence
with regard to your power.

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:38.651
Attacking excessively
without Korrina's command

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:41.654
is nothing short of arrogant.

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:44.924
And, Korrina, because you
allow Lucario to do just that

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:47.593
it shows you
don't truly understand it.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.430
The way things are now,
becoming stronger is impossible.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.367
You two have spent
too much time together.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:57.303
And because you believe
you truly understand each other

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.505
you have
unfortunately neglected

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.674
the training
that would make you stronger.

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:04.310
It's this sort
of immature behavior

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.780
'that's unbecoming
of the Shalour Gym Leader.'

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.950
I don't get this.
I don't get this at all.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.218
We've battled so much.

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:13.819
Why, you fool!

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.088
[gasping]

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:20.126
I order you to go on
another training journey.

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:22.161
'There's a trainer who has
guided me since I was young'

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.330
'who lives on Pomace Mountain.'

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.134
'This Trainer's partner
is also a Mega Evolved Pokémon.'

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.970
'I'm certain they will teach you
what you need to be able to see'

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.973
'beyond the surface
of Mega Evolution.'

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:34.807
Okay.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.611
‐ 'Korrina?'
‐ Huh?

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.880
We want to go with you.
We can train together.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.581
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:44.550
It's here.
Pomace Mountain. Found it!

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.719
Thanks a lot, Serena.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.854
Look on the bright side.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.456
This is all so you guys
can become stronger.

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:52.258
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:54.927
I know you're right, Ash.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.529
I'm sure training
will be a lot more fun

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.497
if you have company.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:01.901
‐ I want to go too.
‐ So do I. We'll go together.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:05.137
I want to beat you guys
when you're both super strong.

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:08.074
And now that Lucario can
Mega Evolve, you'll do it.

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:10.409
And once you're there,
I'll challenge you.

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.978
But once we master
Mega Evolution

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.314
you won't be able to win
a Shalour Gym badge, you know.

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:17.083
There's no way we can know that

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:18.451
until we have
a Gym battle, right?

00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:19.151
PIKACHU
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:24.390
[thinking] Korrina,
Lucario, how will you

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.692
come to terms
with Mega Evolution

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.595
and learn to use
the power of the aura?

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.465
This is a trial
that must be overcome.

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:33.833
Now go! To
Pomace Mountain!

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:40.339
NARRATOR
And so, Korrina and Lucario

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:43.209
set off on a new journey,
complete with a new task.

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:45.344
Just what will they
and our heroes

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.379
gain from their
adventures?

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.348
More mysteries
of Mega Evolution lie ahead

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.517
as the journey continues.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.423
