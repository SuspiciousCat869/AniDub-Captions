You get no points
for good names.

[AGREEMENT]

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.461
Observe, this detects Pikachu's
unique energy pattern

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:16.997
and will track it to
the farthest reaches of the land

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.499
'the bottom of the ocean
or the expanse of the sky.'

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.601
Great! Now we'll find
Pikachu for sure.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.237
It's incredibly inspiring

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.539
that the steady progress
of science can never be stopped!

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.208
[AGREEMENT]

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.643
It's picked up a signal.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.746
Onward! Go, Automatic
Pikachu‐Retrieval Device!

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:35.248
[AGREEMENT]

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.985
Begin retrieval! Let's go!

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.921
‐ Ash, wait up!
‐ Slow down! I'm coming!

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.991
Huh? Hey, what about me?

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.041
I think it's stuck.

Oops. Another failure.

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.752
[coughs]

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.921
Failure
is the mother of success.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.656
I so want to believe that.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:17.424
[coughs]

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.396
Okay, we're all set.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.433
Now, why don't we see
how you work?

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:27.967
[EXERTION]

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.804
That's odd.
Perhaps a loose wire.

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:32.839
PIKABOT [EXERTION]
That's the radio observatory

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:35.341
we saw before.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.545
Look! Isn't that Officer Jenny's
motorcycle?

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:40.980
Hm? You're right.
Wonder what she's doing here.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.920
You know, if that Pikabot
of yours was on the right track

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.289
maybe this weird joint
is Madame X's hideout.

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.291
‐ Huh?
‐ Could be.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:52.859
Officer Jenny
could have gotten a report

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.994
and went to investigate.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.363
I'd say that the probability
is quite high.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.432
‐ Okay. Let's go in.
‐ Right.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.440

Huh. Now you belong to me.

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.083
Come, Pikachu!

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:23.289
Ah..
Good.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.758
I just know
you'll work very hard for me.

JESSIE
Madame X, we have intruders.

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:33.666
So they've found my hideout.
Those fools!

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.636
They're going to pay for this.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:40.874
They have the Pok mon, Chespin,
Fennekin and Froakie with them.

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:44.744
Perhaps you'd like to take them
as servants, too.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.313
Yes, I would. They should all
prove to be quite useful.

[AGREEMENT]

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.891

‐ Right. Bonnie, come with me.

00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.392
Okay. Then we'll go down here.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.229
Officer Jenny.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.632
Since we saw her motorcycle
parked outside

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:07.867
she's got to be in here.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.936
Yeah, but where is she?

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:11.871
I wonder if Madame X
got a hold of her.

Not in here.

I wonder if Clemont
found any sign of them.

Negative.

We got to scram

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:06.893
Pikachu. Yeah! Yes! Yes!

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:08.928
Why are we here?

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:10.763
Most likely to figure out
where we are.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.565
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.768
You're you again!
Big improvement!

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:19.405
Uh, so who can tell me
what Serena's doing over here?

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:23.409
Uh, I guess Malamar was
controlling me, as well.

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.745
‐ Look! There's Madame X!
‐ 'Huh?'

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.414

Officer Jenny?

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.893
What am I doing?

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.596
I got a report that strange
things were going on here

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.932
and hurried over
right away.

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:48.768
Then I ran into that Malamar.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.639
[LAUGHING]

[EXERTION]

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.778
Hey, Malamar's saying
it's really grateful

00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:01.414
to Officer Jenny for doing
all of its work for it.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:04.550
‐ What's going on?
‐ Of course!

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.919
Malamar must've hypnotized
Officer Jenny

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.888
so she could
assume the role of Madame X.

00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:09.922
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.126
Malamar says that's how
it was able to start working

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.963
‐ on an important new weapon.
‐ New weapon?

00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:18.798
And what are you gonna do
with it?

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:21.267
[CURIOUS]
[EXERTION]

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.102
Take over the world?

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.037
Then that means
we'll be doing all the work

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.839
for Malamar like before!

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.541
Oh? In your dreams!
Inkay, Psybeam!

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.712

It's fleeing!

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.059
Come back and fight, you coward!

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.160
We'll get it.

[EXERTION]

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.320
That's right. This is how
the new world starts.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.688
And that will only be
the beginning

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.189
of its evil grand design!

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:19.625
[EXERTION]

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.927
But now that it's been
discovered

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.396
it has to destroy
the weapon right away!

Malamar, stop!

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.808
You've got to run!
It's going to blow!

The beginning
of its evil grand design.

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:01.367
Those words came from Malamar.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.603
What does it mean?
What happens next?

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:07.807
Well, there are still a lot
of questions left unanswered.

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:10.976
Malamar.
That's one scary Pokémon.

what Malamar's masterplan
could be

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.888
but Ash's Cyllage City

of Inkay, right?
