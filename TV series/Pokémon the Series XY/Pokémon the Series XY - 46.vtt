Fennekin!
Thank goodness you're alright!

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.328
Thanks, Pancham.

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:44.564
You really helped
Fennekin a lot.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.265
So now,
what do you say we get back

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.501
to having our battle?

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:50.069
[AGREE]

00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:55.241

[AGREE]

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.177
[DARK PULSE MOVE]

Dodge it!

00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:04.417
Use Flamethrower!

[PAINED]

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.175
Alright, Serena,
use the Poké Ball!

00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.643
Got it, Ash.

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:32.144
Poké Ball, let's go!

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.351
[gasps]

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.955
[CONFIDENT]

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.291
Don't give up!
Just keep battling hard!

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.393
You can do it!
[EXCITED]

00:18:47.393 --> 00:18:49.895
Hm. Use, Flamethrower!

Go on. Throw it again!

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:10.082
Pancham?
I wanna perform together.

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:12.885
Please. Come join me
on my journey, right now.

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.497
[laughing]

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.967
Ta‐da! I've begun
a brand new phase of my journey.

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.135
Because I caught a Pancham!

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:31.937
[EXCITED]

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.407
Thanks for everything,
Fennekin!

00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:35.474
Yeah! You did it!

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.276
[HAPPY]

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.011
The first time
you caught a Pokémon.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.981
‐ Yay!
‐ Thanks!

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.849
I'm going to do my best

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.052
to become
a Pokémon performer like Aria.

00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:47.920
[SURPRISED]

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.755
And someday,
I'll become Kalos Queen!

00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:57.029
Pancham? Fennekin?

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:02.768
Will you help me
make my dream come true?

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:06.138
Awesome! I can't wait to see
you as a Pokémon performer.

00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:07.606
It's good to have a goal,
and I think

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.507
you've chosen the perfect one.

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.076
[AGREE]

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:12.311
That's for sure.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.913
And I'm working hard
at my goal too!

00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:14.814
[EXCITED]

00:20:17.183 --> 00:20:20.519
My goal is to become an
inventor who helps all Pokémon.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.922
You're all so lucky,
I can't wait to grow up

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:23.889
and become a Pokémon Trainer!

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.192
[AGREE]

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:28.060
We're all on the road
to make our dreams come true.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.228
Full speed ahead!

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.297
[EXCITED]

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.532
So, Pancham? Fennekin?

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:35.234
Let's do our very best.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.269
[AGREE]

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:41.807
NARRATOR
Serena has caught

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:44.176
her first Pokémon Pancham,
and has also decided to
become

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.212
a Pokémon performer.

00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:48.714
Now, as they
travel together

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:51.717
each with their own goal, our
heroes' journey continues.
