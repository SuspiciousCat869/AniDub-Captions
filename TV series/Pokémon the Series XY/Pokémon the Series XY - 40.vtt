'While they're still in
the ravine and rescue Bonnie!'

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:01.420
‐ I get it!
‐ I'll handle this.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.756
‐ She's my sister, after all.
‐ Hold on a minute!

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.258
I'm better at this
kind of stuff!

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:06.993
Let me take care of it.

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:09.028
But, Ash, are you sure?

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.763
You just get them to fly up.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.198
If we all work together

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.333
then rescuing Bonnie's a cinch.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.268
It's a deal.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.341
Use Vine Whip!
[VINE WHIP MOVE]

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.110

'Okay, Ash! Go for it!'

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.830
Froakie,
make sure Pikachu's okay.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.481
‐ Bonnie!
‐ Ash made it across the ravine!

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.883
But that's just the beginning.

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.217
What about Bonnie?

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:08.487
Bonnie! Are you okay? Oh!

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.022
[Bonnie moans]

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.258
Hmm. There's only
one thing to do.

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.833
I've got to jump
while I still can!

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.235
[grunting]

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.537
You can do it.

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:27.340
[Ash grunting]

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.341
Just a little farther.

Huh!

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.025
All or nothing.

A Pokémon you've never
seen before?

Yup! That's right!

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:12.051
And after it walked past me

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:14.353
a whole bunch
of pretty flowers bloomed!

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.888
I couldn't help
but chase after it!

[AGREEMENT]

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.761
Huh! A Pokémon that can
make flowers bloom.

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.162
Then right after that,
a Beedrill.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.163
Huh!

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:26.732
Hey! There it is!

Astounding.

Is that a Pokémon? Amazing.

‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:44.784
I'll check the Pokédex.

'Aw. It's gone.'

Marvelous! An unexpected dead
heat at the end of the race.

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:05.237
Congratulations on winning
your points!

Hey, everybody?
I'm sorry about what happened.

I'm sorry, too.

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:21.287
‐ Nah, don't worry about it.
‐ Tierno's right.

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:22.021
Without what happened,
we wouldn't have seen

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:24.924
what we just saw!

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:28.494
And next time, I promise
I'll remember to take a picture.

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:31.030
To think we saw
such a mysterious Pokémon.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.965
I sure hope we see it again.

to score points during
Pokémon Orienteering on day fie
of camp

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.676
they did encounter
a mysterious Pokémon.
