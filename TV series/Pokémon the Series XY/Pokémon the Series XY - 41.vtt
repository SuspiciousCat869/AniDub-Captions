Professor Sycamore's Pokémon

summer camp is beginning

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:10.377
its sixth day and our heroes
have been battling Tierno

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:13.180
and his friends for entry
into the Summer Camp Hall of
Fame.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.116
With a rivalry both
friendly and fierce

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.819
the two teams are currently
tied for the lead

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:22.022
and to break that tie, it's
time for the final event

who gets into the Hall of Fame.

Everyone's so excited.

The Team Battle Competition
works like a tournament.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.497
As usual, the competing teams
that take the top three spots

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.532
will receive points.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.302
We have two teams tied for the
lead with 13 points.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:10.604
And those teams are
Team Froakie and Team Squirtle.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.873
This is our final camp event.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.309

A team battle consists of
several Trainers forming a team

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.919
and battling using
various types of formations.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.855
Now, today our team will be
made up of three Trainers

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.124
but it can be a five
or even a seven‐person team.

I've never had the chance.

a lot of Trainers get together.

Yeah, she's right.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.310

Pikachu will surely come
running to save them.

And if we use Squirtle
and its buddies as shields

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.602
Pikachu won't be able
to lay a paw on us.

Oh, dear.
Something's got to be wrong.

Just like it did before.

Man, are they good at that.

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.300

have them not knowing
what to do next.

but you can always
use that to get stronger.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.228
[OPTIMISTIC]/[EMPHATIC]

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:05.565
[HAPPY]

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:13.239
Oh! You were so awesome,
Squirtle.

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:15.541
[SAD]

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.478
Don't worry, Squirtle.
It's okay to cry.

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.079
Nice battling, Bulbasaur.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.615
[APPRECIATIVE]

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:24.917
We'll get you back next time.

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.019
‐ Okay, Ash?
‐ Okay.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.488
[EXCITED]

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.494
We've got
a great surprise for you

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.029
on our summer camp's
final night.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:39.098
These fireworks
will help us celebrate

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.067
our week of memories.
Marvelous.

00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:46.038
[all gasping]

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:00.119
[all gasp]

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.027
‐ Hey, Tierno?
‐ Hmm?

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.996
Thinking about our last battle.

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:11.397
Can you show me
your battle style again?

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:13.633
[SURPRISED]

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.902
You mean the way
it moves and grooves?

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.337
Uh‐huh, I've never seen
a battling style

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.039
like that before.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.707
If we can learn
how to battle like that

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.843
I think we'll be
a lot stronger.

00:17:23.843 --> 00:17:25.044
No doubt.

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:32.451
'See, I'm gonna be
challenging the Shalour Gym.'

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:34.787
I'm sure your battling style
would be really effective

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.389
at a Fighting‐type Gym
like Shalour.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.990
A Gym battle. I get it. Yeah.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.092
Why don't you show him?

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.795
Moving and grooving like
you do in battle is so cool.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.764
Not to mention a rhythmic
battling style like that

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:47.400
is really one of a kind.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.336
As far as I can see, by doing
those dance steps and constantly

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:52.471
moving around, it creates
such smooth transitions

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:53.773
between attacking and dodging.

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:55.875
That's right. See?

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.810
It started out when I was
thinking about how to make

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.112
moves flow better
when a Pokémon uses them

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:01.147
and I came up
with this way to do it.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:06.352
Incorporating dance steps
in our battle lets us read

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:08.454
our opponent's movements
and makes it easier for us

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.590
to make them battle
at our pace.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.892
‐ Oh, wow! Awesome!
‐ Oh, wow! Awesome!

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.627
And to tell the truth
I had Tierno

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:16.696
teach me
some dance moves as well.

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.898
I'm trying to use it
as part of my performance.

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.399
‐ You're kidding me.
‐ That's so cool.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.401
I want to see.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.537
Okay, Ash. I'll teach you
how to move and groove.

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:25.638
Thanks a lot, Tierno.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.976
Okay, everybody.
Come on out.

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:34.413
[APPEARING]

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.148
You've got to move it too.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.217
‐ What do you mean me?
‐ Yeah, you.

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.719
The most important thing
is for Trainer

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:42.221
and Pokémon to become one.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:44.156
It won't work unless you're
moving and grooving together.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.591
I guess.

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:47.660
[EXERTION]

00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.464
Huh! Yeah. Ready to rock.

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:55.868
First, the basics, okay?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.181
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
Campers.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.317
I hereby announce
that the official closing

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.687
of this season's Pokémon
summer camp is upon us.

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:16.489
Everyone. Give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.796
I sincerely hope
from the bottom of my heart

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:26.866
that the experience all of you
gained as you competed alongside

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:28.834
'your Pokémon
will be truly memorable'

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.469
'as well as invaluable.'

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.172
May your journeys
be rich and full.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.874
And keep traveling
onward and upward

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:35.875
along with your Pokémon.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.414
Hey, Ash,
make sure you work on

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:42.682
everything
I showed you last night.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.284
You bet.

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.687
I hope you follow through.
I'm a little worried.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.690
Come on. I'll be just fine.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.626
‐ I guess it's time to go.
‐ Yeah, you're right.

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:54.760
Though it's never
easy to say goodbye.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.134
Serena? See you
at the Pokémon Showcase.

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.903
‐ Okay.
‐ See you then.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.410
Of course
we're all rivals now.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.311
For sure.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:18.951
Later. Take care.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.555
Let's battle again soon.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:23.422
[JUBILANT]

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.860
NARRATOR And so, the
curtain comes down

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.595
on Professor Sycamore's

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.198
Pokémon Summer Camp,
where Trainers and their

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.200
Pokémon strengthened their
bonds by competing

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.368
and interacting
with others.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:39.138
Will Ash be able to use
Tierno's unique battling style

00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:41.907
to help him win his Gym
battle against Korrina?

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.143
The answer to come,
as the journey continues.

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:58.791
