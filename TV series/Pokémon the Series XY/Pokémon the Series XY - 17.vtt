[EXCITED]

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:57.811
[EXCITED]

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.347
[laughs]
I'm a ninja!

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:02.983
Awesome, Bonnie!
You really look the part!

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.017
Thanks!

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:15.295
The important thing about
Quick Attack is, of course

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.464
to be able to move quickly.

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:19.833
And to do that, one must develop
springy and flexible muscles

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.401
so the first thing
we need to do

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.503
is work on
strengthening your spring.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.606
Hm, I'd say it's time
for me to step up!

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:30.910
You'd better prepare yourselves
for this! Clemontic Gear, On!

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.180
I call this my Muscle Mass
Magnifying Machine!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.615
I thought we'd encounter
a situation

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.784
precisely like this one!

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:40.186
Uh, Okay. So you put
springs on your shoes.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.788
[SURPRISED]

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:44.457
Ah, but they're not
normal springs!

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:47.327
'The basis of all exercise
is increasing muscle strength.'

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.229
'The springs I've equipped
in these shoes'

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.164
'multiply the power
of your jumping'

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.400
by using your body weight
in the process!

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.602
Because of the added load
of your body weight

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.537
they strengthen your
leg muscles rapidly!

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.573
Wow. Science is so amazing!

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.042
Allow me to show you
how it works.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.410
[screams]

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.882
Well, he disappeared
really fast, no doubt!

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:09.749
[laughs]

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:14.788
Camouflage skill!
[SEARCHING]

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:16.189
[SEARCHING]

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:21.361
Training must proceed
step by step.

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.363
Frogadier,
please demonstrate for them

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:25.331
our basic training method.
[EXERTIONS]

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.705
So quick!

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.474
Alright, Froakie, do you think
you can keep up with Frogadier?

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:36.376
[AGREE]

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.079
There's no better time
for you to give it a try!

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.547
[EXERTIONS]

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.217
I am always one with my Pokémon.

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.151
Always!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.620
Yeah, me too!

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.622
Yeah, me too!

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.358
[EXERTIONS]

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.028
You're not jumping fast enough!
[grunting]

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:57.097
ASH
'Keep it up, Froakie!'

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.332
You're still jumping
too slowly!

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.400
How about this?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.768
[EXERTIONS]

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.470
Faster!

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.472
[YELL]

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.241
I can't do any more!

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.409
[WORRIED]

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.443
[WORRIED]

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.645
[grunting]

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.347
[EXERTIONS]

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.882
Excellent!

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.317
It looks like
Froakie's beginning

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.886
to move just
as fast as Frogadier is.

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.488
Keep up the pace,
you're getting there!

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.390
[EXERTIONS]

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.092
That was well done!
Time for the next step!

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:31.464
Ninja stealth skill.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.566
Next, we'll teach Froakie
to run over water.

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.702
‐ Huh?
‐ On water?

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:38.204
But running on water
is scientifically impossible.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.406
Nah, we can do it!

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.542
Alright, Frogadier
will show you how it's done.

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:43.743
[EXERTIONS]

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:48.615
[PLEASED]

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:52.218
I can't believe Frogadier
really ran on water.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.853
Froakie! Now
it's your turn to show 'em!

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.355
[EXERTIONS]

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:57.257
Froakie, you can do it!
[STRUGGLING]

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.192
Aah!

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.193
[LAUGHING]

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:02.462
[ANGRY]

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.831
Okay, now it's my turn!
[grunting]

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.032
Oh, no, Ash!

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.601
Are you okay?

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.905
[CONCERNED]
No good. Can't do it!

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.374
Naturally it's impossible
for me as well!

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:18.578
Huh? Why didn't you
tell me that?

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:20.380
The trick to being able
to run over water

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.749
is to make sure
you move your feet quickly.

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.285
Move your feet quickly.
Can you do that, Froakie?

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:26.486
[EXCITED]

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:28.922
Yeah, like that! Go!

[EXERTIONS]

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.766
Okay, try it again!
[EXERTIONS]

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.469
You can do it, Froakie!

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.673
[EXERTIONS]

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:49.142
Show 'em how it's done, Froakie!

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.952
Feeling frustrated?

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.054
Then use all that frustration
and get out there! Do it!

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.388
[EXERTION]

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:08.561

No, wait.
Team Rocket ninja Pokémon.

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:26.012
We'll put together a ninja
Pokémon posse and Froakie

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:27.180
and Frogadier will be the stars!

Okay, Sanpei, what kind
of training do we do next?

00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.236
Now let me think.

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.171
[stomach grumbling]

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.507
No! I'm as embarrassed
as I can be.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.743
That's nothing
a little lunch can't fix

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.544
and I'll take care
of the cooking!

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.814
‐ And I'll make the dessert.
‐ It's ninja lunchtime!

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.683
ALL
'Alright! Let's eat!

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:04.784
'Hey, thanks!'

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.658
Wow! This is great!
Delish! What is it?

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:13.860
You're eating fried noodles.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.229
It's now my favorite food!

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.230
I'd heard of it from
my friends in Ninja Village.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.498
It's so good!

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.001
Please try the cookies
I baked too!

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:27.907
This is the best cookie ever!

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:33.413
There's nothing like a nap
after a good meal.

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.914
For sure!

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:38.318
So Sanpei, that
Ninja Village you mentioned

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.385
is that your hometown?

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.689
That's right.

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:44.991
It's also the home
of my oldest brother, Ippei

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.193
who is by far the strongest
man in Ninja Village.

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.729
He's there with his Greninja.

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:51.297
Ash
Greninja?

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.299
SANPEI The final
evolution of Froakie.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.535
And there's my
other brother Nihei

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.236
who lives in Ninja Village
as well, with his Venusaur.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:02.508
So there's Ippei, there's
Nihei and there's Sanpei.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.680
My ultimate goal is to one day
defeat both of my brothers

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.615
and assume the title
of strongest ninja

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.751
in Ninja Village
once and for all.

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:13.119
So I guess
you left Ninja Village

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:14.787
so you could train, right?

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:17.557
SANPEI
'Exactly. What about you, Ash?'

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:19.692
I'm working hard to one day
become a Pokémon Master!

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:22.195
SANPEI
Oh.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.831
It's incredible how even though
your goals are different

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:27.800
you're both working as hard as
you can to realize your dreams.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.801
Sounds like you make
good rivals!

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:37.243
[EXCITED]

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:40.913

from tree branch to tree branch

in order to get the kind of
explosive power one needs

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:47.920
to execute an exceptional
Quick Attack.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.357
Alright then Ash and Froakie,
you follow Frogadier and me!

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.393
Froakie, this is where we
really need to step on the gas!

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.594

You'll go faster!

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.374
Once you get the hang of it,
you won't believe your speed!

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:12.945
Wow, Froakie!
You've gotten a lot faster!

with complete awareness of your

surroundings at all times!

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.469

Hear that? We're ready to go!

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.386
Alright, Frogadier,
show them how it's done.

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.121
Now use Quick Attack!

I get it.
