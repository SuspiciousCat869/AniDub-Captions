We had a few surprises,
didn't we?

Yeah, Team Squirtle ended up
with quite a catch.

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.967
And they did it
in a creative way.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.370
They earned every one
of those ten points.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.772
Today should be just as fun.

a marvelous day, indeed.

You can really taste
the ingredients.

I'm swelling with pride.

Ha! Even if we were to get fired
from Team Rocket.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.208
We'd still land on our feet.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.477
You just keep your eyes
on the prize.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:58.912
We're here to steal Pokémon
for the Boss.

It's perfect

I'm pretty sure some of you have

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.685
made Pokévision videos before.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.487
But just in case

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.523
it refers to making
a Pokémon promo video.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.026
I'd like to show you a video
that I made as an example.

conducting daily research
on Pokémon evolution.

The more we research

the more we find
in the world of Pokémon.

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.185
They're all
truly amazing.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.724

about the world of Pokémon

to make Poké Puffs.

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.587
And sometimes there will be
special theme programs

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:41.588
depending on
the specific competition.

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:49.262
The second one is called
General Freestyle Performance.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:53.767
See?

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:54.901
You have to use your Pokémon
skills to their fullest.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:55.869
And the Pokémon appears
on stage

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:56.870
along with its Trainer.

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.048
If you're good enough to win
three or more competitions

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:11.584
then you get to appear in
what's called the Master
Class.

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.853
And the Trainer who wins
there along with her Pokémon

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.655
gets to receive the title
of Kalos Queen.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.562
And who's the queen now?
It's none other than Aria!

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.131
Kalos Queen. Wow!

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.967
Doesn't that sound
totally amazing?

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.536
Mm‐hm. But it doesn't sound
like you battle.

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.671
That's right.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:34.240
Pokémon performance
demonstrates the partnership

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.342
between Pokémon and Trainer
in a completely different way

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.977
than having a battle.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:41.214
‐ You wanna be a performer?
‐ I sure do.

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:43.450
Right now,
I'm researching with style.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.685
I worked real hard
to enter the competition

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.621
and fulfill my dream!

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.723
Being Kalos Queen!

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.126
‐ Serena? Bonnie?
‐ Huh?

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.227
Sorry we're late.

00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:55.795
[HAPPY]

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.497
Are you ready to go?

00:09:57.497 --> 00:10:00.033
I'll be all ready
in just a sec.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.868
GROUP
Who's that Pokémon?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.508
It's Bulbasaur.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.953
‐ 'Time for location scouting.'
‐ 'Uh, what's that?'

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.554
Finding the best place
to shoot the video.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.022
ASH
Oh, right.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.027
CLEMONT
'I think we're getting pretty

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.696
far away from camp.'

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.098
If we go a little further

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.566
I think we might find
the perfect spot.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.737
Come on.

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.507
We're gonna end up spending
the whole day searching.

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:42.675
‐ Yeah. Maybe you're right.
‐ Now, what?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.981
Huh? There! How does that look?

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.050
It's the best place
I've seen so far

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.918
with all those flowers
blooming.

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:54.521
Wait, Serena!

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:57.123
I'll just have a quick look
and then we can start.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.958
[screaming]

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.797
‐ Ash!
‐ Serena!

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:16.009
‐ Ah. Ash, are you okay?
‐ Yeah, how about you?

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.411
I'm alright.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.747
[CONCERN]
Hey there, buddy.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:23.349
It's good to see you.
Here.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:26.886
Thank you very much, Ash.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.089
‐ Ah.
‐ Ash!

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.025
[CONCERN]

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.327
I must have twisted it
a little.

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:37.230
Hm. No big deal. I'm fine.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.632
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:43.069
‐ No, it's okay.
‐ 'Hey!'

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.805
Hey, Ash and Serena,
are you guys alright?

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.807
Yeah. Don't worry.
We're fine!

00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:49.709
[AGREEMENT]

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.612
No! Ash hurt his foot
and can't walk.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:55.915
Understood! Serena, you stay
there with Ash!

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.517
We'll go get help!

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.696
Ash, I feel so awful
about this.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.599
I'm fine.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:18.805
Okay. The swelling should go
down a bit now.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:21.941
That's nice of you, Serena.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.043
And thanks for worrying
about me so much too, Pikachu.

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:25.511
[HAPPY]

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.248
Pikachu is so awesome.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.451
Coming to find you because
it cares so much about you.

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:34.087
Pikachu and I have been
in a lot of tough spots together

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.689
that's for sure.
[AGREEMENT]

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.258
Long as we're a team,
we're fine.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.226
[AGREEMENT]

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.028
Okay, Fennekin,
come out.

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:44.497
[APPEARING]

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:47.166
[EXCITED]

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.868
We're always a team too.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.905
Hungry? Here you go.

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:54.974
[CONTENT]

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:04.384
‐ So they're both alright?
‐ Yeah.

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.320
Ash hurt his foot a bit,
but it sounded like he was okay.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.455
That's good.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.058
'We'll put together
a rescue team right away.'

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.594
Hope they're alright.
I'm worried.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.899
Of course, we still have
the Pokévision video to do.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.835
‐ Right.
‐ You know

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:25.471
we've done a lot of camp
and when I'm battling

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.607
I'll able to use it all.

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:30.143
Wow. Even the fishing contest?

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.312
That's gonna
help you battle too?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:36.349
Yeah, you bet. Nothing we ever
do is a waste of time.

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:39.485
Everything on our journey
leads to the Kalos League.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.387
'That's why the more stuff
we do, the better.'

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:45.692
You're always doing your best.

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:48.027
And you've done so much.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.762
ASH
'But I'm not done yet.'

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.631
After all, I've gotta
make my dream come true.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.702
And that dream is?

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:58.004
To become a Pokémon Master.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.306
Of course.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.874
You really
are an amazing person.

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:07.213
‐ Let me get some more water.
‐ Thanks.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.952
A dream. Having a dream.

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:16.189
Serena, are you okay?

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.396
Sometimes I wonder.

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.531
What is my dream, Ash?

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.533
What is it that I want?

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.268
Don't worry,
you've got lots of time

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.570
to figure out your dream.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.205
[ASSURE]

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.673
[HAPPY]

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.245
Fennekin.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.114
I'll bet you find your dream
together with Fennekin.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:43.049
[AGREEMENT]

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.518
Right?
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:47.487
I'll find my dream
with my Pokémon.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.992
‐ 'Hello!'
‐ Huh? Huh!

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:55.094
It sounds like
Professor Sycamore.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.162
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
There you are.

00:14:56.162 --> 00:14:57.497
Are you alright?

00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:59.599
'Yeah! We're fine!'

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.502
The rescue team's
on its way down now!

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:05.238
‐ Got it.
‐ Thanks, professor!

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.476
Well, we'll give those twerps
a bit of a break

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.245
just this one time.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.880
But nothing's changed.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.784
We've still got
our evil eyes on the prize.

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.953
We are here.
You can all rest easy now.

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.522
'You'll be back at camp
in a jiff!'

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.323
‐ Huh?
‐ Hey, thanks.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.061
'Sorry to put you through
all that.'

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.496
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
Fret not!

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.398
That was nice of you
to get us out.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:35.268
We really didn't mean
to cause any trouble, professor.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.803
I'm just glad
it was nothing serious.

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:45.778
It's beautiful!

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.681
[EXCITED]

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.982
Man, would you look
at this place.

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.151
[AWE]

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:56.355
And it was waiting for us
right off the main path.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.192
This is a great spot.
Time for Pokévision!

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:01.461
[EXCITED]
It's perfect.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.129
After all we've been through

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.764
we'll make the best
Pokévision video ever!

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.333
[all cheer]

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:12.305
[applause]

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.178
Alright. Now, for our next video
from Team Squirtle!

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.113
TREVOR
Hey! We're Team Squirtle.

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:23.583
Allow me to introduce
the tricked‐out trio

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:25.485
that's taken the Pokémon
summer camp by storm.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.089
TREVOR
The Super‐speed

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.424
Battling Charmander!

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.359
[EXERTION]

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.727
And when it comes
to Pokémon knowledge

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.195
I'm second to none,
Trevor!

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.397
[EXERTION]

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:39.432
TIERNO
Battling's all about moving

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.734
and grooving
for Squirtle.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.604
And with pro dancing
on my mind, I'm Tierno!

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:46.305
SHAUNA
No matter what's up

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.140
it's rock solid
and reliable Bulbasaur!

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.614
With dreams of being
a Pokémon performer

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:57.316
dancing in my head,
I'm Shauna!

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.285
Team Squirtle's always
on the prowl

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.053
for battling opponents!

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:03.256
Thank you all so very much.

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.590
We tried everything
we could do

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.058
to bring out the best
in our Pokémon.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.561
Thanks to all of you
for your support!

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:10.897
Wow, you were great,
Team Squirtle.

00:17:10.897 --> 00:17:13.533
Yeah, what an amazing
Pokévision video.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.968
‐ Next up, Team Froakie!
‐ Huh?

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.436
This is our last
Pokévision video.

00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:21.707
Don't you still have
work to do?

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.747
[thinking]
Presenting something

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.182
I made myself in front
of all these people?

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.450
I'm so nervous.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:40.826
SERENA ON TV
I'm Serena.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:43.162
And this is my partner,
Fennekin!

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.331
[HAPPY]

00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:47.333
Today, we're
having a picnic.

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.135
So I made a basket
of Poké Puffs.

00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:50.069
Fennekin loves them.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.238
[HAPPY]

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.907
What have I done?
I'm so sorry, Fennekin.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.643
'Somebody grab
the runaway Poké Puff!'

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.512
[EXERTION]

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:03.482
[EXERTION]

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.718
[EXCITED]

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:07.987
[PANIC]

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:11.157
[HAPPY]

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:13.526
'Oh, well.'

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:16.262
Here! I've got enough
for everyone!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.364
[HAPPY]

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:26.372
‐ Thank you so much, everybody.
‐ Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.543
Oh, wow.

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:33.079
So now that we've seen
everyone's video.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.414
I want you all
to pick the three videos

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:37.583
'you liked the most,
other than your own, of course.'

00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:45.257
The idea for using Poké Puffs
in our video

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:46.592
came from what
we went through today.

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.828
‐ Huh? No joke?
‐ Hm.

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:50.663
Nope.

00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:53.499
Today, Ash said there's nothing
we could ever do

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.700
that's a waste of time.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:58.604
That Ash
is a pretty smart guy.

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:04.644
You know,
it would be beyond amazing

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:07.313
if I could go and see
a Pokémon Showcase sometime.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.749
And see what
a Pokémon performer does too.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:11.317
‐ Then I'll go with you.
‐ Huh?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.184
Sure.

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.555
Come in, guys,
they're announcing the winners.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.190
[EXCITED]

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.292
Okay! Thanks!

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.360
Let's go.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.430
Thanks to your votes

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.932
we've decided on the top three
Pokévision videos.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:30.069
‐ And the third place goes to.
‐ Team Charmander!

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:32.538
Yay!
[indistinct chatter]

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.676
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
'You all did a great job

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.677
showcasing the unique beauty'

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.078
'of water types!'

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:40.246
And now, the second place team.

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:42.081
And that's Team Chikorita!

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:43.949
Yay!

00:19:45.885 --> 00:19:48.154
'You showed the elegance
of flying types'

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:49.522
'in a masterful way.'

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.328
Finally, we come
to the winning team.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.064
And the first place goes to..

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.837
'...Team Froakie!'

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:06.605
Yay!

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:08.240
[laughing]

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:13.713
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thanks so much.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.848
Guess that's the way it goes.

00:20:15.848 --> 00:20:18.217
It's possible we went
a little too battle‐crazy.

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:23.022
'But I don't mind losing to Ash
and his friends that much.'

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:25.224
The way you brought up
the unique character

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:29.528
of each Pokémon, that is what
put you over the top.

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.832
So then, all three winning teams
will be receiving points.

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:34.366
Congratulations.
You should be proud.

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:38.003
Great job today, everyone!

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.972
NARRATOR
Thanks to an unexpected

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.775
turn of events our heroes
have succeeded in making a
great

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:45.144
first‐place
Pokévision video.

00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:47.780
That means Team Froakie
and Team Squirtle

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.515
are tied with
the most points

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.317
as the summer camp
adventures continue.

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:58.457
