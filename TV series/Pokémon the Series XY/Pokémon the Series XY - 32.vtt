That's right. But back then,
it was still a Riolu.

have you done so far?

It was the first time.

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:18.818
That's true, but maybe there's
a reason it didn't listen.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.854
And that's because it couldn't
hear your voice at all.

Huh? Hear my voice?

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.067

After Lucario's Mega Evolution

its aura again caused
a loss of control.

And although Mega Lucario was
able to hear Korrina's voice

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.910
it was only for
a brief moment.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.880
But Korrina and Lucario
will search for a solution

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.448
as the journey continues.
