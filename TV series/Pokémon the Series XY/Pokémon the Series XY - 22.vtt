If it was solid gold

it simply wouldn't be

Wow!

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.335
Apparently, the giant
Golden Magikarp

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:50.870
has been spotted in this
same area several other times.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.706
Fascinating.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:55.442
You see, the mayor
is a very friendly man

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.144
so when I told him about
the legend, he installed

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.847
that Golden Magikarp statue
for the aquarium.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.149
My dream is to catch it
for the aquarium

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.584
so children will
have the opportunity

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.186
to see it up close.

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:07.654
That way, everyone will enjoy

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.990
the aquarium even more.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.625
After all, the purpose
of an aquarium is to educate

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.894
and entertain,
don't you think?

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.830
Sounds really awesome to me.

‐ We'll swim in success.

‐ Mmm.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.279

It originally lived
in the aquarium

so anyone who visited us here

could watch

But Clauncher didn't like
being looked at that way.

it was getting
