Use Flamethrower, now!
[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.108
It's getting warm in here!

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.577
[explosion]

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.212
[PAINED]

[groaning]

JESSIE
It's charbroiled!

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.725
Both sides are Mega Evolved.

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:07.126
But the machine got barbecued
in one shot!

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.634
Now, Pikachu, Electro Ball.

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.335
CLEMONT I'm sure your Pin
Missile will work now, Chespin.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.170
[READY]

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.873

[groans]

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.747
Sounds like it's makin' tea.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:32.985
Mega‐Mega Meowth's power core
took a direct hit.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.555
Is that the whistling sound
of impending doom?

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.790
If so, you know what's next.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.025
[explosion]

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:40.960
[screaming]

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.795
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
We're blasting off again!

WOBBUFFET
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.633
And don't come back.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:48.901
‐ We did it, Clemont.
‐ Yeah!

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.539
Mega Blaziken was awesome.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.140
PIKACHU
[EXCITED]

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.344
Chespin and Pikachu
were pretty awesome too.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.914
[CONFUSED]

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.583
You know what?

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.352
I think you deserve
a little reward.

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:08.287
Yummy macarons.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.188
[EXCITED]

Yay!

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:23.369
‐ For me?
‐ Thank you.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.137
‐ Thanks, Chespin.
‐ Be careful.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.339
CLEMONT Or there won't
be any left for you.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.674
[EXCITED]

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.344
[instrumental music]

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:33.212
MEYER It's good that
Clemont and Bonnie

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.648
are traveling
with Ash and company.

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:38.684
Strength isn't the only thing
Trainers needs for greatness.

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:41.220
Great Trainers also need
to forge an important

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.855
and lasting bond
with their Pokémon.

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:48.894
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE Thank you
so much for your help today.

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:51.263
Because of all of you,
I'm free again.

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.532
Yeah, but still.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:54.500
Your research lab's
messed up again.

00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:58.204
PIKACHU
[SAD]

00:18:58.204 --> 00:19:00.773
Not to worry.

00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:03.509
I'll have it all fixed by the
time you come to visit again.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:06.946
‐ We will, no doubt!
‐ Guess we'd better get going.

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:09.749
‐ Great to see you again.
‐ Big brother, excuse me.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:12.251
Hmm? Bonnie, is there
something wrong?

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.786
Look over there.
It's been watching us.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.455
CLEMONT
Chespin?

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:19.825
You were
a big help, Chespin.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.694
I'm sure that
we'll see you soon.

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:24.397
[URGENT]

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:25.164
Huh?

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:30.302
[SAD]

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:32.204
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE 'You know,
Clemont, it looks to me like'

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:35.574
Chespin wants to go with you.
Hm.

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.743
It's an amazing thing to watch
the likes of you and Ash

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:38.611
when you're together.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.413
Huh?

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:43.149
‐ 'Clemont?'
‐ Huh?

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:44.917
I wanna travel
with Chespin too.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:47.920
Please? Please? Please?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.755
[chuckles]
Is that okay?

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.223
Would you really let me bring
Chespin along with us?

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:53.292
Of course.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.595
After all,
that's what Chespin wants.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.764
I happen to have Chespin's
Poké Ball right here with me.

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.766
‐ It's yours.
‐ Hmm.

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:04.603
So, Professor Sycamore says

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:06.439
it's okay for you
to come along with us.

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:08.274
[OVERJOYED]

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:10.142
That's great. Now..

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.078
It's a pleasure to meet you
all over again.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.924
Yes! Today is a great day,
thanks to science!

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:27.493
‐ I caught a Chespin!
‐ Chespin's a keeper too!

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.430
Now, off to Cyllage City!

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.199
[EXCITED]

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:35.801
Take care, Professor Sycamore!
Bye.

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.837
‐ Bye bye!
‐ Huh?

00:20:37.837 --> 00:20:39.305
‐ Time for adventure!
‐ Goodbye!

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:41.841

NARRATOR Our heroes have
a new friend in Chespin.

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.644
Now, they're off
to Cyllage City

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.313
where Ash takes
his next step

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:48.647
towards entering
the Kalos League

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:50.416
as the journey continues.
