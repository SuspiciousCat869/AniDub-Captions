ASH BREAKING TITLES
AT THE CHATEAU!

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.291
When you have a battle
at the Battle Chateau

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.759
'the winning Trainer
earns something'

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.294
'though I'm not sure just what.'

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.129
That sounds cool!

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.597
Maybe you're awarded
some kind of badge!

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.933
Or a cake! I love cake!

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.301
[chuckling]

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.936
Now let's see..

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:11.872
Noble title, yo!

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.041
[EXCITED]

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.877
Who's that Pokémon?

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.882
Fletchinder, the Ember Pokémon

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.884
and the evolved form
of Fletchling.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.219
'Fletchinder flies
faster and faster'

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.255
'as the flame sac on its stomach
gradually heats up.'

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.957
[EXCITED]

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.959
The evolved form
of Fletchling, huh?

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.963
Yo, yo, yo! A Pokédex
in my face, not cool, bro!

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.899
Sorry about that.
So what's a noble title?

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.467
‐ Huh?
‐ Nico.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.735
He actually listened
to what you said.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:43.537
‐ Yo, yo!
‐ Yo, yo!

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.572
You're not
from around here, yo.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.875
Check out the legendary
Rivière Walk, yo.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.378
You should learn it
if you're gonna be here, yo!

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.214
‐ Uh..
‐ Do you think they're rapping?

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:58.018
‐ Huh?
‐ So noble title?

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.621
It's a real pain to explain, yo.

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.724
But we're heading
to the Battle Chateau now, yo!

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.193
Come with us and check it out
for yourself, yo!

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.261
Great! Let's all go together!

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.930
It'll be the perfect warm‐up

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.565
before I challenge
the Cyllage Gym!

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.400
[EXCITED]

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.902
Warm up? I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.305
It may be tougher
than you think!

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.741
You're gonna be floored
when you get there, yo!

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.809
By the way, I'm Ash and this
is my partner, Pikachu!

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.778
[EXCITED]

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm Clemont. It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.449
‐ And I'm Bonnie.
‐ Serena's my name.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.485
‐ Hi there.
‐ I'm Nico.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.920
And my partner is Fletchinder.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.390
And I'm Chester.
My partner is Fletchling, yo.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.663
So today's the first time
you challenge

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:43.964
the Battle Chateau, Chester?

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:46.433
Uh‐huh. It sure is.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.202
I already have
a Battle‐Chateau title.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.304
My brother's gotten
really good at battling

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.074
so I figured
it's time for his debut.

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.976
[sighs]
They're finally
not talking weird.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.811
‐ Yo! There it is, yo!
‐ Um..

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.115
ASH
'Wow! Check it out!'

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.184
[EXCITED]
It's gorgeous!

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.224
Huh? What's written up there?

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.026
"Battle Chateau. Show
your strength with a title."

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:13.960
Hm.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.732
[all gasping]

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.133
Beautiful!

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.272
Hello, Baron Nico.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:28.341
The Battle Chateau welcomes you
with open arms.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.776
Baron?
[CONFUSED]

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.347
I brought my brother
along with me today.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.516
He'd like
to have his debut battle.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.585
I'm Chester.
Very pleased to meet you.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.721
I'd like to have a battle, too!

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.323
‐ Oh. And you're?
‐ I'm Ash.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.158
And I come from Pallet Town
in the Kanto region.

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.993
[EXCITED]

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:50.497
Well, well.
It's the honorable Baron Nico.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.233
It's a pleasure to see
your brother make his debut.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.102
‐ Thank you.
‐ This is the Chateau owner.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.971
‐ Duke Turner.
‐ Pleased to meet you.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.773
It is my honor
to welcome a guest

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.508
who traveled all the way
from the Kanto region.

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.214
Our Chateau provides
a fulfilling battle experience

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:09.516
and serves as a meeting place
for all the many Trainers

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.084
'who visit here.'

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.420
Ash, this place
sounds perfect for you!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.189
Yeah!
Now, the first thing to know

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.624
is all Trainers
at the Battle Chateau

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.259
are referred to as knights.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.794
CLEMONT
Knights?

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.462
What an appropriate title
for Trainers

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.764
battling at a castle!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.233
[chuckles]
True.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.935
Then each and every knight has
a noble title bestowed upon them

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.570
that is based on the grand total

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.539
of their
Battle‐Chateau victories.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.141
I wish you the best of luck

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.344
in earning your highest possible
noble title.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:40.480
Allow me to show you
the Battle‐Chateau sitting room.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.315
Each time you visit here,
this is where

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.850
you'll be choosing
a battling adversary.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.420
Wow!
[AMAZED]

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.923
[indistinct chatter]

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the distinct honor

00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:00.100
to present Baron Nico.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.234
‐ Hm?
‐ Hm?

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.336
‐ Hm.
‐ Hm.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:07.340
‐ Wow!
‐ So everybody here is a knight?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.976
Right, this is a great place
to hang out with other Trainers

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.879
trade stories and information,
and also look for an opponent.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.781
Yeah! So you battle
who you want?

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.983
Not exactly. There's a catch.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.718
You have to be
the same noble title.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.987
[SURPRISED]/[EXCITED]

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:24.925
Huh? What's that guy
doing up there?

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.861
‐ Uh..
‐ Wow, who is he, anyway?

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:29.596
Oh, yeah, that guy's name
is Grant.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.865
He's always climbing walls.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.301
‐ Yeah, he's really strong.
‐ Strong, huh?

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.707
Any barons here
who would be willing to accept

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.108
a battle challenge from me?

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:44.845
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.418
I'll accept your challenge.

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:54.554
My name is Baron Farrell.
How do you do?

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.623
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:58.024
I'm looking forward
to our battle.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.564
Alright, Nico and Farrell

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:05.799
please proceed
to the battlefield.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.303
'All other knights
may watch the battle'

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:11.671
'from the outside terrace.'

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.410
[all gasping]

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.647
Huh?

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:22.582
Huh?

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.554
[chuckles]

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.359
Hey, that's Ash.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.093
[chuckles]

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.431
‐ Check out the capes!
‐ So cool!

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.700
‐ 'It's a tradition.'
‐ Huh?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.570
The atmosphere here is quite
different from a Pokémon Gym.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.373
True, the Battle Chateau
was founded

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:48.441
on the principles
of a knights' duel.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.911
The aim is to elevate
Pokémon battles

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.713
through the spirit
of chivalry.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.049
It became much more
than two powerful Trainers

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.984
simply battling along
with their greatest Pokémon

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.653
'in a clash of moves.'

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:01.721
'A battle culture
that held civility'

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.524
'in high regard was born.'

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.761
Nowadays Gym battles
have become the mainstream

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.031
but many people enjoy
the Battle Chateau

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.501
as something they can only
experience in the Kalos region.

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:16.836
Wearing those capes
is so awesome!

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.906
Yeah. White capes
are worn only by barons.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:22.876
So how many noble titles
are there?

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:26.179
[chuckles]
Baron is the first
noble title.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.549
Then there's viscount.
Earl is number three.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.252
Then there's marquis.
Number five is duke.

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:34.321
And the highest title
is grand duke!

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:35.188
‐ Wow, that's a lot!
‐ Huh!

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:41.428
‐ To a good battle!
‐ To a good battle.

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.763
The Pokémon battle
between Baron Nico

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.632
and Baron Farrell
is about to commence.

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.534
If Baron Nico is victorious

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.170
'that will be his tenth victory'

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.872
'allowing him to ascend
to the noble title of viscount.'

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.041
May you both battle with spirit

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.477
while observing
the knight's code of chivalry.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.045
Fletchinder, come on out!

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.281
[APPEARING]

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.149
Dusknoir, let's go!

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.951
[APPEARING]

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.420
Oh, they're so cute!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.589
‐ A Dusknoir!
‐ Wow, I've never seen one.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.294
Dusknoir, the Gripper Pokémon.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.229
'Dusknoir is said
to travel between'

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.797
'the human and spirit worlds.'

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.933
Nico will win.

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.835
His Fletchinder
is super‐powerful!

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:24.604
Use Thunder Punch!

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.073
[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE]
Use Flame Charge, go!

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.009
[FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.511
It's gone!

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.681
[EXERTION]

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:38.084
[THUNDER PUNCH MOVE]
Fletchinder's hit!

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:41.221
Ghost types are so scary!
They can disappear and reappear!

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:43.356
Electric‐type moves
are super‐effective

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.427
against Flying types!
[FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.665
‐ Wow, look at Fletchinder go!
‐ Awesome!

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.001
[FLAME CHARGE MOVE]
[PAINED]

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:59.272
That Flame Charge was powerful!

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.341
Right, Nico and Fletchinder

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.843
trained really hard
for this battle.

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:06.246
‐ Yoo‐hoo?
‐ Huh? Viola?

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.815
[EXCITED]
Hey there, Ash! Wow.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.683
Who would have thought
I'd be running into you?

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.186
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ I love the Chateau.

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:15.755
Actually, I have
the noble title of duchess.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.658
‐ Duchess?
‐ It's the second‐highest title.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.928
See, it's the female
equivalent of duke.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.731
Oh, wow. So you must've won a
lot of battles to be a duchess.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.966
[PAINED]

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:27.567
ELISE
That's it!

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.905
And Fletchinder
is the winning Pokémon!

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:32.839
[AGREEMENT]

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:40.580
‐ Alright, Nico won!
‐ That Fletchinder is strong!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.217
Now that Nico has ten victories,
his noble title will change.

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.919
He goes from the noble
title of baron

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.387
to the title of viscount.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:48.721
TURNER
Excellent!

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.523
We applaud the two
gifted knights

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:52.759
and their Pokémon
for their valiant battle.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.294
‐ Argh!
‐ What was that?

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:55.695
[CURIOUS]

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.198
Huh? Not again.

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:01.734
Grant, once more?

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:04.704
I'm afraid I just
couldn't help but applaud.

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:07.307
It was to show my respect
for such a brilliant battle.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:09.809
But, Grant, if you felt that way

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:12.378
why didn't you come down first?

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.115
Because the wall
refuses to let me go.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:18.084
The walls here are so smooth,
they're irresistible.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:20.854
They draw me to them.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:23.456
You do see the delicate beauty
of the Battle Chateau's walls

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.158
don't you, Viola?

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:27.193
Talk about their beauty
all you want

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.729
but I'll never understand
the appeal of walls.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.999
‐ So you know this guy, Viola?
‐ His name is Grant.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.034
He's never seen a wall
around here he didn't love.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.370
Also, he's strong.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.672
[chuckles]
They told me the rules.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.107
I'd like to battle you,
so I was wondering

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:43.109
what your title is.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.612
My noble title is duke.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.981
Duke is the second‐highest title
you can get!

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.682
‐ 'Now then..'
‐ Huh?

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.951
Let us proceed
to the debut battle

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:53.920
involving the two knights
who have come here

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.523
‐ for the first time today.
‐ New knights?

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.292
Yeah. Turner's talking about us.

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:00.493
[chuckles]

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.929
[EXCITED]

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.597
GROUP
Who's that Pokémon?

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:11.371
GROUP
It's Fletchinder!

00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.605
[EXERTION]

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:21.147
Please give the knights
who are about to have

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:23.449
their first battle at the Battle
Chateau a round of applause.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:26.953
[cheering]

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:30.023
So you say you've battled
against Ash before.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.358
He's a gutsy Trainer,
that's for sure

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.428
as are his Pokémon.
They're quite amazing.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.063
Once you see
his passion and drive

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.732
'I'm sure you'll agree.'

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.468
Ash and Chester,
whoever wins this first battle

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:45.205
will then be awarded
the noble title of baron.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.639
‐ Right!
‐ Well, I've been training

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.541
long and hard for this day.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.845
‐ I'm gonna win!
‐ Then let's get underway.

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:55.982
‐ To a good battle.
‐ Oh, yeah, to a good battle.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:05.558
Okay, Pikachu, get in there!
[AGREEMENT]

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.961
Hold on.
What was in Ash's Poké Ball?

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:10.763
You see,
that's Pikachu's Poké Ball.

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.766
Pikachu doesn't like being
inside it, so it stays out.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.635
‐ Yeah?
‐ This is our first battle here.

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.237
I want to win it with you!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.738
[AGREEMENT]

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.307
And my Pokémon, it's Fletchling!

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.442
[APPEARING]

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.111
[EXERTION]

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.550
Fletchling's a Flying type!

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.453
We've been training right
alongside Nico's Fletchinder.

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:35.455
It'll be able to take
anything you try.

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:37.724
Now let the battle begin!

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.592
Alright! Use Thunderbolt!

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.693
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:42.495
Agility!

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.197
[AGILITY MOVE]

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:48.234
You won't get away!
Use Electro Ball!

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:50.970
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.972
‐ Ash is starting off strong.
‐ Perhaps.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.841
Although Flying‐type Pokémon

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:57.277
are weak against
Electric‐type moves

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.812
it doesn't mean anything
if those moves don't connect.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.214
Strength can only take you
so far.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.783
[EXERTION]

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.151
Use Feather Dance!

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:07.320
[FEATHER DANCE MOVE]

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.056
[CONFUSED]

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:11.891
What's going on?

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.560
We've just lowered
Pikachu's attack power!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.130
Now, Steel Wing!
[STEEL WING MOVE]

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.931
We won't lose!
Iron Tail, let's go!

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:23.102
[AGREEMENT]
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:25.905
Pikachu's Iron Tail
is weaker than it normally is.

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.408
Feather Dance
is an amazing move.

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:32.111
‐ Ash and Pikachu, do it!
‐ Fletchling, use Steel Wing!

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.314
Use Iron Tail one more time!
[AGREEMENT]

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.550
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.986
But Pikachu's
attack power is down!

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.854
If one hit isn't enough,
we'll just hit a bunch of times!

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.022
Huh.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:45.191
[PAINED]

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.759
You know, you were right
about Ash's strength.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.728
See?

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:50.897
With the strength
to deal with adversity

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:52.899
looks like this battle's
already over.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.834
Now check out
Pikachu's Thunderbolt!

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.503

[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.305

Oh, no!

[PAINED]

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:06.245
That's it!

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.614
'And Pikachu
is the winning Pokémon!'

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:09.315
[chuckling]

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.120
ASH/CHESTER
Thank you very much!

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.822
[EXCITED]

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:19.525
I knew you'd win it, Pikachu!
[EXCITED]

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.094
You were strong, too,
Fletchling.

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:23.429
Thanks for working so hard!

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.898
‐ Chester lost.
‐ There's always next time.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.601
Yeah. He'll just
have to train with me more.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:31.504
Today's loss is tomorrow's win!

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.474
And now I am pleased
to announce that Ash

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:37.377
from Pallet Town is awarded
the noble title of baron.

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.812
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Ha!

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.247
I'm a baron now.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.750
[EXCITED]

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.885
Bummer I lost,
but congratulations!

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.719
Hm.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:52.992
VIOLA
'A picture to mark

your first victory here.'

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.029
‐ Now smile.
‐ Huh?

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.132
[CURIOUS]
A white glove?

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:01.234
Someone's challenging you!

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.102
I was wondering
when he'd finally ask me.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.373
Hi, Grant.

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:10.209
Duchess Viola, I would like
to challenge you to a battle.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.879
And I accept.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.123
‐ To a good battle.
‐ To a good battle.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.127
Everybody out!

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:30.997
[AGREEMENT]

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:33.399
Hey, Ash, I didn't know
you had a Fletchling, too.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:36.035
Yeah. Everybody,
let's cheer for Viola!

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:39.338

The Chateau Pokémon battle

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:41.874
between Duchess Viola and
Duke Grant will now commence.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.377
Both only need
but one more victory

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:46.412
so whoever wins this battle

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:50.049
'will ascend to become
grand duke or grand duchess'

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.885
'the highest
noble title possible.'

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:56.322
Alright, Surskit, let's go!

Onix! That's a Rock type!

I thought you'd be using
that strategy.

one of your specialties

What's going on
with that Rock Tomb?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.876
It's controlling the boulders!

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:51.577
Grant must've trained hard
to do that.

no ordinary Trainer.

Surskit, you were wonderful.
