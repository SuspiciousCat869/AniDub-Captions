Our heroes are on their way

[EATING]

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.816
Bonnie, it isn't a good idea
to give Dedenne

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.417
so many snacks at once.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.153
Huh? Why isn't it?

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.123
Because when mealtime rolls
around, it won't be hungry.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.659
'Pokémon food is specially
formulated to give Pokémon'

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.561
'a healthy, well‐balanced diet.'

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.162
So it's better to eat
at a specific time

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.465
on a regular basis.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.234
So I guess it's better not to
give Dedenne any snacks at all.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.571
Huh? At all?

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.707
Hold on, I'm sure
a little bit is okay.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.544
He's right.
I give Pikachu snacks

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.312
but when it's time to eat a meal
both of us are always hungry!

[AGREE]

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.081
Well, that's
because the two of you

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.551
like to eat a ton of food.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.453
You sure know a lot about
Pokémon, don't you, Clemont?

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.557
Sure he does! Remember,
he's the Lumiose Gym Leader.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:57.658
Although he doesn't
look like it!

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.160
Doesn't look like it?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.529
There's a lot more I need
to learn about being a Trainer.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.531

Right!

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.568
Part of being a good Trainer

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.736
is managing
your Pokémon's health.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.246

'Huh? Is that you, Lena?'

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:50.236
What do you know?
I had no idea you were in town.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.305
I was just on my way
to challenge my next Gym.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.507
Oh. Which one is that?

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.843
I'm headed
to the Cyllage City Gym.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:58.812
‐ Cyllage City Gym, huh?
‐ Pichu, are you awake?

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.514
[SURPRISE]

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.717
Huh? You aren't Pichu!

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:06.586
[CONFUSED]

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.254
‐ I'm so glad you're doing well.
‐ 'You too, Lena!'

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:12.192
Well, I guess it's time I get
going.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.893
‐ Okay.
‐ And let's have another battle

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.128
again sometime, okay?

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:16.763
‐ See you later!
‐ Sure!

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.046

I was supposed to take care
of Pichu for Lena.

What should I do?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.192

Have you seen a little girl

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.228

We're going to lose him!

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:11.785
We need to talk to that girl
with the ribbon!

‐ Oh no.
‐ I'm sorry.

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:42.115
We confused you
with someone else.

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.249
It's quite alright.

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:49.055
I really thought we found her.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:51.558
It feels like we've looked
everywhere around here.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:53.693
Maybe she didn't come this way.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.628
Nurse Joy said she was
with her older sister

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.363
who's a Trainer, so they might

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.265
already be on their way
to the next town.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.535
They can't! What about Dedenne?

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.871
It's possible the little girl
hasn't even noticed

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:07.674
she took the wrong bag yet.
I'm certain she'll come back

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.809
when she discovers
what happened.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:12.412
Don't forget Nurse Joy told us
she'd let us know

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:14.280
when the little girl comes back
so we should be okay.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.082
She's right!

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.851
There's no way they'd go
somewhere else and leave their

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:20.787
cute little Pichu behind!

We'll get you safely back
to your Trainer for sure!

I can't figure out how something
like this could've happened.

Do you have any idea what
happened to your Trainer?

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:48.515
[gasps]
Oh, no!

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.483
I don't see that little one
anywhere!

There it is! Hey!

I get it.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.195
You want to have a donut,
don't you?

[EXCITED]

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:04.497
I like donuts too!

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.037
Excuse me!
May I get a donut please?

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.106
I was wondering if you've seen a
little girl

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:14.507
with a red ribbon in her hair.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.375
No. Sorry.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.512
Okay, thanks.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.449
[gasps]
Thanks!

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:26.085
Hey, a woman told me
she saw a little girl

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.220
with a ribbon in her hair
in the park.

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.857
Here!

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:55.215
Now stay still while I put this
on you, okay?

[AGREE]

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.387

[CURIOUS]

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.626
You see? Now we're a match!

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.165
Pichu's really cute and I care
about it a whole bunch

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:13.933
but I like you too.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.235
Want to come home with me?

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.936
[CONFUSED]

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.772
Wait, I'm sure
your Trainer's got to be

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.843
looking for you right now.
Really worried, too! Hey!

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:26.079
If I go back to the Pokémon
Center and bring you with me

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.414
maybe I'll find Pichu there.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.015
Let's go back!

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.457
This is it.
The woman said she saw

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:38.992
the little girl
right around here.

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:41.527
Looks like she already left.

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:46.065
I'm afraid at this rate,
we'll never be able to find her.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:49.869
I just thought of something,
but I need some time.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.237
It sounds like
you've got an idea.

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.606
Yeah.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:53.773
There's something I want to try
that just might do the trick!

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.482
I wonder if Pichu's Trainer
noticed what happened yet.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.017
I sure hope
we can find Dedenne soon!

It's the Radio Wave
Amplification Device!

00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:49.222
Radio wave?

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.356

Allow me to explain!

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:59.332
If you recall, Dedenne is
able to sense Pikachu's
electricity.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:01.768
This converts Pikachu's
electricity into radio waves

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.102
and amplifies them.

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.937
If we broadcast those waves

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:06.639
Dedenne should be
able to sense them!

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.641

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:58.451
Yes, I am. My name's Lena.

00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:00.319
Were you the ones
who found Pichu?

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.889
I'm not sure if found
is the right word.

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:05.491
‐ Dedenne! Where's Dedenne?
‐ Huh?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.567
Dedenne. It's probably
with Lyn, my little sister.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.736
ASH
'Well, okay. Where is she?'

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:19.972
Honestly. I don't know!

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.208
So what happened?

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.777
Lyn probably realized she had
the wrong bag.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:26.646
I would think she's looking
for Pichu now.

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:29.615
I see.
But you don't know where, right?

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:32.952
I don't. I've been looking
for her everywhere I can think!

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:35.354
For all I know,
she might have left town.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:38.157
We've got to get moving
and find her right away!

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:39.825
Right!
I think we should all split up

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:41.994
and search the widest area
we can!

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.696
Yeah! Let's give it
all we've got!

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.598
[EXCITED]

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:48.568
Where are you going?
Slow down, please?

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.335
[gasps]

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:52.305
I think the Pokémon Center's
that way!

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.582
Now where are we?

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:18.965
Huh?

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:21.834
‐ Hey, there you are!
‐ Ne ne ne ne ne ne ne.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.777
[THUNDER SHOCK MOVE]

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.051
Awesome!
You're really, really strong!

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.187
[PROUD]

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:42.188
Huh?

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.461
They're chasing after us!
What are we gonna do?

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.665
Oh, no!

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.073
Lyn!

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:04.076
It's Lena!

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.683
‐ Lyn, are you okay?
‐ This Pokémon saved me.

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:12.385
I can't believe that you came

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:15.187
‐ all this way by yourself!
‐ I'm sorry.

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:16.188
Hi, Pichu!

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.362
‐ Pikachu!
‐ Ready, Dedenne?

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:26.265
‐ Alright, use Thunderbolt!
‐ Use Thunder Shock!

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:28.467
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]
[THUNDER SHOCK MOVE]

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:38.010
Yes! We did it!

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.145
Yay, Dedenne!

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.058
‐ I'm sorry!
‐ Now, everything's alright.

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:53.526
I'm so glad that you're safe.

00:19:57.997 --> 00:20:00.366
Dedenne, I'm so sorry!

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:09.008
[stomach rumbling]
Uh, oh.

00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:10.710
I guess, I'm sorry too.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.344
[CONFUSED]
Oh, Ash.

00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:23.422
All ready! Dig in, everyone!

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:26.292
‐ It looks delicious!
‐ Thank you!

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.527
Dedenne? Pichu?
Aren't you going to eat?

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.429
[CONTENT]

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.198
[CONTENT]

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.266
Stop right there, Lyn.

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:35.901
Have you been giving out
snacks again?

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.570
Bonnie! I told you!

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.143
NARRATOR
Happily, Dedenne

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.879
is back with Bonnie and
Pichu is back with Lyn!

00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:49.715
Another step in two young
girls' journey to one day

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.118
become Trainers, as our
heroes' journey continues!
