on the battlefield

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.492
‐ Yeah, weren't they? Let's go.
‐ Pikachu.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.563
Okay, Ash, I'm going
to tuck Bonnie into bed.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.932
Right! Thanks for staying up
so late and helping me out.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.301
Concentrate and speed up.

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:24.404
[AMUSED]

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:27.040
Well, we all worked
on everything we could.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.876
All that's left is to battle
Viola as hard as we can.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.344
So let's give it all we've got!

It's amazing how hard Trainers
and their Pokémon work.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.386
It takes an awful
lot of time and effort

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.354
to earn yourself a Gym badge,
doesn't it?

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.990
You'll be training like this
in no time.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.259
Soon you're gonna hit the road
and catch some more Pokémon

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.595
so you can challenge
the Pokémon Gyms, right?

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:51.431
I guess so,
I know I have Fennekin

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.300
but I'm not sure
what my next step will be.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.803
Got ya. So, take your time
and you'll know what to do.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.424
‐ I heard you.
‐ Hm?

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.125
When you and Ash
were having your talk.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:22.062
He needed some inspiration.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:25.131
But I didn't think
it was gonna come from you.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.934
Each side will have
the use of two Pokémon

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.803
and the battle will be over
when either Trainer's Pokémon

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:32.305
are unable to continue.

may substitute Pokémon.'

VIOLA You can't take a picture
without pressing the shutter

Pikachu really nailed it.
[IMPRESSED]

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:53.720
Iron Tail isn't that effective
against Surskit

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.788
but considering
how Pikachu wasn't able

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.490
to land an attack
at all last time

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.425

It's just like the last battle.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.466
The difference is Ash trained
really hard for this one.

Can you get up, Pikachu?

00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.749
of the battle with Surskit.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.185
If this drags on, it could be
at a real disadvantage.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.420
[DETERMINED]

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.989
Pikachu can't beat
my Vivillon in that state.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.325
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to wait longer for your badge.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.127
Yeah, well,
there's no way we're giving up!

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.962
That's not what we're about!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.297
We'll keep battling
right up until the very end!

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.700
Don't give up till it's over.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.671
I admire your persistence.

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:14.173
But this is the end.
Gust, one more time!

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.410
[GUST MOVE]/[EFFORT]

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.479
Pikachu! Iron Tail, let's go!

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:22.114
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.819
‐ Ah!
‐ It's using Iron Tail!

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.121
Another great way to stay put.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:32.758
‐ Pikachu is so cool!
‐ 'Pretty clever.'

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:35.261
But you just made it
even easier for me to focus.

00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:36.963
Vivillon, use Solar Beam!

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.865
[SOLAR BEAM MOVE]

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.435
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:44.971
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.610
[grunting]

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.379
Vivillon, Sleep Powder!
[SLEEP POWDER MOVE]

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:56.415
[ALARMED]
[PAINED]/[DAZED]

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.319
‐ Pikachu!
‐ Oh!

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.455
So, here we are.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.690
It's my chance to take
a great last picture.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.860
Pikachu! Ash!
You've got to hang in there.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.329
Let's finish this up,
Solar Beam!

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.965
[SOLAR BEAM MOVE]
Pikachu! Wake up!

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.434
[EFFORT]

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.803
Remember your training
from yesterday!

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:20.373
Ah! Pikachu!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.442
'Use Electro Ball on yourself!'
EXERTION]

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:25.778
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:26.979
[SURPRISED]

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.414
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.355
Aah!

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.990
[DETERMINED]

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.627
‐ Alright!
‐ Alright!

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:44.697
It neutralized Sleep Powder with
an Electric‐type move on itself.

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:46.566
[chuckles]
That's so very, very Ash.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.134
Vivillon, Solar Beam!

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.603
[SOLAR BEAM MOVE]

00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:52.605
We're all with you, so put
everything into this move!

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:53.940
Use Electro Ball!

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.442
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.714
[SURPRISED]
Vivillon, no!

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:04.250
[WORRIED]/[PAINED]

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:11.691
‐ Come on, Vivillon, be strong!
‐ Uh‐oh!

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:14.060
Vivillon's flying kind
of weird all of a sudden.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.597
Look at its wing,
it's covered with ice.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.467
‐ No. How can this be?
‐ Pikachu! Now, use Thunderbolt!

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.970
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.874
[PAINED]

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:35.147
Vivillon, no!
[STUNNED]

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.916
WOMAN #1
'Vivillon is unable to battle!'

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.951
Pikachu wins,
which means the winner

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.453
of the match is Ash!

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:41.854
Alright!

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.522
[EXCITED]

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.958
[laughs]
We did it, Pikachu!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.562
‐ Ash!
‐ Ash, that was amazing!

00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:52.832
Happy, happy, Bonnie!
Way to go, Ash.

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.934
‐ You were great!
‐ Hey, thanks.

00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:57.436
And I couldn't have done it
without help from you guys.

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.272
Ash, I had nothing to do
with your win and you know it.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.274
Nah, your invention
gave me the idea.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.542
Huh?

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.715
You mean, my invention's
failure gave you the idea

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:12.451
of Pikachu using
Electro Ball on itself?

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:14.954
Yup, and that's why this victory
doesn't just belong to me.

00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:16.255
It's all of ours!

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:18.958
[EMPHATIC]

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.960
Thank you, Vivillon,
for a great battle.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.562
What did I tell you about Ash?

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.899
[chuckles]
Yeah, you knew it all along.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:30.169
‐ Ash?
‐ Hey, Viola.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.171
Congratulations,
this is to prove you won

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.173
your Gym battle against me.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.409
‐ 'The Bug Badge.'
‐ 'Thanks so much!'

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.946
Alright!
I just got the Bug Badge!

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:42.381
[PROUD]

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.690
VIOLA 'There are some
things you can only see'

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.125
when looking through
a camera's viewfinder.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.661
And things you'll only see
clearly by living together

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.930
with Pokémon, keep strengthening
the bonds you share

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.765
with your Pokémon
and good luck!

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.468
Thanks.
[THANKFUL]

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:05.971
Ash, I imagine you're heading
to your next Pokémon Gym battle.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:08.374
In that case, how about
the Gym in Cyllage City?

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.844
Cyllage City Gym?
That sounds great.

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:14.413
[EXCITED]/[SURPRISED]
You take care, Helioptile.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.115
[WARM]

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.185
CLEMONT
Okay then, we're gonna head out!

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:20.186
Thanks again.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:22.154
[THANKFUL]

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:25.791
‐ Bye, bye!
‐ Viola, Alexa, Helioptile, bye!

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.293
[WARM]

00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:33.766
I'll be seeing
you all again really soon.

00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:36.702
NARRATOR And so, after two
hard‐fought battles against

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:40.272
Gym Leader Viola, Ash has
received the Bug Badge.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.508
Now, our heroes set off
to the Cyllage City Gym

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:44.310
as the journey continues.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.848
So Serena, where are you
headed off to from here?

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:50.616
Uh, me?

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:58.124
