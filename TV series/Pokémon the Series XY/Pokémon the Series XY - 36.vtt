out of the ordinary inside?

Wow. These crystals
are like big mirrors.

Wow. Incredible.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.048
These aren't normal,
run‐of‐the‐mill crystals.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.250
Their highly reflective surfaces

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.052
really do act
just like a mirror does.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.820
Isn't it great?

Huh? What do you mean?

Dead end? How many times
have we gone around?

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.166
It's like a maze in here.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.203
So I guess we should've made
that turn back there after all.

Let's go back.

I think it's this way.

Not again.

‐ Huh?
‐ Hello? Hey, Ash?

‐ 'Over here.'
‐ Here, where?

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:38.592
Another dead end.
I guess we'd better go back.

Ash, we've been searching
all over for you.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.148
Huh? Awesome!

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.950
I can't believe
how fast you've gotten, Clemont.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.651
Now, what do you mean?

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.854
I've always been
the fastest runner.

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.323
‐ I'm really good.
‐ You're kidding me.

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:18.625
Never mind that. So where's
that Pikachu of yours?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.994
Oh, yeah, now, get this.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.996
Another me popped out
from inside the mirror

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.499
then grabbed Pikachu
and ran off.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.967
[laughing]
What are you talking about?

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.468
Was it a dream perchance?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.936
I was awake!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.805
So I jumped into the mirror

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:33.940
and took off after the Ash
who grabbed Pikachu

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.375
and that's when I wound up here.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.645
Hm..

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:42.215
Hm, you are different than
the normal crybaby Ash I know.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.251
‐ Me? Crybaby?
‐ Huh?

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.520
So maybe the culprit is..

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.790
BOTH
Our crybaby Ash?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.892
Come to think of it,
there is a legend.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.494
‐ A legend?
‐ Correct.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.062
There's a famous legend
about the cave

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:59.232
that lies right up ahead!

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.235
You see, the legend states
for every crystal mirror

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.971
in the cave,
there exists an alternate world.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.740
An alternate world
for every mirror?

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.475
Right!

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.243
And there's one more
important point

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.244
but I can't remember it.

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.314
Sounds stupid.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.616
Regardless, the Ash standing
right here in front of us

'is not the Ash we know.'

You know, as weird
as it's gonna sound

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.357
I've got to admit
that the three of you aren't

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.294
the Serena, Clemont and Bonnie
I know either.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:30.897
Hold on. I'm the only me and
anyone who isn't me is not me!

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:33.466
Now, what in the world
did I just say?

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.036
Whatever! Here's the deal.

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:38.038
If you can beat me in a battle
then I'll have to believe you.

Uh..

‐ Okay. You're on.
‐ Huh!

I got lost.

I hope you'll consider
continuing our journey together.

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:49.649
‐ Will you?
‐ Mm‐hm.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.951
Ash, that's awesome.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.319
Don't forget,
I owe it all to you.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.625
Let's head on over
to the Pokémon Center.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.160
'It's gonna be dark soon.'

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.332
"Dark soon."
Huh. How could I forget?

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.468
According to the legend

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.902
people who come
from another world

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.771
can't go back
once the sun sets.

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:12.672
[SHOCK]

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.076
Here.

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.178
As soon as this mirror
started to waver

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.380
that's when I was able
to go right into it.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.648
Let me see.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.550
I'd say the instability

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.052
of the wavering mirror

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:27.920
is functioning
as something of a gate

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.456
between this world
and the other one.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:33.893
But how do we get this mirror
to do it again?

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:36.362
I'm not sure. Right before
it started to waver..

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:38.197
Pikachu.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.004
That's it. I really wanted
to find Pikachu.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.273
When I started wishing
really hard for that

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:48.908
then the mirror wavered.

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.310
Wishing really hard.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.447
That just might have something
to do with it.

00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:57.183
You really wanna return
to your own world, don't you?

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.285
Yeah. Of course I wanna continue
on my journey

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.487
with Clemont, Serena,
and Bonnie.

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:04.023
Alright, focus on that thought.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.825
And if your thoughts
are powerful enough

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:08.761
our two worlds
might just reconnect!

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:13.032
Okay. If that's what it takes,
I can do it. Let's go back.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.201
So we can continue on our
journey with our good friends.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.135
[AGREEMENT]

00:17:19.906 --> 00:17:22.174
Are we ever gonna
see Ash again?

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.976
Of course, we will, Bonnie.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.646
Don't even ask that.
Ash is coming back.

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:29.649
That's right.
And Pikachu too.

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.851
‐ We've gotta hold onto hope.
‐ Hm.

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.271
‐ It's Ash.
‐ It worked.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:55.107
‐ There are two Ashes?
‐ Two of us too.

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:57.510
There's no time.
We'll explain later.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.378
Our worlds are starting
to move apart.

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:04.116
The sun is starting to set.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.851
The two worlds are connected
by our hopes and dreams.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.753
[URGING]

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.623
Get with it, Serena,
you need to concentrate

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:11.857
'on how much you want
to journey with Ash.'

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.527
Huh? Hm. Hm.

00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:16.162
Clemont and Bonnie too!

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:18.331
Concentrate your thoughts!

‐ Hey. We'll do it!
‐ We'll do it!

Hey, Ash. You take care.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.747
Serena,
take care of your Ash, got it?

00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:09.415
Mm‐hm.

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:11.617
‐ Bye, you guys.
‐ Everybody, stay well.

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.953
I do hope we'll meet again.

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:15.821
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

Goodbye, other Bonnie.

You know, I can still
hardly believe it.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:32.738
Wow, the other Bonnie said,
"I do hope we'll meet again."

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.640
It is a possibility
that the portal

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.876
will open up again sometime.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:38.878
In order to prepare for that,
I'll invent‐‐

they're all gonna continue

on their journey together
as friends.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.451
So let's do that too.
Off to the next Gym.

Ah. What a pretty sunset.

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:54.627
I think we should locate
a Pokémon Center

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.128
before it gets dark.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:00.900
‐ Hey, Ash?
‐ Huh?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.502
We're gonna stay on our journey
together too, right?

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:06.272
Of course, we are.
Wouldn't want it any other way.

We're a team.

That double Thunderbolt from
those twin Pikachu really stung.
