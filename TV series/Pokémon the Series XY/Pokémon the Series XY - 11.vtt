I'm sorry. It's my fault

Something worries me
about Meowth.

How much trouble can Meowth

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.055
get into on its own?

00:15:57.924 --> 00:15:58.925

‐ Eh?

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:02.195

[Ash gasps]
All the way up there?

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.224
Why would Pangoro choose
to get its bamboo sprig

00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:32.625
from way up there?

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.794
Must be quite the finicky type.

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.596

So, how do we get it?

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:39.232
‐ I'll go.
‐ 'Wait. It's too dangerous.'

[CONCERNED]
I have an idea.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.342
And it's a much easier way
to get at that bamboo.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.612
Use Vine Whip.

00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:53.646

Of course!

It's a family reunion

and wish you welcome.

Okay, Pikachu. Come with us,
