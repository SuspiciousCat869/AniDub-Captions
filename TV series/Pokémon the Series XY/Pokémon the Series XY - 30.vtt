On their way to Shalour City

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.940
for Ash's next Gym battle

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.675
our Heroes meet
Gym Leader Korrina

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.111
and her partner Lucario.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.780
Korrina agreed to let
our heroes accompany her

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.584
to Geosenge Town to witness
Lucario's Mega Evolution.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.087
Now, they've arrived in town
to search for the Mega Stone

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.422
known as Lucarionite.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.058
So, that's Geosenge Town.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.194

So, we're supposed to find
the Mega Stone here, right?

'Korrina?'

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.739
‐ Finally..
‐ What's wrong?

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.974
‐ Are you alright?
‐ Finally, I'm here.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.910
Yay!

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.044
‐ Whoa!
‐ Oh, wow!

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.612
Yup! We did it!

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:49.116
We're in Geosenge Town, Lucario!

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.518
We won a hundred battles
in a row.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.621
Now, it's time.
Time for you to Mega Evolve.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.257
‐ Okay, let's go!
‐ Hey!

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.659

"The Cave of Trials!"

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.807
Korrina, I know you're here
for Lucarionite

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.141
but do you know
where to find it?

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.977
Not a clue.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.778
But, if you don't know
where it is

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.647
how are you going
to look for it?

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.582
Grandfather told me
that if we came to

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.517
Geosenge Town,
we'd figure it out.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.286
And my grandfather's
really smart!

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.521
Figure it out? Oh!

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.457
I guess Ash and Korrina
are the types

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.125
who like to just jump
into things.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.495
That's why you two get along.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.931
Ah! Look at all these
beautiful stones!

I guess lots of stores here

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.034

I want one! I want one!

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.673
I just got me a Sun Stone!

‐ Alright!
‐ Helioptile evolved.

Awesome!
Hey, Clemont.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.659
How did your Helioptile evolve?

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.861
I evolved Helioptile
into Heliolisk

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.829
with a Sun Stone as well.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.932
Oh, yeah. Ash, I was wondering,
isn't Pikachu gonna evolve?

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.235
Evolve? You see, Pikachu doesn't
actually wanna evolve.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.536
Right?

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.470
Wow. Okay.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.574
Now, let's hurry and find

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.577
that Lucarionite super quick!

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.746
I suggest we all split up
and search every store in town.

Perhaps, one of these

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:14.494
might interest
you instead.

did you have any luck?

CLEMONT
I'm afraid not.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.804
Every single shop owner
I spoke to said

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:24.938
they had never even
heard of Lucarionite.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.540
Hold on!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.508
My grandfather told me that

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:30.544
we'd find the Lucarionite
right here in this town!

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.780
Well, I suppose
that unless Lucarionite

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.149
was very difficult to find,
we would have heard about

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.151
the Mega Evolution
of lots of Lucario.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.487

‐ So, that means..

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.556
I'd say it must be
a very rare stone.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.758
It seems awfully hard to find.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.259
So, then how do we continue
our search?

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.030

what grandfather told me.

about Lucarionite?

Oh! Thank you.

about a cave where it's possible

to locate a special kind
of Evolution Stone.

than the cave
I already told you about

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.065

enough to enter.

‐ Or an adventure.

MCGINTY
I can't tell you for sure.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.518
But there's some evidence
that terrible things

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.554
really do happen there.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.322
And that's why the people
from this town

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:31.324
never, ever venture
into that cave!

we'll be able to lay claim
to the Mega Stone first!

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.636
'It's not a good matchup!'

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.438
'And along with
Blaziken's speed'

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.073
so strong.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.441
You're right.

'We have to stop this.'

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.604
‐ 'We can't!'
‐ Why not?

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.773
Korrina said
this was her battle.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.408
'We've gotta stay out of it.'

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.812
ASH
Isn't that true?

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:47.013
You won't give up, right?

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:51.417
Ash gets it.
He totally understands.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.956
That's right.
We'll never give up.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.258
No matter who we're
up against in battle

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.860
we'll never turn
and run the other way!

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.829

Blaziken can't move,
so speed wont help it now.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:53.279
We're almost done!

You have won.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.096
‐ Hi, Korrina.
‐ Grandfather?

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.664
ASH/SERENA/BONNIE/CLEMONT
That's your grandfather?

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:14.000
Yes. They call me
the Mega Evolution Guru.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.835
I'm Gurkinn.

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:18.404
Mega Evolution Guru?
[SURPRISED]

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.740
And he's Korrina's grandfather,
as well?

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.742
So, what is he doing
here anyway?

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.211
You battled nobly, Blaziken.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.513
‐ You may return.
‐ What's going on?

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:29.148
Does all of this mean that

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.284
Blaziken is your Pokémon,
grandfather?

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:34.153
‐ That's right.
‐ But why all of this?

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.088
I knew that you would complete
your training

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.257
and make it here successfully.

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:40.860
So, I thought I'd give you
this final trial myself.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.728
'And you overcame it
beautifully'

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.697
as I knew you would.

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:47.066
You passed this final test
with flying colors!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.869
Well done, Korrina dear.

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:52.071
And, you as well, Lucario.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.774
Grandfather!

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:56.876
Now, go forth
and take what you've earned.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.722
[chuckles]

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.094
We've finally got
the Lucarionite!

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.642
We came back!

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:32.078
Well, it's nice to see you.

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:34.213
Did you find
what you were looking for?

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:37.650
‐ Yup, we sure did.
‐ Wonderful!

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.518
Sorry, Mr. McGinty.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.454
You took such
a nice photo of us

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.955
but I'm afraid
mine got burnt up.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.324
I see.

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.360
Well then, we'll just have
to print you out another one.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.662
Really? Thanks a lot!

00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:52.531
Say, it looks like it went well.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.067
Your granddaughter really is
something special.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:58.237
She's my granddaughter.
Of course, she is.

00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:00.272
[all gasping]

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.508
Wait. Do you know
Korrina's grandfather?

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:05.344
Actually, he asked me
to help you out in your quest

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.613
to locate the Lucarionite.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.148
That's right.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.484
So you knew from the beginning?

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:14.387
[SHOCKED]
Ha‐ha‐ha! Sorry, kids.

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.455
CLEMONT
Then, what's up with that story

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.557
about something terrible
happening in the cave?

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.027
‐ I made it up.
‐ Made it up?

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:23.029
[all groans]

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.497
If someone unworthy
of the Mega Stone

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.232
had gone inside the cave

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.833
Blaziken would have
driven them off.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.969
So, it wasn't a total lie.

00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:31.604
Huh, like Team Rocket.

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:34.206
[chuckles]

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.676
‐ Now, Korrina.
‐ Yeah?

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.045
As proof that
you overcame your trial

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.380
the Lucarionite is yours.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.949
‐ I'm giving it to you.
‐ Thanks.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:47.019
Good for you! Lucario, too.
[EXCITED]

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.287
‐ Wonderful.
‐ It sure is.

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.122
Congratulations!

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.958
You're so nice. Thank you.

Okay, Korrina.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.130
Are you ready?

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.198
KORRINA
Ready, grandfather!

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.967

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.608
Here we go, Lucario!

Now, Lucario!

Mega Evolve!

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:19.351
We'll finally get to see
another Mega Evolution!

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.419
I can't wait!

many obstacles

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.542
and winning a hard‐fought
battle against Blaziken

Korrina has finally
obtained Lucarionite.
