Time for Shauna's Pokémon Show.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:53.373
My partner for today
is Bulbasaur.

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:54.975
It's super cute
when it runs.

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.509
And even with
its short legs

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.445
Bulbasaur's really good
at running.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.180
It was my very
first Pokémon.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.082
[HAPPY]

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.783
Everybody's favorite.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.652
[HAPPY]

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.120
It has a super‐cute
voice too.

[VINE WHIP MOVE]

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:11.257
Can't wait to see
what will bloom from its seed.

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:13.226
I hope that
you're all excited too.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.699
‐ Well, there it is.
‐ You've got a Bulbasaur.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.968
Yep. It's my go‐to
Pokémon pal.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:24.070
Bulbasaur, come out!

Just like in the video.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.848
Bulbasaur. The Seed Pokémon.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.217
'A young Bulbasaur uses
the nutrients from its seed'

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.519
'for the energy
it needs to grow.'

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.521
Don't you think
Bulbasaur's super‐cute too?

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.424
Sure do.

I guess your Bulbasaur
is kind of snooty, huh?

00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.735
‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ Huh?

I think Chespin
wants to play.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.109

‐ Ta‐da!
‐ Poké Puffs?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.756
‐ Did you bake these, Serena?
‐ Mm‐hm.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.092
Here. I hope
you all like them.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.460

Huh?

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.643
Sorry.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:38.978
Because my Bulbasaur's
a teensy bit shy around others

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.114
it won't eat anything
unless I feed it.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.082
‐ Then go right ahead.
‐ Thanks.

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:45.618

‐ 'Huh? Was that a smile?'
‐ Bulbasaur really loves it.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.465
But that's the most emotion
you'll ever see.

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.266

you like my Poké Puffs.

It's Squirtle.

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:30.330
‐ Wow. Energetic.
‐ So that's a Charmander.

Charmander.
The Lizard Pokémon.

‐ I made it.
‐ Trevor, you're so late.

‐ Again?
‐ What do you mean?

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.131

where it is.

I like to take photos
of all the Pokémon I've met.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:19.205
My dream is to meet every
Pokémon listed in the Pokédex

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:21.507
and someday discover
a new Pokémon

This is Ash, Serena,
Bonnie, and Clemont.

Ash came all the way
from the Kanto region.

Then that means you've come
across a bunch of Pokémon

from Kanto
that I haven't ever seen before.

from Professor Sycamore

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.640
on the same day,
but went our separate ways

That's easy.

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:06.853

What's wrong, Serena?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:35.548
Huh. Nothing. I'm coming.

And why are you here?

Hi ho, campers.

Alright, at our camp,
we have a system

where each team earns points

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.565
depending on how they did
in each day's activities.

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:27.100
Let's have fun.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.301
BONNIE/SERENA/CLEMONT
Right.

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:30.970
Okay, Team Froakie,
let's go!

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.073
Ready, Team Squirtle?
Let's do it with style.

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.608
‐ Right.
‐ We'll do our best.

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.710
First place gets ten points.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.512
Second place gets
seven points.

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:41.981
Third place gets three points.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.751
And all other teams
get no points.

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.653
The goal is to help each other
out while competing.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:50.356
The team that has earned
the most points by the last day

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.625
will have the honor
of being inducted

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.461
into the Pokémon summer camp
hall of fame.

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.931
Also please note
the current champion Diantha

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:01.134
was inducted into
the summer camp hall of fame

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.102
back when she
was your age.

‐ That's so cool.
‐ Wow!

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.006
And that means
we'll be able to follow

in the footsteps
of the great Diantha.

00:15:08.608 --> 00:15:11.077
I wanna do what she did.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.479
Yeah.
Pikachu, let's go for it.

[AGREEMENT]

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.184
Now, on our first day, we like
to get everyone acquainted

00:15:18.184 --> 00:15:20.553
by starting off
with a Pokémon battle.

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:23.489
'It's an annual tradition
where no points are awarded'

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.359
so feel free to challenge
any Trainer you like.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:29.896
I want my opponent to be Tierno.
We'll battle for sure this time.

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:34.267
‐ Alright.
‐ Serena, what do you say?

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.235
So that means I'll be
your opponent.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:38.037
And may the best Trainer win.

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:43.009
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
'Is everybody ready?'

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.979
Battles begin.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.248
[blowing whistle]

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.517
[APPEARING]

00:15:58.257 --> 00:15:59.459
Ready, Froakie?

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.294
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.429
Pikachu, cheer us on
with Bonnie, alright?

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.798
[EXCITED]
You can do it , Ash.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.301
You're using Froakie
not Pikachu.

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.336
I got Froakie
from Professor Sycamore

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.271
when I first got
to the Kalos region.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:15.374
Alright.
A Water‐type battle.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.610
There's no doubt we both want
to get into the hall of fame.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.313
Yep. There's no holding back.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.914
Let's win this with style.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.584
[EXCITED]

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:27.253
Huh?
[AWE]

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:29.388
Hey, you could be
a bit more excited.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.257
Huh?

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:33.459
You see, this is the first time
I'm competing

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.994
in an official battle
with a real judge.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.629
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:39.365
Huh?
Even though you're a Trainer?

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.968
‐ Yeah. This is it.
‐ Amazing!

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:44.770
That means today is your
official debut Pokémon battle.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.139
You're right.
I guess it is.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.808
Let's do our best, Fennekin.

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:51.444
[AGREEMENT]

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:53.012
Charmander,
let's really focus, okay?

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.847
[AGREEMENT]

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.250
Chespin, we've got to win this,
alright?

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.318
[AGREEMENT]

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.554
‐ Would you look at that.
‐ Pokémon aplenty.

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.256
Yep. Stealer's choice.

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:04.724
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
Rejoice.

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:06.626
Excuse me,
but there's a dinner

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:08.528
that's begging
to be prepared, right?

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:09.562
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
Right.

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.597
[EXERTION]

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.466
[WATER GUN ATTACK]

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:16.102
[EXERTION]
Fennekin, use Flamethrower!

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:17.603
[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:18.838
Use Energy Ball.

00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:20.540
[ENERGY BALL MOVE]

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.643
[SHOCK] / [EXERTION]

Hey, Fennekin, are you okay?

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:28.614
[AFFIRMATIVE]
What power.

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.050
Despite it not being very
effective against Fire types.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.854
See? And cute too.
That's power with style.

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:36.656
My dream is to one day become

00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:38.658
the world's greatest
Pokémon performer.

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:40.326
World's greatest
Pokémon performer?

00:17:40.326 --> 00:17:41.928
[CONFUSED]

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.696
Wow, you've never
heard of them?

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.431
They're Trainers who create
high‐quality performances

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:47.500
working together
with their Pokémon.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.367
Dodge it, quick!

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:51.270
[EXERTION]

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:56.475
[PANIC]

00:17:56.475 --> 00:18:00.179
Chespin. Calm down, please.
Come on, calm down.

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.748
[RELIEVED]

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.017
Please excuse us.

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.419
'Chespin,
can you still battle?'

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.988

[WATER PULSE ATTACK]
[EXERTION]

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:14.393
‐ Ah. How does it do that?
‐ It's the rhythm.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.629
‐ 'The rhythm?'
‐ Word up.

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:19.532
My dream is for my Pokémon
and I to be a Rap Dance team.

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.068
‐ Sounds awesome.
‐ You bet.

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:24.570
We're using rhythm and dance
steps while we're battling.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.105
Dodging is a breeze
when you're able to move

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.640
and groove like us.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.542
Okay, Rapid Spin. Let's go.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:32.111
[RAPID SPIN MOVE]

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.180
Froakie, Water Pulse again!

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.615
[WATER PULSE MOVE]

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:37.917
[FEAR]

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:39.819
Alright.
This battle's over.

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:41.354
I'm going to stop the battle.

00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:42.888
which means Squirtle
is the winner.

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:45.958
[EXERTION]

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.927
Pretty cool, huh?

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.028
Looks like we'll be getting
into the hall of fame.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.464
Ah..

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.432
Wow! You two can really move.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.609
You never know
what Ash is going to do.

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.344
I'm always learning
new things to do

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.779
for Pokémon
through his actions.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.914
You're never sure
of what's next.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:12.251
Oh, man, come on.
It's not such a big deal.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.786
But your inventions
are totally amazing.

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.655
An inventor?

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.289
His inventions are always
helping us out.

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.860
‐ Here.
‐ Huh.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.461
Whoa! What's that?

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.430
Inventing is my passion.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.098
I love coming up with things

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.833
that benefit the lives
of Pokémon.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.869
My brother's inventions
are unbelievable.

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:33.773
Awesome. That's so cool.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.208
Serena, how did your battle
against Shauna go?

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:38.010
It was a lot of fun.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.413
I figured out
a lot of things.

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:42.314
'Shauna showed me
a lot of things too.'

They seem
to enjoy our cuisine.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.757
It's all because
of your recipes.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.160
It's all because
I'm the official taste‐tester.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.461
Wait. You can't brag
about that.

You've done a great job.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.439
The kids just
adore your cooking.

00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:08.207

'There's Clemont, Shauna,
Tierno and Trevor.'

They're all on a journey
to make their dreams come true.
