DJ
Welcome back to Pokévision Live!

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.473
Time for more rankings.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.909
We've reached number four
on our top ten.

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.478
'And it's Snow‐Capped Onix.'

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.814
Never seen Pokévision before.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.483
That's amazing,
since everyone knows about it.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.552
Pokévision refers
to promotional videos

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.354
'created by Trainers
themselves.'

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.489
Awesome! That sounds so cool.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.490
I wish I knew what that meant.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.526
[all groaning]

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.328
Next, we bring you
video number three

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.532
which is "Psyduck At Twilight."

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:32.900
'Pokévision is a way
for Trainers'

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.902
'to introduce their Pokémon.'

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.870
Psyduck's such a cutie pie!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.305
Next, number two!

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.640
DJ
'"The Beauty Of Joy."'

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.577
MISTY
'It can also show the bond

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.645
between Trainer and Pokémon '

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.446
'like this video does!'

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.916
You see, Trainers upload
their videos

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.652
to an online viewing site,
and the Pokévision top ten

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.755
is based on the viewer rankings
they receive.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.892
And now it's time for this
week's video number one!

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.028
'Aria and Fennekin's
"Life Of An Idol."'

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.163
I knew Aria would be number one.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.566
[EXCITED]

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.535
After those two had a series of
top ten Pokévision appearances

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.170
'they made their debut
as a pop duo'

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.005
'and became Pokémon superstars.'

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.942
[AWE]

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.711
So cute!
[AGREE]

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.646
You know, Bonnie,
that is a cute Fennekin.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.114
[sighs]

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.150
I think Ash gets it.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.954
You know what, my Fennekin's
just as cute any day.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.656
For sure, and you're at least
as cute as Aria is.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.358
[AGREE]
Bonnie, that's so sweet!

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.794
[THANKFUL]

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.163
You know, I'm pretty sure
you can rent all the equipment

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.131
you need to make Pokévision
videos right here.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.500
‐ Really?
‐ Perfect!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.837
So, I'll make my debut

ASH "A Pok vision of Things to
Come!

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.479
NARRATOR
Now that our Heroes have

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.981
arrived at the Pokémon Center
en route to Cyllage City

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.885
Serena has decided to make
her debut Pokévision video.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.054
I always knew I'd be making
a Pokévision video

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.722
if I ever got a Pokémon.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.858
I want to make one with Dedenne.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.793
But I think
you've forgotten Dedenne

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.596
isn't your Pokémon.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.231
Alright, then I guess
I'll just have to make

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:45.599
a video to find a wife for you.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.334
Huh!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.736
Ash, will you help me with mine?

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.239
Thing is, I want to do some
special training

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.774
so I can be ready
for my battle with Grant.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.976
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah!

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.177
ASH
If I don't have a move

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.278
to counter
Onix's Rock Tomb

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.212
there's no way I can win.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.717
Special training would be
the logical choice.

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:05.118
Right!

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.054
You're really psyched.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.622
Well, maybe the rest of you
can help me.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.158
‐ Sure!
‐ Yeah!

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.559
STAFF MAN
After you've finished shooting

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.161
all the video footage you need

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.296
simply bring it back here,
and we'll do

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.532
all the necessary editing and
create a soundtrack as well.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.400
That would be a big help!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.236
BONNIE
I could even do a video, too!

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:26.873
Now, I think I can be the most
helpful behind the scenes.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.676
No way! You'll be the most help
if we make you a big star!

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.779
But I don't want to be a star.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.483
We also have quite an extensive
wardrobe department you can use.

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.318
‐ That'll be perfect.
‐ Yeah. I can't wait.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.391
‐ We're all ready to roll.
‐ Then let's go!

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.026
[gulps]
[EXCITED]

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.930
Scene one, and action!

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.699
[shivering]
Uh, hello, there.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.402
I'm Clemont, and this is..

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.837
[SALUTATIONS]

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.772
No, no, cut, cut!

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.107
Chespin,
you're too far out front.

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.842
[CONFUSED]

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:04.711
And, Clemont,
you need more energy!

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.012
'Your voice is getting softer
and softer!'

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.415
[groans]

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.917
I told you I'm not any good
at this sort of thing

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.219
so why can't we make
Serena's already?

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.287
Aah!

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.957
Hey, I've got an idea.
Talk for him, Bonnie.

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.526
‐ You mean speak his lines?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.062
You see, we'll be hearing your
voice instead of Clemont's.

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:23.630
Then, all Clemont has to do
is match his lips

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.499
to everything you say.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.567
Aah! That might work.
Yeah, let's give it a try.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:33.073
Alright, take two. Action!

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:33.907
BONNIE AS CLEMONT
'Hello, there,

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.709

my partners, Chespin..'

I cant stand this kind of video!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.822
Don't worry, we'll edit
everything together later

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.724
and that'll make it perfect.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.793
Now, it's time
for our video debut.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.494

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.369
First, take a shot
of Fennekin and me

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:03.370
running through the field.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.372
Okay!

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.374
It looks like that's my cue.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.012
Because the future is now,
thanks to science.

'Clemontic Gear, on!'

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:16.383
I thought we would encounter
a situation

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.385
precisely like this one.

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:21.655
I call it the Pokéstar Shooter.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.524
‐ Pokéstar Shooter?
‐ Boring.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.660
My camera‐equipped
mobile tripod robot

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.529
can provide fixed shots,
mobile shots

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.566
or even crane shots as highest
quality as Pokéstar Studios

of the world.'

'Low angle.'

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.078
‐ 'High angle.'
‐ Huh?

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.647
‐ Zoom in.
‐ Huh!

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.482
You're witnessing
movie perfection.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.251
I guess science really
is amazing

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.320
just like Ash says.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.055
This could be
your first big hit in awhile.

If we're going to stand a chance
against Onix's Rock Tomb

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.786
we'll need a lot of speed.

'Pikachu can use Quick Attack,
and Froakie and Fletchling's'

Double Team will make
its attacks harder to hit.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.993
We'll get your moves
in tip‐top shape

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:35.262
and stop that Rock Tomb.
