00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.195
in what has been a family
tradition for generations.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.697
‐ A trial.
‐ Huh!

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:46.466
What's that mean?
[CONFUSED]

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.969
There comes a time
when our family must decide

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.504
who will inherit our house
and property.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.574
In order to do that,
we conduct a sort of trial.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.777
‐ So, then that means..
‐ That's my brother and me.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:01.147
Correct, I'm sure you learned
a lot during your travels

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.416
so let's see how strong
you've both become.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:05.118
Alright!
I've been waiting for this!

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.420
No matter what the test,
I'll win it!

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.889
[CONFIDENT]
I have no intention of losing.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.725
[EMPHATIC]

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:14.094
Now, the heir will be
chosen by a method

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.830
that's been passed down
from generation to generation.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.064
That sounds like a long time.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:20.100
[CONFUSED]

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.068
I wonder what kind of method
he's talking about.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.837
The method? Hm.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.974
We will have a treasure hunt.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.309
Have a treasure hunt?

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:31.478
[CONFUSED]

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:34.581
Now, I have hidden the treasure
somewhere on the property.

00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.984
He who will be my successor
must find it.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.086
Yes, it doesn't matter
what the treasure is

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:41.688
'cause I'm gonna find it first.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.556
Hmm.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.559
I realize the search area
is rather big.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.162
Therefore, you will both
be permitted an assistant.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:52.565
Assistant? I'd like Ash.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.301
‐ Will you help me out, please?
‐ Huh? Really?

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.570
I'm happy to help
any way I can.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.272
In that case,
then I want to help Heath!

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:00.640
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.976
After all, Heath saved me.

00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:04.711
It's the least I can do.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.746
Will you help us too, Serena?

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.648
‐ You want me?
‐ Yeah.

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.785
And my big brother can
help Blake with Ash. Hmph.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.953
‐ Hm.
‐ Okay.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.256
‐ We'll split into two teams.
‐ Sounds good.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.591
‐ Let's win, okay, Heath?
‐ Right.

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.061
[blows raspberry]
[Heath laughs]

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.396
And when you've finally
located the treasure

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.465
then, you will bring it
back to me.

right then and there.'

where the treasure is, Blake?'

Not really,
I think we should check

everything
that looks suspicious.

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:58.865

get along with your brother

all that well, do you?

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.212
See, I just don't want to
lose to him, that's all.

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.282
Even though we used
to be really close.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.451
Our whole family
used to go picnicking together

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.153
on a nearby hill
when I was just a little kid.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.360
One day, my dad gave us
two Espurr.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.197
And it wasn't long before
they evolved into Meowstic.

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:33.533
Which was also when my brother
and I started to butt heads.

If you want to make the most
out of Meowstic's powers

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:50.817
the first thing
you need to do is..

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:52.452
Knock it off!

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:54.587
I'll battle any way
that I want to!

So get off of my back
and keep off!

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.326
I'm old enough
to take care of myself.

And I've got to prove that
to the rest of my family.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.001
Having a brother or sister's
not all that easy, is it?

I never really mean to.

‐ Don't be silly.
‐ 'But, Ash..'

You got angry with Bonnie

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.752
because you were worried
about her, right?

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:27.954
I'm sure Bonnie knows
that's the real reason.

you were my brother instead.

very much either.

‐ Do you guys fight?
‐ Yeah, we do.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.803
I worry about him,
so I'm always giving him advice

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:51.504
which he doesn't like.

It's not like I purposely want
to pick a fight or anything.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.756

saying you're not mad at Blake?

Blake, don't be so hasty!

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:39.799
Right. I'll be careful.

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:41.567
Then you've got the attack.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.003

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.974

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.686
But how?
[CONFUSED]

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:35.388
Very well done.
Thanks a lot, Exploud.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.256
Now return.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.191
What's going on?

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.360
I don't understand
what just happened.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.963
Does it mean that Exploud
is your Pokémon, dad?

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.865
That's right.

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:49.001
I instructed Exploud
to wait for you two here.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.137
Why would you do
something like that?

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:54.507
Because I truly wanted
both my sons to remember

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:56.442
back to the time
you battled as a team.

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.277
'Shoulder to shoulder.'

00:17:58.277 --> 00:17:59.545
‐ Hm?
‐ Hm?

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.548
Hmph.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.150
[laughter]

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.518
'So you chased away
the Venipede'

'together, did you?'

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.556
The bond you two share
is our family treasure.

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.925
I hope you'll always remember
and cherish that.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.827
I won't forget it, dad.

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:16.596
I'll always remember it too

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.730
even after I'm all grown up.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.636
That timing of the Energy Ball
you used was perfect.

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:24.770
Well, I couldn't have done it
without your help.

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:32.745
The true treasure is
to be found within your hearts.

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.113
I want you both
to remember this.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.449
Oh, dad.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.052
I know I made you worry. Sorry.

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:43.689
Sorry? There's no need for
regret, now that you're home.

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.958
It's so great
that those two made up.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.028
[PLEASED]
So, what about the two of you?

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:52.965
‐ Huh? Uh. Hm.
‐ Uh.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.602
I know I'm not
the most dependable brother

00:18:56.602 --> 00:19:00.272
but there will never be a moment
when I stop caring about you.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.608
Believe it or not, that's why
I nag you from time to time.

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:05.878
Hm‐mm.
Clemont, I'm sorry, too.

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.047
I should have told you
before I left.

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:10.950
I'll even eat
every one of my veggies.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.319
So, will you always be
my big brother?

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.655
I'll be your brother forever.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.857
You're my little sister
and I love you.

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:20.726
Mm..
[both laughs]

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.196
All's well that ends well,
you know?

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.265
Yeah.

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.600
Dad, you're the best.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.601

SERENA
'Those Meowstic are..'

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.392
You see, they haven't
seen each other

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.261
since Blake and I
went our separate ways.

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.230
They've always been very close.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.533
Meowstic, from now on you two
will always be together.

Come on, Chespin, cheer up!

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.713
I'll bake you some Poké Puffs.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.081
You'll find true love
someday soon.

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:17.450

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:25.291
Thanks! Take care of yourselves
on your journey.

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:27.093
Be sure to come back
again some time.

00:20:27.093 --> 00:20:28.894
You bet!
And thanks to both of you.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.696
Take care of each other.

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.765
Bye‐bye, then.

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:35.701
I'm glad you're a team again.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:36.836
NARRATOR
The closer they are,

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.604
the more they fight.

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.973
Two pairs of siblings
were able to make amends

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:43.075
and reaffirm the bonds
between them.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.678
And so, with Clemont
and Bonnie's bickering

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.346
sure to bring
them even closer

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.782
it's on to Coumarine City

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:51.617
