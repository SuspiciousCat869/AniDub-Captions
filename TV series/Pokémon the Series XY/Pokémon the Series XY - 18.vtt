where Ash's next Kalos

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.811
our heroes have just arrived

[chuckles]
So this is Camphrier Town.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.320
The town map says it's a place
where you can taste the ages!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.623
What does taste the ages mean?

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.892
It means the town
has a wealth of history

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.527
with a lot of old buildings
still standing.

‐ Oh, my ears!
‐ What a terrible noise!

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.868
Yeah. I wonder what it is!

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:42.142
‐ What a relief.
‐ Huh?

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.413
Hi. E‐excuse me, but what was
that awful sound just now?

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.615
‐ Uh..
‐ Huh?

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.584
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Ah, I'm sorry.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.719
‐ Just one second.
‐ Oh..

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.221
I was wondering if you knew

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.989
what that terrible noise
was just now.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.492

Hm.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:01.755
Snorlax, the Sleeping Pokémon.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.691
'After eating its fill,
Snorlax is too sleepy to move.'

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.060
'Small children
sometimes play on its belly.'

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.697
I'm certain that the sound
you heard was Snorlax snoring.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.033
But why is it sleeping
right in the center of town?

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.668
This town and Snorlax

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.069
have always had
a symbiotic relationship.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.738
Symbiotic?

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:19.239
She means
they help each other out.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.208

WOMAN #1
Every year about this time

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.746
Snorlax comes down
from the mountaintop

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.748
to eat up all the crop roots
that are left over

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.750
after we've finished
our harvest.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.485

Wait. Isn't that a bad thing?

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.320
WOMAN #1
Not at all!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.188
In fact, as Snorlax
digs up the roots

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.890
it plows the fields

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.725
which gives us a good harvest
the next year.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.827
ASH
Wow!

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.129
WOMAN #1
Then when Snorlax

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.231
is almost finished eating

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:46.533
we have a harvest festival
as a way of showing Snorlax

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.068
our gratitude
for its help.

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.203
At the close of
the festival

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:53.273
the lord of Shabboneau Castle
plays thePokéFlute

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.776
while Snorlax finishes up
the town's offerings.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:56.810
And then it dances
all the way back up

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.579
to its mountaintop home.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.049
Does that mean the festival
hasn't happened yet?

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.216
‐ You see..
‐ 'Wake up!'

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.384

The town is all ready
for the festival to begin

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.195
but the way things are,
there's no way we'll be able to.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.831
'We have a big problem that's
keeping Snorlax from waking up.'

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.433
What's the big problem?

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.568
The lord of Shabboneau Castle

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.503
who plays the flute
to wake Snorlax

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.272

I'd say this is my cue

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.820
to step in and help

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.988

I don't think it worked.

What do you think's gonna happen

Nobody will get any sleep
and we'll all be a wreck.

Maybe if Nurse Joy took Snorlax
in at the Pokémon Center‐‐

Perhaps, maybe we could
ask Officer Jenny.

People are having a hard time,
but I feel bad for Snorlax, too.

We've got to help Snorlax out
before it gets in more trouble.

‐ I can't leave it like this.
‐ Yeah!

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.170
It seems the only way
it'll wake it up

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.704
is if the lord
of Shabboneau Castle

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.873
plays the Poké Flute.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.809
So why don't we just ask
the lord of Shabboneau Castle

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.577

So tell me, what brings you
to my castle home? Um..

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.967
We need your help!

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.668
Please play the flute
at this year's harvest festival

Um, uh, that is not
up for discussion.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.942
Please, sir, come back!

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:19.012
Snorlax is asleep in the center
of town and won't wake up!

00:06:19.012 --> 00:06:20.614
We need you to play
the Poké Flute.

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:22.749
‐ Oh, pretty please!
‐ Mm..

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.418
I would if I could,
but no, can't do.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.554
I'm allergic to the flute now

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:32.325
so when I play, I then
break out in hives! Boo‐hoo..

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:35.662
So if you can't play,
then just lend us your flute.

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:37.731
I've also developed
such an acute fear of flutes

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.332
that just looking at it
scared me

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.401
so I'm afraid I threw it away!

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.970
‐ Huh?
‐ Threw it away?

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.706
Lord Shabboneau, I understand
you're saying all of this

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.676
to protect your family name,
but I'm certain

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.811
you'll regret
lying to these children later.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.481
So perhaps you should
just tell the truth.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:58.685
W‐what to do? Oh, dear.
Alright, here's the truth.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:02.822
The Poké Flute was in my castle
at one time, not now.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:05.592
‐ Well, what happened to it?
‐ Did somebody break it?

‐ 'No, nothing like that.'
‐ Ah..

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.396
‐ That's good.
‐ So what happened?

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.164
I'm afraid she just grabbed it.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.379
Wait. So you just allowed
the princess to take it?

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.581
You see, once Princess Allie
makes up her mind

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.784
it's impossible
to get her to change it.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.253
‐ He's right.
‐ 'And you're okay with that?'

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.421
SERENA
'It's a family heirloom?

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.690
Sadly, it is.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.925
Princess Allie's father's
been kind to me

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.094
'so I couldn't
put my foot down.'

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:43.964
Well, you can count on me
to get it back from her!

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.033
No doubt! Then you'll be able
to play it at the festival!

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:50.503
Splendid! I'd be delighted to
perform at the harvest festival.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.139
‐ 'Okay, let's go!'
‐ 'Right!'

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.474
'Why don't we wait for them
in Camphrier Town?'

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.676
MAN #1
'As you wish.'

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.045
Did you get a load
of that crazy scene?

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.914
It sounds to me like
that Poké Flute

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:03.283
has control over Snorlax.

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.552
If that flute
can control Snorlax

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.654
then catching Pikachu
will be a piece of cake.

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.456
JAMES
We could build the Boss

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:12.025
a bodacious bombastic band
of Snorlax!

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:13.860
JESSE If we do that,
Team Rocket will

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.895
dare I say,
rule the world!

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:16.830
MEOWTH
And there's a promotion for us

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.598
in there somewhere!

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.300
JESSE
'No time to waste.'

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.501
TEAM ROCKET
Let's make haste!

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.109
CLEMONT
I'd say this hedge

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:30.243
is part of Parfum Palace.

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.180
Bonnie, what are you doing?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.149
I think we can sneak in
right through here!

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.123
[all gasping]

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.924
SERENA
'What a giant garden!'

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.092
BONNIE
I wouldn't wanna mow the lawn.

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.596
[BARKING]

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:52.365
[all gasping]
Huh? Who's that Pokémon?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.234
You know that one.
It's a Furfrou.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.470
Ah! That's a Furfrou, too?

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.339
ALLIE
'Furfrou, stop at once!'

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.042
[Allie laughing]

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.917
Furfrou dear, you shouldn't be
playing with all this trash.

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.820
‐ It'll give you a tummy ache.
‐ Hey, you calling us trash?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.890
Uh, might you be Princess Allie?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.392
[Allie laughing]

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.728
Indeed, I am Princess Allie.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.131
‐ Parfum Palace is my home.
‐ So lovely!

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.600
Wow, you're a real princess?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.470
And getting the flute back
might not be so easy.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.640
Please, Princess Allie, give us
the Poké Flute back, alright?

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.209
‐ Not going to happen.
‐ But why not?

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.278
Because my things are my things

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:40.580
and things that were given to me
are my things as well

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.816
so the Poké Flute is one
of my things and it's all mine!

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.250
[laughing]

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.052
She's weird.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.188
She's awful
and she's selfish, too!

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:49.622
The town won't be able
to have the harvest festival

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:50.957
without the flute.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.859
And Snorlax is snoring so loudly

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.627
that the townspeople
can't get any sleep!

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.963
If so, they should just
go to their seaside villas

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.264
and take a little nappy‐poo.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.867
[laughing]

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:03.036
Uh, at this rate
the townspeople are gonna

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:05.205
end up hating Snorlax.
I can't let that happen.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:06.139
[AGREEMENT]

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.240

[SURPRISED]

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:12.545
Hm, hm..

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.881
Would this Pikachu
belong to you?

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.983
Yeah. My partner.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:20.153
Every Pikachu has different
size cheeks than other Pikachu.

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.422
'Yours has
perfectly‐sized cheeks'

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:24.090
'and the roundness and redness
are just right.'

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.559
'Splendid!'
[HAPPY]

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:29.829
[PAINED]
Such a splendid and rare Pikachu

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.332
is unworthy of you
so I'll graciously accept it

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.100
and treasure it
like an heirloom.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.037
Huh? No way!

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.873
Pikachu's my buddy
and that's the end of that!

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:40.907
Hm..

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.376
‐ Bring them out.
‐ Ma'am.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.348

all of these treasures'
'for Pikachu?'

‐ That's crazy!
‐ You're out of your mind!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:59.926
Hm..
Hey. Hm.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.996
If I recall, you want
the Poké Flute, correct?

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.398
Yeah! Will you give it back?

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.467
Let's have a battle.
Furfrou versus Pikachu.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.702
Huh?

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.437
I suggest that we bet
the Poké Flute and Pikachu!

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.306
No way!

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.774
How could you do
such an awful thing?

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.410
‐ Ew!
‐ We can forget it.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.946
But I'm warning you that
this is your one and only chance

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.114
to get your hands on that flute.

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.549

you'll go through with it?

It's a deal! You're on!

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.997

It's Snorlax!

Alright, if I win, you're gonna
return that Poké Flute!

Enough talk, let us begin!

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:03.590
Pikachu versus Furfrou
in a one‐on‐one battle!

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.124
The battle will be over
when either Pokémon

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.393
is unable to continue. Agreed?

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.395
‐ Okay!
‐ That's fine with me.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.130
Alright, battle begin!

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.537
Okay, Pikachu, use Quick Attack!

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:19.405
This should be easy, Furfrou!

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.307

Pikachu, Iron Tail, let's go!

'Let us scatter
the rose's glorious bloom'

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:12.191
Now use Thunderbolt!

[PAINED]

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.834
No! How dare you do that
to my Furfrou?

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:25.238
‐ Furfrou's got a new hairdo!
‐ Great job, Pikachu!

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:27.373
Take Furfrou
to the groomer right away!

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.176
As you wish, ma'am.
[PAINED]

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.712
Hold on. What about our battle?

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:35.048
Princess Allie,
are you forfeiting?

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:36.683
It can't be helped!

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:40.320
My Furfrou can't battle
looking so atrocious!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.755
So that would mean a forfeit
and Pikachu's the winner!

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.358
Alright! We did it, buddy!
[EXCITED]

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.260
Now it's time for you

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.529
to give Lord Shabboneau's
Poké Flute back!

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:51.664
I will not return anything
since I lost.

[SHOCKED]

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.568
That wasn't the deal we made!

[ANGRY]

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:00.807
Ha, if you were listening,
the only thing I said was

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:02.542
that we would be betting
the Poké Flute and Pikachu

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.811
in our battle, and nothing more!

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.580
'After I beat you, I was going
to give you the Poké flute'

'but since you're the winner,
I insist'

'that you hand over Pikachu
to me this instant!'

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.654
‐ Huh.
‐ What kind of bet is that?

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:15.888
‐ Really!
‐ It makes no sense!

[AGREEMENT]

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.227
Ha, well,
I'm the princess of this palace

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.362
and that means
I make all the rules.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.466
‐ Something wrong?
‐ Your unscientific selfishness

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.034
might be tolerated
at your palace

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.669
but not out in the real world.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:31.637
We refuse
your ridiculous demands!

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:36.409
Ash battled against you
even if it meant

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.344
putting his precious partner
on the line!

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.879
'Of course, he trusted'

'that you'd give up the flute
if he won!'

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.651
If you insist
on acting so selfishly

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.821
I'm afraid you're not going
to have any friends left. Huh?

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.823
I think you're being
a little too harsh.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.859
You didn't have to yell at her
like that.

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:55.328
But somebody needed
to tell her the truth!

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:57.730
[sobbing]
It's alright.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.400
You scolded me
with much sincerity.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.401
That means
you must care about me

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.902
a great deal, don't you?

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.204
I what? Huh?

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.473
I truly understand.
There's no need for words.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.575
‐ You don't understand.
‐ I don't?

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.211
Hm. Hm.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.881
I suppose you can
have the Poké Flute back.

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.618
‐ Huh?
‐ 'Under one condition.'

00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:22.121
‐ I'm not giving you Pikachu!
‐ In exchange for the Poké Flute

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.357
I insist that you leave
this one with me.

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:27.427
[screams]
You want me to stay?

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.696
[all gasping]
[whispering]

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.565
‐ Do you think so?
‐ Yeah.

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:35.234
You can have my brother
if you want him!

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:36.836
Bonnie, how could you
tell her that?

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.938
Alright. It's settled.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:39.672
Ma'am.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:43.943
Now please give them
the Poké Flute.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.551
Here. It's yours.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.886
You have your precious
Poké Flute now.

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.688
‐ Thank you!
‐ We got to go.

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.723
Have a good time, big brother!

00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:00.426
Uh, but, you guys..

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.495
After we wake up Snorlax
we'll come back.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:04.831
Just hang in there for a while.

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.934
‐ But, Ash, help me.
‐ Don't worry. It'll be fine.

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:10.470
[groans]

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.805
Um, are you really
sure about this?

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.373
[chuckling]

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.375
Everything will be fine,
Clemont.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.544
Congratulations, princess.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:21.180
Take good care
of my brother, okay?

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.350
Guys, please don't go!
Don't leave me!

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:32.325
[SNORING]

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.796
Hm..

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:38.998
‐ 'Lord Shabboneau!'
‐ Huh?

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.100
[panting]

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.635
‐ 'Ah, they're back!'
‐ It's true!

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:45.571
And with the Poké Flute!
[panting]

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.406
We got it back
just like we promised.

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.474
ASH
'Now please play it!'

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.676
Yes.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.048
‐ My flute! What's going on?
‐ Huh?

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:57.583
[all screaming]

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:59.185
Lord Shabboneau!

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.587
[WORRIED]
[groaning]

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.022
[all sighing]

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.591
ASH
'Ah.'

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.927
Oh, I should have known
it was you!

00:17:07.927 --> 00:17:10.029
Prepare for trouble,
you don't know much.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.665
And make it double,
you're so out of touch.

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:14.667
To protect the world
from devastation.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.670
To unite all people
within our nation.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.740
To denounce the evils
of a Twerp with a flute.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.310
We extend our reach,
then the problem is moot.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.712
‐ Jessie!
‐ And James!

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.682
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:32.518
Surrender now
or prepare for a musical fight!

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.687
Meowth, that's right!
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.724
Perfect‐o.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.027
The flute that controls Snorlax
controls the world!

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:42.862
Yeah, and that's the name
of that tune!

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:45.264
I'm the only one
who can play that flute!

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.333
We'll see about that.

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:48.834
We'll give it a test run
and play a few riffs!

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.737
Oh, no! Don't do it!

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.806
Your Highness doth protest
too much, methinks.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:56.108
Play us a tune, maestro!

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:58.477
C sharp or B flat?

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:01.581
My ears! Boo‐hoo..
[all gasping]

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.449
I think you need
to take lessons!

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.919
For the next 500 years!
[ANGRY]

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.189
And I tried to tell you
nobody can play it but me.

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.959
[ANGRY]

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.761
[indistinct chatter]
Snorlax woke up!

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.964
And that awful noise
put Snorlax in a bad mood!

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:20.499
[ANGRY]

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:21.834
[EXERTION]

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:24.870
Hm. You see that?

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.207
Hats off, folks, I'm a genius!
Alright, Snorlax, obey me!

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:31.377
[AFFIRMATIVE]
[ANGRY]

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.880
[HYPER BEAM MOVE]

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.384
I blew it!

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.952
TEAM ROCKET
We're blasting off again!

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.554
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:49.195
‐ Lord Shabboneau, your flute!
‐ Thanks! I'll play!

Look, and here comes Snorlax!

Wow! Look at Snorlax go!

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.347
Thanks so much for all your help
again this year!

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.182
Yay! Snorlax, go!

[YAWNS]

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.121
What a relief.

SNORLAX
[HAPPY]

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.732
Everything worked out just fine.
Isn't it great, buddy?

The Poké Flute

00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:31.637
has been returned
to its rightful owners

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.572

is even stronger,

Um, aren't we forgetting
something?

‐ 'Clemont?'
‐ Oh, it was horrible.

00:19:55.094 --> 00:19:56.495
What happened
to all of your clothes?

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.997
Oh, I can't look!

00:19:57.997 --> 00:20:00.533
So how did you get out of there?
