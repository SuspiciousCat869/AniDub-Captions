‐ I wanna take care of it.
‐ Sure.

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:21.941
I'll do it right now.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.409
[APPEARING]/[HAPPY]

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.381
Dedenne! Yay! Ha ha ha!

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.950
Hi, there.
I'm Bonnie.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.385
And see?
That's my brother, Clemont.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.520
[GREETING]

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.888
‐ 'That's Pikachu and Ash.'
‐ Nice to meet you.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.291
[HAPPY]

00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:41.661
Here. Let me get you cleaned up.

00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:44.230
You got yourself all dirty
from the battle.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.999
[PLEASED]

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:50.970
Hey, look! Dedenne likes it
when I pet its tail too.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.139
Wow!
I never would have guessed.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:56.242
[EXCITED]
You both like the same thing.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:18:00.813
[PLEASED]
You two are just like twins.

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.815
[HAPPY]

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:05.284
Well, they're both
Electric types, remember.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.320
You're gonna have fun with
Dedenne, aren't you, Bonnie?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.956
Yeah!
Dedenne is so cute!

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:12.191
[HAPPY]
Nuzzle, nuzzle, nuzzle.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.260
[NUZZLE MOVE]

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.898
Nuzzle's one of Dedenne's moves.
I guess you forgot.

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:21.500
Yup. And now I can feel
what it's like to be paralyzed.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:24.637
[YAWNING]

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:29.542
Huh? It fell asleep.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:32.845
Of course. You see, Dedenne
tend to fall asleep a lot.

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:34.280
That's just
one of the things they do

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.148
to conserve their energy.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:39.085
‐ Awesome, an energy saver.
‐ Aah!

00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:41.587
Okay, you can take a nap
in here.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:46.292
Aah!

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.160
So, let's get going.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.329
‐ Right, let's hit the road.
‐ Yeah!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.064
ASH/CLEMONT
Shh!

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.000
Shh! He he!

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.967
[all giggling]

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.441
NARRATOR And so after
escaping Team Rocket's evil
clutches

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:04.510
Pikachu and
Dedenne are safe

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.712
and Dedenne's
back to perfect health.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.514
Following Clemont's
successful catch

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:11.651
our heroes now have
a new friend in Dedenne

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.719
as the Kalos region journey
continues.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.821
[SLEEPING]

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:22.194
Oh! This is terrible.

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:23.496
The sun's setting
and we're still

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.164
in the middle of the woods.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.366
[WORRIED]
Wait, does this mean

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.267
we're sleeping
out in the open tonight?

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.236
Hmm?

00:19:30.236 --> 00:19:31.570
[EXERTION]

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.274
Uh, roughing it's not my style.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.777
If we could
find a Pokémon Center

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:40.646
there's no doubt
we'd be able to stay there.

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:41.147
'But I don't know
where it is.'

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:46.652
Ah! I see somebody.

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:50.289
Excuse me!
Can you please tell us

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.024
if there's a Pokémon Center
close by?

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:54.560
[screams]

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.262
[SCARED]

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:57.630
[CONFUSED RAY MOVE]

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:02.902
[EXERTION]

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.539
[explosion]

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.174
[PAINED]

00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:12.812
Huh.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:17.683
Ah! Thanks, Fennekin.
You saved me.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:19.919
[HAPPY]

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:23.289
Is everything okay?
I just heard somebody screaming.

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:26.625
Aah! Nurse Joy!

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:29.295
I just got a little startled
by a Pokémon.

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:32.498
Oh, I understand. But are
the two of you alright?

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:35.668
Yup. Hey, could you tell me
if there's a Pokémon Center

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.436
around here, please?

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.705
Yes, it's located
just up ahead.

00:20:40.306 --> 00:20:41.507
Thank goodness.

00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:46.712
Fennekin, we're going to stay
at a Pokémon Center tonight!

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.115
I know!

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.317
Let's have a race
to see who gets there first!

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:52.184
FENNEKIN
[EXCITED]

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:57.556
