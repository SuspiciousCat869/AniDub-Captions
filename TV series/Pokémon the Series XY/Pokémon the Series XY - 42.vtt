00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.490
Wow, Ash. You can't wait.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.527
But still, Korrina
and Lucario are strong.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.930
Are you sure you're ready?
Maybe you should train more.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.133
He's right. What about Tierno's
rhythmic battle style?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.669
Have you mastered that yet?
I'm just saying.

Hey, I'll be fine.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.874

head on, it'll all work out.

Looks like it's just
floating in the ocean.

We can't get over there
by walking.

Come on. We came all this way,
and we can't get to the Gym?

Good to see you again too.
Welcome to Shalour City.

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.105
You came over here
just to meet us?

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.707
Yup, I figured you'd be
showing up soon

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.643
so I've been waiting for you.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:23.877
If you're trying to get
to the Shalour Gym

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.013
that means one thing.

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.215
You must be fully prepared
to challenge me. That true?

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.983
Of course.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.719
But, you haven't decided
on a strategy yet.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.855
I've been training hard
since I last saw you

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.957
and I've beaten
every challenger.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:38.692
So that means
you've won all your battles.

How are we going to get across?

Why not?

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.116
There's a saying,
those with a desire to battle

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.052

his strategy.

I'm here to challenge the Gym.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.971
But before you do, you must
listen to what I tell you.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:01.141
Fact is, that's the rule when
anyone comes to this island.

Uh, if you say so.

‐ A valuable story.

It concerns Mega Evolution.
Come, come. Follow me.

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:17.257

I've never seen
such a large statue before.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.542
It symbolizes
our family friend

with Mega Lucario.'

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:58.198
You see, the history
of Mega Evolution began long ago

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:00.166
with the arrival
of one of my ancestors.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.301
Right here on this island.

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:08.808
This man was traveling and
training with his Lucario

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.844
when they found two
peculiar stones right here.

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:34.200
It is generally believed
that what happened next

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.569
was the world's first
Mega Evolution.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.971
So this is where
Mega Evolution started.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.639
[AWED]

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.341
That's right.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.409
Our family has lived here
and protected

Mega Evolution Island
ever since.

That's great! What an
interesting story that is.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:50.884
I never knew that before.

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.352
Wow, this is an important place.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:54.087
Yeah, you bet.

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.588
I want to become
a great Gym Leader

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.091
just like my Grandfather
and my ancestor.

00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:00.627
Wait a sec,
your Lucario can Mega Evolve

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:02.695
and you're already
a great Gym Leader, right?

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:04.998
‐ You think? Go on.
‐ Stop.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.967
To me, she still has
a long way to go.

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:11.671
It's too soon to pass down
the Scroll of Secrets to her.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.740
Not that again.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.543
Excuse me.
What's the Scroll of Secrets?

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.344
A family treasure.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.113
It lists everything
one needs to know

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:20.980
to be a Gym Leader.

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:24.884
‐ Could we see it?
‐ Please, show us.

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.320
I'd love to see what it says.

The fact is,
we haven't had dinner yet.

let's have
our Gym battle tomorrow.

of Mega Evolution stuff

in that thing.

and gift it to the Boss.

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:20.006
Mega Evolve.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.210
[gasping]

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:32.485
[ENERGIZED]

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.520
[gasping]

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.589
‐ Is that..
‐ Yes.

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:38.124
Ready, Lucario?

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:39.959
[CONFIDENT]

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:42.328
So? Knock yourselves out.
Use Shadow Ball.

00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:43.763
[SHADOW BALL MOVE]

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:45.565
Lucario. Use Bone Rush!

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.066
[BONE RUSH MOVE]

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.336
[PAINED]

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.408
TEAM ROCKET
We're blasting off again!

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.643
[FRUSTRATED]

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.985
Korrina and Lucario
are so amazing.

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:07.753
Don't you think so too, buddy?

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.255
[IMPRESSED]

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.324
And we get
to battle them tomorrow.

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:13.192
I can hardly wait. All set?

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.161
[CONFIDENT]

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.830
Here it is.
We got your scroll back.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.032
Well done,
you make me very proud.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:24.971
That's the Scroll of Secrets.

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.773
What does it say? Show us.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.176
But we're not allowed
to see it, right?

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:34.013
Hm, since you managed to get
the scroll back to me

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:36.048
I guess
I can make an exception.

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:38.050
Wow, you mean it?
[EXCITED]

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.685
[laughing]
Yay!

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.953
Now.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.292
"Rule one.
Early to bed and early to rise.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.695
'"Rule two. Eat in moderation,
even if it's delicious.'

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.397
'"Rule three.'

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:53.165
'"Keep all of your
belongings organized'

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.201
'"and readily available.'

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.802
‐ But, sir?
‐ "Rule four.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.339
Wash your hands
several times a day."

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:03.142
Um, is that really
the Scroll of Secrets?

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:06.012
You doubt me?
It took a lot of effort.

00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:08.648
I spent countless hours
writing this.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.617
All so Gym Leaders could be
at the peak of perfection.

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.719
[chuckles]
That's what you wrote?

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.656
Hm. Profound, right?

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.858
So then, there's nothing
in there about Mega Evolution

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:20.626
or your ancestors' history?

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.628
Uh! No. Not a single thing.

00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:31.904
NARRATOR
The Shalour City Gym Battle

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.473
between Ash and Korrina
will now begin.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.375
Each Trainer
may use three Pokémon.

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.444
Furthermore,
only the challenger

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:40.212
will be allowed
to substitute Pokémon.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.981
Ash, you can do it.

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:43.649
Make sure you don't lose.

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.884
Both of you do your best.

00:19:44.884 --> 00:19:46.752
You ready to go for it,
Pikachu?

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.554
[DETERMINED]

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.389
Gym Leader Korrina.
Come forth.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:02.735
Huh?

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.082
[grunts]

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.754
So, we battle once again.
Finally.

00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:25.357
Right. I've been looking forward
to this. I am totally psyched.

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.427
[EXCITED]
Me, too. I'll give it my all.

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.429
Great. And I'll be
doing the same thing.

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.298
[DETERMINED]

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.700
Ash sounds confident,
but I wonder

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.602
if he's really
going to be alright.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.604
‐ Yeah, I do too.
‐ Go! Go! Go, Ash.

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.273
[EMPHATIC]

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.775
NARRATOR
The Gym battle between Ash

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:45.010
and Korrina is about
to get under way.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.813
Will our hero be able
to defeat Mega Lucario

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.483
and win his third
Kalos Gym badge?

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.752
Stay tuned,
as the journey continues.

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:59.492
