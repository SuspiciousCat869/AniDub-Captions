00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.518
It came up so suddenly.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.956
I hate thunder. Ah! Ah.

Bonnie, you can't
just go in there.

It seems totally deserted.

The exterior's
in pretty bad shape

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.821

‐ Ah..

But..

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.186
I didn't turn them on.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.555
‐ So, then..
‐ Who did?

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.323

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.728
Probably,
it must've been the sensors.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:17.764
‐ Sensors?
‐ Yeah, motion detectors.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.966
That's why the lights
came on automatically.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.102
It may be an old house
but it must be equipped

Uh, let's wait outside

‐ No way!
‐ But it was just wide open.

It must be
the motion detectors

closing and locking
the doors

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.000
after they're open
for a short while.

‐ But why are they still locked?
‐ Let me see.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.639
Maybe this is a haunted mansion

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.341
that grabs people
and then eats them.

‐ Wait.

You should never
trust anything

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.348
that can't
be explained by science.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.517
This is a huge mansion

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.120

another way to get outta here!

It's a downpour.

when that happens.

JESSIE
Look.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:37.878
There's a good chance it's not
raining inside that huge house.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.547
‐ But what if somebody's there?
‐ Then I'll keep them company.

And that's a bad thing?

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:58.198
It'll keep away the riff‐raff

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.400
and make this the perfect
Kalos frontline hideaway.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.902
Wait a sec.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.003
I thought we were
getting out of the rain.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.039
Hm. Huh?

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.208
Oh! It's an automated window.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.210
In an old house like this?

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.012
Meowth's right.
Wait up, Jessie.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.351
Judging by the looks of it

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.753
this place
has been abandoned forever.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.021
Longer.

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:26.493
Hm. There must be
a light switch around here.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.664
Oh, thanks
for the light, Meowth.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.200
I didn't do that.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.102
I'd say everything
in this old joint is automated.

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.772
‐ This old house?
‐ Huh?

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:41.074
I'm starting to get a bad
feeling about this place.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.809
You and me both, pally.

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.177
Let's make sure
we have an out.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.580

[screaming]

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.220
It's just a painting.

'Y‐you're, you're right.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.823

'Maybe she owns this place?'

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.696
Maybe she's not alive
but she's here, anyway

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:03.530
if you know what I mean.

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.466
[shudders]

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.501
Huh! Did I say that?

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.805
[shudders]
Did you hear that?

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.940
‐ That sound?
‐ Yeah, loud and clear.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.775
I am so through with this place.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.245

Anybody hear that?

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.987
It must be an old
grandfather clock

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:27.654
ticking away somewhere
and nothing more.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:29.589
I'm sure of it.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.225
Sounds to me like
someone's pounding a stake.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.094
‐ How come?
‐ To stop a vampire?

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.229
[shudders]

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.265
My mouth's got a mind
of its own today.

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:42.002
[screaming]
Ah.

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:43.937
It's just a portrait painting.

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.906
Next time, tell me
before I freak out.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.807
Hey, did that woman's eyes
just move?

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.810
[screaming]
What is that awful noise?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.213
Like I previously stated

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:55.181
this is an old mansion
so it's really drafty.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.883
The draft sounds
like a whistle

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.818
and the whistle sounds
like someone screaming

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.553
which is actually
quite common.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.322
You're wrong,
I have no doubt in my mind

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:03.556
that was somebody screaming.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.625
Serena's right.
[SCARED]

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.627
This mansion must be haunted

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.162
by the spirit of the lady
in the painting.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.664
[shudders]

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:12.933
Ah! There I go again!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:17.470
[shudders]
We need to get out of here fast.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.005
I thought you were going
to make this our hideout.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.407
I lied.

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.208
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.243
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:24.778
What's that?

ALL
'Ghost!'

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.921
Whatever that is
has shining eyes!

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.123
Well, I'm not about to stick
around and check out

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.025
whatever it is that Sparky
just threw at us.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.461
That was no Poké Ball
and I'm no Pokémon!

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.596
But I am!

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.398
‐ Another scream..
‐ Ah..

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.666
Let's find a way out.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.600

‐ Hey!
‐ Wait!

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.594
I figured it out,
there must be a Psychic

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:49.929
or Ghost‐type Pokémon
in this mansion.

That's gotta be why
those lights turned on

all by themselves.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.237
So you think
a Pokémon did all of that?

00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:00.607
Of course, that certainly would
explain all this weird stuff.

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:03.376
Yeah and maybe that thing we saw
was actually a Pokémon.

A Pokémon?
[INSIGHTED]

I'd guess the doors
and windows wouldn't open up

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.916

probably doesn't want us

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.985

of the mansion just yet.

I'm afraid there's no way
any one of us would know.

Hey, Ash, we could
try to find out.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:41.767
Yeah, we could.

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:44.103
That's a great idea.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.938
I'm afraid we don't have time
for such silliness.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.740
We know the quickest
way out of here.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.477
And that's to catch Espurr.

Grandma Lacy?'

Huh?

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:18.931
‐ Uh, Grandma Lacy?
‐ That's her in that painting.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.734
‐ She's my grandmother.
‐ Wow, she's your grandmother?

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:23.469
Does that mean
you own this big house?

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.171
That's right. I sure do.

00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:26.806
My name is Elise.
So, who might you be?

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:32.044
I understand.
You knew my grandmother then.

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.447
I'm sorry we entered
your house without permission.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.483
No problem. I'm glad you were
able to get out of the rain.

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:40.152
Grandma Lacy always used
to play games with me

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.821
when I would come here
for a visit too.

00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:42.855
Just like she did with you.

Thank you.

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:11.717
This was my grandmother's
favorite piece of jewelry.

After this,
after meeting all of you

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.533
I think I've changed my mind.

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.835
I'm going
to renovate this place.

I'm going to move in.

And you know what, I'd be
thrilled if you'd come and play.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.822
I know.
Do you wanna go to the cemetery

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:52.458
where Grandma Lacy is now?

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:55.528
You can tell her all about
the pendant and say goodbye.

and I will be good friends.

if you held on to that pendant,
instead of me.

Lacy would want anyway.
