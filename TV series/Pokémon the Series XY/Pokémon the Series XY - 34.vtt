I‐I don't know,
but I think it's more times

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:31.264
than I can count on
both of my hands.

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:34.000
Of course, when Hawlucha poses
like it does

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.269
it's easy to dodge.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.606
If only we could speed up
its Flying Press.

‐ Hey, are you alright?

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.003
Yeah, I think I've
figured out a way

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.738
to keep your battling style

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:13.306

stop your opponents

So, it's Machamp.
It's been a long time.

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.309
Do you know that Machamp?

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:25.545
KEATON
'Yes, the truth is..'

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.817
...that Machamp actually used
to be the Forest Champion

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:34.254
helping keep things
calm and peaceful.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:38.291
But when Hawlucha arrived,
the two of them became
rivals.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.493
Over the course of time

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:43.162
Machamp began to lose
more and more battles.

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:45.231
Finally, having been
forced to hand

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.934
the title of Forest Champion
over to Hawlucha

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.469
Machamp disappeared.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.341
I've heard several rumors
that Machamp has been living up

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.377
in the mountains,
training hard.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.247

And that sounds
like a draw to me.

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:25.464
Hawlucha, thanks. Having
a battle with you was great.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:28.534
I think you're
a really special Pokémon.

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.169
'Getting your Flying Press
perfect like that'

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.938
'during a real battle
was amazing!'

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.707
It may have looked like a draw

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:37.343
but the truth is,
I totally lost.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:40.613
'I know you're gonna be fine
from here on out.'

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:43.015
You know what? I think
you want to go with Ash.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.350

Huh?

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:52.425
[ENCOURAGING]

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.260
Now, don't worry.
The forest will be fine.

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:57.897
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:57.897 --> 00:19:59.765
So, Hawlucha, wanna come along?

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.036
[AFFIRMATIVE]
Great!

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.238
We're gonna be really
good friends. I promise!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.049
[cheering]

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.953
Yes! I caught Hawlucha!

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.688
Yeah!

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.256
[EXCITED]

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.195
‐ 'Ash?'
‐ Huh?

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:31.964
I trust that you'll take
good care of Hawlucha.

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.433
Please make sure you give it
lots of action‐packed battles.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.535
Right!

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.438

And so, Ash has a new Pok mon

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.608
friend in Hawlucha with
its strong battle style.

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.544
Now, our hero's Shalour City
Gym battle challenge awaits

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:47.480
as the journey continues.

00:20:55.054 --> 00:20:57.656
