[PROUD]

Evolution is when

super bright
and transform, like.. Bam!

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.866

"Wow, that's awesome!"

That's about all there is to it.
[EXASPERATED]

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.905
Okay, I don't get it at all.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.241
I guess that's my cue
to take over.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.344
There are some kinds of Pokémon
who change their shapes

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:55.148
after certain criteria are met,
and this is called Evolution.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.784
For example,
Scatterbug evolves into Spewpa

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.420
and Spewpa evolves
into Vivillon.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.089
There are several ways
to make Pokémon evolve

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.126
but the most common way is,
like with Vivillon

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:09.562
when they reach a certain level
and then evolve.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:12.866
An alternative method
is by using an Evolution Stone.

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:15.902
For example, for Pikachu
to evolve into Raichu

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.772
it needs a Thunder Stone.
[JOYFUL]

how they evolve.

are amazing.

a lot to learn.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.659
Impressive, eh? Hm?

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.895
'There seems to be something
in Spewpa's fur.'

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.930
Yeah, I wonder what it could be?

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.998
Let's take a closer look.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.069
'It looks like
some sort of chip'

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.338
'that's used
for transmitting signals.'

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:54.774
‐ A signal? But for what?
‐ I know.

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.776
Dolan must have implanted
that chip

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.812
as a tracking device so he
could hunt down any Pokémon

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.214
that might get away from him!

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.450
SERENA
'Then he might be close by!'

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.352
Well, if he is,
I'll get him.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.926
‐ Huh? What's wrong?
‐ Spewpa's probably worried.

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:17.097
After all, Dolan is still
holding its friends captive.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.365
You wanna get your friends
out of there, right?

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.766

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.537
First, we'll let Dolan
take Spewpa back

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.806
and then we'll follow, using
the transmitter's signal.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.208
That way, he'll lead us
to the hideout

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.576
and all the Pokémon too.

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:31.277
And that'll make it easy

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.979
to rescue all of Spewpa's
stolen friends!

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.814
That's a great plan.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.649
Do you think we can really
pull it off?

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.985
We happen to have
an inventor in the house.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.420
Sounds like my cue
to get busy!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.589

‐ Ha‐ha‐ha.

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.816
We can then pinpoint
Spewpa's location

But, Dolan dropped
Scatterbug, right?

Remember, Scatterbug evolved
into Spewpa since then.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.801
Don't worry. No problem.

00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.336
Once he sees Scatterbug's chip
on Spewpa

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.338
it won't take him long
to figure everything out.

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:35.041
I feel uncomfortable
about all this.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.477
Maybe we shouldn't be using
Spewpa as bait.

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:40.713
‐ It's dangerous.
‐ I'll just act as a decoy.

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.749
Well, if anybody could pull
it off, it's you.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.351
‐ Thanks.

the whole plan

Dolan's a very greedy man.

He'll definitely come back
or he won't make all that money.

Once he makes his pickup,
we'll follow.
