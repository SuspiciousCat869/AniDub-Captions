00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.326
So, Fairy Flower, huh?

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.861
'I know I've seen
this flower somewhere.'

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.263
‐ 'Huh!
‐ Huh?

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:44.898
SERENA
'On Bonnie's head!'

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:47.200
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.303
I see, the reason Flabebe
landed on Bonnie's head

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.038
wasn't because
she looked pretty.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.807
It thought it saw
its favorite flower.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.675
That makes sense.

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.644
It's always better using
scientific reasoning.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.180
Why you..

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.583
I want both Florence and Flabebe
to get better, but what to do?

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.885
I guess I'm at a loss.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.054
I've got it, we'll go
and find a Fairy Flower.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:10.123
[EXCITED]

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:12.392
In the meantime,
you can go to the hospital

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.660
and spend some time
with Florence.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.562
Once we've located it

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.664
we'll bring the flower
over to you right away.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.299
I don't know what to say.

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:20.400
‐ I'll look for it, too!
‐ Huh?

Thank you once again.

ASH
You can count on us.

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.921
I think that Flabebe
needs to feel better first.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.823
‐ So, let's go see Nurse Joy.
‐ Right.

00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:52.699
Flabebe's all ready now.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.234

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.436

I'm so glad you're alright.

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.340
NURSE JOY
For the time being.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.742
You see, Flabebe uses
the energy of its flower

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.110
to replenish its strength.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.012
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:08.048
And that's why we've got
to get out there

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.850
and find a Fairy Flower
as soon as we can.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.819
Do you know where
Fairy Flowers grow?

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.387
NURSE JOY
'Let's see, you should find

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.122

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.590
'in a field close to town.
Yes, right here.'

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.928
One thing, unfortunately

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.530
they're out of season
at the moment.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.998
It might be hard to find one.

00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:26.466
[SAD]

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:28.034
We'll give it a shot.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.770
Thank you, Nurse Joy.
[GRATEFUL]

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.740
Alright, let's go before Flabebe
feels weak again.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.408
‐ Come on.
‐ Right, let's hurry.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.077

Well, well, well.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.216

with a blooming opportunity.

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.152
JAMES
What next?

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.487
JESSIE
First we plant the seed

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.122
then water it, then bam.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.991

‐ Yes, ma'am!

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.961

where the Fairy Flowers grow?

[CONFUSED]

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.698
It looks like we go

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.935
in approximately an hour.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.436

MEOWTH

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.410
We're here to take you

we'll help you find them,
don't ya know.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.619
You'll help us find
a Fairy Flower?

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.488
MEOWTH
Maybe two, don't cha know.

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.823
Since they're out of season
at the moment

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.793
an amateur would have a hard
time finding one, don't ya know.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.561
Nurse Joy did tell us
the same thing.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.130
MEOWTH
But wait. There's more.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.098
Today's your lucky day!

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:34.567

We've never been meaner.

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.373

that much time.

Let's go with them
so we can find a Fairy Flower.

Okay, right this way,

We're here ya Fairy Flowerland,

I can't believe how fast
we got here.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.283
JAMES
Without us, you'd be walking

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:24.851
in circles, ya.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.086
Not so sure about that.

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:29.489
We've been on this path
the whole time.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:32.592
Listen what's important now
is that we find a Fairy Flower.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.527
Yeah, Grey's waiting for us
at the hospital.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.462
Alright, Bonnie, ready?

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.330

we're gonna find

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:43.970

you like, okay?

I'm not finding
any Fairy Flowers.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.649

Nurse Joy was right on the mark

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.418
when she said that
they're now out of season.

to grab on to a flower

that's still growing naturally
out of the ground.

Flabebe up there with me.

I've somehow achieved
a contented and peaceful state.

What's up with you two?

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:49.609
Let's get the Twerps
off the grid.

00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:52.111
You needn't be so angry,
Meowth, old chum.

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.946
He's right.
Fighting is so barbaric.

So what should we do now?

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:12.899
Why don't we set adorable
little Pikachu free?

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:14.967
That's fine with me.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.402

What's gotten into
Team Rocket anyway?

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:28.681
Oh, I see, the pollen
from Flabebe has the power

00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:31.284
to make everyone
feel wonderfully relaxed.

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.185
So, when anyone acts
aggressively towards it

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.354
'it simply scatters its pollen.'

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.144
I hope you'll find it
in your heart to forgive me.

That was so kind of you,
dear Ash and Clemont and Serena

Clemont's right.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.536
The Fairy Flower
was all the way up on a cliff

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.004
and she climbed up there
with Flabebe to get it.
