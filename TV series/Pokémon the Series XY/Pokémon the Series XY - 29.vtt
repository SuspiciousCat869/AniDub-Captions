00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.482
'that transcends
all other Evolution.'

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.518
'It goes without saying
that you need'

00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:33.820
'both a Mega Stone
and a Key Stone.'

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.356
'But, what is more important
is the bond of trust'

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:37.757
'between you and your Pokémon.'

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.459
Yup, yup, yup!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.727
We need a strong bond!

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:43.229
I get it! I get it!

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.666
Lucario and I will get
strong together!

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.468
Okay, grandpa, we're going!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.741
'We decided we needed
hundred victories in a row'

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.743
before we went
to Geosenge Town.

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.845
That's what Lucario
and I have been doing!

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:01.715
[AGREEMENT]
So, when you challenged me

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.350
you were going
for victory number ninety‐nine?

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.652
[SHOCKED]

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.455
But having ninety‐nine
victories in a row..

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.290
I know you're a Gym Leader
and everything

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.192
but that sounds a little
hard to believe.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:14.027
Oh, I've got proof! See this?

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:19.165
‐ They're footprints!
‐ Wow!

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.701
Wow! They're from Pokémon
you battled against?

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.004
Yup! I asked them
to stamp their paws!

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.206
'Here's a print from a Pangoro'

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.907
'whose Trainer is named Kramer.'

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.576
'And this one is from
a Krookodile'

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:32.012
with a Trainer named Seth,
and.. Huh..

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.947
‐ Huh?
‐ What's the matter?

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.216
I forgot to ask Pikachu
to stamp its paw!

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.918
[CONFUSED]

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:39.919
KORRINA
'Now, don't mind me..'

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.688
'There.'

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.390
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh? That's ketchup.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.091
[Clemont chuckles]

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.226
Mm‐hm. Mm‐hm. Mm‐hm.

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:48.061
This is perfect!

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.896
[EXCITED]

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.135
So, that Lucario
could Mega Evolve

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.370
not to mention beating
the Thunderbolts out of Pikachu.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.040
Now, that's an offer
we can't refuse.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.941
We may not have been
able to catch Gardevoir

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.144
but Lucario's a done deal!

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:07.347
We'll cop the Key Stone
and Pikachu. Ooh.

00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:09.482
We'll get that Mega Stone
from Geosenge Town

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.151
and then both Lucario
and Pikachu

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.953
will Mega Evolve
right on the spot!

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.855
And when the Boss
gets a load of the mound

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.590
of Mega‐Evolved Pokémon
we've put together

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.359
he'll flip his lid.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.094
Then let's set
the stealing stage.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:22.595
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:27.000
One more Trainer left.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.568
Who'll be my hundredth
straight victory?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.403
'Maybe Serena?'

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.372
'Or maybe Clemont?'

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:33.573
‐ 'Attention, miss.'
‐ Huh?

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.842
‐ 'Yes, you!'
‐ Huh?

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:38.278
JESSIE ON SPEAKER
'Is that Lucario your partner?'

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:39.712
‐ Uh..
‐ Who's that?

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.186
JAMES
Certainly nobody suspicious!

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.388
We're the Mega Evolution
Consulting Group.

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.723
Mega Evolution what?

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.759
Our job is to give you
a consultation

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.462
concerning how strong
your Pokémon will become

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:58.398
and what kind of moves
it'll use, once it Mega Evolves.

00:09:58.398 --> 00:09:59.999
JESSIE
We're also aware that your

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.935
Lucario wishes to Mega Evolve

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.471
'using the Mega Stone
from Geosenge Town.'

00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:06.339
Now, how do you know that?

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.708
See, when it comes
to Mega Evolution

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.243
we know everything
there is to know

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.045
from soup to dessert!

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:15.048
Wow! That's cool!
[AMAZED]

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:17.717
A thorough consultation
is in order.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.486
I sense our encounter
was meant to be.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.689
Wait. There's no need.

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.991
We're already
super strong anyway.

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.293
And as soon as
Lucario Mega Evolves

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.496
we'll become stronger than
we ever were before!

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:31.131
It's a free consultation

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.932
so there's no reason to decline.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.400
[Jessie chuckles]

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.970
MEOWTH
Now, step right this way!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.005
JESSIE
We'll need to take this as well.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.306
[Jessie chuckles]

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.075
‐ That's mine!
‐ Fear not!

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.543
‐ It's safe with us.
‐ Uh..

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.380
Hey!

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.649
Since, we're here, we'll look
into Pikachu's Mega Evolution!

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.618
Huh?

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.419
We'll tell you everything.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.655
Like, how strong Pikachu
will become

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.357
when you use the Mega Stone
from Geosenge Town.

00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:58.658
‐ Now..
‐ Huh?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.593
[STRUGGLING]

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.729
Huh? Hey, wait!

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:05.565
So, if Pikachu
can Mega Evolve, too

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:08.067
then I wanna find out
if Dedenne can.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.869
Please tell me, please?

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.105
JESSIE
Oh, what a shame.

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.207
There's no way Dedenne
could have a Mega Evolution.

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:16.476
BONNIE
What? Why not?

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.178
‐ There.
‐ So.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.580
JESSIE
I think it's time we begin.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.183
‐ Hold on a second!
‐ Huh?

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.918
How do you know
that there's a Mega Stone

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.020
in Geosenge Town, anyway?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.355
Our job is to know
all of that stuff!

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.291
JAMES
Along with a Key Stone

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:33.927
it's needed to facilitate
a Pokémon 's Mega Evolution!

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.496
JESSIE
Everybody knows that.

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:39.666
A Pokémon will Mega Evolve
with the use of two stones.

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.801
You're wrong!
There are different Mega Stones.

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:44.237
Each Pokémon requires its own

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:46.439
specific Mega Stone
to Mega Evolve!

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:49.409
'The Mega Stone in Geosenge Town
is Lucarionite'

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:50.710
'and only Lucario
can Mega Evolve with it!'

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.379
[gasping]

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.950
Professor Sycamore was talking
about the same thing.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.119
He said Gardevoir's Mega
Stone was Gardevoirite.

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.387
JAMES
Uh, now that I think of it,

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.256
he did say that.

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:05.458
So, what we're sayin' is,
Pikachu won't be

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.261
able to Mega Evolve,
using Lucarionite.

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:11.164
How could you forget something
as important as that?

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:13.366
[chuckles]

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:14.968

To unite all people

To denounce the evils
of truth and love!

Surrender now or prepare

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.241
for a Mega‐Evolved fight!

They're really bad guys who are

'always trying to steal
people's Pokémon!'

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.441
Tiny Twerp's right.

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.311
We populate a terrifying
and mysterious organization

that performs unseemly
acts of evil every day!

both Lucario and Pikachu

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.123
and create an invincible

where Team Rocket went?

Come on, Clemont, hurry up!

Huh, coming!

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:29.168
Our first stop is Geosenge Town
to find the Lucarionite.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.870
Then we can locate
the Pikachunite

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.872
at a more leisurely pace!

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.708
But how do we know that
Pikachunite really exists?

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.443
We don't know for certain
if Pikachu

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.479
will even be
able to Mega Evolve.

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:41.214
Negative thinking
prevents me

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.682
from having a nice day!
So, stop it!

this way.

[panting]

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.261
Do you always
have to run so fast?

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.196
Well, maybe you run too slow.

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:30.997
[FRUSTRATED]

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:41.274
Yup. Lucario's here.

They're not far away.

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.077
You can really sense
where Lucario is?

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.512
That's incredible!

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.782
Uh‐huh, I can.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.584
The two of us have been together
ever since we were young.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:54.754
We played together.

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:56.456

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:02.061
We grew up like siblings.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:09.335
Lucario and I share
an unbreakable bond!

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:10.903
That's something that
will never change.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.978
I just know.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.681
Lucario's waiting for me
to rescue it!

00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:23.683
Isn't that little
more than a hunch though?

00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:25.885
Yup! But I just know!

00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:29.222
Hey, Diantha said something
like that as well.

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:31.457
She and Gardevoir could sense
each other.

‐ Huh?

Pikachu and I have traveled
all this way together, too.
