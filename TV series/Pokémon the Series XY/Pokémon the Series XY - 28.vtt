'Double prizes!'

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.936
That's our Jess,
the most devious mind

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.171
on the devious planet.

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.507
Now, it's time for part two
to get under way.

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.676
‐ Yay!
‐ Yay!

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:24.311
SERENA/ASH/BONNIE
What?

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.247
Fakes? In this town?
Forcing people to battle?

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:28.715
SERENA
Eating and drinking a lot

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.583
and then running
without paying?

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.585
That's right,
and when they run away

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.688
they announce your names
to everybody.

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.389
So, I asked you to come here
to see if you knew

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.591
what's been going on.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:39.793
'This photo
is from the restaurant's'

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.261
'surveillance camera.'

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:44.864
‐ They do look like us..
‐ Yeah, but why?

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:48.068
We have no idea, but we're
currently investigating.

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.736
So, I'm asking you to please be

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.105
extra careful
during your stay here.

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.274
That's all for now, you can go.

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.142

Thanks.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.444

'There are some weird people

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.279
in town disguised as us.'

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.848
I'm so mad at them, we'll tell
you a lot more when we get back.

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:02.782
See ya.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.255
I wonder why there wasn't anyone
pretending to be my brother.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.991
‐ That's weird.
‐ Yeah, you're right.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.625
It makes no sense to me.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.094
[CONFUSED]

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:17.197
I can't believe how odd
that is.

00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:19.265
[JESSIE]
Excuse us.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.067
But are you that brilliant
young inventor, Clemont?

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.470
Uh, brilliant? Well..

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.940
JAMES
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.643
You're from the Kalos Institute
of Technology? Oh.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:32.445
JAMES
We're in the process of building

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.647
an important device
but we need your help.

‐ Like me?
‐ Of course!

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:42.922
JESSIE
We've heard all about you.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.925
How unique and revolutionary
your inventions are.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.360
People in the know are saying
they're brilliant

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.796
and incredibly useful.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.464
JESSIE
Yes, indeed! Brilliant enough

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.066
to figuratively blind you.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:55.035
JAMES
Devices from the future,

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.370
works from a Master inventor.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.739
[chuckles]
You're embarrassing me.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:00.940
JESSIE
Please, Clemont, sir,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.709
work alongside us.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.412
I'll help in any way I can!

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:15.155
I'll be back later
this evening. Clemont.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:16.389
Would you give this to Ash,
please?

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.627
Yes, of course.

00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:22.562
CLEMONT
'Incredible!'

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.464
You've got all sorts
of equipment.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.232
Do you mind if I examine it?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.934
JESSIE
Not at all.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.703
Wow! A complete set of tools.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.572
This is so exciting.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.107
JAMES
Here's what we're working on.

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:35.809
Behold!

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:38.945
Wow! A Heliolisk robot?

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:41.047
Fantastic!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.650
JESSIE
This is as far as we've gotten.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.652
JAMES
We were commissioned to build it

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:48.288
by an organization
dedicated to world peace.

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.323
JESSIE
But a cruel, nasty Electric‐type

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.725

'to sabotage our work'

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.627
CLEMONT
'That's not very nice.'

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.429
JAMES
And so, we humbly request

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.766
that you build us an
electric‐type defensive device.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.769
Hmm..

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.772
Electric‐type
defensive device, eh?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.342
‐ 'Well?'
‐ Yes! That will be a breeze.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:12.412
Joy! We knew we could count
on you!

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:15.748
First off, I'll need to gather a
number of insulating materials.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:18.651
Let's get started right away.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:22.122
It will be hard to move if
too much electricity builds up.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:25.091
So, I'll need to install
a discharge mechanism as well.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.494
JESSIE
You are a true genius, Clemont.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.629
We never would've thought
of that.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.164
[James laughs]
This goes here.

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:33.466
'Then I do this..'

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.608
Your Kalos region update?

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:43.076
JESSIE
Sir! We now have two Pokémon.

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.410
'Pumpkaboo.'

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.479
JAMES
'And Inkay.'

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.015
I'm quite happy to hear that.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.683
JESSIE
We're working hard

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:53.520
to increase our firepower
by catching more Pokémon.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.389
And soon, you'll be receiving
even more exciting news from us.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:59.492
I look forward to that.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.427
We'll do our best,
we simply must.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.329

or bust!

We would be honored if you would

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:30.523
name this for us,
brilliant lad.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.426
Hmm, let's see.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.829
How about the "Electricity Has
No Effect on Me‐a‐Tron?"

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:38.464
‐ Big fail.
‐ Hey, what's that?

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.702
JESSIE
Initially, we thought we'd build

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.604
a Pokémon transport machine..

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:48.675
But we couldn't get
the thing to work.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.743
JESSIE As the capsule
travels through

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:52.245
the tube, it get stuck.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.813
CLEMONT
Huh, I could see

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.281
if I can adjust it.

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:55.982
JESSIE
Really?

00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:01.321
Of course, how far do you want
to send the capsule?

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:02.689
JESSIE
One and a half miles or so.

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.657
One and a half miles.

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:07.427
If the capsule with a Pokémon
in it weighs this

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:10.263
and if the distance
is one and a half miles

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:12.332
then the necessary output
would have to be..

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:15.235
Alright, I've got it.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.004
It's all done,
now we can seal it

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:18.871
so, we can increase
the pressure.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.510

Some people are pretending

who they are, quick!

That's right,
I can't take it much longer.

I'm not gonna let them
drag our names

I'm Bonnie from Lumiose City.

Once the Twerps learn
there are copies of them

running around they're going to
want to stop us.

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:50.396
And that's when we lure them
into our trap, it's a snap.

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.498
It tickles my cap.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.334
Were there people here
who look like us?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.103
Yeah! And they ate without
paying me anything.

Your clothes are awful,

Ta‐da, ta‐da, ta‐da!

I don't do that ever.

It wasn't easy for me
to dress down
