‐ You know?
‐ Huh?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.556
Wigglytuff's convinced
it can't do its job.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.093
It takes everyone time
to get used to a new job.

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.328
‐ Yeah, you're right.
‐ But Wigglytuff seems to be

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.799
taking its mistakes personally.
[CONCERNED]

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.667
Actually, Wigglytuff
should be grateful.

Please, may I take
a look at this?

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:41.915
Sure you can.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.591
Yeah. That's who the book
is about.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.693
It tells the story of something

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:57.063
that apparently happened
right here.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:01.201
'Long ago, when there was a mass
outbreak of rampaging Flygon'

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:04.504

appeared.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.239

their anger.

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.693
Right, and that tale
is just one of the reasons

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:29.162
that Wigglytuff came to be
assistants at Pokémon Centers

the Kalos region, see?

Wigglytuff!

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:11.757
Salamence's moves
aren't doing a thing!

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.726
Wow! It's just like
from the book!

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:21.434
That's it! Wigglytuff's
a Fairy‐type, right?

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.437
'Dragon‐type moves have
no effect on Fairy‐types!'

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.038
'That's why the Wigglytuff
in the book'

‐ Huh!
‐ That's great!

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.499
Wigglytuff's Heal Pulse got
Salamence feeling normal again!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.234
Ha‐ha! Yes!

[HUMBLE]

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:25.564
‐ Well, that's a relief.
‐ That was a close shave.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.600
I thought I was talking toast.

Because of all of you
everybody's just fine now.

Thanks!
[PLEASED]

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.270
We didn't do anything.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.871
It's all thanks to Wigglytuff!

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.506
[IMPRESSED]

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:08.708
Right.
You were really amazing!

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.746
Wigglytuff, next time
I'm in a pinch like that

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:14.980
I really hope
you'll help me out again.

NARRATOR
After overcoming its anxiety

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:41.841
Wigglytuff is sure to make a
great assistant for Nurse Joy.

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.778
And soon, our Heroes will
again set a course for Coumarie
City

00:20:45.778 --> 00:20:48.614
and Ash's next Gym battle,
as the journey continues!
