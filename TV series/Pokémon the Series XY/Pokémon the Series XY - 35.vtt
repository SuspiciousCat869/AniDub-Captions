it's only able to glide.
That's not good.

Since it can't really fly,
it's a disadvantage.

Great job.
Keep giving it all you've got.

that's the real reason

Fletchling flew down like that.

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.067
It was pretending
to be cornered

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:43.402
but that was just a lure,
what a maneuver.

'cause of the Double Team.

‐ That's when it attacked.
‐ Way to go, Fletchling!
