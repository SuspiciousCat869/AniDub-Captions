Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:40.666
Surrender now or prepare
for a forest fight.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.368
Meowth, that's right!

[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:48.841

Team Rocket. Not you again.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.676
JESSIE
Well, the same goes for you.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.778
It's all part
of our groundbreaking

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.581
patent‐pending,
rare‐Pokémon‐stealing strategy.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.416
Of course, you're the ones

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.619
who set a trap
for Sudowoodo and Bonsly.

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:02.054
‐ Wow. He thinks.
‐ Ah.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.390
‐ Give Pikachu back.
‐ That didn't last long.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.125
[EXERTION]

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.928
Save your volts.

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:11.197
We used an insulated net

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.633
to catch the best
Twerp Pokémon we can get.

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:17.003
[ANGRY]
Pumpkaboo, get rid of that crew.

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:19.071

Dodge it!
[EXERTION]

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:35.154
Froakie. Use your Frubbles!

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:37.256
[FRUBBLES MOVE]

[FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.165
Pumpkaboo. Snap out of it.

Please, you should know

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.706
Fighting‐type moves
won't work on Ghost types.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.508
I'm one step ahead
of you guys.

00:17:55.508 --> 00:17:59.312
‐ One step?
‐ Froakie. Use Water Pulse!

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.380

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:08.087
‐ Yippee!
‐ Great strategy.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.822
They used Flying Press
to leave Pumpkaboo

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:12.124
open for a successful
Water Pulse.

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.826
The two of you
sure make awesome partners.

‐ Oh!
‐ Froakie, no!

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.318
Don't worry.
Froakie's fine.

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:40.953
'That was just a decoy
made out of Frubbles.'

Alright.
Time for Super Flying Cut.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.762

Super Flying Cut worked

just the way
it's supposed to.

This isn't looking good.

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:11.317
Maybe we should shelve
our strategy and call it a day.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.953
Huh! Aah!
