ASH
'Whoa, a huge Pok mon battle!'

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.174
And it's taking place
right here in town.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.643
‐ Wow!
‐ We should definitely go.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.211
[EXCITED]

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:14.548
‐ Wait! Is that..
‐ Huh?

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.417
It is! Diantha's doing
an exhibition battle.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.720
‐ Wonderful!
‐ Yeah.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.190
Awesome, alright!
So, who's Diantha, anyway?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.691
[groaning]

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.327
How can you not know who she is?

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.796
She's the strongest Trainer
in all of Kalos, that's who!

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.465
Yup, she's the champion.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.933
[PROUD]

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.301
Really? No kidding?

[AMAZED]

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
Diantha, the Champion, huh?
I'm psyched!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.075
Not only is Diantha
the Champion

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.679
she also happens to be
a world‐famous movie star.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.848
‐ Movie star?
‐ Just have a look up there!

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:50.217
ASH
Huh? Whoa.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:51.652
CLEMONT
That's her in the blockbuster

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.854
"My Sweet, Sweet Lady."'

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.589
'Elegant, with a dignified
presence!'

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.191
The all‐around perfect
leading lady.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.494
‐ I so admire her!
‐ I do, too!

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.495
‐ Yes!
‐ Huh?

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.297
That's it!

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.598
I'll challenge her!

[DETERMINED]

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:10.203
In that case, I'll ask her
to take care of Clemont for me!

NARRATOR
As our heroes continue

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.790
their journey
to Shalour City

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.826
and Ash's next
Gym battle challenge

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.663
they decided to go and meet
Diantha, the Champion!

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.264
Excuse me, I'd like
to get a word with Diantha.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.001
Everyone, settle down!

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.569
ASH
Check out that crowd!

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.338
Now, Diantha won't be
seeing anyone

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.241
or giving any interviews today.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.443
‐ Know what?
‐ We're out of luck.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.045
‐ Shall we go back?
‐ 'Hey,

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:25.746
‐ Huh?
‐ 'Over here!'

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.450
‐ Nice to see you.
‐ Huh!

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.485
Professor Sycamore?

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.922
'What are you doing here,
professor?'

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.891
There's only one reason for me
to be away from my lab.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.027
And what's that?

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:43.463
You're here to do research
on Mega Evolution, right?

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.067
Still as perceptive as ever,
Clemont. Exactly.

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.369
I'm doing extensive research
on Diantha's Gardevoir

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.705
and its Mega Evolution.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.241
‐ Oh!
‐ Wow, Gardevoir?

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.476
‐ It can really Mega Evolve?
‐ It sure can!

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.745
Wow. I wanna see!

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.914
Have you already seen Diantha,
professor?

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.116
‐ I have.
‐ Huh?

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:03.784
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
She's getting her makeup done

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.318

ASH SERENA BONNIE CLEMONT
Oh!

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:08.955
Diantha's on the other side
of that door!

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.058
Wow, wow, wow!

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:13.894
We are so unbelievably lucky!

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:17.297
Yes! I'm gonna go challenge her
to a battle!

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.466
Sorry to keep you waiting,
professor.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.235
Oh, dear, I see you have guests,
don't you?

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.171
‐ Oh. It's Diantha for real.
‐ Oh.

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:26.006
So pretty!

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.408
[chuckles]
Why, thank you.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:32.813
So, did you reconsider what
we spoke about earlier, Diantha?

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:36.249
You must mean about me lending
you this Key Stone, right?

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.585
Key Stone?

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.421
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:44.825
If there's anything else I can
help you with, I'd be happy to.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.227
But, this Key Stone is part of
the bond I have with Gardevoir.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.132
‐ Bond?
‐ I can't lend it to anyone.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.501
‐ Sorry.
‐ I understand how you feel..

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.870
But please..

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.906
Alright then, well,
how about the next time

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.275
I visit Lumiose City,
if I have some time‐‐

KATHI LEE
Not going to happen. No way!

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:07.147
Diantha's schedule
is already jam‐packed.

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.117
Right now, we haven't any plans
to visit Lumiose City.

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:11.852
Your expression is as cute
as ever

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:13.019

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.425
Why don't we discuss
this whole scheduling conflict

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.494
in a civilized way over
a little dinner?

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:22.796
KATHI LEE
No, thanks.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.732
You're on soon.
Are you all set to go?

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:28.168
Yes, you're all welcome to stay
for the exhibition battle.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.161
‐ Yeah!
‐ Yay, Diantha!

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:59.099
Professor, what's with
that Key Stone

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.067
you two were
talking about before?

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.336
You see, the Key Stone
is crucial for a Pokémon

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.006
to Mega Evolve.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:09.176
The stone a Trainer possesses
is called a Key Stone.

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:10.544
And the stone a Pokémon
possesses

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:12.179
is called a Mega Stone.

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.114
Key Stone and Mega Stone.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.483
Alright, Gardevoir, it's time.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.685
Let's show the fans
a spectacular battle.

'to protect a Trainer it has
made a deep connection with.'

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.371
Hey, look! Gardevoir's wearing
a pendant as well.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.840
Yeah, you're right!

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.342
That's Gardevoir's Mega Stone.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.011
Mega Stones have many different
names, depending on the Pokémon

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.180
that Mega Evolves.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.649
In Gardevoir's case, its Mega
Stone is known as Gardevoirite.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.689
I see! As long as you have both
a Key Stone and a Mega Stone

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.724
a Pokémon can Mega Evolve.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.494
‐ So cool.

of Trainer and Pokémon
become one.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.968
Hearts become one?

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.736
It means they need to have
an exceptionally

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.571
strong bond between them.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.373
Of course!

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.507
'That's what
Diantha meant when she said'

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.709
'the Key Stone is part
of their bond.'

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:21.314
Hmm, it sounds like
the Champion's Gardevoir

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.550
possesses the power
to Mega Evolve.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.553
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.989
Diantha's a great actress,
just like myself.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.658
Oh, how did I forget that?

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:36.296
A fellow great actress's Pokémon
is worthy to be my Pokémon.

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.633
And Gardevoir will be
my Pokémon, mark my word.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.768
Marked! In addition,
the Boss will love a Pokémon

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.036
that can Mega Evolve.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.838

Now, let the battle begin.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.960
You may go first, Magnus.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.917
by making eye contact.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.304
JAMES
Surrender now or prepare

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.606
for us in your face!

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.774
Meowth, on the case!

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:13.112
[PANIC]

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.415
Team Rocket!
You're doing it again?

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.417
They're a bunch of
really bad guys

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.685
who go around stealing
other people's Pokémon.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:23.022
They steal Pokémon?
What despicable people!

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:26.592
Why, thank you, we'll wear
that as a badge of honor.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.461
Since I'm the greatest actress
of all time

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.062
I accept your kind words.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.731
Quick, Gardevoir, Shadow Ball.

00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:33.433
[SHADOW BALL MOVE]

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:37.703
Oh, smashing.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.472
The only thing
getting in and out of this box

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:40.640
is sunlight, dig!

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.376
And, curtain up!

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:45.478
[all screaming]

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.413
MEOWTH
Bye‐bye, chump guys!

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.916
[coughing]

00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:52.418
‐ Ah, they're gone.
‐ They flew away.

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.621
Don't worry,
I'll take us right to them.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.323
PROFESSOR SYCAMORE
Diantha, wait, do you know

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.025
where Gardevoir is?

00:15:59.025 --> 00:15:59.926
Yes.

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:07.133
[panting]

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:10.136
BONNIE
Come on, Clemont, hurry up!

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.871
It happened when I was
in the Lapidarian Highlands

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.973
for a film shoot.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.175
Whoa! That's one of the last
unexplored regions in the world.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:18.644
Yes, that's right.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.246
A thick fog
rolled into the area

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:20.913
while we were shooting.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.850
Huh.

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:28.688
Huh?

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:41.133
It's Gardevoir.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.301
[HAPPY]

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.439
KATHI LEE
Diantha!

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:49.609
[CALM]

00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:51.177
DIANTHA
Later, my manager Kathi Lee

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.712
told me that Gardevoir

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.481
had appeared
from its Poké Ball on its own.

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.918
It then guided everyone to
exactly where I had gotten lost.

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:01.354
Hm, could the stones be
responsible for what happened?

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.389
I wonder..

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.324
Maybe Diantha's and Gardevoir's
hearts were connected

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.159
and called out to each other.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.362
Did you say it was our hearts?

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.597
‐ I think Ash is right.
‐ Yup.

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.333
Hmm, huh?

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.167
Gardevoir's up ahead.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.138
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.006
ASH
It's them!

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.912
So, let's review, this Gardevoir
can Mega Evolve.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:28.080
And once it's safely
into the Boss's hands

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.482
we'll evolve into big shots.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:31.684
A major mega‐promotion!

00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.253
[laughing]

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:35.154
JESSIE/JAMES
'Hey!'

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.956
There they are..

00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:38.858
Ash, I want you all
to stay here.

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:40.493
‐ Uh, but..
‐ It'll be fine.

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:45.698
Alright, you listen.

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:48.367
I want my Gardevoir.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:51.404
‐ How'd she find us?
‐ Ha! The how means nothing!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.874
We'll just see, now, Gardevoir!

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:56.943
Let's show them a few things
about a strong bond.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.278
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.821
[EXERTION]

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.362
‐ Look at that light..
‐ Is it..

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:18.798
It is! That's when a Pokémon
Mega Evolves.

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:21.300
Gardevoir, now Mega Evolve!

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.936
[EVOLVING]

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:38.818
[PROUD]

00:18:38.818 --> 00:18:41.420
‐ Yeah, check it out!
‐ Wow! It Mega Evolved!

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.189
‐ What a sight.
‐ Excellent.

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:45.625
‐ It's so coo.
‐ Marvelous.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.460
JESSIE
Uh, I think we're in trouble.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.961
MEOWTH
Chill! Our box can deal with

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.896
'anything
that galoot dishes out!'

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.898
Use Shadow Ball.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.433
[SHADOW BALL MOVE]

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.837
[explosion]

00:18:57.837 --> 00:18:58.738
[screaming]

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.777
‐ Our box is junk.
‐ Such pompous power.

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:06.879
And checkmate!
Excellent work.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.714
Use Moon Blast.

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.583
[MOON BLAST MOVE]

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:15.154
‐ Let's beat a hasty retreat.
‐ Step on it.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.189
[MOON BLAST MOVE]

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.428
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
We're blasting off again!

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.165
‐ Awesome!
‐ You did it!

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.601
[laughing]
[PROUD]

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.205
‐ Huh?
‐ Hey, look, it changed back!

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.508
Right, what makes
Mega Evolution different

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.009
from ordinary Evolution
is it isn't permanent.

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:41.047
[all gasping]

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:42.415
That's what I call
perfect timing.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.785
Diantha!

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:46.786
[chuckles]

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:53.059
Ash, I realize
we weren't able to

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:55.327
finish our battle together,
but it was fun.

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:56.762
I thought it was fun, too!

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:57.997
PIKACHU
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:57.997 --> 00:20:00.566
Thanks so much to all of you.

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.101
SERENA
Will we ever see you again?

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:04.737
BONNIE
I wanna talk to you more.

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.472
Now, you shouldn't bother her
like that!

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:07.473
DIANTHA
I'm sorry. I have a movie shoot

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:09.575
to get to.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.944
I want to thank you for showing
me the bond that's so crucial

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.180
for a Pokémon to Mega Evolve.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.515
I'm glad I was able to help.
Take care!

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:22.588
ASH
Diantha?

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.758
Right now, I'm training really
hard to enter the Kalos League!

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:29.128
So, when I win,
will you battle with me again?

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:32.064
That's a tall order!
But, that's the spirit.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.033
Yes! I look forward to it!

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:38.671
NARRATOR
An encounter with Diantha

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:40.372
has given our heroes

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.742
and Professor Sycamore
a deeper look

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.010
into the mysteries
of Mega Evolution!

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.246
Now, it's off once again
to Shalour City

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.281
as the journey continues!

00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:58.724
