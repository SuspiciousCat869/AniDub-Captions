‐ Huh!
‐ Huh!

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.337
Thank you for waiting.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.539
Your Pikachu and Fletchling
are now fully recovered

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.274
and feeling fine.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.715
That's great.

00:16:55.715 --> 00:16:58.084
‐ Thank you, Nurse Joy.
‐ It's my pleasure.

[HAPPY]

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:02.655
Fletchling and Pikachu,
this is Serena.

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.390
She was with Clemont
and Bonnie watching us battle.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.793
[GREETING]

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.129
Hi, you two.
Nice to meet you.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:13.232
Huh? I just realized something.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.101
Nurse Joy, how did you get
to the Pokémon Center

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:16.335
from Route 4 without passing me?

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.404
Huh?

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.072
But is that the Nurse Joy
you met on Route 4?

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:22.341
Couldn't be!

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:25.011
I would think the Nurse Joy you
met on Route 4 was my cousin.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.680
‐ Your cousin?
‐ I knew it.

NURSE JOY 'Here's a photo

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.819
Wow, it's the same in Kalos too.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:36.055
Incredible!

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:39.025
Oh, right! I was hoping you'd
look at my Pokémon too.

Whoa. Never seen that Pokémon.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.402
POKEDEX
Fennekin. The Fox Pokémon.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.571
'Fennekin expels
hot air that can reach'

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.872
'nearly four hundred degrees.'

00:17:52.872 --> 00:17:54.173
'It likes to snack on twigs. '

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.741
[Bonnie laughs]

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.977
I guess it's a Fire‐type
Pokémon, right?

00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.946
‐ And it's so cute.
‐ Yeah.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:01.347
I got it from
Professor Sycamore.

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:03.482
Professor Sycamore, huh?

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.885
CLEMONT
'You see, Fennekin
is one of three Pokémon'

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.687
'that new Trainers
may choose from.'

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:11.190
Therefore, I can deduce
that you're a new Trainer.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.859
Right.
I just started my journey.

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.262
I'll be glad to
look at Fennekin.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.831
Please wait right here while
I perform a thorough exam.

ASH
'Alexa.'

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.273
It looks like Pikachu
and Fletchling

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.374
are fully recovered.

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.309
Let me guess

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.744
you're going to
start training right away?

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:33.145
Of course I am.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.413
You want to help me out?

Noivern can use Gust too.

One of our
problems with Viola was

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:57.236
we couldn't get past
Vivillon's Gust.

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.071
So let's try to
keep our balance.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.207
