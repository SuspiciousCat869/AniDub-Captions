If we don't hurry, we won't get

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.648
to the Pokémon Center
before the sun sets.

Then we can just camp out.
No big deal!

‐ Don't you have your gear?

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:25.626
Well, actually, my mom told me
this might happen

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.694
but I never really considered
that I'd end up

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.130
having to sleep
outside for real.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.599
I brought an extra
sleeping bag with me

so you're welcome
to use it if you like.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.736

It's great!
You're really a great cook!

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.031

Cooking's a lot like inventing.

Now, who has room for dessert?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.117
Yesterday when we stayed at the
Pokémon Center, I made macarons!

‐ No!
‐ Oh, man.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.138
Uh, that's so weird.
Could I have dropped them?

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.008
‐ I hope not.

But what are you doing here,
I wonder?

Hey! Chespin!

I'm really starting
to get really worried.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:23.603
I wonder if Chespin was really
shocked after losing so bad.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.139
It's my fault.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.541
I was the one who forced
Chespin to have a battle

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.543
after it had eaten
all of those macarons

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.879
and now it doesn't like me
anymore.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.815
Chespin must've run away.
I know it.

‐ Maybe.

So, why isn't Chespin with you?

Doesn't matter.
I left Chespin where it was.

looked really happy.

‐ What are you talking about?

it will help me grow

that it is.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.180
[WILL‐O‐WISP MOVE]

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.082
Chespin!
Keep rolling and dodging.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.750
[DETERMINED]/[EXERTION]

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.752
Wow, it's working!

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.554
Now Chespin's starting
to move faster and faster.

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.823
Yay, Chespin! Way to go!

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.925
Chespin, feeling good?
[CONFIDENT]

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.160
Use Tackle.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.528
[TACKLE MOVE]/[EXERTION]

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.968
Alright! Now Chespin's moving
like its regular self.

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:43.469
[PROUD]

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.670
Let's keep it up.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.705
Use Vine Whip!

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:47.306
[VINE WHIP MOVE]

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.978
‐ That won't work on us.
‐ Oh, oh, no.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:54.046
Use Flamethrower!

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.314
[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.184
[PAINED]

00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:01.654
‐ Oh! Chespin!
‐ Oh!

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.228
Please, Chespin.
You've just got to get up.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.497
'I believe in you.'
[STRUGGLING]

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:12.965
Get up. You can do it.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.601
[STRUGGLING]

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.707
What's that?
[AMAZED]

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.810
Overgrow.
Chespin's Special Ability.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.580
When Chespin's in bad shape, its
Grass‐type moves get stronger.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.648
[TRIUMPHANT]

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.784
Yes!
It's time to really show 'em.

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.452
[HAPPY]

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.488
Vine Whip, let's go.
[DETERMINED]

00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:37.356
[VINE WHIP MOVE]

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.959
[PAINED]

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.561
[SHOCKED]

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.797
Great! That's the way to do it.
[PROUD]

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.366
I've still got a trick
or two up my sleeve.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.402
I didn't think
I'd need to use this

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.671
but I'm gonna
and that'll be that.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.674
But Wylie!
You're going to use that move?

00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:57.543
It's much too dangerous
to use and you know it.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:01.280
Now you be quite.
There's no going back now.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.583
Huh, sounds like a
super‐strong move that could

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.952
hurt the Pokémon who uses it.
[SHOCKED]

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.887
Heads up.
[NERVOUS]

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.623
Now, Mystical Fir..

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:12.858
[groans]

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:16.095
My‐my‐my back! Aah!

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:19.065
Huh? Sir, are you alright?

00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:20.166
[CONCERNED]

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:22.234
Oh, dear.

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.337
Now didn't I tell you
you'd hurt yourself, Wylie?

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.305
Poor thing.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.774
I see. She meant Wylie'd
get hurt, not the Pokémon.

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:30.309
[RELIEVED]

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.548
I'd say that's enough
battling for one day, Wylie.

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:38.784
Huh! I guess I'll let you
have this victory.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.020
Well, I suppose we should just
call it a draw.

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:45.825
I'm really sorry that we ended
up dragging all of you

00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:47.760
nice folks into our little
family squabble.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.462
We had a fight yesterday.

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:54.400
Really going after that
soup, aren't you?

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.569
What do you mean by that?

00:18:56.569 --> 00:18:59.438
Are you insinuating
that I'm eating too much?

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:03.476
Nope. I'm just saying a little
restraint's healthy.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.145
Oh, yeah? Well, there'll be no
dinner for you tonight!

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.114
Hey! Come on.

00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:12.451
[laughing]

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:14.186
Oh. What's that?

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:17.023
Well, you see..

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.395
I bought it for you with
the hopes that we could make up.

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:25.231
Wylie. Now, isn't that sweet?

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.600
I bet you were gonna apologize

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.535
whether I won or lost,
weren't you?

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:31.604
'Course I was.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:37.109
Well, then, I think we
should all eat Wylie's apology!

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.778
‐ What do you say?
‐ You mean it?

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.546
‐ Alright!
‐ Delish!

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:41.580
Yay!

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:48.487
Chespin dear,
I can't thank you enough.

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:51.157
I'd say you're a very lucky
Pokémon to have teamed up

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:52.525
with such a good
and caring Trainer.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.460
[HAPPY]

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.529
So you didn't run away
because you don't like me?

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.663
[DISAGREEING]

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:00.199
Wow. You do.

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:03.169
You like me, Chespin.

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:05.504
Clemont, looks to me like you
imagined the whole thing.

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:07.740
I could tell how much Chespin

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.142
cares about you by watching
the two of you in that battle.

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.644
Oh, yeah.
You were great.

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:12.578
[IMPRESSED]

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.548
You're my special partner.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.283
I hope you and I can be
friends forever.

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:18.517
[HAPPY]

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.153
Thanks for everything.

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.355
‐ Come back anytime.
‐ Right.

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.990
[FRIENDLY]

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.625
NARRATOR And so,

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.828
a brief misunderstanding
has helped

00:20:28.828 --> 00:20:30.996
Clemont and Chespin strengthen
the bond between them

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.399
another happy ending
in our heroes'

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.068
many exciting adventures,
as the journey continues.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.040
'It looks like
it's getting dark.'

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.842
[DISAPPOINTED]

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:44.944
Yeah, it doesn't
look like we'll get

00:20:44.944 --> 00:20:46.746
to the Pokémon Center
tonight either.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:50.015
I have an idea.
Let's just camp out.

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.584
I thought of some more
Pokémon to imitate.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:52.318
