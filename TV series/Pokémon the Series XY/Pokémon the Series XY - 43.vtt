to perfect Tierno's rhythmic

for his Gym Battle against
Korrina

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.152
Ash was ultimately unable
to contain his excitement.

Now, after his decision
to challenge the Gym

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.757

Now, let's get that

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.727
Battle rhythm. A mystery.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.597
Nothing mysterious about it.
You saw it.

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:39.633
[chuckles]
That's why it's a mystery.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.501

Alright, Mr. Confidence,

a real rivalry.

Let's have a great battle,

[INTENT]

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.331
Ash is having so much fun.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.300
That's true,
but I wonder how useful

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.469
that rhythmic battle style
will be.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.105
You're worried that Ash
can't dance, right?

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.240
As soon as Ash saw Korrina,
he stopped trying

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.442
to perfect
his rhythmic battle style.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.211
From that point on,
you could say Korrina

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.313
got Ash completely off his game.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.815
‐ Huh?
‐ Oh. Stop!

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.418
Hey, whose side
are you on anyway?

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.087
Bonnie, the real action
in a Gym Battle begins

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.589
from the very moment
a Trainer challenges a Gym.

Alright, then, Ash,

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.242
Don't disappoint us, Korrina.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.817
Let's get our Shalour Gym
strategy rolling.

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:07.688
One, two, one, two,

‐ Hawlucha's doing it.
‐ That's great.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.225
But doesn't Ash need
to dance, too?

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.094
[HAPPY]

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.230
Would you look at that?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.498

Hawlucha's rhythm.

Yup. There you go with
that mysterious rhythm.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.674
But now what are you
gonna do with it?

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.976

It doesn't look like
Hawlucha can do anything.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.667
[PAINED]

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.335
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go!

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.871
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.808
A Thunderbolt after getting hit?

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.109
That's our unique
battle style.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.012
Aura Sphere!

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.149
M LUCARIO/PIKACHU
[AURA SPHERE MOVE]/[ALARMED]

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.151
[PAINED]

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:27.353
No, Pikachu.

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.387
[gasping]

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:34.460
[EAGER]

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.729
Pikachu, can you get up?

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:39.131
[STRUGGLING]/[DETERMINED]

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.269
Looking good,
Ash and Pikachu.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.371
[IMPRESSED]

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.073
That's 'cause I'm gonna
win that badge.

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:48.508
Lucario, Metal Sound.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.276
[METAL SOUND MOVE]
[STRUGGLING]

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.911
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt

00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:53.546
and wipe out that Metal Sound.

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.915
[AFFIRMATIVE]/[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:16:57.884 --> 00:16:59.685
[PAINED]

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.489
Some power play.
Aura Sphere.

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.858
If Pikachu gets hit
after that Metal Sound..

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.228
[AURA SPHERE MOVE]

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:12.164
Pikachu, use Iron Tail
and knock down that Aura Sphere.

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:15.601
[IRON TAIL MOVE]/[EXERTION]
[gasps]

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:17.069
‐ Look at that.
‐ What was it?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.238
Remember from the Cyllage Gym?

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.339
CLEMONT
Draco Meteor climb.

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:25.011
How is that even possible?

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.480
Jump, Lucario. Use Bone Rush.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.448
Iron Tail, let's go!

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.517
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.486
PIKACHU/ LUCARIO
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:37.823
[grunting]

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:43.796
PIKACHU/M LUCARIO
[DETERMINED]

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:46.832
‐ They're both standing.
‐ That's incredible.

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.535
Lucario took the hit from
Iron Tail before it reached

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.171
full speed and doing that kept
the damage it took to a minimum.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.740
Ash and Pikachu, you're amazing.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.108
Using our move
like a springboard

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:58.077
to make a super high jump.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.212
I thought that would be enough
to wrap this up.

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:02.315
You're a tough one, Korrina.

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:04.584
But it is almost time
to wrap this up.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.752
Use Power‐Up Punch.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.721
Go on, Pikachu, Iron Tail.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:11.223
PIKACHU [IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.428
Electro Ball!

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.829
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:19.298
Aura Sphere, go.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.900
LUCARIO
[AURA SPHERE MOVE]

00:18:22.535 --> 00:18:23.936
Finish this with Thunderbolt.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.439
[THUNDER BOLT MOVE]

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:29.775
[SHOCKED]

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:32.311
[SATISFIED]

00:18:33.713 --> 00:18:34.647
[gasps]

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.588
Hmm.

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.992
Lucario is unable to battle.
Pikachu wins.

00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:49.028
Which means, the match goes
to Ash, the challenger.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:51.831
[gasps]
Yes! Ha. Pikachu.

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.600
[RELIEVED]

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.403
You were awesome, buddy.

00:18:57.403 --> 00:19:00.606
Congratulations, Ash and
Pikachu. You did it.

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:01.741
That was the most exciting
battle ever.

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.576
[EMPHATIC]

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:06.278
And once again,
you managed to surprise me.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.413
Well, you can thank
Pikachu for that.

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.982
[TOUCHED]

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.785
You battled well, Lucario.

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:14.687
‐ 'Korrina.'
‐ Huh?

00:19:14.687 --> 00:19:15.955
That was a fine battle.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.359
Ash deserves
all the credit for that.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.229
Pikachu and all his other
Pokémon are awesome.

00:19:23.229 --> 00:19:24.797
You and I still have
a lot of work to do.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:27.299
[OPTIMISTIC]

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:30.069
Don't forget, as Gym Leader, you
still have a duty to perform.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.003
Right.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:33.806
Ash?

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.778
This proves your victory
at the Shalour Gym.

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:41.347
The Rumble Badge. Congrats.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:43.883
Thanks a lot, Korrina.

00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:46.519
Alright. I just
won the Rumble Badge.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.187
[EXCITED]

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:58.164
'And now it's on
to badge number four.'

00:19:58.164 --> 00:19:59.899
ASH
'Right.'

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:00.866
So where do you plan
on going next?

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.002
Uh, not sure.

00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:06.539
Coumarine City
is the closest city from here.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.075
Wow. Coumarine City's
got a monorail.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.777
Yay! I wanna ride.

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:14.814
The Gym Leader there
is quite a thorny opponent.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.949
Yeah, but if anybody can handle
it, that'll be Ash.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.085
[laughs]

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:21.020
Then it's off to Coumarine City.
What do you say, buddy?

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.354
[EAGER]

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.657
‐ 'Ash?'
‐ Huh?

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:27.193
'I promise I'm gonna make
the Shalour Gym'

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:29.462
'even more passionate
than it is now.'

00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:31.197
You make sure
you come back soon.

00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:33.165
Yeah. I will.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:39.004
NARRATOR
And so, Ash's Shalour City

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:42.141
Gym battle challenge has
come to a victorious end.

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:45.711
Ash has his third Kalos Gym
badge, the Rumble Badge.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.681
Now, with their sights
set on Coumarine City

00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:50.349
our heroes' journey
continues.
