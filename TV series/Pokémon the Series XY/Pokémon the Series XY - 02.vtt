So what's the deal
with Froakie's Trainer?

What happened that would make
him give Froakie up?

Well, one of my
numerous responsibilities

is to give Trainers
their very first Pokémon.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:23.697
Froakie's a Pokémon
meant for new Trainers.

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.533
But this particular Froakie
is a bit different

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.770
refusing to listen to its
Trainer during battle.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.072
There have been times
when Froakie ran away

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.974
simply because it didn't
like its Trainer!

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.009
And several Trainers
have come back to my lab

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.377

I'm sure Froakie acts
that way for a reason.

So Froakie's had a hard life.

SYCAMORE Well, if I
told you that Pokémon

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:15.201
may have an additional
evolutionary stage

what would you say?

Are you serious?

00:07:18.338 --> 00:07:20.941
So you're saying that Garchomp
can still evolve?

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.076
Possibly. That's my research.

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.679
‐ Whoa!
‐ Unbelievable.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.247
There have been several reports

about different Pokémon
evolving in a way

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.952
that we researchers refer
to as Mega Evolution.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:35.188
Mega Evolution?

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:38.992
A lot of the mechanics
are still a mystery

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:41.461
but we believe
that a strong bond

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.763
between Pokémon and Trainer,
as well as a special stone
