Are you stuck?

[AKARI] I'm fine, it's just
Aria's coming to visit,

16
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,083
so I'm trying to clean up.

17

Do you know where the vacuum is
or if we even own one?

18

I've been at it all morning,

Good morning!

I'm your new roommate.

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll be staying here a while.

34
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,541
[AKARI] Huh?
How long is a while?

35
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,250
You fled for your safety?

36
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,750
Yep.

37
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,625
It's all because there's been
a series of attacks lately

38
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,083
targeting Butei.

39
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,583
Including me, I'm afraid.

40
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,083
Miss Takamagahara's
the one who said

41
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,541
to lay low for a while.

42
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,000
She says that I could
especially be in danger

43
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,875
due to all the
bad guys I've caught.

44
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,708
There are bound to be
some who get released

45
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,416
and then come
after me for revenge.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,041
[AKARI] But the number of
crimes you've solved

47
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,333
should give you the
confidence to get through this.

48
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,291
It's like that they hate you
means you must be

49
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,541
the best Butei.

50
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,541
Don't know about that,
but thanks.

51
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,708
Anyway, that's the reason
I need to stay with you guys.

52
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,791
It's also a good chance
for me to observe you

53
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,291
in your day-to-day life.

Yes, ma'am! I agree!

We'll do whatever it takes to
make our home into your home!

It's small, but there's nothing
we can't change for you.

Just ask.

Whoa, hey, I won't
boss you around.

would that make me?

No parents. Living alone.

There are bad guys
out there gunning for her.

65

low until it all blows over.

So outside school,
you're with her all the time?

Do you even have room for her?

It's fine.

We're not there that
much during the day,

and at night she'll
sleep with me.

[SHINO]
No!

73

It's weird to have my
mentor in my house,

but it should be lots of fun.

We can do all the cooking
and shopping together.

76
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,458
And along the way I'll really
get to pick her brain.

There are so many things
I can't wait to ask her

78

to come along with you.

I normally don't get to

Almost every piece of clothing
I wear is custom-made.

And for food, I eat out,
or have it delivered.

Well, we better get going.

[AKARI]
Well...

From there, you'll
work your way up

204
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,958
to becoming her partner.

205
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,833
You'll travel
around the country,

206
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,541
and pull off secret ops
with cool code names.

[AKARI]
Yep!

See, I've realized that
I even if I learn under you,

and train as hard,
or harder, than you...

216
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,458
Well, it still won't be enough
to make me as good as you.

You really wanna
be like me that bad?

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,458
[AKARI]
Yes! I do!

219
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,875

But why?

00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:17,791
[AKARI]
"Why"?

221
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,166
Well, uh...

222
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,333
Because I admire you. Yeah.

223
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,583
And because you're
the perfect Butei!

224
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,708
[ARIA] But there are plenty
of other S-Ranked Butei

[AKARI]
Uh... Well...

Because of your sense of honor,
you follow the full Butei Code!

You could easily be
a super deadly S Rank.

But you never hurt
the criminals you capture.

Hang on.
This is a lot to process.

she started running

[ARIA]
Reki!

322
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,083
[RAIKA] So this whole
gun fight came out of

323
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,666
some robbers wanting to
retaliate against Aria?

324
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,166
[TAKACHIHO]
Huh...

325
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,041
[TAKAMAGAHARA] The police
said they're part of a larger

326
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,916
bank robbing gang she foiled.

327
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,958
So it's a simple revenge hit.

328
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,875
[SHINO] Wait, it's just
a coincidence, and not related

329
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,833
to all the other Butei attacks?

330
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,166
[TAKAMAGAHARA]
We'll have to investigate more,

331
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,291
but at the moment, no,
it doesn't look like it.

332
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,833
Anyway, you all did great.

333
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,625
I see everyone's ranks
moving up soon.

334
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,333
[KIRIN]
What about Akari?

335
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,208
[RAIKA] They'll probably
come down pretty hard,

336
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,083
since Aria almost got killed
because she hesitated.

337
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
[TAKACHIHO] I'll take it
upon myself to cheer her up

338
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,416
with words of encouragement.

339
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,208
And my hands, if she lets me.

340
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,541
Poor Akari.

341
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,250
[ARIA]
Akari.

342
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,083
[AKARI]
Yes, ma'am!

343
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,416
I appreciate you
coming to assist me.

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
It kept the bad guys
off-balance.

345
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,416
So let's focus on
the positives first.

346
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,333
And then talk with your friends
on where you can improve.

347
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,083
Anyway, excellent effort.

348
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,708
Thank you for saying that.

349
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,750
I was worried you were
really gonna lay into me

350
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,250
for hesitating with my gun.

351
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,208
Know what I mean?

352
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,750
Oh! That's right!

353
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,875
[AKARI] I didn't get this back
from you on my own, so...

354
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,583
You don't have
to do that, Akari.

355
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,541
[AKARI gasps]

356
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,666
Your Amica test is done.

357
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,958
It doesn't feel right
to make you mine now.

358
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,291
[AKARI gasps]

359
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,125
I think the best thing for
you would be to transfer

360
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,333
to a department where
they don't use firearms.

361
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,916
You should hand in the
form for that tomorrow morning.

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,791
Um... Is this...

363
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,708
...all because I hesitated
to shoot that one guy?

364
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,041
Don't worry, I swear I
won't lose my nerve again!

365
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,250
That's not the only
reason you should transfer.

366
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,583
What?

367
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,291
Because you didn't shoot,
I was able to see

368
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,916
that you and I are
different types of Butei.

369
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,625
Even different types
of women altogether.

370
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,333
[AKARI]
Wait...

371
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,166
What does that mean?

372
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,500
[ARIA]
It means I finally understand

373
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,750
what I've been feeling
since we first met.

374
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,041
That while I work best alone,

375
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,708
you work best in
a team of friends.

376
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,500
Even if you mastered
everything about me,

377
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,791
you wouldn't gain much,
as a Butei or a person.

378
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,875
I would!

379
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,708
[ARIA]
Stop trying to be another Aria.

380
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,166
Instead, you need
to follow the path

381
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,458
that lets you be the best Akari.

382
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,250
There's so much
I can learn from you!

383
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,083
Being your Amica's
what's best for me!

384
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,333
You're perfect!

385
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,541
But there are so many
things that I can't do.

386
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,750
It should be obvious
I'm not perfect.

387
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,166
That you can't see that

388
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,500
just tells me how little
you know about me.

389
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,375
Then I'll have to work harder!

390
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,750
Whatever it takes to become
your partner, I'll do it.

391
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,000
No questions asked! Okay?

392
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,750
Then why didn't you shoot
that guy when I told you to?

393
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,166
[AKARI gasps]

394
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,500
And I'm not saying you should
have killed him, either.

395
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,291
If you couldn't even
manage to fire into the air

396
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
to scare him,
what makes you think

397
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,041
you can be my partner?

398
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
But there's another
bigger reason

399
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,333
why I won't make you my Amica.

400
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,166
I'm always working some
of the most dangerous cases.

401
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,708
If you're by my side,

402
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,083
that'll just put you in danger
of getting hurt, or worse.

403
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,916
That... doesn't scare me.

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,541
I still wanna do it!

405
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,708
[ARIA]
Be honest with yourself.

406
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,666
You were relieved when
Reki shot that guy for you.

407
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,583
And you even said
one of the biggest reasons

408
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,583
you admire me is because
I don't shoot to kill.

409
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,583
[AKARI]
Aria, no...

410
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,250
[ARIA] I've known for
a while you've been hiding

411
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,416
something from me.

412
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,666
Something big.

413
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,291
And I think now's the
time to finally bring it

414
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,750
out into the light.

415
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,708
So, I want you to shoot,
right here, right now.

416
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,916
[AKARI]
I can't.

00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,208
No!

left eye, throat, and heart.

Every single shot
is a kill shot.

422

[AKARI] If I had shot
when you told me to...

423
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,791
That perp, he would be dead.

424
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,500
Even a Butei shouldn't
have a skill this perfect!

425

426

[AKARI sobbing]

428
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,875
[KYOCHIKUTOU] I heard you used
another diversionary tactic.

429
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,000
[RIKO] Yep! I paid off some
more useless small fries.

430
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,041
And it worked.

431
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,875
They kept Aria
and Reki tied down,

432
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,583
and we got exactly
what we needed.

433
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,916
So, our operation
can officially begin.

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,583
We can start abducting
or killing our targets.

435
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,000
Mine is, of course,

436
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,750
my dear old friend Aria Kanzaki.

437
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,708
And I need you to
eliminate her sooner

438
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,833
rather than later.

439
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,250
It's hard for me to do my work

440
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,958
when there's an S-ranked Butei
running around the city.

441
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,875
[RIKO]
Don't worry about me and Aria.

442
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,375
Piece of cake.
What about your end?

443
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,833
[KYOCHIKUTOU] A poisonous
flower is about to bloom.

So yes, you're right.
It's time for me to begin.

445
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,291
[RIKO] I think it's best
if we go radio silent

00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,750
from here on out.

447
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,125
Even if you get in trouble,
don't come running to me.

448
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,250
[KYOCHIKUTOU] I'm glad my sister
came all the way out here

00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,708
to meet us.

450
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,458
Mine is an easy job, Riko.

451
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,083
Like pulling out a weed.

452
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,208
The name of the
person I will kill...

453
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,458
...is Akari Mamiya.

Move! Two gunshot wounds--

The most perfect Butei ever!

I want it.

I want it more than I've
ever wanted anything.
