1
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,875
[AKARI] What can I say?
I've got a dream.

2
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,958
[ARIA] I'm a Butei.
You need to surrender now.

3
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,375
I'll go ahead and request
an Amica contract with Aria!

4
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,708
[RAIKA] It's a two-person cell
training system at our school.

5
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,458
Combine the kanji for war
with the one for siblings

6
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,000
and it reads Amica.

7
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,208
[AKARI] The program is designed
to give you direct training

8
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,208
from an upperclassman
for an entire year!

9
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,833
[ARIA] If you can defeat me,
you can become my Amica.

10
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,541
Like I said,
I believe that everyone

11
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,708
should be given an equal chance.

12
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,458
Although, the results
will not be equal.

13
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,416
That's just a simple fact.

14
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,375
[gasps]

15
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,083
[ARIA]
You passed the test, y'know?

16
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,375
What?

17
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,208
But you're not officially
my Amica yet, okay?

18
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,583
You'll be in training.

19
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,583
And if you still want the
contract, in that case,

20
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,291
you'll have to actually
get this gun back from me.

21
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,000
Until you manage that,
you'll be my personal assistant.

22
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,375
Work for you?

23
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,750
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Of course it does!

24
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,125
Anything to work for you, Aria!

25
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,791
Let's see, which team
are we fighting against?

26
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,750
There we are!

27
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,958
Wait, Takachiho.

28
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,083
[TAKACHIHO] And you call
yourself a Butei.

29
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,291
You're so pathetic.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,541
[AKARI] Because Takachiho
told me that I can't do it.

31
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,708
[ARIA]
She did?

32
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,125
[AKARI] She used
the phrase you told me

33
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,541
to remove from my vocabulary.

34
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,291
[ARIA] I'll be on
the Quartet sidelines,

35
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,291
so make sure you win, okay?

36
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,416
[AKARI]
Mm!

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
[KIRIN]
Okay. One more time.

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,166
In order to win, we have to
touch Team Takachiho's eye flag

39
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,166
with an attack flag
before they get to ours.

40
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,458
As we discussed in our plan,

41
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,500
I went ahead and buried
our eye flag to hide it.

42
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,125
I recommend that we keep our
bee flags under our clothes.

43
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,541
[RAIKA]
Yup, already done it.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,208
Safest place to keep 'em
from getting snapped.

45
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,958
[KIRIN] Akari and Shino
will handle the offense.

46
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,458
Raika and I will take defense
and guard the buried flag.

47
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,833
Keep in mind, Akari,

48
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,708
there's a pretty good chance
they'll hide their flag

49
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,041
in a secure place like a locker.

50
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,875
Well, good thing I brought
a skeleton key with me.

51
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,333
[YUYU] I've confirmed
our enemy's location.

52
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,708
[YAYA] It appears that they
have an all-purpose key.

53
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,833
Go on, what else have you found?

54
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,208
[YUYU] Akari Mamiya and
Shino Sasaki are the attackers.

55
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,125
Raika Hino and Kirin Shima
will be taking defense.

56
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,125
Just what I expected of them.

57
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,250
You two go now and
take your positions.

58
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,833
[YUYU, YAYA]
Yes, Miss Urara!

59
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,166
[TAKACHIHO]
Oh, Akari.

60
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,416
Can you and your loser
friends make it this far?

61
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
[TAKACHIHO laughing]

62
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,541
All right then, Akari.
Let's do this.

63
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,875
[AKARI]
Mm.

64
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,666
[AKARI] I can't forget
that Aria's observing me

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,916
from somewhere.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,875
I've gotta do my best.

67
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,500
We're exposed out here,

68
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,791
but it's the only way
to get to their base.

69
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,833
Be careful of ambushes.

70
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,666
[AKARI] I know this area
like the back of my hand,

71
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,666
but it feels so eerie right now.

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,833
[thud]

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,416
[YUYU, YAYA]
Take this!

74
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,375
Ow!

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,625
Akari!

76
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:05,833
[gasps]

77
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,541
You..

78
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,208
...degenerate thief!

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,666
[YUYU groaning]

80
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,291
Two against one?

81
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,750
[groaning]

82
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,583
That's my kind of fight! Akari!

83
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,666
You keep on moving,
I'll take care of them!

84
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,166
You sure?

85
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,958
Let's win this!

86
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,583
[AKARI] Kirin!
Are you there? It's Akari!

87
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,125
[KIRIN]
Oh, is there something wrong?

88
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:04,125
We ran into the creepy twins.
I made it through alone.

89
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,000
Shino's holding them back
for me. Any updates?

90
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,791
Nope, all quiet on our end.

91
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,708
[AKARI] Good to hear. I'm
headed to the enemy lines!

92
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,000
Roger that.

93
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,208
The twins apparently tried
to ambush our girls,

94
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
but they failed.

95
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,583
If they went with only
one defender though,

96
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,166
they might still have another
attacker out there.

97
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,791
[HINA]
We do.

98
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,958
[gasps]

99
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,083
[HINA]
And you're looking at her.

100
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,708
[RAIKA]
Hina Fuma!

101
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,791
[RAIKA] It's not gonna
be easy dealing with her.

102
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,083
[KIRIN gasps]

103
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,833
[whimpers]

104
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,583
I'll protect my Amica.

105
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,125
Oh, Raika!

106
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,416
[HINA]
Y'know, Kirin,

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,250
you should've washed
the dirt from your hands.

108
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,208
You obviously buried the flag.

109
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,791
[gasps]

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,708
You've got good eyes.

111
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,583
But I suggest...

112
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,083
...you focus on me!

113
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,500
[HINA]
Eyes are too easy to deceive.

114
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,875
[RAIKA]
I can't see!

115
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,416
Please be careful!

116
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,375
[gasps]

117
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,500
[ARIA]
Hey. It's me.

118
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,875
Yeah. That's right.

119
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,750
I've got something I could
use your help with.

120
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,458
Mm-hm. Thanks.

121
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,958
[TAKACHIHO]
So, you're the one who made it.

122
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,875
[TAKACHIHO]
I wonder...

123
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,791
Could this be fate?

124
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,208
[AKARI]
Of course I have to fight her.

125
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,916
[TAKACHIHO]
How fortuitous.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,583
The chance to bring
you down myself.

127
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,583
I couldn't ask for more.

128
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,666
[gasps]

129
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,083
[AKARI]
The Sturm Ruger Super Redhawk!

130
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,083
[chuckles]

131
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,875
There's no point in hiding.

132
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,583
I'll simply destroy
everything around you.

133
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,250
I can pay for the damages.

134
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,666
[AKARI]
This won't work.

135
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,458
She's beyond the range
of my Micro-Uzi.

136
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,333
Can you see?

137
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,666
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
I've got a great view.

138
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,250
[RIKO] I just knew they'd
wind up fighting here.

139
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,250
Of course Takachiho
would pick a spot

140
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,333
where she can fire off
that huge gun of hers.

141
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,541
Well, let's kick back
and enjoy the show.

142
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,916
With the trouble I went to,

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,875
it should be highly
entertaining.

144
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,416
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Be careful
not to be conspicuous.

145
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,333
It'll only complicate
things if they see you.

146
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,458
Oh, don't worry, I know.

147
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,458
[KIRIN]
Raika!

148
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,458
[RAIKA]
Stay right there no matter what!

149
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,750
Or I won't be able
to tell where you are!

150
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,250
[KIRIN]
Understood!

151
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,750
[HINA] Carrying on
with a conversation

152
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,833
while being attacked?

153
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,833
Awfully confident, aren't you?

154
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,333
[RAIKA]
I guess so.

155
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,708
Do you wanna know why?
I'd be happy to show you!

156
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,250
[HINA] Confidence is just a
precursor to disappointment.

157
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,083
[TAKACHIHO]
Were you aware...

158
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,666
...I also requested an Amica
contract with Aria Kanzaki?

159
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,125
[gasps]

160
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:24,666
Although, I somehow failed
that test in her estimation.

161
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
Afterwards,

162
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,916
I even tried offering to pay
her quite a bit of money.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,750
Despite my efforts, I simply
couldn't persuade her.

164
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,458
[TAKACHIHO]
But now?

165
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,875
The most peculiar
part of it all...

166
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,375
...I'm happy I'm not her Amica.

167
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,083
I actually think
it's for the best.

168
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,541
She made a helpless, E Rank,

169
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,833
pathetic excuse for a
Butei her Amica instead.

170
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,375
So I think it's evident
that she's lost her mind.

171
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,833
It makes perfect sense.

172
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,000
I mean, that is
the only explanation

173
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,583
as to why she'd overlook
the far superior person.

174
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,750
Aria the Quadra.

175
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,750
She clearly doesn't live up to
the reputation she's earned.

176
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,083
[yelps]

177
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,791
[chuckles]

178
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,958
[AKARI] I don't care
what you say about me.

179
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,083
[TAKACHIHO]
Mmm?

180
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,291
[AKARI]
But...

181
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,583
...nobody talks
that way about Aria!

182
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,208
[AKARI]
All right.

183
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,916
[AKARI groaning]

184
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,458
Did that hurt? It certainly
looked like it did.

185
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,250
[AKARI]
Such force. It hurts.

186
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,916
[groans]

187
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,666
Now let's see if I can target
an even more painful spot next.

188
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,833
[screams]

189
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,916
Akari.

190
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,333
Falling back like that
was a big mistake.

191
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,208
Always keep the range
of your gun in mind.

192
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,666
At this distance,

193
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,166
your Uzi's targeting is
completely inaccurate.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,750
[TAKACHIHO]
My gun on the other hand...

195
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,000
It's right for the job.

196
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,250
I can fire it with the
precision of a scalpel.

197
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,833
You have to be flexible
when you fight.

198
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,583
You know,

199
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,041
shooting galleries are a lot
more fun when the targets move.

200
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,416
[chuckles]

201
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,833
[gasps]

202
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
[AKARI]
Time to get flexible.

203
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,458
[TAKACHIHO]
Hm?

204
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,333
[engine revs]

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,708
[gasps]

206
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,125
[TAKACHIHO]
Not fair!

207
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,375
[AKARI] Sorry, scooter owner!
I'll be really careful!

208
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:39,375
But be careful because a
headshot can still kill someone.

209
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
[TAKACHIHO]
I know she was admonishing us.

210
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,291
But I took it as advice.

211
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,708
[grunts]

212
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,791
Now fall down!

213
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,791
[AKARI]
All that training, it paid off!

214
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,791
I am not gonna fall!

215
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,416
[KIRIN]
Everything's set now!

216
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,583
[KIRIN giggles]

217
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,166
[BOTH yell]

218
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,625
Come on, we have to run now!

219
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,791
Whoa, hold on! We can't
abandon the eye flag!

220
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,916
Don't worry about it! Now hurry!

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,916
[RAIKA]
Uh... what?

222
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,000
Wha...? Wait. That's...
their attack flag!

223
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,041
No more shooting for you.

224
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,333
[TAKACHIHO]
Huh?

225
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,916
[AKARI]
Come on.

226
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,708
[AKARI]
Please make it!

227
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,208
Go!

228
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,333
We... won.

229
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,291
This can't be... happening.

230
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,875
Owie.

231
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,500
We really did it.

232
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,708
We actually won, Akari!
We pulled it off!

233
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,916
Yeah! We sure did, huh?

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,750
I can't believe it!

235
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,666
Is this true? Did I lose?

236
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,583
[SHINO, AKARI]
We did it! We won!

237
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:39,166
We won! Akari and Shino
managed to pull it off!

238
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,541
Really? But it's
too early to rejoice.

239
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,875
For all we know,

240
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,208
their team might've gotten
to our eye flag as well.

241
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,291
And if that's the case,
the rules say it's a draw.

242
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,791
In order to trick your enemies,

243
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,666
you must first
trick your allies.

244
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,625
They're more than welcome
to have the bee flag

245
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,083
I buried back there.

246
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,791
Because... I've got
the eye flag right here.

247
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,000
[gasps]

248
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
[crying]

249
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,125
I told you. Bees really
gross me out.

250
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,625
[chuckles]

251
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,500

[creaking]

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,666
I-I'm stuck in this
thing! Ugh! Stupid!

254
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,416
You want some help?

255
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:57,750
Are you there?

256
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,583
[SHINO]
Hey, Akari.

257
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,750

Hey. Are you okay?

[gasps] Uh-huh...

Are you all right?

[SHINO whines]

270
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,041
[AKARI]
I knew it was you!

271
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,500
I knew you were the
one who saved us!

272
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,416
[ARIA] Reki's the one
you should be thanking.

273
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,333
[AKARI]
Thank you so much!

274
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,166
That was seriously
a close one.

275
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,250
What were they expecting
when they picked this place?

276
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,541
Oh, good grief.

277
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,000
We're gonna have to fill out
a ton of paperwork on this.

278
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:07,958
[YUYU]
Are you okay?

279
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
[YAYA]
You're not hurt, are you?

280
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:13,958
[TAKACHIHO]
Let's go.

281
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,416
[YUYU, YAYA]
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
[ALL laughing]

[KIRIN]
You were wonderful, Raika!

284
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,500
You know,

285
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,541
popular people are like
magnets for danger.

286
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,791
I'm glad I asked you
to come along.

287
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,958
Not that I ever expected
something this severe

288
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,000
to go down.

289
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:40,500
What're your thoughts on the
matter? Coincidence? Or worse?

290
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,791
[ARIA] But...
if it wasn't a coincidence...

291
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,041
Hmm...

[RIKO laughing]

295
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:03,291
That was amusing!
Hey. Look. My scooter!

296
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,375
Now what's it doing down there?

297
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,416
You're so obvious.

[chuckles]

00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,666
You call yourself a villain?

00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,458
That was the work of a softie.

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,333
[RIKO]
Well, maybe I'm both.

302
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,458
[RAIKA]
Giving derringer training?

303
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,250
[KIRIN]
All my classmates are very cute!

304
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,791
[AKARI]
It is a little odd.

305
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,791
I wonder what she's trying
to get out of this?

306
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,666
[KIRIN]
They're getting way too close.

307
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,875
And I'm not cool with it.
