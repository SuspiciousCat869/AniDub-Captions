Huh?!

00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,166
[RAIKA]
Ha!

9
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,125
Hmph!

10
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,250
Ahh...

11
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,125
Kirin! I'm here to rescue you!

12
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,625
Prince Raika, you're my hero!

13
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:05,041
[KIRIN] Go, Prince Raika!
Defend my honor!

14
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:14,958
Ahh... What a truly
wonderful dream!

15
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:20,333
My prince, Raika, really is...
my one, true love!

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,625
[FEMALE STUDENT 3A] Oh, wow!
I grew an inch since last Fall!

17
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 3C] Really?
Must be all that milk you drink.

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,833
[AKARI thinking]
Today, the upperclassmen

19
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,958
are giving us physical exams.

20
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:06,125
And the one assigned to me
is Aria! I'm so excited!

21
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,416
[SHINO grumbles]

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,333
[SHINO thinking]
Stupid Aria gets to hog Akari

23
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,000
all day every day.

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,333
My beautiful Raika.
Oh! Too loud.

25
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,041
Is there something wrong?

26
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,375
Yeah. Recently,
I can't shake the feeling

27
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,208
that someone's
been spying on me.

28
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,083
Huh?

29
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,291
[ARIA] Line up!

30
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,541
First off I have to
see how tall you are.

31
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,583
What type of
firearm we assign you

32
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,583
will be determined
by this and your build.

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,083
[GIRLS]
Yes, ma'am!

34
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,875
[ARIA]
Shino Sasaki.

35
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,083
Looks like anything bigger than
an M4 carbine will be too much,

36
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,666
so we'll stick with that.

37
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,791
[ARIA] Raika Hino,
since you're so tall,

38
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,708
you can handle a longer rifle.

39
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,708
The Belgian FAL
should do the job, nicely.

40
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:53,541
Akari Mamiya, just 139
centimeters. Hmm...

41
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,125
[AKARI]
Hmph...

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,583
I don't wanna carry around
this super weird gun!

43
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,416
[RAIKA]
You look so cute with it!

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,666
[AKARI] Measure me again,
Shino, come on!

45
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,958
[RAIKA]
Why?

46
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,791
It's not like you've grown
in the last minute.

47
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:11,000
Bottom-right and top-left...

48
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,125
Bottom.

49
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,916
[SHINO thinking]
Her little mouth hangs open!

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,666
She's so cute when
she tries to concentrate!

51
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,125
Right. Top. Left. Bottom. Left.

52
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,916
Bottom. Top. Right.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,916
Top-right.
Bottom-right. Top-left.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Great. All done.

55
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,500
[ARIA thinking] Raika Hino.
Her vision is incredible.

56
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,166
[SHINO] How the
heck can you see those?

57
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,458
[AKARI]
It's, like, super vision!

58
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,291
Hey girls, come on!

59
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,958
You can't give up!

60
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,000
Aria, I feel like I might...

61
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,083
[ARIA sighs]

62
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,916
[ARIA]
Five more minutes!

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,041
[RAIKA]
Roger!

64
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,166
[KIRIN thinking]
She's so cool!

65
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,875
[ARIA] This last test checks
your overall fitness.

66
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,750
It also serves as
a stress reliever

67
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,166
for the poor upperclassman

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
who got stuck dealing
with you all today.

69
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,750
[GIRLS]
Huh?

70
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,416
[ARIA] I want the three
of you to attack me!

71
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,708
[AKARI thinknng]
That's right!

72
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,500
If I find an opening
in her defense,

73
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,375
I can get my gun back! Okay!

74
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,958
[SHINO thinking] Three on one
means I can crush Aria

75
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,416
in the confusion!

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,791
I know S-Rank Buteis
are the strongest,

77
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,875
but let me test that firsthand.

78
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,250
[RAIKA] Come on!

79
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,250
Shino! Akari!

80
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,333
Not bad.

81
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,291
[sighs]

82
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,708
And that's Baritsu,

83
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,291
a hand-to-hand combat passed
down in my family.

84
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,416
But firing two guns at once...

85
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,291
...isn't the only type of
fighting I know how to do.

86
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,166
Baritsu.

87
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,541
Oh, boy.

88
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,708
I hope that my beloved
Prince Raika is okay!

89
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,666
I can't assess you just
by fighting like this.

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,291
Akari, Shino, I want
you two to spar.

91
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,583
But hand to hand
combat only, no guns.

92
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,125
Wait, I have to fight Shino?

93
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,000
Happy to wrestle her, ma'am!

94
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,333
[SHINO thinking]
Oh, how could I hate Aria

95
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,333
when she's letting me get
skin-to-skin with Akari?

96
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,916
[ARIA]
Raika, you'll spar with...

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,666
Let's see... You!
Wanna help us out?

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,625
Hmm?

99
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,083
Me? Fight a girl? Seriously?

100
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,333
[ARIA]
Yes. A co-ed fight with Raika.

101
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,250
Whenever you're ready,
go at her.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,750
[SHINO]
Akari!

103
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,041
[AKARI]
What are you doing?!

104
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,166
[FEMALE STUDENT 3A]
A co-ed fight?

105
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,333
He might kill her!

106
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,708
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
No way, it's Raika Hino!

107
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,916
[FEMALE STUDENT 3B]
Go for it, Raika!

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
[FEMALE STUDENT 3C]
Make us ladies proud!

109
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,875
[ARIA]
Ready, fight!

110
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,000
[HODORIGO growls]

111
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,500
You bitch!

112
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,541
[ARIA]
That's enough!

113
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,666
[MALE STUDENT 3A] Are we sure
she's biologically female?

114
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,625
[FEMALE STUDENT 3A]
Oh, stuff it! She's amazing!

115
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,375
[ARIA] Well, sorry about your
arm there, thanks for helping!

116
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,458
She cheated!
You man-chick!

117
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,583
Yeah, whatever.
I'll take you any time!

118
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,250
[KIRIN thinking] She gets
more amazing every hour!

119
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,958
I feel so tingly now.

120
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,166
My heart's beating
like a drum! Wait...

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,541
[ARIA]
Hmmm...

122
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,541
Stop tickling me!

123
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,916
You'll make me wet my pants!

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
[ARIA]
Hey, that's not real sparring!

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
[AKARI] Well, she'll
probably give me and Shino

126
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,958
bad marks for the tickling.

127
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,791
But you were amazing,
Raika, fighting that jock!

128
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,541
[SHINO] And not only
did you beat a guy bigger

129
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,166
than any of us,
you made it look easy!

130
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,500
[RAIKA] Thanks.
But I just did what I do.

131
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,583
[AKARI] I know how well you
fight against bigger opponents,

132
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,458
so I never doubted you'd
clobber that sexist pig.

133
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,458
[RAIKA] True.
You've watched me kick butt

134
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,666
and take names
since junior high.

135
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,875
[AKARI] Yep! I know every
bit of you, inside and out!

136
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,416
[SHINO]
Don't forget, though,

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,875
the real lesson here is
we were no match for Aria.

138
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,375
[AKARI]
No, ma'am!

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,958
[RAIKA]
Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,208
No. I'm sorry
for bumping you.

141
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,791
[AKARI] Wow.
That is one pretty girl!

142
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,583
She's Riko Mine,
a Year Two student.

143
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,791
[RAIKA thinking]
If I was a girly girl like her,

144
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,291
no one would ever
make fun of me.

145
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,708
She cheated! You man-chick!

146
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,041
[AKARI]
What's wrong, Raika?

147
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,916
[gasps]

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Oh. Nothing.
Let's go home.

149
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,000
[RAIKA] Hang on, Akari,
aren't you supposed to be

150
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
working with
Aria this afternoon?

151
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,583
[AKARI] Yeah, but she said
something came up

152
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,750
at the last minute.

153
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,875
[SHINO] Then let's
go get some leaf pies!

154
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,583
Huh? Ah!

155
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,083
[RAIKA and SHINO]
Huh?

156
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
[splutters]

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,458
So that's it then.

158
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,875
The something that came up

159
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,041
and took Aria's attention away
from Akari was a date.

160
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,625
Wait, he's... he's Kenji
Tohyama from year two.

161
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,041
He was already an
S-Rank Butei last year.

162
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,833
Even defeated his teacher
in his entrance exam.

163
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,125
A first-year student
with an S Rank?

164
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,583
[SHINO] He's a natural, alright!

165
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,791
With a ranking like that,

166
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,166
it's no wonder Aria
has the hots for him!

167
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,791
Well, how 'bout that pie?

168
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,666
[SHINO] Hey, Akari!
What about the leaf pies?

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,541
[AKARI]
We'll go next time! Promise!

170
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,208
[SHINO thinking] Stupid Aria!
Always stealing Akari!

171
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,083
[AKARI thinking]
Kinji Tohyama.

172
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,500
He's a strong Butei,
but what kinda person is he?

173
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,041
[KINJI]
And just who are you?

174
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,083
[AKARI shrieks]

175
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,833
[AKARI]
Kinji Tohyama!

176
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,541
[AKARI]
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,375
Weren't you the one hanging on
to the monorail the other day?

178
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,333
Why've you started
following me around?

179
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:01,083
[AKARI] Because..
Because it's not fair!

180
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,250
[KINJI]
Hmm?

181
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,916
If you had any idea
how hard I've worked

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,916
to get close to Aria, you'd
never swoop in and steal her!

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,208
[KINJI] Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

184
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,500
You're like- in love with her?

185
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,500
[AKARI] What? No!
It's just like, well--

186
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
I'm sorry if this looks
a certain way to you.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,458
To be honest,

188
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,125
it's annoying that Aria keeps
following me around so much.

189
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,750
You... think she's annoying?!

190
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,333
You're annoying!

191
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,166
[KINJI] Whatever. By the way,
your tailing skills suck.

192
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,708
What junior high are you from?

193
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,916
[AKARI]
Um, just a public junior high.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,875
I transferred into Butei
the second half

195
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,458
of my last year there.

196
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,500
Public, huh?

197
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,333
[AKARI]
Hey...

198
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:47,458
There's nothing wrong...
with a public school!

199
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,250
[KINJI thinking]
Pubic!

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,958
Ahh!

201
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,250
[HINA] Master!

202
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,625
[KINJI]
Fuma! Help me!

203
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,208
The current's
taking me away! Help--

204
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,541
[HINA]
I'm coming!

205
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,750
Just try to grab a branch!

206
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,916
[AKARI] The kids at
this school are weird.

207
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,500
[AKARI]
Using him?

208
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,000
[ARIA]
That's correct.

209
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,708
I'm not really into Kinji,
I'm just using him to help get

210
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,166
to the bottom of the
investigation I'm conducting.

211
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,250
[AKARI] Okay that
makes sense, I guess.

212
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,958
So what are you investigating?

213
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,833
Put it this way, if I
told you, I'd have to kill ya.

214
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:25,625
Oh.

215
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,791
Remember what I said.

216
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,750
You can't take part
in my missions yet.

217
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,958
I know that it can
sting to hear that.

218
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,541
But you're still going
through Butei training.

219
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,583
[AKARI]
Right.

220
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,583
[ARIA] Much of what
you need to know

221
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,291
is in the lessons
I've given you.

222
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:41,083
One: Crimes and criminals don't
wait for a Butei to be ready.

223
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,708
Two: Always be punctual.
And three...

224
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,833
[AKARI]
Yes?

225
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,000
[ARIA]
And three:

226
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,916
Pay more attention
to your surroundings.

227
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,125
Your classmate Shino Sasaki
had been acting strange.

228
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,250
But you didn't
notice it, did you?

229
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,125
Never repeat...

230
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:03,041
...a mistake more
than once. Bye.

231
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,041
[AKARI sighs]

232
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,750
I knew I had a lot to learn,

233
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,291
but I didn't think
I was this far off

234
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,375
from being able to help her.

235
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,958
[sighs]

236
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,250
At this rate, I wonder if I'll
ever become her official Amica.

237
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,708
[RAIKA] Your name's Kirin Shima,
right?

238
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,125
You're still just
a kid in junior high.

239
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,791
what are you doing
asking me to meet you here?

240
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,750
[KIRIN] Madame Raika,

241
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,708
please allow me to
become your new Amica!

242
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,416
Uh?

243
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,625
Huh?

244
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,791
Let me be your Amica, Raika!

245
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,166
Uh, no thanks.
It's still my first year.

246
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,541
I can't have an Amica yet.

247
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,208
Your class rank
has no bearing on that.

248
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,541
It was no big deal
last year when Riko Mine

249
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,916
made me her Amica as a freshman!

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,125
[RAIKA]
Riko?

251
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,000
[RAIKA]
Don't compare me to her.

252
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,541
I don't care, it's still a no.

253
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,708
[KIRIN]
Mistress Raika, please!

254
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,958
[AKARI]
See ya, later!

255
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,291
Why is she so stubborn?

256
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,125
[AKARI]
I'm sorry for spying.

257
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,000
I got carried away trying
to follow Aria's advice.

258
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,875
[RAIKA]
No apology necessary.

259
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,041
I don't care about her.

260
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
[AKARI]
Don't be so cold.

261
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,916
I think that Kirin Shima
seems kinda cute.

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,041
Why don't you wanna help her?

263
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,708
Because I don't want to, 'kay?

264
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,375
[AKARI]
She's not your type?

265
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,375
[RAIKA] Look, can we just
talk about something else?

266
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,500
[HODORIGO]
What, Raika?

267
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,833
I'd put that she-beast
at the bottom.

268
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,625
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
Yeah, I'm with you there.

269
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,375
She's a dude!

270
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,625
Ha! Totally.

271
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,708
She's almost as tall as
our boy Hodorigo here!

272
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,916
With no dissenting votes,

273
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,541
we put Raika at the
bottom of the Hot List!

274
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,208
You guys shut up!

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,166
[AKARI]
Raika!

276
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,250
Yeah, what?
I'll be just a minute.

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,375
You think what those cave men
say about my looks bothers me?

278
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,750
You're funny.

279
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,666
Go back to class,
I'll catch ya later.

280
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,916
Um. 'Kay.

281
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:22,083
[RAIKA cries]

282
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,208
Pay more attention
to your surroundings.

283
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,833
[AKARI thinking]
I guess I haven't gotten

284
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,166
to know Raika well enough

285
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,708
to tell that something
like that would hurt her.

286
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,875
[RAIKA]
I gotta jet. See ya!

287
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,750
[AKARI]
Oh, okay.

288
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,833
[KIRIN] So, where you
think Raika's going?

289
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:42,708
[gasps]

290
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,083
[KIRIN]
Akari!

291
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,000
There's something
important I wish to discuss.

292
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,500
[MALE STUDENT 3A]
She's a dude!

293
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,291
We put Raika at the
bottom of the Hot List!

294
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,250
[RAIKA thinking]
Get outta my head.

295
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,208
I gotta go to my special place.

296
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,291
Relieve some of this stress.

297
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,000
So why am I hiding
on a train with you?

298
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,416
Because you want
to help me be her Amica.

299
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,083
You know what it's like
to crave the guidance

300
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,000
and attention of someone
just a little bit older.

301
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,500
But I've already
learned once today

302
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,166
I'm no good at tailing people.

303
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,875
Don't worry.

304
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,083
Despite her great size,

305
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,458
Raika's very inattentive
of her surroundings.

306
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,916
I've stared holes through
her since we got on this train

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and she hasn't noticed me yet!

308
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,833
[AKARI thinking] It must
have been Kirin spying on her

309
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,333
this morning in the gym.

310
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,333
Why's she in
the fashion district?

311
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,083
Oh, my gosh,
what if she's into--

312
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,500
[GIRL SHOPPER 3A]
You look adorbs!

313
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,666
[GIRL SHOPPER 3B]
Totes adorbs.

314
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,250
[GIRL SHOPPER 3C]
I feel good in it, too!

315
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,125
[STORE CLERK 3A] Thank you for
coming to see us again, Raika!

316
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,166
I have some new costumes
that just came in today

317
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,291
that you might like.

318
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,208
Can... I try them all?

319
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,041
Of course!

320
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,500
Try on any costume you want.

321
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,875
That's what this
store's all about!

322
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,916
[thinking] Deep down, every
girl longs to be a princess.

323
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,041
So Raika relaxes
by cosplaying!

324
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,958
I never would have guessed
that in a million-billion years.

325
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,291
Whatever floats her boat.

326
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,916
Uh oh, looks like
developmental regression.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,958
It's a serious problem!

328
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,291
Regression?

329
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,041
At Butei, girls are
supposed to have

330
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,958
the same competitiveness
and aggressiveness as boys.

331
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,500
That kind of stress
makes some girls

332
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:20,458
unwind by doing childish things,
like playing dress-up!

333
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,750
If she starts regressing
in other areas of her life,

334
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,958
she might need to
see a psychologist!

335
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,583
[AKARI]
Whoa.

336
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,250
[KIRIN]
Don't indulge, Raika.

337
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,083
You've never looked prettier.

338
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,916
Oh, really? I don't know.

339
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,541
[RAIKA thinking]
She's only being nice.

340
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
I look silly.

341
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,000
[KIRIN] In my fantasy the
prince saves the princess.

342
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,291
[KIRIN]
Well, now it's opposite day,

343
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,166
and this princess
is saving her prince!

344
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,625
[RAIKA] What are you
guys doing here?

345
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,833
Uh... Well... we were...

346
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,291
The real question is how
a Butei didn't even notice

347
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,291
we were here until
you turned around!

348
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,208
[RAIKA] If you tell people
at school about this,

349
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,125
I'll kill you!

350
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,333
Kill them?

351
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,916
I'm more than happy
to keep my mouth shut,

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,666
provided that you
give me a chance.

353
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,416
Just a chance to
become your Amica.

354
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,416
[AKARI]
Alright, ladies!

355
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,541
This match is to
determine if Kirin Shima

356
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,875
becomes Amica to Raika Hino.

357
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,791
You're both free to use
any weapons you like,

358
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,333
except guns or knives.

359
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,833
The winner is the first girl

360
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,333
to get the other flat on her
back or to say, "I give up!"

361
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,041
[AKARI] Wait, a sec!
I don't wanna be referee!

362
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,166
So, do I have your word?

363
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,750
[KIRIN] If I win, you promise
that you'll make me your Amica.

364
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,583
[RAIKA] Fine, but if I win...

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,958
...you stop following me around!

366
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,750
You can't fight me!

367
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,833
I'm too cute!

368
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:20,083
[RAIKA] You left
yourself open to this!

369
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,583
Jonathan the Third
special giraffe move!

370
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,625
Well, that's it:
Kirin Shima is the winner!

371
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,958
[RAIKA]
Uh... Huh?"

372
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,791
[KIRIN]
I'm now your Amica! Hehehe!

373
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,083
[KIRIN] I love my big sister,
and my big sister loves me.

374
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,208
I love my big sister and
my big sister loves me.

375
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,500
One question, Raika,
why was your end game so bad?

376
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,666
[KIRIN]
Bad?

377
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,083
You got her on her
back with a foot move.

378
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,583
Now, I've seen Raika dodge
that sort of thing before

379
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,750
and counter with
a joint lock and flip.

380
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,166
But she didn't do
it with you, Kirin.

381
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,041
You think my big sister
lost to me on purpose?

382
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,375
But why?

383
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,166
I... decided I was okay
with it... Your thing?

384
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,375
The thing where I grudgingly
declare you to be my Amica.

385
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,541
Congrats.

386
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,291
You won me over!

387
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:30,125
Kirin, you impressed her
with your persistence and skill!

388
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,375
You really think so?

389
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,875
Will you stop making me
seem like such a softy?

390
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,791
[RIKO]
Oh, hi, Kirin.

391
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,083
And girls from yesterday.

392
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,833
[KIRIN]
What a nice coincidence!

393
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,125
Oh, I know!

394
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,250
I love how cute you all look.

395
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,833
Thanks. Oh, guess what?

396
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,541
I'm the Amica for the
big upperclassmen here!

397
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,416
Well, you both
made great choices.

398
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,125
Now take good
care of each other.

399
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
Right, sure.

400
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,916
[RIKO] Catch ya later,
kiddos! Akari...

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,625
...I'll see ya soon.

402
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,541
Riko is something
else, isn't she?

403
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,458
Kirin, are you sure you
made the right choice?

404
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,833
You were the Amica to one of
the prettiest girls in school.

405
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,333
It's true that beautiful Riko

406
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,750
was always very nice
and protective of me.

407
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,041
That said, unlike ours,

408
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,625
the relationship was
strictly platonic.

409
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,166
My sweet Raika.

410
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,250
it's my duty to tell you how
gorgeous you look in that dress.

411
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,333
[RAIKA]
Hey, wait.

412
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,583
What are you doing?
Get off of me!

413
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,875
[AKARI thinking] Well,
that was kinda weird.

414
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,166
I wonder how Riko knows my name?

415
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,291
[ARIA]
Nothing?

416
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,541
[HINA]
Yes.

417
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,875
I checked all of Akari
Mamiya's school records

418
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,833
and found nothing special.

419
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,166
Or bad, or even remotely
out-of-the-ordinary.

420
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,333
[ARIA] What about anything
with her family?

421
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,833
[HINA]
No red lights.

422
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,375
It does look like she lives
with just her little sister,

423
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,291
separate from
her parents, though.

424
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,541
[ARIA]
Hmm...

425
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,708
[HINA] We're looking
at one of two things.

426
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,125
Either she's lived a
totally boring life, or--

427
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,541
She's doing a masterful
job hiding her past from us.

428
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,583
[HINA] So, I take it you want me
to continue the investigation?

429
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,750
[ARIA]
Yes, please.

430
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,625
Something about her...
really bothers me.

431
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,875
[ARIA] It's like a gut
feeling--that she's dangerous.

432
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,208
[AKARI]
Quartet? What?

433
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,375
[TAKACHIHO] I can't
believe I have to fight

434
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,291
a pathetic E Rank
like you a second time.

435
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,458
You lack both
technique and elegance.

436
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,541
while that amateur

437
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,625
somehow lives up
to her expectations.

438
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,875
[AKARI] She used
the phrase you told me

439
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,250
to remove from my vocabulary.

440
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,500
[TAKACHIHO] You have
no chance of defeating us.
