[AKARI]
Quiet, please.

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,166
If you're ready,

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,916
we shall begin the
exchange of vows ceremony.

6
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,041
[AKARI]
Kirin Shima.

7
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,791
Do you take this woman
to be your mentor?

8
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:03,166
Do you vow to love her as
long as you both shall live?

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,500
[KIRIN]
I do!

10
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,541
[AKARI]
And do you, Raika Hino,

11
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,125
take this woman
to be your Amica?

12
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:14,541
And do you, too, vow to love her
as long as you both shall live?

13
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,333
[RAIKA]
I do.

14
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,166
Very well.

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,083
You may now kiss your Amica.

16
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,083
[RIKO]
I object to this ceremony!

I'll be taking Rin-Rin with me!

00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,291
Get down!

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,708
What a magical day!

00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,583
I can make you much happier.

34
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,708
Sure! You're so right, Riko!

35
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,166
[RAIKA]
Kirin!

36
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,166
What a nightmare.

00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,583
[ARIA]
All right!

38
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,708
Let's all toast to Team Mamiya's
victory in Quartet.

39
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,458
And of course, to Akari's
big promotion to D Rank!

40
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,791
[ALL]
Cheers!

41
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,458
[AKARI]
Aw, thanks so much, you guys.

42
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,750
[SHINO] So you finally
made it out of E Rank.

43
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,583
Crazy, huh?

44
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,083
But I feel bad
that I'm the only one

45
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,416
who got promoted
for our big win.

46
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,875
Nothin' to feel bad about.

47
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,041
If it wasn't for you,

48
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,375
we wouldn't have won
in the first place!

49
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,666
Yep, that's true!

50
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
If we were giving
medals for conduct,

51
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,500
you'd have neck strain!

52
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,166
It wasn't just you winning.

53
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,208
I heard they took into
account your sportsmanship

54
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,583
when you helped
Takachiho at the end.

55
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,875
You did a great job, Akari.
Really.

56
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,416
Thank you, Aria.

57
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,625
[NONOKA] You must've been
scared though, huh, sis?

58
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,666
I mean, especially when
that scaffolding collapsed.

59
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,166
Yeah.

60
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,125
Seriously, someone should sue
that construction company.

61
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,583
You guys don't think it's
possible someone actually

62
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,375
sabotaged that scaffold
to collapse, do you?

63
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,833
[ARIA]
I'm glad you bring that up.

64
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,916
[ARIA] I conducted a
thorough investigation,

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
and I didn't find
anything suspicious.

66
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,041
[AKARI sighs]

67
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:44,875
Splendid!

68
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,500
It was all an accident then.

69
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,625
This isn't like TV where
people would do something

70
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,583
completely insane to ruin a
game some girls are playing.

71
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,625
[NONOKA]
If it wasn't for you,

72
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,500
my sister would
have been killed, Reki.

73
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,333
Your sniping was like a miracle.

74
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,750
At least, that's how she
described it back home.

75
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, thanks again for
your miraculous aim.

76
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,208
I'm happy to help.

77
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,666
[ARIA]
To be honest with you,

78
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,375
I had suddenly gotten a bad
gut feeling about things.

79
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,000
So I asked Reki to come
as an insurance policy.

80
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:20,875
Right?

81
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,166
[REKI]
Yep.

82
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,416
[AKARI] Your tactical
awareness is the best!

83
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
Thanks!

84
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,083
Though in this case, I'm happy
my gut was proven wrong.

85
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,291
It's still important
that we're careful.

86
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,541
There are always plenty
of bad dudes out there.

87
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,333
[RIKO] And a Butei
is always a target.

88
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,916
Don't worry about me, Riko!

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,250
I've got my own personal
upperclassman watching my back!

you are just so cute!

Uh... Yeah?

100
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,875
If your fight with
Takachiho had been real,

101
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,041
you would've died
when she shot you.

The first rule of
battle is to not die.

Yes, ma'am.

You should stop,

before you break something
in the restaurant.

Here comes the sore loser.

124
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,041
Well, well, well.

125
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,333
For a poor girl, you sure
think little of others.

126
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,541
What did you call me?

127
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,625
Girls from Tottori
have perfect manners

128
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,041
and social graces.

129
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,125
[TAKASHIHO]
I'm here to congratulate you,

130
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,708

they're beautiful!

We're done here.

Even when she's trying
to be nice, she's a jerk!

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,833
We should double-check
that she hasn't

136
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,333
booby-trapped those flowers.

Oh, come on.

138
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,000
She's not evil, you guys.

139
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:30,833
I'm with Shino.

140
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,375
You're being too trusting.

00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,000
Here, let me take it apart.

142
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,125
[AKARI]
Leave it alone!

Why would she bring
a gift to hurt me?

Ever hear of the Trojan War?

145

you to ruin it! Stop!

Let's keep the

The reason they're happy
is because of me.

Well... You girls have fun.

It was good luck!

So thank you again, Aria.

That's for preggos.

What? What's wrong?

171
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,083
[AKARI]
Aria gave it to me.

172
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,500
So don't you make fun of it!

--[AKARI yells]
--[KINJI] I'm not!

Stop it, Akari!

[AKARI]
Get outta here!

All right, all right,
I'm leaving!

[KINJI]
But just a minute.

178
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Before I go...

179
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,500
[AKARI]
Huh?

180
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,375
I find it a little surprising
she has a friend like you.

181
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,916
Since she said,

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,250
"I can get through this life.
Without having any friends."

If she's hanging with you
all the time now,

187
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,333
it frees me up
to do other stuff.

Late!

189
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,500
Is something wrong?

Akari, I miss you!

this party going!

Kii always has a way of
showing up at the wrong time.

Wait, who's Kii?

195
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,583
Is that like your nickname
for Kinji Tohyama?

196

Yep. We keep it pretty tight.

I'm... I'm reading too

But then...

208
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,041
Raika and Akari have
been close for a long time,

209
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,666
so maybe there is something
going on there.

210

What am I gonna do?!

211

I really wish you had seen it.

213
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,708
[HINA]
Well...

214
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,875
I was fighting Raika
when it happened,

215
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,166
so you'll understand
my hands were full.

216
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,541
[ARIA] I didn't get a good
look at it myself.

217
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,875
But what I do know

218
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,166
is she used another
strange technique.

219
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,458
It was almost like a
superhero's power.

220
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,750
I think that falling
scaffold was...

221
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,750
...a set up.

222
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,375
To force her into
using her powers

223
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,250
to save herself and Takachiho.

224
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,375
Otherwise...

225
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,250
It seems too convenient to me.

226
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,875
I need to get to the bottom
of whatever is going on.

227
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,541
Can I count on you?

228
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,333
[HINA] Understanding what's
going on is beyond my skills.

229
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,375
Have you thought about
just asking her about it?

230
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,208
[ARIA]
I haven't.

231
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,000
Maybe it's best to
just leave things be

232
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,208
and hope she tells me herself.

233
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,875
But that's a big
gamble, isn't it?

234
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,666
[RIKO]
Yeah.

235
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,000
I think it's best if I
lay low for a while.

236
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,291
Aria was also
investigating the site.

237
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,625
And we know the one thing she
does have is good instincts.

238
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,750
Having said that,

239
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,041
I don't consider her
much of a threat.

240

This way, you and I
can both take our time

coming up with plans and have
fun comparing them later.

[AKARI] That gun battle
with Takachiho

275

was a real wake-up call.

It made me realize how much
I have to work on my aim.

And better aim will
lead to Aria making me

Don't apologize.

I'm happy to talk
to my old Amica.

295
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,291
So your big worry is that
between her and Akari,

296
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,583
things might be getting
a little too kissy-kissy?

[KIRIN]
Exactly!

298
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,625
And if those two become
attached at the hip,

299
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
it will create a
Grand Canyon-sized,

300

well, canyon between
all four of us!

301
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,541
Maybe she doesn't
take you seriously yet

302
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,500
because you still belong
to CVR's Division Two.

303
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,833
So how 'bout you
get her to say a manifesto?

00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,916

You'll be in my
Beta Workforce Class.

310

No. I can't do it.

how to shoot yet!

You're making excuses.

Maybe you are the one
who's bad with smaller guns.

teach my friends at all

than make a mistake.

323
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,458
What a selfish chicken!

324
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,000
I am so not a chicken, you brat!

325
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,958
So that's that.

326
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,708
I'm not gonna be your teacher.

327
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,625
No way.

328
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,750
[KIRIN]
Really?

329
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,250
[AKARI]
Don't be so hard on her.

330
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,833
I think it'd be nice if
you helped out Kirin.

331
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,333
[RAIKA] I'm not trying
to be mean, it's just that...

332
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,708
Well... It's like...

333
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,500
She's a lot of fun and all.

334
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,916
But she totally acts like
she's the upperclassman,

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,541
ordering me to do
whatever she wants,

336
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,000
whenever she wants.

337
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,625
Now that you say that...

338
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,166
Didn't she have a picture of her

339
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,958
that she made you
put in your room?

340
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,750
Stop it!

341
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,250
[AKARI] Be up front with her
about the relationship.

342
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,958
[RAIKA]
Shut up about it!

343
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,375
Why's she want me to teach
her stupid class, anyway?

344
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
I can't handle a whole room
full of junior high crazies!

345
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,041
I can't even handle her!

346
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,708
[AKARI]
Huh... It is a little odd.

347
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,833
I wonder what she's
trying to get outta this.

348
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,708
[SHINO] Are you thinking
anything specific?

349
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,791
[AKARI] No, it's more like
it's just a gut feeling

350
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,208
that something's up.

351
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,083
Look, the only way to find out
is to grant her request.

352
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,000
Plus, doing it would
make her happy.

353
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,916
No! And that is final!

354
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,416
[KIRIN]
What?

355
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,000
You're gonna teach my class
how to shoot after all?

356
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,625
Raika, you made my day.

357
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,750
Thank you so much!

358
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,625
Akari insisted
I help, so really,

359
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,541
you should thank her.

360
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,041
[KIRIN]
Akari did that?

361
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,583
Don't give me
the credit for this.

362
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,958
Yeah, but it's the truth.

363
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,041
Well, I'm always happy
to accept kind words

364
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,125
from a friend.

365
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,333
Good luck, girls!

366
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,166
[RAIKA] Good luck on
your training with Aria!

367
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,541
You ignored my request,

368
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,333
but after Akari talks to you,
you're suddenly all,

369
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,458
"Oh, sure, Kirin, I'm happy to
teach derringer shooting."

370
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,166
[KIRIN]
It's not important right now.

371
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,500
Well, let's go!

372
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,083
My name's Rui!

373
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,375
And I'm Kuu!

374
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
I'm Moyu!

375
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,083
And I'm Kira!

376
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,625
Oh, uh... hi.

377
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,083
Nice to meet you, girls.

378
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,333
[RAIKA]
Now listen.

379
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,666
Its bad range means
you don't aim a derringer.

380
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,000
You press it in
their gut and shoot.

381
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,250
[ALL squeal]

382
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,041
That's awesome!

383
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
No, she's awesome!

384
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,625
You're like a cowboy prince!

385
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,125
Please marry me!

386
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,291
Just pay attention!

387
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,125
I'm only doing this once more!

388
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:05,916
[sighs]

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,458
Press and shoot!

390
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,791
[ALL squeal]

391
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,541
[RAIKA] I mean it!
Pay attention!

392
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,208
Guns are serious business!

393
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,833
[ALL]
Thank you, Miss Raika!

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,333
[KIRIN]
We'll never forget the one day

395
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,541
you made junior high
fun and worthwhile.

396
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,750
[RAIKA]
It's fine.

397
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,583
But you'd be further
along if you listened.

398
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,208
[KIRIN]
I almost forgot your gift!

399
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,375
What? You don't
have to do that.

400
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,791
The school is
supposed to pay me.

401
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:37,958
Shut up and follow!

402
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,250
[RAIKA]
What? Hey!

403
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,125
[KIRIN] Right this way,
through these doors,

404
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,250
you'll find everything
you could desire.

405
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,250
[RAIKA]
What is this place?

406
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,375
Hey, Kirin?

407
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,125
[ALL] Welcome to
the CVR Training Room!

408
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,125
[ALL giggling]

409
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,541
[KIRA, MOYU]
You like it, Raika?

410
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,250
[RAIKA]
Wait...

411
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,500
What are you guys doing?

412
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,666
[ALL]
Raika!

413
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,875
[ALL giggling]

414
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,333
[RAIKA]
This is getting creepy!

415
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,875
[RAIKA]
Please! Get off of me!

416
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,750
[KIRIN] Calm down.
I know you like it, Raika.

417
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,375
We wanted to do
something nice for you

418
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,541
after your lesson.

419
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,333
So I told them
about what you like,

420
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,625
and they were happy to make...

421
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,416
...all your deepest
fantasies come true.

422
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,833
[KIRIN]
Commence operation.

423
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,250
[ALL squealing]

424
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,708
Get off me! Let me go!

425
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,250
[RAIKA]
What's happening?

426
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,583
You're so adorable.

427
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,416
[RAIKA]
Come on!

428
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,375
Wow! Look how she's shaking!

429
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,166
It's probably her first time!

430
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,250
[RAIKA]
I can't...

431
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,541
[KIRA]
So tasty!

432
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,250
I think I'll kiss you now.

433
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,333
[RAIKA]
I can't take this anymore!

434
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,833
They're so cute
I'm gonna go insane!

435
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,583
Get off me.

436
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,166
[KIRIN] The only way
we can free you...

437
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,250
...is if you read this entire
official CVR document

438
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,083
out loud.

439
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,500
[RAIKA]
What?!

440
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,125
No! I'm not agreeing to what's
on some random paper!

441
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,666
[KIRIN] But it's not random.
It's a CVR specialty.

442
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
A manifesto!

443
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,166
By reading it aloud,

444
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,333
you promise to always
choose your Amica.

445
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,625
Even when confronted with
your secret fantasy world

446
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,583
come to life.

447
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,000
What?

448
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,583
[KIRIN] By saying it, you let
the world and your Amica

449
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,541
know where your
true priorities lie.

450
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,375
[RAIKA]
In this moment,

451
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,625
I don't like you.

452
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,708
[RAIKA]
I take Kirin as my bride!

453
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,291
[ALL]
Congratulations!

454
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,625
[ALL]
Heave-ho!

455
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,750
[KIRIN laughing]

456
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,333
[RAIKA]
Weirdest. Day. Ever.

457
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,500
[AKARI] So how'd it go
teaching Kirin's class?

458
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,541
Fine, I guess.

459
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,708
Was there an
accident on the range?

460
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,666
Well, no.

461
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,500
For now, I'll just say that...

462
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,250
Everybody in our group
seems to be worried

463
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,041
about the craziest things.

464
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,541
[KIRIN]
Oh, big sister, Raika!

465
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,708
Wait for your one true love!

466
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,666
Hey there, Kirin!

467
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,833
Well now, you seem happy!

468
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,583
[KIRIN]
Good morning, ladies!

469
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,833
[giggles]

470
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,833
Akari, thank you again
for the wonderful moment

471
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,791
of pure, un-coerced love
you enabled yesterday.

472
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,125
[AKARI]
That's great!

473
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,916
Granted, I don't know
what you're talking about,

474
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,583
but I'm glad you're glad.

475
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,166
[KIRIN]
Aren't you excited, Raika?

476
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,083
We're gonna move in and
live together from now on!

477
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,333
[AKARI]
Move in?

478
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,166
[RAIKA]
No!

479
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,500
No more games!

480
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,250
[KIRIN groans]

481
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,208
[KIRIN]
Oh hey, Akari, Shino!

482
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,166
Yesterday after class,
I recorded Raika

483
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,166
vowing to me that I'm her bride!

484
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,208
[RAIKA]
I take Kirin--

485
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,208
[KIRIN screams]

486
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,000
Bride?

487
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,250
I knew they were close,

488
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,416
but I didn't know things
were moving so quickly.

489
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,583
[SHINO]
Hold me.

490
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,625
Let's try to be as close
as they are, okay?

491
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,125
Uh... What?

492
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,125
Kirin is right.

493
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,000
Your help certainly did pay
off big for the two of us.

494
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,166
I'll have to pay you
back later, Akari.

495
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,625
[AKARI]
That's so sweet!

496
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,958
I'm trying to think what I want.

497
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,708
[SHINO] Whatever you do,
I'm coming with!

498
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,541
[KIRIN] She acts like
she's embarrassed.

499
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,041
But she loves it.

500
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,833
[SHINO] You're accused of
forcing yourself on Akari!

501
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,625
I find you guilty!

502
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,083
[TAKACHIHO] There was
no forcing of anything,

503
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,166
and you were creeping!

504
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,916
You are guilty!

505
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,208
[TAKACHIHO]
You're outta room!

506
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,416
[SHINO]
It's not over!
