00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,333
[ARIA]
Thanks, everyone!

3
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,375
Thank you! You're all so great!

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,958
[AKARI] All you guys in
the back, everyone up top,

5
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,666
I love you all!

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,416
[ARIA] But now, I'm afraid
I've got some sad news.

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,000
My bandmate, Akari Mamiya,
this is her final concert.

8
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,750
I'm forcing her out of the band,
and show business.

9
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,250
[AKARI]
Whaaat?!

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,083
Why, Aria? What did I do?

11
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:05,416
[ARIA] It's what you are,
a pathetic E Rank Butei.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,083
The lowest rank there is.

13
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,041
But you said that was okay...

14
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,583
[ARIA]
I expected you to progress

15
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,416
when I made you my Amica,
but you're still E Rank.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,875
I gave you a shot, but
I can't wait around forever.

17
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,083
Please, wait! Don't go, Aria!

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,041
[ARIA]
Goodbye, Akari.

19
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,708
I'm moving on with a more
deserving group of friends.

20
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,125
[AUDIENCE cheering]

21
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,000
[AKARI]
Shino? Raika? This isn't fair!

22
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,666
Just 'cause you've got
a higher rank than me?

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,500
You too, Kirin? And Nonoka?

24
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,666
Don't do this! You guys!

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,083
You can't leave me
behind, please!

26
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,291
[AKARI groaning]

27
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,375
[NONOKA]
Hey, Sis, are you okay?

28
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,041
Wake up, Sis!

29
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,166
Nonoka!

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,458
Give Aria back to me!

31
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,750
What the...?

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,291
Sorry.

33
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,500
[laughing]

34
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,708
Can you blame Nonoka
for being mad?

35
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,375
No, but I was still dreaming,
and it was a bad one.

36
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,166
It was just a dream,
don't be so glum.

37
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,833
[AKARI] Yeah, but I'm scared
that it might come true.

38
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,708
[door opens]

39

[GIRL STUDENT A]
Is that Hotoegee?

40
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,958
[GIRL STUDENT B] What's she
doing in a Year 1 classroom?

41
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,500
Settle down, please,
I have an announcement.

42
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,875
Why is Shino with her?

43
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,708
That's a good question.

44
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,166
Okay, everyone,
please be quiet now.

45
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,208
I'm your school council
president, Shirayuki Hotogi.

46
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,250
I have a message
from the Masters.

47
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,041
As I'm sure you're all aware,

48
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,208
next week, Year 1 students
will take the Quartet test.

49
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,458
However, going by
the sign-up sheets,

50
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,250
many of you have not yet
decided on your groups.

51
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,000
Quartet? What?

52
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,583
This is required, mandatory
for all Year 1 students.

53
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,875
So please submit
your teams to us.

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,291
That is all.

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,833
[AKARI] What exactly
is Quartet again?

56
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,875
[SHINO] It's actually
a pretty crucial event.

57
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,416
[RAIKA]
Teachers told us about it,

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,291
and it's been up on
the bulletin boards.

59
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,166
But you probably
weren't paying attention

60
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,500
because you're so
preoccupied with Aria.

61
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,833
[AKARI]
Yeah, probably.

62
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,458
Quartet's a type of test,

63
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,125
a fight between two
groups of four people.

64
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,166
You can team up with anyone.
So, we can pick whoever.

65
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,541
Oh?

66
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,875
Does that mean you can have
an intern in the group?

67
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,458
I didn't realize that.

68
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,833
The most important thing
is their ability.

69
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,416
That's all that matters.

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Even a junior high student is
allowed to participate with us.

71
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,500
Huh. I guess that
does make sense.

72
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,000
[RAIKA giggles]

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,916
[SHINO] So, yes, you can team
up with your Amica, Kirin,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,625
since that's what
you're wondering.

75
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,125
[RAIKA]
What?!

76
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,958
What gives you that idea,
I didn't say anything like that!

77
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,583
Uhh, but I guess it
would seem strange

78
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,041
if I didn't team up with her,
since she's my Amica.

79
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,291
[RAIKA groans]

80
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,083
[SHINO]
Oh, guess what?

81
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,083
I heard that that it's possible
to raise your rank

82
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,833
if you get a good
score on the test.

83
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,416
[AKARI]
So let me get this straight,

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,208
are you saying that I may become
a D rank if I get a good score?

85
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,000
Yep, but the only way
for you to do it is to win.

86
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,208
[chuckles]

87
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,958
What if we...? I mean...

88
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,708
Yeah, I know.
We should team up.

89
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,541
[SHINO] So the three of us
together, plus Kirin.

90
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,875
Let's win this thing.

91
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,666
Heck yeah! Let's do it!

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,083
[SHINO]
Well, that's a relief.

93
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,916
I didn't wanna let
Shirayuki down.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,625
I mean, y'know, since
she's my sister now.

95
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,666
[BOTH] Uh? Did you
just call her your sister?

96
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,125
Hang on, Shino. We saw you
helping Shirayuki earlier.

97
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,250
Does this mean...?

98
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,375
[SHINO]
Uh-huh!

99
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,750
I still don't quite believe it,

100
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,416
but she accepted
me as her Amica!

101
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,666
So, let's see, which team
are we fighting against?

102
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,125
Oh. There we are.

103
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,750
Wait, Takachiho.

104
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,416
Urara Takachiho.

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,875
She's that A-ranked brat

106
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,750
who defeated you in
battle the other day.

107
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,416
Her family owns the
Takachiho Financial Group,

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,208
and she's so pretty that CVR
asked her to join them.

109
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,375
CVR? What's that?

110
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:46,166
It's a very specific department.
They specialize in honeytraps.

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,208
Y'know, strategies based
around physical charms.

112
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,333
[AKARI]
Huh? That's a department?

113
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,000
Sure is! I'm actually in CVR.

114
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,083
Of course, my division, well,
it's much more specialized.

115
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,791
Hey, would ya quit
hangin' off me?!

116
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,166
[TAKACHIHO]
Yuyu. Yaya. Laugh at them.

117
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,208
[YUYU, YAYA laughing]

118
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,541
[TAKACHIHO]
Yuyu, Yaya. Stop.

119
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,875
Were you girls talking about me?

120
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,416
Ooohh, my, my, my, my, my.

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,791
I can't believe I have to fight
a pathetic E rank like you

122
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,375
a second time.

123
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,875
I hope they're not
going easy on me

124
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,750
due to my family's donation.

125
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,708
And your friends don't
look impressive either.

126
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,208
Is that an intern?

127
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,791
Back off. She's my Amica.

128
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,416
Really? Your Amica's from CVR?

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,416
What are you,
some kind of pervert?

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,041
[RAIKA growls]

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,500
You bitch!

132
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,083
[RAIKA]
What? Hina Fuma?

133
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,458
I figured she'd be
useful during Quartet.

134
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,916
So I hired her to join my team.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,250
[growls]

136
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,041
You lack both
technique and elegance.

[KIRIN yells]

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,791
[whimpers] That was just a joke.

141
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,833
Ow!

142
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,125
Kirin, no!

143
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:13,791
[YUYU, YAYA]
Heave-ho.

144
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,458
[AKARI yelps]

145
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,333
Are you okay?

146
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,041
[TAKACHIHO]
Shino Sasaki.

147
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,250
Your father's an
armed prosecutor.

148
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
Yeah, so what of it?

149
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,458
[TAKACHIHO] Please,
don't act like you're unaware

150
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,750
of our fathers' hatred
for each other in court.

151
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,125
Oh, I'm well aware.

152
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,875
Your family is nothing
but armed lawyers.

153

[chuckles]

154
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,833
You're the heir of one
of the wealthiest families

155
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,375
in the Butei world.

156
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,375
And I know where
you come from as well.

00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,833
[TAKACHIHO panting]

161
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,125
[YUYU]
Uh...

162
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,125
Takachiho?

163
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,625
[TAKACHIHO clears throat]

164
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
[TAKACHIHO] One's Quartet team
should be carefully chosen

165
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,625
for skill and strategy.

166
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,625
But you just went and picked all
of your loser friends instead.

167
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,583
You have no chance
of defeating us.

168
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,291
[growls]

169
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
[ARIA]
Hey!

170
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,708
What do you think you're doing?

171
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,625
[gasps]

172
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,916
[TAKACHIHO]
Well then...

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,125
[TAKACHIHO laughing]

174
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,250
[TAKACHIHO]
See you on the Quartet field.

175
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,000
[ARIA]
Quartet, huh?

176
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,666
Because I'm a transfer student,

177
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,333
they've never required me
to take part in that test.

178
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,916
Oh, really?

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,458
Wait. listen! Guys!

180
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,166
I bet you we can get Riko
to help us practice!

181
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,083
Riko? Riko Mine?

182
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,958
Yeah! I served as
her Amica last year.

183
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,166
Is that so? Not sure
if she's dependable.

184
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,041
So, she'll help us!

185
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,291
Now let's make a practice plan!

186
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,583
Hey, we can hold a
training camp at my house!

187
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Whoa! Are you sure?

188
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,833
Anything to beat her family.

189
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,041
The Tottori Sand Dunes are
beautiful. They're glorious.

190
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,791
They shimmer in the moonlight

191
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,333
beneath the magnificent
Mount Daisen.

192
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,708
There's even a festival held
there during the summer.

193
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,083
It was my dream in life to
walk among those sand dunes

194
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,291
with Aria by my side.

195
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,375
But she deemed me unworthy
of being her Amica,

196
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,208
while that amateur somehow
lives up to her expectations.

197
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,875
Utterly unforgivable. Truly.

198
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,416
That Akari Mamiya is
nothing but a dirty thief.

199
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,625
[TAKACHIHO growls]

200
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,375
[TAKACHIHO]
You will pay, Akari.

201
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,791
[RAIKA]
Whoa.

202
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,458
This place is enormous.

203
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,541
Nonoka, you can take off now.

204
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,958
What's the big deal?

205
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,458
I just wanna meet your friend
Shino before I leave.

206
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,375
Oh, hey! You're here!

207
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,791
[ALL]
Thanks for having us!

208
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,416
Hi, my name's Nonoka Mamiya.

209
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,666
Thank you for being such
a good friend to my sister.

210
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,125
[SHINO]
So cute!

211
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,166
Her little sister's almost
as cute as she is!

212
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,166
Here ya go, Sis.
Your PJs are packed in here.

213
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,625
Oh. I packed your pillow too!

214
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,000
You've got a really
thoughtful little sister.

215
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,708
Yeah, kind of hard to believe
you two are related.

216
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,375
What does that mean?

217
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,041
Will you be joining us and
staying overnight, Nonoka?

218
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,208
What? Oh, no, I'm going home.

219
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,791
It's not like she's part
of our Quartet group.

220
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,291
I mean, she doesn't
even go to Butei High.

221
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,250
[NONOKA]
Well I guess I'll get going.

222
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,166
[gasps]

223
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,625
Hey, are you all right?

224
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,250
[NONOKA]
I... I just got a little dizzy.

225
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,916
Are you sure you're okay?

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,666
You should probably stay
here and rest after all.

227
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,791
[NONOKA]
No, really, it's not that bad.

228
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,750
Why don't you lie
down for a while?

229
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,833
I'd feel much better if you did.

230
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,625
Okay. If you guys insist.

231
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,750
[SHINO] All right!
They're both staying the night!

232
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,666
[SHINO] As you all know,
Quartet is happening Monday.

233
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,000
And since today's Friday,

234
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,583
that gives us the entire
weekend to spend training.

235
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,541
Now, here's our opposing team.
Takachiho. Hina Fuma.

236
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,750
And of course, the twin
sisters, Yuyu and Yaya.

237
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,833
The theme of the match we've
been assigned to fight is:

238
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,625
Poison.

239
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,333
Each team will be designated
by a specific bug,

240
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,083
and will carry attack flags with
a picture of that bug on them.

241
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,250
The teams will also be
given a single flag

242
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,458
with a picture of an eye on
it that they need to protect.

243
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,125
Whichever team's attack flag
touches the eye flag first

244
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,708
is the one to win.

245
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,083
So you lose if your eye gets
stung by a poisonous bug?

246
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,125
[SHINO]
You got it.

247
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,708
It looks like we're
the bee team.

248
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, gross, bees
totally creep me out.

249
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,458
The test is held
on the mega-float,

250
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,875
and takes place within
Zone 11 of Butei High.

251
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,791
Anything in the zone
can be utilized.

252
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,541
And those are
the basic rules.

253
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,083
Sounds pretty simple.

254
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,666
Yeah, right?

255
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,208
But you've gotta think of all
the skills they'll be testing.

256
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,833
Hiding, attacking,
withdrawing, and so on.

257
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,708
[RIKO] Here she is!
My little Rin-Rin!

258
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,250
Riko, you're here!
I'm so happy you came!

259
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,708
Well, I couldn't turn down
a request from my old Amica.

260
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,250
[KIRIN] Oh, thank you so much.
It means the world to me!

261
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,291
[AKARI] How does Riko Mine
always look so beautiful?

262
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,458
[RIKO] Poison, huh?
That brings back memories.

263
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,916
ust know that I believe Butei
should protect themselves.

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,875
I refuse to protect
my underclassmen.

265
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,583
Although, I am happy
to train them.

266
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,666
[RIKO] We'll train you to deal
with the twins, Shino.

267
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,333
[MAIDS] I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

268
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,333
Please forgive me, I'm so sorry!

269
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,791
[RIKO] The strongest amongst
you will guard the flag.

270
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
Just remember to
trust your friends

271
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,833
and buy them time no
matter the circumstance.

272
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,708
[yells]

273
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,000
[AKARI yelping]

274
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,500
Why am I the only one that
got stuck riding this thing?!

275
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,125
[RIKO]
Trust me, will you?

276
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,166
A Butei needs to know
more than just fighting

277
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,500
if she wants to survive.

278
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,708
Yeah. But, but-- Ah!

279
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,916
Ow, ow, ow.

280
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,916
[RIKO]
She is certainly earnest.

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,750
Amicas tend to think
like their mentors.

282
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,125
I bet I can learn a lot
about Aria from her.

283
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:11,875
[laughing]

284
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:15,333
That's gotta be the saddest
thing I've seen! Ha, ha!

285
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,083
Oh, I recognize you. Riko?

286
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,833
Yep! Everyone's
busy training now,

287
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,666
so I came up to check on you.

288
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,750
You feel better now
that you got some rest?

289
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,208
Oh, yeah, thanks,
but I'm okay now.

290
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,791
I felt a little dizzy,
that's all.

291
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,125
[RIKO] Good to hear.
I'm glad you're okay.

292
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,750
[NONOKA] So, is there anything
that I can do to help my sister

293
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,458
and everyone train?

294
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,666
[RIKO] No. You don't
need to worry about them.

295
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,291
But you're a really
sweet kid to ask.

296
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,416
[RIKO] It's too bad sweet
kids go to an early grave.

297
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
Uh-oh, are you feeling dizzy?

298
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,125
Kinda, yeah.
From that horse thing.

299
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,416
I'm fine. But hey, are you
feeling better now, Nonoka?

300
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
[NONOKA] Yep. 100%!

301
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,666
Done waiting! I'm eating!
I'm famished after today!

302
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,583
Oh! You're not choking, are you?

303
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,458
How 'bout I feed you
like old times, Kirin?

304
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,416
Say "ahhh"!

305
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,250
[KIRIN] Oh! Stop, Riko,
I can eat on my own.

306
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,250
Are you jealous that no
one's feeding you, Sis?

307
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,958
No, that seems a little weird.

308
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,750
[RIKO] Don't be silly, Kirin.
You used to love this.

309
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,416
Excuse me! There's a time
and place for goofing off.

310
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,875
But not while we're in
the middle of training.

311
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,166
She needs to maintain her focus!

312
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,791
I see. You're totes jelly.

313
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,375
You're going crazy with
jealousy! Aren't you cute?

314
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
What? I am not.

315
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,625
Anyway,

316
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,541
I heard that Shirayuki accepted
you as her Amica, Shino.

317
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,875
That's right.

318
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,958
[AKARI] Oh, yeah, I've been
meaning to ask you.

319
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,083
How did you end up scoring
an interview with her?

320
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,958
Huh? Uh. Well, to be honest,

321
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,083
I asked the Masters to
make a recommendation.

322
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,375
Just from looking at you

323
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,416
I can tell you have very
strong feelings for someone.

324
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,583
[gasps]

325
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,833
I believe that you
and I are a lot alike.

326
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,208
[SHINO]
Huh?

327
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,208
I can give you some training
to win over your love

328
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,708
while at the same
time determining

329
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,291
if you're properly
fit to become my Amica.

330
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,666
Uh. Thanks.

331
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,541
Cooking is one of
the most reliable

332
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,166
and fastest ways to win
over someone's heart.

333
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,041
[SHINO]
I'll do my best!

334
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,500
Never accept never!

335
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,083
Never accept never!

336
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,750
[SHIRAYUKI] Infrared cameras
are more effective

337
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,625
on swimsuits than underwear.

338
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,000
That's excellent info!

339
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Make sure you run the pictures

340
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,708
through analytical software.

341
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,000
And back up all the files
on three drives, right?

342
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,958
Shirayuki's pouring all of
her love into these lessons!

343
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,875
[BOTH laughing]

344
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,416
Destroy your rivals right away!

345
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,583
Destroy my rivals!

346
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,708
Especially if she has pink hair!

347
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,833
Bring her down as
soon as you see her!

348
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,250
You really know your stuff!

349
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
How dare you even think

350
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,458
of making a move on my Kkn!

351
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,500
Oh, yay!

352
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,833
You mean it? You're
making me your Amica?

353
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,333
Well, of course!

354
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,791
She really is such
an amazing person.

355
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:15,958
[AKARI]
Uh, Shino?

356
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,875
[RAIKA] Hey. You went
dead silent. Uh...

357
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,166
[SHINO giggles]

358
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,000
[SHINO] It's gotten so late.
Why don't you stay the night?

359
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,333
Oh, I'm okay.

360
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,166
And besides, I'd hate to
cut in on someone's game.

361
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,166
[KIRIN giggles]

362

Don't forget.
Butei Charter Article 6.

"Think for yourself,
and act on your own."

[ALL]
Thank you for training us!

366
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,166
[KIRIN] Hey, Raika.
You're not still upset, right?

367
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,333
[RAIKA sighs]

368
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,125
If it's any consolation to you,

369
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,375
I'm flattered by
all the jealousy.

370
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,166
Please don't be upset with me.

371
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,875
I'm not mad at you or
anything. It's just...

372
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,333
What is it?

373
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,041
[RAIKA] It's just that
I'm not really sure

374
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,208
if you want me
to be your mentor.

375
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,708
[gasps]

376
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,333
I mean, Akari's got Aria,
and Shino's got Shirayuki.

377
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,750
They're both incredible
and you're stuck with me.

378
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,458
A Year 1 student who's
only good at sports.

379
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,791
I would never wanna be
anyone else's Amica.

380
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,250
You don't even realize how long
I've had my eye on you, do you?

381
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,500
[gasps]

382
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,750
Wait, you have?

383
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
Yeah.

384
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,250
Ever since I popped in to
observe the gym with my friends.

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,291
But I was worried that you
wouldn't want to accept me.

386
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,875
I'm so tiny and weak, I'm like
the exact opposite of you.

387
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,416
I was too nervous to
strike up a conversation.

388
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,708
When I finally asked
to be your Amica,

389
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,125
I had to muster up every
ounce of courage I have.

390
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,166
Hey, Raika. Kirin.

391
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,625
They sent me to tell you
our bedrooms are ready.

392
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,375
[RAIKA]
Cool.

393
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,125
Well, then. Ready?

394
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,708
Yep! Let's go!

395
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,375
This here is
Miss Akari's pillow.

396
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,416
And this is a brand new replica!

397
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,125
Wow.

398
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,541
Fantastic work!

00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,791
[MAIDS]
Thanks!

00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,208
[SHINO]
Akari's actual pillow.

401
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,583
I'll give her the new one and
tell her I got it dry cleaned!

402
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm giving her a new one,
so it's okay, right?!

403
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,750
Oh, Shirayuki,
you'd be so proud of me!

404
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,708
[AKARI] I have to get
good at riding this,

405
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,625
so I'll practice all
weekend if I need to!

406
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,041
[yelps]

407
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,083
C'mon. I will raise my rank.

408
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,833
I'm not gonna let that
dumb dream come true.

409
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,250
[ARIA]
What exactly are you doing?

410
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,125
[gasps]

411
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,375
[AKARI]
Aria!

412
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,708
So. This is part of
Riko's training, huh?

413
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,208
How come you're the only person
out here still working?

414
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,541
And here I was a little worried

415
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,083
you might've already gone
to bed for the night.

416
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,208
Why are you pushing
yourself so hard?

417
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,625
[AKARI] Because Takachiho
told me that I can't do it.

418
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,833
[ARIA]
She did?

419
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,291
[AKARI]
She used the phrase you told me

420
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,791
to remove from my vocabulary.

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,875
[sighs]

422
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,041
Jeez...

423
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,083
You sure are stubborn,
you know that?

424
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,375
But that's actually one of
the things I like about you.

425
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,958
We've known each other
for a while now.

426
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,166
How long has it been since you
became my Amica in training?

427
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,541
[AKARI]
A few weeks.

428
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,375
[ARIA] I've been giving
you lessons when I can

429
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,083
but do you feel like
you're mastering them?

430
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,500
[AKARI]
Uh. Well, I'm trying.

431
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,791
Let's go a quick round.

432
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,416
A one-on-one match
will give me the chance

433
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
to see exactly how much
you've improved.

434
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,291
[AKARI]
Uh! You mean right now?

435
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,875
Try to at least
hide your surprise.

436
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,250
You do remember, right?

437
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,791
You've gotta get this back
if you wanna beco--

438
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,541
That was actually better
than I expected.

439
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,000
But your moves are too simple,

440
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,666
allowing your opponent
to read them.

441
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,583
You have to be flexible
when you fight.

442
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,208
Be flexible. I can do that!

443
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,708
You're not there yet.

444
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,666
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

445
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,083
[ARIA]
But...

446
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,208
...your moves seem to be
gradually growing similar

447
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,750
to mine.

448
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,750
I'll be on the
Quartet sidelines,

449
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,958
so make sure you win, okay?

450
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,208
[gasps]

451
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,083
[AKARI]
Thank you, Aria!

452
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,000
[TAKAMAGAHARA]
Hiding flags and passing them

453
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,000
to your other team members
is accepted within the rules.

454
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,250
Rubber bullets are the only
bullets you're allowed to fire.

455
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,833
But be careful because a
headshot can still kill someone.

456
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,708
Let's all do our best.

457
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,000
[TAKACHIHO]
Ugh!

458
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,250
Seriously?

[TAKACHIHO] Don't talk
to me like we're equals.

460

It's insulting.

What's that old saying?

462
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,250
One's soul dwells
within their pupils?

Well, good luck, girls.

[AKARI]
We won't lose!

466

[TAKACHIHO] I wonder...
Could this be fate?

--[SHINO] Akari!

00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,500
[TAKACHIHO]
Did that hurt?
