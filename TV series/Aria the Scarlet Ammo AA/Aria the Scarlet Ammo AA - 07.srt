[SERVANTS]
Welcome home, Miss.

2
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,708
Here. Your shade, Miss.

3
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,833
[YAYA]
Please stay under it, Miss,

4
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,208
the desert sun is
especially strong.

5
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,666
[AKARI]
Hello, Miss!

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,375
And how are you doing
on this fine after--?

7
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,666
[TAKACHIHO]
You're late!

8
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,166
I didn't see you out
here waiting for me.

9
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,125
It won't happen again!

10
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,958
I'll go make you a glass
of strawberry lemonade.

11
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,166
[TAKACHIHO] Now? You should
have it already made!

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,375
[AKARI]
I'm... sorry, I forgot--

13
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,208
[TAKACHIHO]
You're the worst girl here!

14
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,583
But I know how to get
the best out of you.

15
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,791
[AKARI whimpering]

16
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,708
No, not that! I beg for
your forgiveness! Please!

17
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,000
You've been bad.
And my mind is made up.

18
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,958
What? No! Not that!
Anything, but that, Miss!

19
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,000
[TAKACHIHO] Begging
will only make it worse.

20
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,041
[AKARI]
I learned my lesson.

21
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,416
Strawberry lemonade. Right?

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,083
[chuckles]

23
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,500
[whimpers] I beg you...

24
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,583
No! Please not the whip!

25
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,875
[yelps]

26
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,458
I am so sorry!

27
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,333
[TAKACHIHO]
Tickle-tickle-tickle...!

28
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,625
[AKARI laughing]

29
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,958
Now, to tickle the other
side! Tickle-tickle!

30
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,833
Is this where you're
most ticklish?

31
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,958
You like that, don't you?
Well, I like it even more!

32
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,708
[laughing]

33
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,791
Yes! Yes! Yes!

34
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,541
[TAKACHIHO, AKARI laughing]

35
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,625

[gasps]

37
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,083
Akari Mamiya.

38
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,083
[TAKACHIHO]
She's so cute. I must have her!

39
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,541
[TAKACHIHO]
Hey, Akari.

40
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,500
What's up, Takachiho?

41
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,708
I have this giant
list of crazy things

42
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,583
I just desperately
wanna do to you.

43
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,958
I'll pay you lots of money

44
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,958
if you let me start
checking them off.

45
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,541
Of course you can do that!

46
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,958
Oh... Great!

47
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,125
Then put on these cat ears,

48
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,416
get down on all fours,
and say "meow."

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,166
Sounds fun, but I
really just want you

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,291
to tickle me again, 'kay?

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,250
I've never been good at
coming up with original stories

52
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
for my dolls!

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,333
[AKARI]
I've never seen you yawn before.

54
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,166
Didn't get enough sleep?

55
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,625
[ARIA] Of course, I yawn.
I'm still human.

56
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,000
But yes, I was up super
late finishing a report.

57
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,000
[AKARI]
Yeah, I know how that goes.

58
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,291
[ANNOUNCER]
A-Train now arriving.

59
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,083
[AKARI gasps]

60
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,083
It's important to act like
a Butei at all times.

61
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,083
That means paying attention
to your surroundings

62
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,916
and being on guard.

63
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,416
[gasps]

64
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,375
[gasps]

65
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,375
[ARIA]
In short, a Butei is prepared

66
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,833
for every situation imaginable.

67
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,416
Uh. Right.

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,750
[ARIA]
Though I admit,

69
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,666
trying to take advantage
of me just now was smart.

70
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,666
[AKARI]
I'll try even harder next time!

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,875
[ARIA]
Hm.

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,291
[TAKACHIHO] Maybe I should
take some writing classes...

73
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,541
[TAKACHIHO]
No.

74
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,291
Last thing I need is even
more vivid fantasies

75
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,166
to lose myself in.

76
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,458
[TAKACHIHO]
You little cutie. Don't do that.

77
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,041
[TAKACHIHO]
I wanna be her friend for real.

78
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,333
[TAKACHIHO]
But does she wanna be mine?

79
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,250
Thank you so much.
They're beautiful.

80
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,458
[TAKACHIHO] I have this
giant list of crazy things

81
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,666
I just desperately
wanna do to you.

82
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,583
I just don't know
where we go from here.

83

[TAKACHIHO]
Uhh...

87
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,458
Um... Uh, how much was that?

88
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,416
[AKARI]
Uh... how much was what?

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,708
Uh!  I'm talking about
that family restaurant

90
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,458
the other day.

91
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,791
The one I stopped by.

92
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,416
[AKARI]
Huh?

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,625
Ice cream sundaes.

94
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,625
You know, their hand-scooped
strawberry ones.

95
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,875
How much are they?

96
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,875
Oh, um... Wait, let me think.

97
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,208
[TAKACHIHO]
I'm so good.

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,875
I turned an awkward moment
into normal small talk.

99
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,416
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,458
I'll check next time, though.

101
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,833
Well, I guess I better
get back to class!

102
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,250
See ya!

103
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,458
[ELEVATOR VOICE]
Doors are closing.

104
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,166
[TAKACHIHO]
Akari will be mine!

105
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,250
Oh, yes.

106
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,458
If I, Urura Takachiho,
want something, I will get it!

107
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,125

A rose?

110
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,958
[AKARI]
I'm home!

111
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,958
[NONOKA]
Hi, Sis, what's up?

112
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,125
[AKARI]
You see these?

113
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,125
[NONOKA] Whoa.
Someone left you roses?

--[YUYU] Let's go.
--[YAYA] Yeah.

115
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,875
Well, Akari... You're
popular with guys.

116
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,500
That's nice of you to say
that, but it's not likely.

117
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,208
Have you opened the card?

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,916
[AKARI] Hm... They look kinda
weird in our apartment.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,833
[NONOKA] That's 'cause they
weren't even in a proper vase.

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,666
[AKARI]
All right, moment of truth.

[AKARI gasps]

someone's up there!

[MOTHER]
Don't point! It's a psycho!

[GIRL, MOTHER screaming]

126
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,458
[YUYU] We made it there
before she got home.

127
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,083
It was a close call, though.

128
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,000
[YAYA] All we had time to do
was drop off the flowers

129
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,500
and note. Now please,
Miss. What's going on?

130
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,875
[TAKACHIHO]
Little foot soldiers

131
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,416
should not be asking their
mighty general questions

132
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,250
about her grand strategy.

133
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,416
[YUYU]
I'm worried.

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,750
[YAYA] She's never
gotten higher than a C

And the décor reflects
your personality really well!

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,291
Oh! Those roses are the same
as the ones you gave to me!

140
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,583
Oh, yes. A symbol
of our love union.

141
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,041
[AKARI] Oh, please,
make me your sex slave!

142

[TAKACHIHO]
You're a fast one, aren't you?

[TAKACHIHO clears throat]

145
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,583
Well, you may finish your
drinks, but then you must leave.

146
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,833
[YUYU, YAYA]
Hm?

147
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,333
[YUYU] She's disrespecting us
even more than usual.

She's a slave master!

00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,541
[AKARI] Oh, no! Why are
they glaring? I was invited!

161
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,916
[door opens]

162
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,916
[YUYU]
Miss Urara?

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,083
[YAYA]
We have Akari.

164
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,083
[gasps]

165
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,791
[TAKACHIHO]
She's here already?!

166
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,125
Oh. Wow.

167
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,958
Looks like she's setting
up for a big party.

168
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,541
Hi. I mean, hello.

169
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,416
Amazing! Takachiho,
you're beautiful!

170
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,708
Yes. And so are you.

171
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,833
--[TAKACHIHO giggling]
--Great cake!

172
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,166
[YUYU growls]

173
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,708
Once again, congrats on
being promoted to D Rank.

174
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,791
Oh! Thank you!

175
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,000
[squeals]

176
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,166
[TAKACHIHO]
She's so cute. And innocent!

177
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,208
[TAKACHIHO] So, um...
I have a quick question.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,916
Would... Would you say that
we're now... that we're...?

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,375
Are you and I... friends now?

180
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,916
Uh, yeah. Guess you
could say that.

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,541
[echoing]
Guess you could say that...

182
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,125
Yes!

183
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,625
But wait! Hey!

184
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,666
Don't you want us to be
more than just friends?

185
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,333
What?

186
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,916
[TAKACHIHO laughing]

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,208
Let's take our friendship to the
next level, right here and now!

188
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,583
Now just... lie back!

189
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,458
[AKARI yelps]

190
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
[SHINO]
Spy, spy, spy, spy!

191
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,666
Um... What're you doing to me?

192
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,416
[TAKACHIHO] If you don't
like it, I'm happy to pay you!

193
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,666
[TAKACHIHO] I've been dreaming
of this very moment

194
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,125
since Quartet ended!

195
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,916
[TAKACHIHO laughs]

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
[AKARI screaming]

197
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,416
What? I didn't even take
your clothes off! Hm?

198
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,458
[gasps]

199
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,541
You peeper!

200
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,500
[SHINO]
I'm not the pervert here!

201
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,916
Now stop! Get your
hands off her!

202
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,166
Uh, Shino, hold on.

203
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,916
You can't seduce her
because she was mine first!

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,541
I will not stand aside

205
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,875
and let you beguile Akari with
your wealth and evil charms.

206
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,125
I'm not seducing her.
You see, she...

207
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,791
...has chosen to be
my new best friend.

208
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,125
[grunts]

209
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
[TAKACHIHO] Oh, Shino,
you're the kind of person

210
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,750
who'd ruin Akari by
spoiling her with love.

211
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,125
Now me, I'll be demanding
with her and with myself.

212
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,666
We'll push each other and
become real women together!

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,375
What? Become women?

214
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,916
[AKARI gasps]

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
--[AKARI] Goodbye, girlhood!
-- [TAKACHIHO] It feels so good,

216
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,875
--From now on, I am a woman!
--doesn't it? So right!

217
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,791
[SHINO]
I challenge you to a duel!

218
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,916
What?!

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,208
I'm not giving her
up without a fight!

220
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,125
All right. We shall
have a duel then.

221
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,625
A duel? I'm not worth it!

222
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,625
We will meet after
school tomorrow.

223
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,708
[TAKACHIHO]
Fine!

224
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,875
[AKARI]
Why are my friends so violent?

225
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,833
All right, c'mon, guys.

226
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,750
You've taken this
duel thing far enough!

227
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,166
Akari.

228
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,583
Our school honor code says
nothing on fighting duels.

229
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,291
But they're not
encouraged, either.

230
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,416
So if you rat us out, you'll
ruin our permanent records.

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,833
[SHINO]
I'm with her.

232
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,583
There are times when a girl's
gotta defend her honor.

233
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,500
Urara Takachiho.

234
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,291
You're accused of forcing
yourself on Akari!

235
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,958
I find you guilty!

236
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,916
There was no forcing of
anything, and you were creeping!

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,125
You are guilty!

238
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,916
[SHINO] I warn you
not to underestimate me

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,125
just because I'm from Inquesta.

240
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,041
As a matter of fact,
you should use your gun.

241
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,333
[TAKACHIHO] If I did that,
you'd be dead in a half-second.

242
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916
Besides, I went
to fencing nationals.

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,583
And I like showing off
any chance I can get!

244
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,625
[yells]

245
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,375
You'll find that this saber...

246
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,291
...is as flexible
as any leather whip.

247
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,666
[SHINO] I'll turn her
strength into a weakness.

248
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,250
[chuckles]

249
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,541
[TAKACHIHO] I know you're trying
to close the space between us.

250
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,750
But that won't happen because
I have the longer reach!

251
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,833
[TAKACHIHO] To excel at
the sword drawing technique

252
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,833
of Iaijutsu requires
perfect timing.

253
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,916
Whether a scabbard's there
or not makes no difference.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,416
[SHINO growls]

255
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,083
[TAKACHIHO] And unlike you,
my timing is always perfect!

256
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,583
Girls, that's enough.
I think you've both-- Ah!

257
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,625
You're outta room!

258
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,250
It's not over!

259
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,291
[RUI] Today's target
practice sure was boring.

260
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,291
[MOYU] There's gotta be
something fun to do on campus.

261
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,375
[KUU]
Well, let's look around.

262
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,083
[clang]

263
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,291
[ALL gasp]

264
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,541
[RUI]
Did you guys hear that?

265
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,583
[MOYU] Sounds like two
pieces of metal hitting.

266
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,750
[KIRA]
It could be a fight! Let's go!

267
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:08,833
[SHINO panting]

268
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,083
Seriously, stop before
one of you gets hurt!

269
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,833
[TAKACHIHO, SHINO]
I won't give up!

270
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,750
[SHINO] If I time this right, I
can do the Turning Swallow Cut.

271
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,250
[TAKACHIHO]
That was it, right?

272
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,500
The perfect time for
you to make your move,

273
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,250
if only I step in just
a half foot closer.

274
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,666
[SHINO]
It's now or never.

275
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,333
[AKARI]
Careful, please.

276
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,625
What're you doing?

277
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,500
[TAKACHIHO laughs]

278
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,750
You look so scared and awkward.

279
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,666
[SHINO]
This is my only chance.

280
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,250
[SHINO]
Come on. Please.

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,416
[SHINO]
Please work!

282
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,458
[gasps]

283
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,125
[SHINO]
Turning Swallow Cut!

284
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,666
[gasps]

285
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,875
[gasping]

286
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,333
[SHINO sneezes]

287
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,375
[SHINO]
Stay calm, Shino.

288
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,375
So what if the gamble
didn't quite pay off?

289
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,833
You still have a chance to win.

290
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,666
[TAKACHIHO]
This duel's as good as won.

291
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,625
I just turned a mistake
into a huge opportunity!

292
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,875
[SHINO]
So...

293
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,000
[TAKACHIHO]
What?

294
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,791
[SHINO]
How did... Akari's...

295
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,000
...chest smell...

296
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,208
...when you were
motorboating her?

297
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,583
[TAKACHIHO]
Oh, please!

298
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,583
Why don't you tell me?
I know you have her pillow!

299
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,208
And I bet that you...

300
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,250
...didn't throw away the
straw she used last night

301
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,333
in your dining room.

302
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,583
Of course not.

303
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,916
Why?

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,666
Are you looking to trade
something of hers for it?

305
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,416
I got some strands of her hair.

306
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,375
So... how 'bout I give you
two of them... for the straw.

307
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,541
I want five.

308
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,750
Five? You're even
greedier than your dad!

309
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:53,625
How 'bout three?

310
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,916
No, four!

311
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,333
[AKARI] Well, at least
they're not trying

312
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,916
to kill each other now.

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,208
Come on, you two.

314
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,166
It's not that hard
to kiss and make up.

315
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,416
[RUI]
Wow! A sword fight?

316
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,708
Are you fighting a real duel?

317
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,208
That's like so old school!

318
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
Do you mind if
we Instagram this?

319
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,541
[ALL gasp]

320
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,625
[AKARI]
Crap! Witnesses!

321
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,250
Great! Hold that pose!

322
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,833
And now, could you please
tilt your heads to my left?

323
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,041
I love it!

324
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,625
Pics are great,
but let's get video!

325
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,083
[TAKACHIHO, SHINO]
Would you shut up?!

326
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,666
We're not here
to entertain you!

327
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,791
[screaming]

328
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,583
[BOTH]
Akari!

329
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,625
No!

330
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,791
[AKARI sighs]

331
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,708
[sighs]

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,291
What were you thinking?
You could've died, Akari!

333
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,208
She's right! Do you like
making us worry? Do you?

334
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,500
Guys, I'm sorry.
Trust me, I am.

335
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,750
But I had faith.

336
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,083
I knew that in a pinch,

337
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,333
you two would stop fighting
and help each other.

338
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,416
[SHINO, TAKACHIHO]
Uh...

339
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,708
And you did even better
than I expected!

340
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,041
You worked like old friends.

341
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,708
Well, look.

342
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,541
I don't know why you two
were so set on fighting a duel

343
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,958
to the death,

344
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,625
but the fact of the matter is,
I'm friends with Shino.

345
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,791
And now I'm friends
with Takachiho.

346
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,333
So that makes...

347
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,166
...the two of you
friends as well,

348
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,458
'cause the friend of your
friend is your friend!

349
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,333
Between us three, there's
plenty of love to go around!

350
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,375
[BOTH gasp]

351
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,666
[BOTH squeal]

352
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,583
[SHINO, TAKACHIHO]
What a sinful little angel!

353
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,500
[TAKACHIHO]
Shino.

354
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,416
When Akari jumped
for that falling girl,

355
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,750
you were a hair quicker
than me in going after them.

356
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,958
That means your love for her...

357
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,416
...is still stronger than mine.

358
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,541
I can't believe
she's admitting this!

359
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,916
Wait. Love?

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,416
[TAKACHIHO]
But while I admit that,

361
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm not about to give up my
new friendship with Akari.

362
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,333
There's also the unfinished
business of our sword duel.

363
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,583
So while friend's a stretch,
I will call you a "good rival."

364
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,708
Akari. Be careful.

365
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,166
Like me, Shino wants
to be naughty with you.

366
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,041
[AKARI]
Naughty?

367
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,625
Play dolls with you,
spank you, kiss you,

368
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,416
tickle you, put her face
in your chest and blow,

369
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,291
put her hand up your skirt
and all sorts of other stuff.

370
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,916
--[SHINO squeals]
--[AKARI] Huh?

371
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,958
[ARIA] I heard you and Takachiho
are friends now. Good.

372
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,125
Yeah! We're on great terms!

373
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,000
How are you? Still really tired?

374
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,291
[ARIA]
Yeah...

375
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,458
[ARIA]
Lot of reports, lately.

376
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,375
[AKARI]
Aria.

377
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,500
[ARIA]
Hm?

378
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,000
One day soon...

379
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,041
...I'm getting back my gun.

380
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,291
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
When will you make a move?

381
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,250
[RIKO]
Hmm... Probably not for a bit.

382
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,625
Sorry to keep you
waiting like that.

383
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,833
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
It's fine. Take your time.

384
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,250
There's still plenty
of stuff I need to do.

385
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,125
[RIKO] Why are you painting
each one of your nails

386
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,500
a different color?

387
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,833
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Because,

388
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,625
I like having as much of
my collection as possible

389
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,916
right at my fingertips.

390
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,041
[RIKO]
I see.

391
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,666
[RIKO]
Collection, huh?

392
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,333
[TAKACHIHO] Welcome, friends,
to the Spa Resort Takachiho!

393
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,583
[AKARI]
Whoa! All right!

394
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,958
[TAKACHIHO] Oh, sweet,
defenseless little...

395
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,000
[ARIA]
I can swim, Riko!

396
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,333
[KIRIN]
We can't do this in public!

397
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:02,333
[RAIKA]
Don't go grabbing my--!

398
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,541
[SHINO]
You're utterly shameless!

399
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,458
[TAKACHIHO]
This bikini is meant for Akari.

400
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,000
Constructed from a
very special fabric.
