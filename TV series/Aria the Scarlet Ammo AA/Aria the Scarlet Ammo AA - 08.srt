1
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,375
[AKARI laughs]
Octopus fishing is so fun!

2
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,833
[ARIA gasps]
Oh hey, you caught something!

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,750
[AKARI gasps]

4
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,666
[AKARI]
I did it, I caught one!

5
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,791
[AKARI laughs]

6
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:06,833
[AKARI yelps]

7
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,250
What, seriously? Stop!

8
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:14,500
[AKARI giggling]

9
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,541
[AKARI groans]

10
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,375
[AKARI]
Oh man, that hurt.

11
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,500
[AKARI gasps]

12
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,750
What's the matter, Sis?

13
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,208
Oh. Please don't tell me...

14
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,166
Why is... that wet?

15
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,041
But... You're in high school!

16
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,208
Where's your control?

17
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,458
No, I didn't!

18
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,625
I would never, I mean,
someone else must've--

19
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,875
[AKARI]
Oh, wait.

20
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,208
I opened that right
before I went to sleep.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,333
Oh, thank goodness.

22
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,416
I was so embarrassed for you.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,458
I know. I'm so relieved.

24
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,625
[AKARI]
Yeah, well...

25
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,541
I guess I know why I was
dreaming about the ocean now.

26
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,708
Yeah, that's cause
and effect for ya.

27
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,500
[AKARI]
Aria was in my dream, too.

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,833
Ma'am...

29
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,625
Akari is walking eastward,
accompanied by her sister.

30
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,583
They appear to be
headed towards the bridge.

31
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,125
You may have won
the battle, Shino,

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
but I will always win the war.

33
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,708
That's the Takachiho way.

34
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,416
Yes. It is.

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,166
Let's get there before they do.

36
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,833
Whole unit! Move out!

37
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,083
[YAYA gasps]
Hey, wait! We weren't ready!

38
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,416
[YUYU] What does
she mean, "whole unit"?

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,125
She's only got us!

40
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,041
[NONOKA] The supermarket on
the other side of the bridge

41
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,250
is having a sale.

42
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,541
It's one per customer,

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,375
but you can buy half
a dozen eggs for 50 yen.

44
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,583
Whad'ya say we have fun
and take the long way?

45
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,125
Works for me!

46
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,500
We can eat as many omelets
as we want with all those eggs!

47
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, man, I can't wait!

48
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:21,791
[TAKACHIHO]
Oh, my!

49
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,875
Is that who I think it is?

50
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,875
[TAKACHIHO]
Bonjour!

51
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,541
Akari. What a coincidence.

52
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,125
Total coincidence.

53
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,666
Yeah. Talk about
a crazy coincidence.

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,000
[AKARI]
Takachiho!

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,791
Hey, Yuyu! Yaya!

56
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,583
Oh, it's you.

57
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,083
Uh, thanks for sending the
beautiful roses the other day.

58
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,125
[TAKACHIHO chuckles]

59
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,708
Well, my pleasure.

60
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,625
I should be thanking you for
all that your sister has done.

61
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,958
That's nice.

62
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,041
Well, we were just heading
to the grocery store.

63
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,375
They've got a really
great special on eggs.

64
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
A carton for 50 yen!

65
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,625
Oh, wow!

66
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,625
You've just enticed me
to tag along.

67
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,291
[NONOKA]
Huh?

68
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,125
Oh, you don't mind.

69
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,625
The more the merrier, right?

70
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,291
[NONOKA] Sure, but it's
kind of a long walk to--

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,208
We can get more eggs now!

72
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,791
Happy to help.

73
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,833
And we happen to be out for a
long stroll right now, anyway.

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,875
[chuckles]

75
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,125
[AKARI]
Talk about embarrassing, right?

76
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,125
Nonoka almost had me convinced
that I really did wet the bed.

77
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,375
[NONOKA]
Enough, Sis.

78
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,791
Quit talking about pee,
we're drinking tea here.

79
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,916
She gets carried away. Sorry.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,291
That's okay.

81
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,000
For the record, it was
nothing more than some water

82
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,166
I accidentally spilled.

83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,625
It wasn't pee, okay?
It was silly.

84
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,125
And it made me have a dream
about the ocean and an octopus.

85
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,583
The ocean, you say?

86
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,166
Oh my!

87
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,625
[TAKACHIHO]
Perfect!

88
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,041
I can bring up my invitation
without raising suspicion.

89
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,958
Hot damn, I'm good.
Even my luck is good!

90
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,666
[TAKACHIHO]
That reminds me...

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,541
Do you happen to
be free tomorrow?

92
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,708
Yeah, I think so.

93
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
[TAKACHIHO]
Well, then.

94
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,333
How about we make your dream
of the ocean come true?

95
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,833
I'm inviting you
to the water park

96
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,000
the Takachiho Conglomerate owns.

97
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,458
We'll have the place
to ourselves,

98
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,625
and I've got an
extra swimsuit for you.

99
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,500
Whoa! Really? Awesome!

100
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,666
Are you serious?

101
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,708
We don't have
octopuses, though.

102
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,833
[TAKACHIHO chuckles]

103
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,916
Oh, sweet, defenseless
little goldfish.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,458
I'll lure you into the pool

105
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,583
and show you just how
deep my friendship goes.

106
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,458
[laughing]

107
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,791
Were you saying something?

108
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,875
[TAKACHIHO gasps]

109
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,916
Just that I'm excited!

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,791
Let's hear who's coming!
Count off!

111
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,541
One!

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,125
Two.

113
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:32,708
[YUYU]
Three!

114
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,666
[YAYA]
Four!

115
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,500
Five!

116
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,041
And six!

117
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,416
Make that seven!

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,458
Hey, cool!

119
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,458
No way!

120
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,416
I don't remember
inviting you guys!

121
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,458
Little did you know,

122
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,416
we were tracking
you tracking Akari.

123
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
I know you tried
to throw me off guard

124
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,916
with your little
speech the other day.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,500
And now here you are,
making your move.

126
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,166
So, then, "the more
the merrier," right?

127
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,875
[AKARI]
Mm-hmm!

128
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,416
I certainly think so!

129
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,333
Oh, hey, yeah,
do you mind if Aria comes?

130
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,250
I'd love to invite her
if that's cool!

131
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,458
[TAKACHIHO]
Uh...

132
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,541
Um... Well, uh...

133
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,208
Of course, you can!

134
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,250
You're welcome to invite
as many friends as you want!

135
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,166
Fantastic!

136
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,916
[TAKACHIHO]
Oh damn it!

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,583
And right when I had Akari
in the palm of my hand!

138
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,166
This is all your fault for not
being cautious enough!

139
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,958
You asked for this punishment!

140
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,916
[NONOKA]
Hey, um...

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
This is kinda weird...

142
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,500
This is part of her education!
I'm not doing it out of cruelty!

143
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,083
You worthless idiot!

144
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,791
[YUYU]
Thank you for teaching me!

145
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,250
[TAKACHIHO]
Shino...

146
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,875
[SHINO] I owe you
an apology for earlier.

147
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,750
And why would you apologize?

148
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,500
Because yesterday's enemies...

149
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,291
...could be today's friends.

150
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,208
[ARIA]
No, I'm too busy for that.

151
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,458
Well, I don't
wanna go to a pool.

152
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,833
What pool?

153
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,166
But Takachiho's
opening it just for us.

154
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,708
We'll have it to ourselves!

155
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,208
The place is called
Spa Resort Takachiho.

156
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,958
And it's not only a pool,
it's like a full-on water park!

157
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,333
Please come, Aria!

158
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,458
No. I just don't like
swimming, all right?

159
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,208
Don't you mean
that you can't swim?

160
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,541
Hey! Who told you that?

161
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,583
I can swim just
fine with floaties!

162
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,000
Wait, what're you doing here?

163
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,708

As you can see, it's
the same design as mine.

Except that Akari's
has been constructed

from a very special fabric.

225

Oh, yes.

00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,083
They're so cute!

326
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,000
[TAKACHIHO]
They're actually robot dolphins.

327
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,375
[AKARI]
That's awesome!

328
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,541
[TAKACHIHO]
What's happening here?

329
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,166
[TAKACHIHO]
Why is it not shrinking?

330
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,791
Look at me!

331
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,500
This is amazing!

332
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,875
[SHINO]
Oh yeah.

333
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,875
The infrared camera does
work nicely on swimsuits.

334
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,416
I'm too scared, Raika!

335
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,666
Kirin, you can't just
go around grabbing my--

336
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,375
[yells]
Holy crap, Kirin!

337
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,291
Here we go!

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
[KUU laughing]

339
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,916
You're doing so
incredibly awesome, Kuu!

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,791
This starfish is really cool!

341
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,208
And super cute!

342
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,500
[RAIKA yells]
Stop!

343
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,375
It's okay, Raika,
we're almost to the bottom!

344
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,416
[RAIKA screams]

345
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,958
[ALL squeal]

346
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,333
Uh, hey, Raika...

347
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,833
OMG! Everybody's looking
right at us!

348
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,125
We can't do this in public!

349
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,333
[ALL]
You should kiss her!

350
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,333
Kiss her!

351
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,916
That's messed up
on so many levels!

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,958
[glass clamoring]

353
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,750
[NONOKA]
Uh...

354
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,750
Sorry for the interruption.

355
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,583
I uh, I didn't know
that uh, y'know,

356
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,125
the two of you were a uh...

357
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,416
What? No!
It's not what it looks like!

358
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,541
[KIRIN]
It's exactly what it looks like!

359
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,708
[RIKO]
Hey, Aria!

360
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,791
Hop in, it feels great!

361
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,041
How can you sit there
and waste this opportunity?

362
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,166
I can swim, Riko!

363
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
As long as it's
shallow enough to stand.

364
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,583
[RIKO] Your little legs
are probably too short.

365
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,333
[ARIA]
Riko!

366
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,500
[ARIA gasps, yells]

00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,875

Help!

00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,375
[RIKO laughing]

369
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,250
Reki!

370
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,666
I am... a single bullet.

Hey, that hurt!

00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,833
[ARIA] I am so gonna
pump you full of holes!

374
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,375
[RIKO]
Whatever.

375
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,208
Aw, is the deadweight mad?

376
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,625
[ARIA]
Holes! Holes!

377
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,833
[AKARI]
Hey, Aria!

378
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,791
Do you wanna play
split the watermelon?

379
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,958
[ARIA]
Split the watermelon?

380
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:05,875
[AKARI]
Yeah!

381
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,541
[ARIA]
You can be so childish.

382
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,333
Thank you, but no thank you.

383
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,208
I have no interest
in any of that.

384
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,916
Besides, it's just downright
wasteful to play with food.

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,416
[RIKO]
Sounds like fun to me!

386
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,916
[ARIA]
Hey, cut it out, Riko!

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,958
Let go of my hand! Seriously!

388
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,750
[RIKO]
All of us can play together.

389
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,541
[RIKO]
Aria! A little to the right!

390
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,750
[AKARI]
Now a little bit lower!

391
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,041
You're almost there!

392
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:27,916
[TAKACHIHO]
There you go!

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,416
That's it, right around there!

394
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,208
Split it Butei style!

395
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,958
It's so much more exciting
using real bullets!

396
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,875
[TAKACHIHO]
The most delicious watermelons

397
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,583
are grown in Tottori.

398
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,625
[YUYU, YAYA gasp]

399
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,583
[HINA]
Perfect split!

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,458
What do we do here?

405
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,500
We obviously gave
Miss Urara the swimsuit

406
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,750
that was supposed
to be for Akari.

407
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,500
Maybe if we can
get it to dry...

408
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,875
[YUYU]
Come on, come on!

409
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,750
[YAYA]
It's not getting bigger!

410
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,958
[YUYU, YAYA]
Please get dry!

411
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,458
Here, try this, Akari.

412
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,458
No, you should eat mine first.

413
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,625
[BOTH]
Ahh!

414
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,291
[AKARI gasps]
I found 10 yen!

All right. What're you
trying to pull here?

What am I...?

00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,208
What do you think
you're trying to do?

418
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,291
Silly me!

419
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,208
It's just an old,
rusted bottle cap.

00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,833
[NONOKA]
Aw, jeez, Sis.

421
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,791
Quit pickin' stuff
up off the ground.

422
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,041
[TAKACHIHO] It looks like
her suit hasn't shrunk any!

423
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,208
What's going on?

424
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,791
[SHINO]
I'm not crazy.

425
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,958
Her swimsuit's the one
that's shrinking.

426
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,625
[TAKACHIHO]
Ready?

427
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,416
It's about time for
the new ceiling cycle.

00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,500
[AKARI]
Oh! Beautiful!

429
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,166
[TAKACHIHO] It hasn't shrunk
in the slightest bit yet.

430
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,083
Well then, time for plan B.

431
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,625
Open the trapdoor,
and soak her in warm water!

432
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,541
Oh crap!

433
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,125
That's the final resort button!

434
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,458
No! This is so bad!

435
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,083
[TAKACHIHO] We can get an
even better view over here.

436
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,583
[AKARI]
Cool. Okay.

437
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,791
[TAKACHIHO] This is precisely
where the trapdoor is located.

438
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,375
The two of us will just slip
into our little love room alone.

[TAKACHIHO] What the hell
are you two doing?

441
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,875
Don't do it, Miss Urara!

442
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,583
Everyone'll think
you're a pervert!

443
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,333
[TAKACHIHO]
Stop it!

444
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,583
[SHINO]
Yep. I knew it.

445
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,625
They must've switched
the suits on accident.

446
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,125
[SHINO]
We're aborting the operation!

447
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:43,916
[AKARI]
Operation?

448
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
I'm not aborting anything!

449
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,458
Are you betraying me?

What the hell?

453
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,833
This is my heated love spa.

454
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,833
Thank you so much for
ruining the operation.

455

[SHINO gasps]

456
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,625
[SHINO]
Uh... Takachiho!

457
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,791
[TAKACHIHO screams]
What?!

458
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,458
Why? Why am I naked?!

459
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,208
[YUYU, YAYA]
Hey, Miss Urara?

460
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,250
[YUYU]
Uh... We are so sorry!

461
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,958
[YAYA] We accidentally mixed up
the bathing suits earlier!

462
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,083
[TAKACHIHO] Those two are
the most useless idiots

463
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,791
this world ever crapped out!

464
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,583
[TAKACHIHO]
Give me your swimsuit right now!

465
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,583
[SHINO]
Are you crazy?!

466
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,125
Then I'd be naked!

467
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,291
What were you gonna do
to Akari down here?

468
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,000
This room is straight
out of a sleazy motel!

469
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,916
[TAKACHIHO] You have no right
to ask me that question!

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,250
Don't act like you
weren't planning on

471
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,791
doing the same thing!

472
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,125
[AKARI]
What's going on?

473
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,125
[YUYU]
Avert your eyes!

474
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,625
[YAYA]
Nothing to see down there!

475
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,291
[TAKACHIHO] Oh, whatever,
you creepy voyeur!

476
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,916
[RAIKA]
What a day.

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,291
It was definitely
a full one, wasn't it?

478
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,500
For real! I had tons of fun!

479
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,791
Hey, at least we were able to
obtain a bunch of good footage.

480
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,833
And we procured
the cup and silverware

481
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,375
that she used earlier.

482
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,041
I guess it worked out okay.

483
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,208
How about that?

484
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,708
She rarely loses heart.

485
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Found him!

486
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,541
I'm not taking this camera
off him for the entire night.

487
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,541
[HODORIGO] Oh, well look at
that, I found you a balloon.

488
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,958
[HODORIGO'S SISTER]
Yay! Gracias, Big Bro!

489
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Who the hell are you?!

490
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,250
[AKARI]
Oh, hey, what's up, Aria?

491
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,291
Today turned out
pretty fun, huh?

492
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,750
And I got in some nice
lounging by the pool time.

493
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,791
Whoa! Where'd all those
peach buns come from?

494
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,916
[ARIA]
Peach buns?

495
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,416
[AKARI]
I did it! I got it!

496
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,958
I got my gun back!

497
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,333
Why's it so...?

498
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,333
[ARIA giggles]

499
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,083
[AKARI]
Aww! That is so not fair!

500
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,208
Yeah, you're right.

501
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,916
But you know, life's not fair.

502
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,208
Which reminds me...

503
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,041
I'm sorry that I was
so mean to you yesterday.

504
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,666
Spending time with you guys...

505
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,041
Well, it was all right.

506
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,708
So how about it?

507
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,416
Should we hang out together
again sometime soon?

508
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,958
You really wanna... hang out?

509
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,125
Tell ya what.

510
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
I'll come visit you
at your place.

511
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,458
[ARIA]
I'm your new roommate.

512
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,875
I'll be staying here a while.

513
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,333
[AKARI] There are bad guys
out there gunning for her.

514
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,208
She needs a place to lay low
until it all blows over.

515
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,791
[ARIA]
Akari! You've gotta shoot!

516
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,958
[ARIA] It should be obvious
I'm not perfect.
