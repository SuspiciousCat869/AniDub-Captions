1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,500
[ARIA] I had a feeling this
might happen someday.

2
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,708
[ARIA] You're the only one who
could back me into a corner.

3
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,416
I just hoped it wouldn't
come down to this.

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,541
Now...

5
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm the only one
who can defeat you.

6
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,458
You did this to yourself.

7
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,916
[AKARI]
Let's go, Aria!

8
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,458
[AKARI] This is the one fight
you won't win!

00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,625
[ARIA gasps]

10

[AKARI gasps]

11
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,250
[ARIA] I only have to
disperse the vibrations

12
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,708
to avoid that attack!

13
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,833
[gunshot]

14
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,750
[AKARI]
What can I say?

15
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,083
I've got a dream.

16
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,791
[AKARI] I wanna be just
like my hero in life, Aria.

17
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,416
--[CLOCK meows]
--[AKARI screams]

18
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,333
Ah! Nonoka!

19
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,916
How could you let me sleep in
like that? I'm so late!

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
[NONOKA]
I tried to wake you up.

21
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,791
But I gave up after you
kicked me in my face.

22
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,708
[AKARI]
Aw... Sorry.

23
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,083
[AKARI]
Oh, that's right.

24
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,041
I was dreaming about having
a crazy fight with Aria.

25
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,625
No wonder it was so vivid.

26
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,250
[AKARI]
My cell...

27
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,791
Have you seen my
cell phone anywhere?

28
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,916
Right here.
And I charged it up for you.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,041
Oh, nice! Thanks!

30
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,750
Jeez.

31
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,375
Put your bulletproof
uniform on right.

32
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,625
Oh hey... do you have your gun?

33
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,125
[AKARI]
Never worry about that.

34
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,500
I would never forget it.

35
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,500
It's the same kind
of gun Aria has.

36
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,958
[AKARI]
I'm heading out, Nonoka!

37
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,458
See ya later!

38
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,291
[NONOKA] Be careful out there!
Watch out for cars, okay?

39
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,000
[AKARI]
I think I can manage that!

40
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,500
[AKARI]
My name is Akari Mamiya.

41
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,208
I'm a freshman in Class A
at Tokyo Butei High.

42
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,583
[AKARI gasps]

43
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,291
[AKARI] Butei are freelance
guardians of the city.

44
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,875
They're given
permission to carry arms

45
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,791
and solve all manner of crimes.

46
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,375
The word "Butei"
means armed detective.

47
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,375
Butei High trains students to
become professional Butei,

48
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,166
so I've got a way
to go before I make it.

49
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,750
[AKARI]
And this is the mega-float

50
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,583
where the school is located.

00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,416
Whew. Barely made it. 

53
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,916
It looks like you've had
a rough morning, Akari.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh. Shino. Raika.
Good morning, guys.

55
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
You wake up late
today or something?

56
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,875
Not exactly the
best day to sleep in.

57
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,291
You've got your promotion test
for your rank, remember?

58
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,375
Oh, yeah.

[DRIVER 1A]
We've gotta stop to let some

00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,666
Looks like there's a chase.

67
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,458
All that noise is the police
chasing after some criminals?

68
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,416
Where's my phone?!

[phones beeping]

70
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,458
[SHINO] It says here that some
creeps robbed a bank.

71
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,833
And now they're on the lam.

72

Whoa, check it out!

[ARIA]
I'm a Butei.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,333
You need to surrender now.

86
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,958
[ARIA] And then I kicked
through the windshield!

87
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,625
[KIRIN] Quite the incredible
feat back there,

88

wasn't it, Riko?

That Aria Kanzaki's pretty
impressive, huh?

[RIKO] Wait, you sound like you
like her, Kirin.

[KIRIN]
Well, she's remarkable, sure,

92
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,041
but she's not quite my type.

93
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,916
Besides, there's already
someone I've got my eye on.

00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,166
All right, I think that's
all I need from you.

Man...

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,833
Pretty cool way to
start the day, huh?

00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,375
Aria is amazing.

Not that I'm surprised.

99
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,375
She is an S-rank Butei
in Assault after all.

100
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,166
Yup! Sure is!

101
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,875
She's an expert in armed
and hand-to-hand combat!

102
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,958
On top of that... she comes
from a British noble family,

103
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,791
and she's been a Butei
since she was 14.

104
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,125
Yeah, yeah, she has an
arrest rate of 99 percent.

00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,791
And everybody calls her
"Aria the Quadra."

You've told us like
a billion times already.

[AKARI]
Y'know what?

I'm gonna ace my promotion test!

109

I'm inspired from
watching Aria work.

110
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,416
And I just know I'm gonna
do the very best I can!

[AKARI screaming]

name again, Akari something?

Here's a thought.

120
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,416
Maybe you're just not
cut out for this school.

Great work, Takachiho!

[YAYA]
Here, let me towel you off!

124
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,416
[AKARI] Hey, so...
Sorry I let you both down.

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
Especially with all
the wonderful support

126
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,375
you guys give me.

127
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,958
The name of that rude
chick who took you down

128
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,833
is Urara Takachiho.

She's just some rich,
stuck up, little brat.

130
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,875
I can't believe she went
ahead and shot you like that.

131
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,791
I mean, she already
had you cornered.

132
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,791
Totally unnecessary.

133
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,291
Oh, it's all right.

134
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,083
She was a stronger
opponent, that's all.

135
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,750
I can't resent her for that.

136
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,416
That's just the way life goes.

137
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,291
[AKARI sniffling]

138
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,541

140
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,500
There's too much wasabi in this!

141
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,125

earful when I get home.

It's nothing to be down about.

We are still in
Year One after all.

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
[SHINO] Yeah, we've
got a long way to go.

146
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,625
I'll keep on
practicing with you.

147
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,625
You'll get there eventually.

148
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,958
[RAIKA]
Sure. Who knows.

149
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
Maybe you'll actually
get good enough someday

150
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,708
to confidently request
an Amica contract with Aria.

151
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,291
[AKARI]
An Amica contract...

152
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,750
Great idea!

153
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,750
I'll go ahead and request
an Amica contract with Aria!

154
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,083
[RAIKA] Whoa, hold on,
you mean right now?

155
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,625
[SHINO]
Wait, what is an Amica contract?

156
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,333
Oh, do you really not know?

157
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,583
It's a two-person cell training
system at our school.

158
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,416
Combine the kanji for war
with the one for siblings

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,791
and it reads Amica.

160
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,125
The program is designed
to give you direct training

161
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,625
from an upperclassman
for an entire year!

162
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,166
They give you
practical guidance,

163
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,750
and you get to actually go work
with them out in the field!

164
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,208
You get to take part in
operations with cool codenames

165
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,750
and everything!

166
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:06,166
Oh! I'm totally shocked I
didn't think of this sooner!

167
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,041
[RAIKA] Uh... there's kind
of a huge disparity in skills

168
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,583
between you and Aria.

169
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,958
Sure, but there's nothing
that says I can't request it!

170
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,541
[RAIKA]
Don't waste your time.

171
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,458
Sorry, but I heard Aria rejected
twenty students in a row

172
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,625
who requested to be her Amica.

173
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,666
[AKARI groans]

174
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,375
Hey, sis.

175
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,958
Still procrastinating?

176
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,250
Yeah.

177
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,250
I'm so torn.

178
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,875
I... I'm just not sure
if I should fill out

179
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,791
this request form.

180
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,666
I mean... maybe Raika
and Shino were right

181
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,500
when they said that
I'm not ready yet.

182
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,708
I don't know.

183
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,250
If you really wanna go after it,
then I think you should.

184
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,958
You mean it?

185
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,583
You've got my support
no matter what happens.

186
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,083
I say you should go for it.

187
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Especially knowing
how much you admire Aria.

188
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,041
Try not to stay up too late.

189
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,791
You'll oversleep again.

190
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,083
[AKARI] She's right, I've gotta
become as strong as Aria.

191
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
[AKARI] It's the only way
to avoid going through

192
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,500
something like that again.

193
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,916
[TAKAMAGAHARA]
Prepare yourself.

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,583
They'll probably call
you in as a witness

195
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,916
about yesterday's incident.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,625
[ARIA] There was something
kind of off about those perps.

197
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,791
Their plan was so sloppy.

198
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,791
[TAKAMAGAHARA]
Oh, one more thing.

199
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,375
Looks like you've got
another Amica request.

200
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,125
[ARIA] Akari Mamiya.
Year 1, Class A. E rank?

201
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,500
Do you know her?

202
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,875
[ARIA]
Nope. Never even heard of her.

203
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,875
Well, if you're wondering about
her marksmanship scores...

204
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,208
Out of 144 students,
she's ranked last.

205
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,083
[TAKAMAGAHARA] You don't
have to test her if you don't

206
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,666
want to. Your call.

207
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,875
[RAIKA]
What?

208
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
You really submitted it?

209
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,166
[AKARI]
Yeah.

210
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,000
[SHINO]
Aria may only be in Year 2,

211
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,083
but she is still
a top-ranked student.

212
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,666
And at E rank,
you're at the very bottom!

213
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,083
They won't even let you talk to
her, let alone be her partner!

214
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,083
[SHINO] I don't mean
to sound like a jerk,

215
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,833
but you have to realize
your aptitude and,

216
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,791
y'know, know your place.

217
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,583
I get that, but... 

218
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,416
[RAIKA] An Amica request from
the student in last place...

219
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,250
She'll probably ignore it.

220
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,875
Take your time.

221
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,875
You're pushing
yourself too hard.

222
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,041
Why don't you let me
help you train?

223
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,250
[AKARI]
They're right.

224
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,333
But Aria... 

225
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,125
[ARIA]
Your friends don't speak for me.

226
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,166
And I think everyone
should be given a fair shot.

227
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,208
[AKARI]
Huh?!

228
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,000
Aria?!

229
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,625
[ARIA]
You should've noticed me.

230
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,500
It's a good thing
I'm not your enemy.

231
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,333
'Cause I'd pump you
full of holes.

232
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,000
Akari Mamiya...

233
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,791
You're invited to fight me.

234
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,958
[ARIA]
Like I said,

235
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,375
I believe that everyone should
be given an equal chance.

236
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,416
Although... 

237
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,625
The results will not be equal.

238
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,041
That's just a simple fact.

239
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah, I understand.

240
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,333
[ARIA]
I'm a very busy person,

241
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,083
so I'll test you
right here and now.

242
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,583
[AKARI]
What?!

243
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,541
[ARIA] If you can defeat me,
you can become my Amica.

244
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,125
Work for you?

245
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:20,833
[AKARI]
But...

246
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,291
But that's impossible!

247
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,958
I mean there's no way that
I can possibly defeat you!

248
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,666
[ARIA] Opportunities
don't wait for you.

249
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,541
The same way that crimes
don't wait for a Butei.

250
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,250
Uh... Akari?

251
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,416
You doing this?

[AKARI yells]

253
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,458
[ARIA]
Now don't go jumping the gun!

254
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,416
I didn't say anything about
hand-to-hand combat.

255
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:51,958
[ARIA]
Hold on...

256
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,458
You've got the same gun as me.

257
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,458
Yeah. I do.

258
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,833
It's just that... I've got
so much respect for you, so...

259
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,250
[ARIA]
Uh...

260
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,458
[ARIA]
All right.

261
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,333
I'm using your gun in the test.

262
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,000
If you want to be my Amica,

263
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,875
you have to get it back
from me within half an hour.

264
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,916
[AKARI]
What?!

265
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,708
Akari...

266
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,291
It's against the rules
for us to help you.

Do your best!

00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,541
I believe in you!

269
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,583
I may not pull this off...
but I'm gonna try!

We've gotta help her!

00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,541
Grab my hand!

It's an Amica test.

An Amica test, huh?

00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,791
I wonder who's she after.

own Amica, don't you, Kin?

This girl is
insanely persistent.

290
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,250
[AKARI]
I will be Aria's Amica.

Send Assault and Snipe in, stat!

00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,250
Huh.

320
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,500
[ARIA] Sounds like the
cops'll take it from here.

321
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's get back to the test.

322
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,000
What?!

323
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,041
Uh...

324
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,666
[ARIA] I'm impressed
you've made it this far.

325
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,833
So I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

326
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,625
Now... come at me.

327
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,958
[AKARI]
Wait... You mean right here?

328
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,500
I can't!

329
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,791
[ARIA] I don't ever wanna hear
you say the words "I can't"

330
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,916
again for the rest of your life.

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,125
[AKARI gasps]

332
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,666
Trust me.

333
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,333
The only thing that phrase does
is hold back your potential.

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,791
[AKARI]
Please, Aria.

335
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,333
I want you to attack me.

336
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,375
[ARIA]
Hm?

337
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,541
You got this!

338
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,166
Oh, no...

339
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,500
[AKARI] You've been running
from me this whole time.

340
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,958
I don't wanna be your Amica if
all you're gonna do is run away.

341
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,000
[ARIA gasps]

342
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,083
[ARIA] There's no taking
back what you said.

343
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,458
So get ready.

344
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,958
[AKARI] I can only pull
this off if I counterattack.

345
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,416
[ARIA gasps]

346
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,583
I did it!

347
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,375
[AKARI yells]

348
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,166
[ARIA]
Akari!

349
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,958
[AKARI screaming]

350
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,458
[RAIKA, SHINO gasp]

351
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,041
[AKARI coughing]

352
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,833
[SHINO] I'm really sorry
it didn't work out.

353
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,166
[RAIKA] There's just too much
of a disparity between you two.

354
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,416
You're right! No kidding!

355
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
[AKARI]
Hey, Aria?

356
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,500
Thanks for giving me a shot.

357
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,125
I really appreciate it.

358
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:47,416
I know I'm not good enough
for you... but this test...

359
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,416
It's only inspired me
to work that much harder!

360
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,625
Well then... Thanks again!

361
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,416
[ARIA]
You passed the test, y'know...

362
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,625
[AKARI]
What?

363
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,375
You did get the gun
back from me at one point.

364
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,000
So I think it's only fair
that we call it a tie.

365
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,583
[ARIA]
Who knows...

366
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,500
If I hadn't been on guard
the whole time...

367
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,333
So I passed?

368
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,625
Seriously?

369
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,625
But you're not officially
my Amica yet, okay?

370
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,958
You'll be in training.

371
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,750
And if you still
want the contract...

372
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,083
In that case...

373
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,625
You'll have to actually
get this gun back from me.

374
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,791
Until you manage that,
you'll be my personal assistant.

375
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,208
Work for you?

376
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,750
Yes! Yes! Yes!

377
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
Of course it does!

378
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,166
Anything to work for you, Aria!

379
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,208
[ARIA]
While you're in training,

380
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,958
you won't be
investigating any crimes

381
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,166
or going after
criminals with me.

382
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,833
That's gotta wait until you
become my official Amica.

383
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,750
Got that?

384
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,583
Yes, ma'am!

385
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,250
I can't wait to get started!

386
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,875
I am so happy for you!

387
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:55,750
Me, too!

388
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,958
Thank you, Raika!

389
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,250
[BOTH laugh]

390
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,833
Um, Shino?

391
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,458
Oh... Sorry.

392
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,916
I'm fine. Congratulations.

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,458
Aw! Thank you!

394
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Is there any place that
you wanna go to celebrate?

395
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,958
[ARIA]
So that's my first Amica, huh?

396
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,333
Not too bad.

397
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,208
But... 

398
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,666
[HINA]
Akari Mamiya, huh?

399
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,125
[ARIA] Yeah, she's a Year 1
student with an E rank.

400
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,291
But I'm concerned
for some reason.

401
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,000
[HINA]
Really?

402
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,875
What has you concerned?

403
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,041
I don't know.

404
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,041
That's why I want you
to check her out.

405
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,041
I'm sure she's just
a nice girl, but still...

406
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
I can't shake the feeling
there's something dangerous

407
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,625
about her.

408
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,416
[HINA]
You can count on me.

409
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,583
I'll report back with
the info when I have it.

410
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,958
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
What took you so long?

411
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,166
Last I checked, you were
supposed to disembark yesterday.

412
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,250
[RIKO] I tried to
fire up some small fries

413
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,541
to attract the attention
of the police.

414
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,333
It worked up to the point of
instigating them to rob a bank

415
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,333
using fake info.

416
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,125
But... I got interrupted.

417
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,125
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
How so?

418
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,625
Oh. There was an
unexpected player,

419
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,291
so I had to
start all over today.

420
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,791
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Oh well.

421
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,166
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
We still have some time left.

422
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,125
[SHINO] Do you know about
the three-day rule?

423
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,583
The cancellation clause?

424
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,125
[AKARI]
What are you doing?

425
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,083
[SHINO] I'll be at your side to
care for you the whole time.

426
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,125
[ARIA] You've gotta handle
these things on your own!

427
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,208
[SHINO]
Now that you've seen this,

428
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,416
I'll deal with you next.

429
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,750
[AKARI]
Nothing's going to stop me!

430
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,666
I will be Aria's Amica!
