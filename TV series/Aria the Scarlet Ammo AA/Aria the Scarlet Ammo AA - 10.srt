You've openly defied the IU.

Refusing to share your coveted

And that's the reason why
we're attacking you like this.

[HINA] Nonoka's condition is

For two years after you're

[HINA] On behalf of the
Fuma clan, I apologize.

198

Fuchou was originally
developed by us.

199
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,833
But a few years back,
Kyochikutou stole the recipe

200
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,500
and began using it for evil.

[KIRIN] There has to

It can be neutralized,

That means the person
who can save your sister

Please don't do it!

We'll come up with a plan!

[AKARI]
Don't follow me!

This is the only move
I have left. I'm going.

213
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,041
[ARIA] A heroine sacrificing
herself makes for a good story,

but it's not a real answer.

important than me.

I overheard almost everything.

IU is coming after
the Mamiyas, too, huh?

221
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,208
I don't know what to do.

222
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,833
They're my enemy, too.

00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,916
I can help.

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,250
But I need you to
be honest with me.

00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,000
Listen, Akari.

226
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,416
Ever since we met,

227
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,208
you've been hiding
your background

228
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,416
and suppressing your
true abilities from us.

229
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,041
And that's why your Butei
rank stays so low.

230
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,250
Isn't it?

231
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,708
Had you been up front with me
and said IU was your enemy,

232
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,583
we could have approached
this differently.

233
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,875
[AKARI] The Mamiya family
techniques are used

234
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,541
for killing people.

235
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,000
I didn't feel
comfortable telling you.

236
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,208
I get it.

237
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,833
Your family history
doesn't exactly square

238
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,416
with your conscience.

239
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,291
But what about honoring
your mother's wishes?

240
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,541
The techniques could be used
not to hurt, but to protect.

I...

242
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,625
I do want that!

243
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,125
That's why I want to be...

244
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,750
...a Butei.

317
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,000
No trace.

318
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,958
Only poisons can act like that.

319
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,041
Some examples:
Arsenic is tasteless, odorless,

320
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,625
and dissolves in water.

321
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,500
One kilogram of botulinum
can wipe out mankind.

322
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,125
And oleander, aka Kyochikutou.

323
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,375
So you see...

324
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,958
Poisons are my very identity,

325
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,375
so I make it my life's work
to know them all.

326
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,083
So... Give me Takamakuri.

327
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,458
I want it.

328
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,666
I want it more than I've
ever wanted anything.

329
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,083
[AKARI gasps]

330
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,291
[AKARI] I'd never give it
to a psycho like you!

331
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,708
You're done!

332
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,708
This hotel is completely
surrounded by my Butei friends!

333
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,958
Oh. Well that's surprising.

334
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,458
[AKARI] We've all taken
classes in basic siege craft!

335
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,416
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Not what I meant.

336
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,208
I'm surprised to see
a bunch of tree frogs

337
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,291
not running from
a poisonous snake.

338
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,875
[KYOCHIKUTOU] This is your
last chance to be smart.

339
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,500
Come and join the IU, Akari.

340
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,791
This is your invitation.

341
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,125
I'll help you master skills
you didn't even know you had.

342
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,166
You'll be so much stronger.

343
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,625
Stronger than Aria Kanzaki.

344
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,125
Nothing you say will ever
make me join you!

345
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,250
The party's started!

346
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,208
[AKARI]
Where are you?

347
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,000
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Did you know that
oleander means "dangerous love"?

348
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,666
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Now come play with me.

349
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:54,666
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
How would you like to die?

350
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,291
[RAIKA] Don't worry,
I'm still right on her tail!

351
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,083
[TAKACHIHO] I'll just have
to shoot them all!

352
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:58,958
[SHINO]
Akari, no!

353
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,083
Wait, what?

354
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,083
[KIRIN]
Hold back!

355
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,708
Butei are never
supposed to kill!

356
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,250
Come on, I'm very eager
to see Takamakuri.

357
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,625
[AKARI]
Kyochikutou...
