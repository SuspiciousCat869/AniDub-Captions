1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,958
[ARIA] Akari, I'm giving you
your first official operation.

2
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,666
[ARIA] You take down the enemy
trying to kill your sister.

3
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,708
I've even come up with
a code name for this.

4
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,500
I was inspired by the first
letter of both our names.

5
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,208
[ARIA]
Operation Double A!

6
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,166
[KYOCHIKUTOU] This is your
last chance to be smart.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,833
Come and join the IU, Akari.

8
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,666
You'll be so much stronger
than Aria Kanzaki.

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,375
Nothing you say will
ever make me join you!

10
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,875
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Did you know that
oleander means "dangerous love"?

11
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,625
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Now come play with me.

12
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,458
Let's see which is
more important to you:

13
00:02:56,541 --> 00:03:00,000
Not surrendering, or saving
your sister from annihilation.

14
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,833
Tonight's gonna go
even better for me

15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,375
than it did two years ago.

16
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,750
You've managed to make
so many fun friends

17
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,958
for me to murder.

18
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,291
[AKARI] Calm down.
There's gotta be an explanation.

19
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,750
Remember what Aria told you.

20
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,916
And three,

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
pay more attention
to your surroundings.

22
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,916
[AKARI gasps]

23
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,291
[AKARI]
Nanowires!

24
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,791
How perceptive.

25
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,208
Of course, you'd have to be
an amateur to overlook them.

26
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,625
Thanks for not disappointing.

27
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,583
[AKARI]
Get back here!

28
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,750
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Let's clear out all the riffraff

29
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,333
standing in our way.

30
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,291
That'll give us the chance to
have a nice, long conversation.

31
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,125
Kyochikutou escaped!

32
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,083
She's heading toward
the north side!

33
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,333
She's using wires
as her foothold!

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
[KIRIN]
Copy that!

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Hina already has
that position covered!

36
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,000
[HINA] Not the easiest
angle to shoot from.

37
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,041
[HINA] Sorry to break it to you,
but I'm your opponent.

38
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,333
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Allow me
to grant your final wish.

39
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,750
Tell me, how would
you like to die?

40
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,083
[HINA] Oh, I plan to die
a peaceful death

41
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,625
on the tatami mat!

42
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,916
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Oh...

43
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,000
[HINA]
Poison gas?

44
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,458
That's just desperate.

45
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,125
My mask blocks poison.

46
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,750
You'll have to do
better than that!

47
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,458
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Did you
really think I'd poison you

48
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,416
with an inhalant?

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,833
That's evidence of an
utter lack of imagination.

50
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,625
I could never enjoy
such a dull exercise.

51
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,833
[HINA]
She tricked me.

52
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,125
You just dove through a cloud
made of poison and acid.

53
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,375
It doesn't melt
organic material.

54
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,291
But it does enter through
the pores of the flesh.

55
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,416
Uh-uh.

56
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,708
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
You've been trained in

57
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,708
poison resistance, huh?

58
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,750
Although... you're too
worn out to keep fighting.

59
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,791
[HINA groans]

60
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,458
[HINA]
Please, don't!

61
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,291
In our clan, exposing
a female ninja's face

62
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,916
is even worse than
exposing her naked body!

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,458
I know. I'm trying
to humiliate you.

64
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,875
Y'see? There now.

65
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,750
I'm looking at your naked face.

66
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,125
[HINA gasps]

67
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,083
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
A bonus relaxant for you.

68
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,333
Sleep tight.

69
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,333
Kyochikutou took down Hina!

70
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,625
Seriously?

71
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,708
Afraid so.

72
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,875
But she managed
to put a tracker on her.

73
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,125
It looks like Kyochikutou's
headed towards the station.

74
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,791
It seems that she's packing
poison gas in her arsenal, too.

75
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,416
We need to minimize the risk
of citizen casualties,

76
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
so lure her to a wide open area.

77
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,166
Good plan.

78
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,375
Let's do this.

79
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,375
[RAIKA] Which direction
is Kyochikutou headed?

80
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,458
[KIRIN]
From your location,

81
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,541
she's currently headed
west-northwest.

82
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,083
Makes sense.

83
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,541
So the plan is to avoid
fighting in crowded areas

84
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,625
and tighten the
encirclement around her?

85
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,666
[KIRIN]
Yep!

86
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,833
Do everything
you can to make sure

87
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,875
that she doesn't escape!

88
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,166
[KIRIN] I'll take this time to
make sure that Hina's all right.

89
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,250
Oh, man.

90
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,375
Kyochikutou's pretty
dangerous, huh?

91
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,583
Miss Urara.
What're your orders?

92
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
I think you would be
best utilized

93
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,583
if you went to backup Kirin.

94
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,791
You want us to what?

95
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
Why order that?

96
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,083
[TAKACHIHO] Because I know
that she could use your help.

97
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,833
And I'll be just fine.

98
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,208
I can handle
Kyochikutou on my own.

99
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,416
Wait, are you sure?

100
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,208
Don't do this!
Please let us come with you!

101
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,500
[TAKACHIHO] You really
don't get it, do you?

102
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,125
I want the credit, and
I don't want to share it

103
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,250
with anyone else.

104
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,916
[YUYU, YAYA]
Yeah, but --

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,083
[TAKACHIHO] Don't forget
what Aria told us.

106
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,375
The group that
Kyochikutou belongs to...

107
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,750
They're an international
crime syndicate.

108
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,833
This task is well
beyond your abilities.

109
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,083
Miss Urara,

110
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,583
are you saying this...

111
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,000
...because you're actually
worried that we might get hurt?

112
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,291
[TAKACHIHO growls]

113
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,583
[TAKACHIHO]
You take that back!

114
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,750
I only care about me!

115
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,791
That is why!

116
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
Be quiet! Honestly...

117
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,208
This is a job for
an A-rank Butei!

118
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,041
You two do as I told you!

119
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,583
[TAKACHIHO]
Kyochikutou changed her route!

120
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,791
She's heading towards
the warehouse district!

121
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,083
Don't worry,
I'm still right on her tail!

122
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,250
[KIRIN]
Copy that!

123
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,375
[RAIKA]
What's her current position?

124
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,583
[KIRIN] 300 meters
directly ahead of you.

125
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,875
It looks like she's hiding
out by the third warehouse.

126
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,458
Copy that.

127
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,666
I'll figure out how to hold her
here until the others arrive.

128
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,166
[RAIKA]
She's not here?

129
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,875
[KYOCHIKUTOU] A scorpion
would never run away

130
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,541
from some measly ants.

131
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,041
[RAIKA]
When did she...?

132
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,958
[KYOCHIKUTOU] You honestly
believed I wouldn't notice

133
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,208
that someone attached
a tracker to me?

134
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,375
[KYOCHIKUTOU] I doubt you
wanna fill that lovely body

135
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,208
of yours with poison.

136
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,625
So why do you show so much skin?

137
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,916
[RAIKA]
Wh-What's happening to me?

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
[RAIKA groans]

139
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
How does it feel?

140
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,625
Don't you just love
that tingling sensation?

141
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,958
[RAIKA groaning]

142
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,416
[KYOCHIKUTOU] You look
so cute when you're angry.

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, have fun.

144
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,625
[RAIKA gasps, groans]

145
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,208
And don't forget
to writhe in pain.

146
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,416
It... It hurts so bad...

147
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,041
[RAIKA groans]

148
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,416
[KIRIN]
Raika?

149
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,166
Raika, are you okay?

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,750
[TAKACHIHO] I figured I might
try running interference.

151
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,083
[KYOCHIKUTOU] Such a beautiful
friendship you have.

152
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,000
So nice, truly,
it warms the heart.

153
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
[TAKACHIHO]
Did you say friendship?

154
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,625
[chuckles]

155
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,500
That is putting it lightly.

156
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,583
Friendship doesn't even
come close to describing

157
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,875
my true feelings!

158
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,291
[TAKACHIHO]
Hold it!

159
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:01,958
[TAKACHIHO]
This is weird.

160
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,708
I don't remember this
area being so large.

Wait, did she...

165
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,958
[laughter continues]

166
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,833
[TAKACHIHO]
Dammit! Her poison gas!

167
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,791
It must be a hallucinogen.

168
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,583
If that's how
she wants to play,

169
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,333
I'll just have
to shoot them all!

170

[thud]

171
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,166
[TAKACHIHO]
I didn't... even move?

172
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,333
Have I just been
lying here this whole time?

173
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,458
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Sounds like you were having

174
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,375
a pretty fun dream there.

175
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,000

[TAKACHIHO]
It's Takachiho.

178
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,500
Are you all right?

179
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,625
[TAKACHIHO]
I... let my guard down.

180
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,291
Just hang in there!
Where are you?

181
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,500
Miss Urara!

182
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
[TAKACHIHO] Akari. I hope
that... you can... hear me.

183
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,500
Kyochikutou...

184
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,708
She's headed towards...
the bridge.

185
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,500
She knows...
about the tracker on her.

186
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,333
Please be careful.

187
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
I got it. Thank you!

188
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,875
We better hurry.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,958
I should have heard about
Kyochikutou's arrest by now.

Akari...

Reki? Is something wrong?

192
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,458
I have a message for you
from Ms. Takamagahara.

193
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,750
You do? Is it urgent?

194
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,333
[ARIA]
Wait, what?

195
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,916
[horns honking]

196
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,791
It looks like they've
shut down the bridge.

197
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,958
There was a massive
pileup earlier.

198
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,125
They've got it closed until
emergency crews can clear it.

199
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,125
For real?

200
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,708
This doesn't feel right to me.

201
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,750
[KIRIN]
I know.

202
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,250
I think Kyochikutou
caused the wreck

203
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,083
to create a place
to fight Akari.

204
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,333
We've succeeded in luring her
into a wide open area,

205
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,916
but she's been crushing all
of us one by one in return.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,375
You'll have to take
her down together.

207
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,625
Akari.

208
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,875
Don't let her get
anywhere close to you.

209
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,541
Her fingernails are poisonous.

210
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,708
[KIRIN]
Lie down, Raika!

211
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,333
You shouldn't be moving yet!

212
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,333
[SHINO] I get the feeling
the police haven't realized

213
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,750
that Kyochikutou
caused the accident.

214
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,833
Looks like it'll take a while

215
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,583
before they get things
under control.

216
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,583
[AKARI]
Right.

217
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,833
We're Butei, and crimes
don't care if we're ready.

218
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,916
[SHINO]
I'll ambush her from below.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,458
Keep her attention
on you until I'm ready

220
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,125
to make the attack, all right?

221
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,291

I'm on it.

[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Show me some gratitude.

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,958
I went to all this work
to create a nice stage

224
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,583
for our final showdown.

225
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000

[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Face it, I'm a deadly poison

00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,125
and you're simply not
good enough to purify me.

229
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
[AKARI] Just gotta keep her
distracted until Shino's ready.

What's with the suitcase?

the country or something?

[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Oh, this?

233

My friends in IU insisted
that I take it with me.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,375
I didn't think
I was strong enough

235

to use it,
but they reassured me,

236
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,250
it's completely recoilless.

I'm glad I brought it
with me after all.

It's rude to make
a point of standing

so far away from me.

No, Shino...

You saved me...

But the...

249
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,291
The bulletproof
uniform wasn't enough.

250
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,291
Please, Akari.

Please don't change.

00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,750
You can never forget
that you're a Butei, okay?

254
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,250
And as Butei,
we don't... we don't kill.

255
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,583
Shino... No...

256
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,166
Shino, no!

257
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,708
Now that's a letdown.

258
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,583
I was looking forward
to making her suffer

259
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,541
with a slow-acting poison.

260
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,666
[AKARI]
Kyochikutou...

261
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,750
And what's this?

262
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,250
Takamakuri.

263
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,166
Oh, right, of course.

264
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,583
Your hands are
poisonous like mine.

265
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,833
I really should've guessed.

266
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,875
How could I have not seen
something so obvious?

267
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm guessing you have it
smeared on your fingers?

268
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,958
Well I suppose you'll show me...
your Mamiya technique.

269
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,708
[YUYU]
Miss Urara...

270
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,125
Here, this will help.

271
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,166
It's a Fuma family antidote.

272
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,375
[KIRIN]
Don't, Akari! Hold back!

273
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,625
Butei are never
supposed to kill!

274
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,833
Please, Akari!

275
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:44,916
Are you listening?!

276
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,708
Don't worry about it.

277
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,083
Have some faith in her.

278
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,416
[KYOCHIKUTOU] I've heard this
technique described before.

"Slipping through
a thousand arrows,

without leaving
a scratch on the body."

00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,041
[KYOCHIKUTOU laughs]

283
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,416
Takamakuri.

284
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,833
A midrange combat
poison technique.

285
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,250
But what kind of poison is it?

286
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,041
[AKARI]
My success rate for Takamakuri

287
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,708
is only one in three.

288
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,208
If I fail, she'll
probably kill me.

289
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,833
But I have to try!

290
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,000
If your fight with
Takachiho had been real,

291
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,375
you wouldn't have made it.

292
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,291
[AKARI]
That's right.

293
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,125
Don't forget who you are
and what you are.

294
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,625
Stay calm.

295
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,041
I'm a Butei, and I'm here
to arrest her for her crimes,

296
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,166
not take revenge.

297
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,208
So why'd you freeze up?

298
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,791
Come on, I'm very eager
to see Takamakuri.

299
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,666
You need incentive?

300
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,666
How 'bout those thousand arrows?

301
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,083
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
Or in this case, bullets!

302
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,291
[AKARI]
There was no lightning.

303
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,458
I failed!

304
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,333
Okay... what was that?

305
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,375
Takamakuri is not
a poison technique.

306
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,208
Human bodies have
hidden oscillations

307
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,875
caused by small
electric currents.

308
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,083
Takamakuri harnesses
those oscillations

309
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,541
to throw at your opponent
when you rotate your body

310
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,083
to create a gyro effect.

311
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,083
[AKARI] The feeling I had
when my mom taught it to me

312
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,583
is coming back.

313
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,333
I won't fail next time.

314
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,583
You think I'm falling for that?

315
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,666
[AKARI]
Don't be hasty.

316
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,083
The right moment will come.

Her gun is jammed!

Always be on guard,
even when asleep.

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,125
She's a lot calmer
than she looks.

321
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,750
[AKARI]
So it was just a trap!

322
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,333
All of Aria's lessons are
keeping me alive right now.

323
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,083
I'm not so sure
if it's actually worth

324
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,833
sticking around here
if Takamakuri

325
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,791
really isn't a poison.

326
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,791
But I kinda wanna finish this.

327
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,708
[AKARI yells]

328
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,583
[KYOCHIKUTOU screams]

329
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,291
[KYOCHIKUTOU]
She wasn't lying.

330
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,833
It's not a poison.

331
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,416
[AKARI]
Is she okay?

332
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,458
She'll be just fine.

333
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
Her wounds are shallow.

334
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,333
It turns out she was
using a weak ammunition.

335
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,750
Her bulletproof uniform
deflected direct hits,

336
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,875
so that's good.

337
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,750
And everybody else
is okay, too.

338
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,875
They're recovering just fine
thanks to Hina's antidotes.

339
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,958
They should be back up and
on their feet in no time at all.

340
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,791
Good. That's a relief.

341
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,208
You'll regret this.

342
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,500
You've got big trouble
headed your way.

343
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,750
I should've known that
you'd be a sore loser.

344
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,458
I'm only stating the facts.

345
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,041
Things would've gone
a lot easier for you

346
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
if you'd just obeyed me.

347
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,333
What was that
supposed to mean?

348
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,750
Oh, she was just
trying to freak us out.

349
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,125
C'mon, let's go see how
Raika and the others are doing.

350
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:38,958
[ARIA]
Akari!

351
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,416
[AKARI, KIRIN gasp]

352
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,625
[AKARI]
Aria!

353
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,875
Why aren't you in the hospital?

354
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,125
[ARIA]
Reki rushed over to give me

355
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,916
urgent information from school.

356
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,708
We still don't have
official confirmation,

357
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,458
but Kyochikutou supposedly
wasn't the only infiltrator

358
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,208
we have to deal with.

359
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,291
It's not over.

360
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,041
There's another IU goon.

361
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,916
[SUIMITSUTOU] I'm not a
big fan of people bullying

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
my little sister.

363
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Little sister?

364
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,375
Yeah, you heard me.

365
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,208
Kyochikutou's my
precious baby sister.

366
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,875
Pleased to meet you.

367
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
[SUIMITSUTOU]
My name's Suimitsutou!

368
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,666
[ARIA]
Our time together?

369
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,833
[ARIA]
Well, it was pretty fun.

370
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,833
[ARIA]
Take care, Akari.

371
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,583
You'll make a great Butei.
