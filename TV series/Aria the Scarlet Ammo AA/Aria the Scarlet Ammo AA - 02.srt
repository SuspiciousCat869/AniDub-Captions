1
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,958
[SHINO]
Oh, Akari...

2
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,041
Hey. The rich girl's back.

3
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,791
And big shock,
she's by herself.

4
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,333
Who really wants to
hang out with someone

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,500
that arrogant?

6
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,958
[SHINO]
So what?

7
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,875
I don't care if I'm all alone.

8
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,250
I don't care.

9
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,333
[AKARI]
Hey, Shino!

10
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,375
[SHINO gasps]

11
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,333
[SHINO]
Akari!

12
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,000
[laughs]

13
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,750
[AKARI]
Oh, Shino!

14
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,916
[SHINO]
Akari!

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,375
[AKARI]
You're the best!

16
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,458
[SHINO]
No, you are!

17
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,500
[BOTH laugh]

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,791
[SHINO]
Why, Akari?

19
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,583
[AKARI]
Over here, Aria!

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,958
I'm so sorry!

21
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,708
I hope you haven't
been waiting too long!

22
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:09,041
I have, Akari.
Five minutes, in fact.

23
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,958
As a Butei, you are
expected to be punctual.

24
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,000
And especially as my Amica.
Don't be late again.

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,125
[AKARI]
Yes, ma'am!

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,583
[AKARI] She's taking
a huge chance on me,

27
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,875
and I've already screwed up.

28
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,583
[ARIA] I've gone ahead
and submitted the report

29
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,208
of our Amica contract
to the school.

30
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,375
But don't forget.

31
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,333
This doesn't mean
I've accepted you yet.

32
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,208
Not until you take this back.

33
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,750
You won't truly be my Amica

34
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,000
until you can
accomplish that task.

35
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,333
Right! I remember!

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,125
[ARIA] If you see an
opportunity, try to take it.

37
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:44,875
[AKARI]
Roger!

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,916
[AKARI]
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,375
Maybe wait for a
more strategic opportunity.

40
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
Let's go.

41
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,166
[AKARI]
Sure!

42
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,916
[AKARI] The Amica program
is part of our training

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to become armed
detectives at Butei High.

44
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,125
Upperclassmen select
the underclassmen

45
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,958
they find most capable
and then mentor them.

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,166
And I've got the honor
of being Aria's Amica!

47
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,708
Well, technically,
I'm still in training.

48
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,708
But still.

49
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,583
I'm walking side
by side with her!

50
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,916
I know that she'll
accept me one day soon.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,708
And then I'll finally be
her official Amica!

52
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,000
[ARIA]
Here we are.

53
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
[AKARI] Whoa! She's got
a VIP room in the dorm!

54
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,666
[ARIA] It only makes sense for
you to have your own room key

55
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,083
as my Amica.

56
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,500
You will be assisting me
very frequently from now on.

57
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,291
[AKARI]
Of course!

58
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,625
And I'll do my best!

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,666
[AKARI]
Gotcha!

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,875
[ARIA]
C'mon in.

61
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:44,916
[AKARI]
Huh?!

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,458
Wow... It's so big!

63
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,750
[ARIA]
Is it?

64
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,125
My room at home is
ten times bigger than this.

65
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,666
[AKARI]
Wait... What?

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,041
Ten times?!

67
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,666
[AKARI sighs]

68
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,791
[ARIA] I'm sure that you've
already heard about this,

69
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,958
but I come from a noble family.

70
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,500
The Holmes family, specifically.

71
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,625
[AKARI]
Hold on... Holmes?

72
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,375
[ARIA]
As in the Sherlock Holmes.

73
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,125
I can assume you've
heard the name.

74
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,958
I am the fourth generation.

75
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,166
[AKARI]
Whoa...

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,958
She's already trusting
me with her secrets.

77
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,250
[ARIA]
Here's your first task.

78
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,208
Contact SSR for me.

79
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,833
Order some silver bullets to
fight against stealth criminals.

80
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,000
[AKARI]
Uh...

81
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,708
[ARIA] Can you assemble
a Yagi antenna?

82
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,500
Marksmanship?
Forensics? Driving?

83
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,083
What're your skills?
There's gotta be something.

84
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,250
[AKARI]
What's that?

85
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,333
[ARIA] It's a paraglider
I use for missions.

86
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,250
I need to improve its
turning functionality.

87
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,375
Here, follow these instructions.

88
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,541
You can stitch it together.

89
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,833
Uh, okay!

90
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,333
[ARIA] Just stick
to those directions

91
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,041
and you won't screw it up.

92
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,333
I've got something
I need to take care of.

93
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,458
I'll be back.

94
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,500
[ARIA] Akari's attack
was clearly based off

95
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,666
a Japanese martial art.

96
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,583
But... It's not karate,
judo, or aikido.

97
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,875
[HINA] The technique she used
was most likely Tobiugachi.

98
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
It's the same
technique ninjas use

99
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,291
to remove an enemy's
eyeball or internal organs.

100
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,416
[stomach growls]

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,875
[ARIA]
Some upfront payment.

102
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,166
Dig further into her past.

103
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,291
[HINA] Ah!
Thank you so much!

104
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,250
[ARIA]
She works for way too cheap.

105
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,291
[HINA] I'll conduct a
comprehensive investigation

106
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,791
into Akari Mamiya's history.

107
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,916
Something bothers me
about her too.

108
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,000
[yelps]

109
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,791
[AKARI]
Talk about sad.

110
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,750
This is the only thing
that I can really do.

111
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,833
[ARIA yawns]

112
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,458
It's later than I thought.

113
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
[ARIA] Has she been
sewing this entire time?

114
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,000
[ARIA]
She finished the whole thing.

115
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,416
I thought it'd take
at least two days.

116
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,500
[AKARI gasps]
Oh, Aria!

117
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,250
The way you sewed this...

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,500
[AKARI]
Oh, yeah, I backstitched it.

119
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,666
I figured it'd be
stronger that way.

120
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,250
Really? Backstitching?

121
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,375
[AKARI] Yeah, you pull the cloth
to the side with each stitch

122
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,833
and then loop back through
the same needle hole.

123
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,708
It's the strongest way to
hand stitch cloth together.

124
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,875
But I... I can redo it
if you don't like it.

125
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,291
No, it's great. Thank you.

126
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,291
It looks like we've uncovered
one of your strengths.

127
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,000
You are a hard worker.

128
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
[AKARI crying]
Thank you, Aria!

129
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,291
[ARIA] Hold on a minute.
What's the matter?

130
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,458
What's wrong?

131
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,541
[AKARI]
Nothing at all!

132
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,875
Everything is so great!

133
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,166
[ARIA]
She really is an odd girl.

134
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,500
Is she like this
in her everyday life?

135
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,208
[AKARI] And then, Aria used
the paraglider I sewed for her

136
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,916
to get the drop on those
criminals this morning!

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,166
Really?

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,875
Sounds like you were
actually helpful, huh?

139
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,125
[AKARI]
Yeah!

140
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,166
I worked all night to
have it ready for her!

141
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,000
And then Aria used it!

142
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,541
[SHINO] It's like she
only cares about Aria.

143
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,916
She came soaring out of the
sky and rescued the victim.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,083
Aria is so amazing.

145
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,250
[AKARI] She already submitted
our Amica contract

146
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,125
to the school.

147
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,375
It's great!

148
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,375
Of course, I'm still
just in training

149
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,250
until I get my
gun back from her.

150
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,958
So what gun are
you packing now?

151
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,291
Oh, well, I've still
got my other gun.

152
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,166
Y'know, the Micro-Uzi.

153
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,625
It's pretty good for
getting the job done.

154
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,833
That's true.

155
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,583
Anyway, sounds like
she's gonna accept you.

156
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,500
Although it'll probably
take a little while.

157
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,041
Yep.

158
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,500
But I promise you it'll happen
no matter how long it takes!

159
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,958
So, are you ready head out now?

160
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,125
Oh, hey!

161
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,625
We can grab some
leaf pies on the way home!

162
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,541
[AKARI]
Oh, sorry, I can't.

163
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,500
Aria's heading out
of town on a mission

164
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,291
so I have to help her prepare.

165
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,166
She needs me to pack
all of her nightgowns

166
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,583
and underwear for her!

167
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,166
And besides, I can't really
eat sweets right now.

168
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,125
Aria told me that I could
stand to lose some weight

169
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,541
when I had a sleepover at
her place the other night.

170
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,750
[SHINO]
She stayed overnight?

171
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,166
[AKARI]
All right!

172
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,041
I'm out, see ya later, guys!

173
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,500
[RAIKA]
Yeah, yeah, sure.

174
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,875
You do your best.

175
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,083
[SHINO gasps]

176
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,333
You okay?

177
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,208
[SHINO]
Uh... I'm fine.

178
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,416
I just got a little dizzy.

179
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,416
[RAIKA] She won't stop going
on and on about Aria, huh?

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,875
I guess she's pretty happy.

181
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,875
Are you ready to get going?

182
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,083
Those leaf pies sounded good.

183
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,916
Oh, no.
I'm kind of tired.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,916
I feel a little sick, actually.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,041
Uh, you need something
from our class?

186
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,375
Uh... No! Never mind!

187
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,791
Good day, Miss Shino.

188
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,041
Welcome home.

189
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,250
[MAID 2B] Please, let me
take your bag for you.

190
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,583
[MAID 2C]
Oh, no, Miss Shino.

191
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,791
Is something wrong?

192
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,750
[MAID 2D] Are you all right?
You seem upset.

193
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,333
--[SHINO] Shut up!
--[door slams]

194
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,875
[SHINO] Aria this, Aria that,
I'm so sick of it!

195
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,000
What is wrong with Akari?
She's supposed to be my friend!

196
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,166
Aria! Aria! Aria!

197
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:47,166
[SHINO] I have to do something
before I lose her to Aria.

198
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,291
Try to calm down, Shino.

199
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,708
Just use the Akari box.

200
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,333
Take it all in!

201
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,625
Akari's essence!

202
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,708
[SHINO]
Oh, Akari!

203
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,708
We'll be friends for eternity!

204
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,500
[AKARI] I mean, we've
become friends now, right?

205
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,500
So we'll always be friends!

206
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,958
[SHINO]
Yeah, of course, we will!

207
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,666
These leaf pies
are delicious, huh?

208
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,625
Here, please, have mine!

209
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,208
Wait...

210
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,208
Come on, this is not the
time to escape from reality!

211
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,750
[SHINO]
Aria H. Kanzaki.

212
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,458
S-Ranked Butei.
Aria the Quadra.

213
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,750
With the London Bureau of Butei
since she was only 14 years old.

214
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,250
She has an impeccable
arrest rate

215
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,500
of apprehending
99 perps in a row.

216
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,791
[SHINO]
She's strong.

217
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,166
It's too dangerous to
eliminate her directly.

218
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,208
[MAID 2A]
Miss Shino.

219
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,750
I brought your dinner for you.

220
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,333
[SHINO] Just leave it
outside the door!

221
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:48,250
[typing]

222
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,666
[SHINO]
Yes! That's it!

223
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,333
This is how I can win
my sweet Akari back!

224
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,333
[laughing]

225
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,375
[gasps]

226
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,666
So Aria...

227
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,916
Do you know how long
you're going to be away?

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,125
[ARIA] I'm not sure yet, but
don't slack off while I'm gone.

229
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,250
You keep working hard
on your own, okay?

230
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,375
Think you can do that?

231
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,208
Yeah!

232
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,833
You can totally count on me!

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,125
[yells]

234
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,125
[AKARI]
Ow!

235
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,083
Make sure you
lock the place up.

236
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,208
Of course.

237
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,333
[groans]

238
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,541
[AKARI]
Well, Aria.

239
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,208
I hope you have a safe trip.

240
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,416
[ARIA]
Hmm...

241
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,708
Is there something wrong?

242
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,916
No, it's nothing.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,958
Let's go.

244
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,625
[ARIA] So what're ya
gonna do while I'm gone?

245
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,833
[AKARI] Shino invited me
to hang out at her house.

246
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,958
[ARIA]
Who's Shino?

247
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,625
[AKARI]
Oh, Shino Sasaki.

248
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,416
Y'know, the girl with dark hair
when I took your test?

249
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,416
[ARIA]
Oh, I think I remember her.

250
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,708
Are you two pretty close?

251
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,791
[AKARI]
Yeah! Really close!

252
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,833
[ARIA]
Huh...

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,583
[ARIA]
I'll see ya later. Work hard.

254
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,666
[AKARI]
Okay!

255
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,250
[SHINO]
Akari!

256
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,083
[AKARI]
Hey, Shino!

257
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,416
[SHINO]
Done with your training?

258
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,666
Ready to head to my place?

259
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,166
[AKARI]
Yep!

260
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,375
I can't believe I've never
been over to your house before.

261
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,250
[AKARI] I didn't know
you lived in a palace!

262
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,208
[SHINO]
She is so cute!

263
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't help it, I've gotta
get some pictures of her!

264
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,625
[MAIDS]
Welcome home, Miss Shino.

265
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,875
My, my. What's this?

266
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,208
Oh, how adorable!

267
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
And unexpected!

268
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,083
[MAID 2D]
What a nice surprise!

269
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,458
[MAIDS] She brought a friend
home for the first time!

270
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,875
Hey, y'know...

271
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,291
You're gonna get tired
carrying that heavy gun around.

272
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,208
We can hold onto it
for you, if you want.

273
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,250
Sure. Good idea.

274
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,250
Here ya go.

275
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,583
[MAID 2B]
It'll be in safe hands.

276
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,791
This is great!

277
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,083
Uh, hey... the leafy part
is edible too, right?

278
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,125
Sure is.

279
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,708
Yeah, they're called
caraway leaves.

280
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,083
They add a more enticing
smell to the meat.

281
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,625
It's similar to parsley.

282
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,750
[SHINO]
Oh!

283
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,000
Try the lemon balm over there.

284
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,458
It has calming and
cardiotonic effects.

285
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,583
Supposedly chewing one
leaf before battle

286
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,750
allows you to exhibit
your full power.

287
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,708
[AKARI]
I'm impressed, Shino.

288
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,541
You really know your stuff.

289
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, c'mon.

290
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,416
I don't know all that much.

291
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,083
[SHINO squeals]

292
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,083
I like her so much!

293
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,625
She's so great!

294
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
[AKARI]
Your garden's huge!

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,083
[SHINO]
That's the fountain,

296
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,125
and there's an herb garden
just over there.

297
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,833
[AKARI]
The size is incredible.

298
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,000
I feel like I could
get lost in here.

299
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,416
[AKARI] It's starting to
get a bit chilly, huh?

300
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,750
[AKARI]
Uh... Hey, Shino.

301
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,791
I think we might've
gotten locked out.

302
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,791
[AKARI]
Uh, Shino?

303
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,125
Akari.

304
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,750
Do you know about
the three-day rule?

305
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,166
The cancellation clause?

306
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,041
It's a stipulation
within the Amica Contract.

307
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,958
If the junior loses a fight
in the first 72 hours,

308
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,500
the rule states
that the contract

309
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,291
then has to be terminated.

310
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,583
All because the mentor
couldn't protect her junior.

311
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,041
And the contract can't
be renewed afterward.

312
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,083
[AKARI] I've never even
heard of that rule.

313
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,416
Our contract was approved by the
school at 8 PM three days ago.

314
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,791
Only fifteen more minutes.

315
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,291
[SHINO]
Understand...

316
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,333
I let you keep your knife so
you're not defenseless.

317
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,375
[AKARI]
Huh?

318
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,291
What are you doing?

319
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,333
[SHINO] I suggest...
that you break up with Aria.

320
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,375
[AKARI gasps]

321
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,333
[SHINO]
A sword won't cut through

322
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,916
your bulletproof uniform,

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,458
although it might
break your bones.

324
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,750
But don't worry... 

325
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,208
I'll be at your side to
care for you the whole time.

326
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,833
[AKARI gasps]
No...!

327
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,958
[SHINO]
You really are quite agile.

328
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,291
Just like a swallow.

329
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,916
[SHINO]
But that doesn't matter.

330
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,125
I can cut a swallow in flight.

331
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,875
[AKARI] Her sword
technique is deadly.

332
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,375
[SHINO] In the
swordsmanship passed down

333
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,750
through the Sasaki family,
we're taught the art of iai-giri

334
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,375
without using the sheath.

335
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,583
The lack of friction provides
for the fastest sword technique,

336
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,250
hence the discarding
of the sheath.

337
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,250
I haven't actually mastered
this technique, but--

338
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,916
[SHINO]
Turning Swallow Cut!

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
[SHINO]
Oh, Akari...

340
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,833
This is all your
own fault, Akari.

341
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,833
[SHOP CLERK 2A]
You lucked out.

342
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,041
You got the last pie.

343
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,333
[AKARI] Can I get
a leaf pie, please?

344
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,875
Ugh, you're sold out?

345
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,708
[SHINO]
Um... Y'know...

346
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,125
I'm not really that hungry.

347
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,125
Are you sure?

348
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,791
That's so nice!

349
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,333
Here, I'll give you half.

350
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,375
Don't you just feel lucky to
eat a fresh leaf pie like this?

351
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,416
It's so good.

352
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,166
[AKARI]
Isn't it?

353
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,125
[SHINO]
Hold on, wait a minute.

354
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,458
Let me pay you for my half.

355
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,958
Oh... I've only got my card.

356
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,250
[AKARI]
Don't worry about it.

357
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,000
You can pay me back later.

358
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,666
[SHINO]
You mean I'll see you again?

359
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,833
[AKARI]
Mm-hmm!

360
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,625
I mean, we've become
friends now, right?

361
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,416
So we'll always be friends!

362
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166
[SHINO] I just accidentally
made my first friend.

363
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,875
[SHINO]
I don't want to lose you.

364
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,250
So I have to do this!

365
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,000
Please, Akari.

366
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,791
Just break up with Aria.

367
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,833
I don't understand.

368
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,500
Why are you doing this?

369
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,416
Nothing's going to stop me!

370
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,125
I will be Aria's Amica!

371
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,791
[AKARI]
Her sword...

372
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,791
If I can just get it
away from her...

373
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,625
I'll use Tobiugachi
to take it!

374
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,916
[SHINO] I know about
your technique.

375
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,208
I watched you use it
when you fought

376
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,375
against Aria the other day.

377
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,666
It's obvious
what you're planning.

378
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,250
To take my sword.

379
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,875
But I've planned ahead.

380
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,083
It's very unlikely you
can use that technique

381
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,375
if your opponent
is out of your reach.

382
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,666
You can only use it
when you are

383
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,333
in close enough
proximity to them.

384
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,541
Samurai would carry a short
and long sword with them.

385
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,708
Up until this point,
I've been using a short sword.

386
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,458
And this is the long sword.

387
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,750
It's commonly called
a "laundry pole."

388
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,583
[AKARI]
Whoa, it's huge!

389
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,500
[SHINO] I won't let Aria
take you away from me.

390
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,625
I won't!

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,750
What?!

392
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,875
She dodged it.

393
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:27,791
[SHINO yells]

394
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,708
[AKARI yells]

395
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,458
[SHINO]
Now you lose.

396
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,625
[ARIA]
Akari!

397
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,291
[ARIA]
If you want to be my Amica...

398
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,791
You've gotta handle
these things on your own.

399
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,083
[SHINO]
You just stay there.

400
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,875
Now that you've seen this,
I'll deal with you next.

401
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,416
[SHINO]
Akari is mine.

402
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,791
She's mine!

403
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,333
[SHINO]
Her bulletproof tie?

404
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
[SHINO screams]

405
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,166
Wait, I don't get it.

406
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,416
Why are you here?

407
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,916
Your friend down there...

408
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,916
She was acting weird
the other day.

409
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,833
But hey, you won.

410
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,833
[SHINO crying]

411
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,166
Akari hates me now!

412
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,166
I'm gonna have to go back
to being all alone again!

413
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,541
Oh, Shino...

414
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,916
Sorry.

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,041
I didn't realize that I
was being so insensitive.

416
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,375
It's okay, Shino.

417
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,875
I don't hate you.

418
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,791
You don't hate me?

419
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,500
Do you really mean that?

420
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,291
Mm-hmm.

421
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,750
So you still like me?

422
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,000
Please say that
you still like me!

423
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,166
[AKARI]
Well, yeah.

424
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,125
[SHINO] Oh, Akari,
I like you so very much!

425
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,208
We'll always be friends,
right, Akari?

426
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,333
Right? Right?

427
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,458
[ARIA] I wonder if
those two are actually

428
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,625
getting along today.

429
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,958
If a friend of mine
tried to pull

430
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,208
some psycho junk
like that on me...

431
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,250
I think I might
cut them loose.

432
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,500
[RAIKA]
What's wrong, Akari?

433
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,041
You look a little down.

434
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,625
[AKARI]
Uh... Yeah...

435
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,666
Yesterday was weird.

436
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,708
[AKARI]
Poor Shino.

437
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,666
I wonder if she's okay.

438
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,833
[SHINO]
Hey, good morning, guys!

439
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,083
[AKARI]
Uh... Hi, Shino.

440
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:33,875
About yester--

441
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,250
Akari!

442
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,458
I did some research
after you went home.

443
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,041
Have you heard anything
about the Amica group?

444
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,375
[AKARI]
No, I don't think so.

445
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,083
It's a cool system
where underclassmen

446
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,500
get to form
their own group.

447
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,875
They receive instructions
from their own mentors,

448
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,125
but the underclassmen
can all train together!

449
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,583
So guess what?

450
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,833
I requested an Amica contract
with Shirayuki Hotogi!

451
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:54,583
[AKARI, RAIKA]
Really?

452
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,750
So, what do you say?

453
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,500
We should totally form
an Amica group!

454
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,791
Huh? Huh?

455
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,833
[AKARI]
Huh?

456
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,083
I mean we are best friends,

457
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,541
so it only
makes sense, right?

458
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,916
I suppose it does.

459
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,166
We are friends, I mean,
you said you still liked me,

460
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,000
which means that we're still
the best of friends, right?

461
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,166
[AKARI]
Well, I mean yeah, but...

462
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,291
[RAIKA]
Uh, hey, come on.

463
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,833
Can you at least pretend
to be normal?

464
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,916
[ARIA]
Huh?

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,750
They're still friends? 
Seriously?

466
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,625
[ARIA] She is a very,
very strange girl.

467
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,875
[KIRIN]
My one, true love!

468
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,000
[RAIKA] If I was a
girly girl like her,

469
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,583
no one would ever
make fun of me.

470
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:03,291
[KIRIN] If I win, you promise
that you'll make me your Amica.

471
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,208
[RAIKA]
Fine, but if I win,

472
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,166
you stop following me around!
