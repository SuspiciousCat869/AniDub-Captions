163
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,250
and told the authorities
how to make the antidote

for her poison.

Your sister will
make a full recovery.

Oh, thank god.

And it's all because
of you, Aria.

I can't thank you enough!

Don't doubt yourself.

You're gonna do fine without me.

Without you?

[ARIA]
Listen, Akari.

174
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,541
This was our
first case together,

175

and it was also our last.

176
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,291
You're gonna have
to find someone else

[AKARI]
But why?

179
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,291
Did you decide
I'm too weak after all?

180
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,416
Or are you upset because I
was keeping a secret from you?

No, that's not it.

I totally understand that.

It's just that...

I already told you the
two of us are too different.

[ARIA] Y'know, I prefer
to fight on my own.

But you're the type who likes
to work with her friends.

And at this point, I don't
think you'll learn from me.

188

[AKARI]
B-But...

189
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,666
I can learn that much
more from you

190
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,333

191

[ARIA]
Regardless... 

192
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,666
I already told you
the other day.

193
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,041
I have a lot of enemies.

194

If you're with me,
there's a good chance

your life will be

You have to
trust me on this.

I'm doing this
for your own good.

I know you can find someone
who's better for you than I am.

Someone with a solid reputation

[ARIA] I don't wanna
repeat this again.

Your life will be in danger

And from now on,

I won't cower from

Hmph! You're gonna defeat me?

Yeah.

Will you finally
give up for good?

We'll do the same
test from before.

Get the gun back and you win.

[ARIA]
But this time...

238
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,416
You're gonna have to do
more than chase me.

239

You're gonna have
to actually fight me.

Here's my seventh
piece of advice for you.

251
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,291
When you're in a fight, use
every last trick you've got.

252
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,666
It's just rude to hold back.

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,708
Right!

00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,791
[ARIA] Y'know,
to tell you the truth...

255
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,500
[ARIA] I had a feeling this
might happen someday.

256
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,166
You're the only one who
could back me into a corner.

257
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,250
I just hoped it wouldn't
come down to this...

258
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,458
I have to defeat you.

259
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,166
But you know, you asked for it.

260
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,500
Let's go, Aria!

261
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,250
This is one fight
you won't win!

262
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,750
[ARIA] I only have to
disperse the vibrations

263
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,958
to avoid that attack!

264
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,625
[AKARI] But if there's nothing
to disperse the vibrations,

265
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,708
you won't be able
to use that trick!

[ARIA] Another way
to stop that technique

is to prevent you
from doing your spinning.

And by the way...

274
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,041
Even though you
got the gun back,

275
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,333
you were still defeated.

You're not very thorough.

It looks like you've still
got plenty to learn after all.

00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,208
I've already made reservations
at a chic restaurant.

321
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,916
[SHINO] Jeez, who do you
think you are?

322
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,291
Akari already has plans with me!

323
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,458
[TAKACHIHO]
Yuyu, Yaya.

324
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,583
Restrain her please.

325
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,000
[YUYU, YAYA]
Yes, Miss Urara!

326
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,875
[TAKACHIHO laughing]

327
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,125
[SHINO]
Unhand me right now!

328
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,500
Don't make me use my sword!

329
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,250
[AKARI] Uh, sorry,
I hate to tell you this, guys.

330
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,333
But actually... I've got
plans to help Aria today.

331
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,250
[SHINO, TAKACHIHO]
What?

332
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,125
I'll see you both tomorrow!

333
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,708
This is starting
to get a little old.

334
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,500
It always seems to
go down like this, huh?

335
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,000
Excuse me... Miss Urara?

336
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,666
What about the reservation?

337
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,083
Do you want us
to cancel it for you?

338
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,000
It's so hard to get
a table at this place.

339
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,166
Do you wanna join me?

340
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,791
[SHINO]
I suppose I could.

341
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,833
It's not like I have
any other plans.

342
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,791
Would you like to work
on a scheme with me?

343
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,625
I am more than positive
we could drive a wedge

344
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,958
between Aria and Akari,
Takachiho.

345
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,250
I like the way you think.

346
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,708
We shall discuss it thoroughly.

347
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,291
I've got the feeling there's
more trouble on the way.

348
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,958
Well, you know how that
sounds to my ears.

349
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,166
Won... der... ful!

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,250
[RIKO]
That was totally awesome, Aria!

351
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,416
You took down both sisters,
and the hijackers.

352
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,833
Consider me impressed.

353
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,875
You never told me who
the bus hijackers were.

354
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,333
Well, they struck
a plea bargain.

355
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
So I can't talk about the perps.

356
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,291
You're so funny!

357
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,375
What's that mean?

358
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,333
Did she tell you
about them or something?

359
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,791
Is that it?

360
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,250
[RIKO]
Yeah, right.

361
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,500
Aria's too cold
to tell me anything.

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,041
More importantly,
I can tell you this much--

363
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,083
Suimitsutou took a plea deal.

364
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,541
And Ms. Takamagahara...
She complimented you.

365
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,833
Aw, cool. That was sweet.

366
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,333
Remember...

367
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,333
Catching a perp is rarely
the end for a Butei. Trust me.

368
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,833
All it does is increase
the level of danger.

369
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,500
Keep your wits about you.

370
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,666
You got it!

371
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,708
Huh...

372
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,291
Long time no see.

373
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,041
You're being nice
to Shino, right?

374
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,666
Yeah! Of course!

375
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,916
She's the best!

376
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,208
[AKARI]
Stupid Kinji.

377
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Stupid Aria.

378
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,625
So are you guys
back together?

379
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,541
We were never
even really apart!

380
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,375
And we're on our way to a
special assignment right now!

381
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,125
There are still a few
criminals from the mission

382
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,875
the other day left on the loose.

383
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,416
We've got a tip on their
current whereabouts.

384
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
I see. Well, be careful.

385
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,416
[AKARI] Nobody asked you
to worry about us.

386
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,083
What's your problem?

387
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,666
We'll be fine,
but thanks for that.

388
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,583
[KINJI]
Huh?

389
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,375
Alrighty, then...
see you around.

390
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,875
[AKARI] C'mon, we're
wasting time, let's go!

391
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,666
Is there something wrong?

392
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,208
Wow.

393
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,333
Was it just me or was there
something different about Aria?

394
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,375
[HINA]
It wasn't just you.

395
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,208
Everything is
constantly changing,

396
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,250
allowing new paths to open.

397
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,916
That is the way of the Butei.

398
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,791
[ARIA]
We'll go around the back.

399
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,083
[AKARI]
Right.

400
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,125
[BOTH scream]

401
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,708
What is wrong with you?!

402
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,541
I'm so sorry!

403
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,625
[ARIA] That's it, you are
going back to being a trainee!

404
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,625
[AKARI]
No!
