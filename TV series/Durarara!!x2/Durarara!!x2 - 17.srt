00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,877
We said bye and then‐‐

317
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,087
‐ Hey, Anri.

318
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,755
‐ Yes, what?

319
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,008
‐ I know there are things
you don't want to tell me,

320
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,468
and it's okay if you don't.

321
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,347
I doubt I know how to fix
whatever's bugging you,

322
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,933
but no matter what that is
or what you're hiding,

323
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,353
I know I can work things out
so there's a spot for you.

324
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,438
‐ Uh.

325
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,231
‐ You'll see.

326
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,943
I'll fix everything so Masaomi
can come back here too.

327
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,779
All our friends will have
a place here.

328
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,282
Don't worry about a thing, Anri.

329
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,911
‐ He always said Masaomi would
come back to the city someday,

330
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,247
and now he says
he'll fix it so he can.

331
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,458
It's such a weird thing
for him to say.

332
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,918
‐ I think I get it.

333
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,128
Instead of trusting
his friend will come back,

334
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,881
he's putting his faith in his
own power to make it happen.

335
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,051
‐ You're right, that doesn't
sound like Mikado.

336
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,844
‐ Hm.

337
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,639
No.

338
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,558
‐ What really went down
at that factory?

339
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,477
It was right after that night

340
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,938
the kid showed up
out of the blue.

341
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,606
‐ It's about time...

342
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:07,193
‐ He certainly didn't act
like he wanted to be friends.

343
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,819
How did you get this address?

344
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,655
‐ Hey, it's okay.
Don't worry.

345
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,657
As long as we're cool,
I won't tell the cops

346
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,242
where you guys live.

347
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,161
I did tell my friends I was
coming here tonight though.

348
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,038
So if I do happen to disappear,

349
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,749
the cops would
definitely show up.

350
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,502
Or maybe a fire will break out.
Who knows?

351
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,672
‐ Huh, you sound like
Izaya Orihara.

352

‐ [gasps]

I never thought I'd
be compared to that asshole.

354
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,179
‐ Huh, so you do know
Izaya after all.

355
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,765
You guys are totally cut
from the same cloth.

356
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,060
I'd bet you're just like him,
never happy unless you have

357
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,104
the world in the palm
of your hand.

358

greedy little boys.

359

You know what I want
in my hand?

360
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,696
Celty's, and I'll do anything
to keep her safe.

361
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,239
‐ Stop it, Shinra.

362
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,659
It would be stupid to kill him
over a few vague threats.

363
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,369
‐ Celty.

364

‐ No reason to get ahead
of ourselves, Doc.

365
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,584
For now, all I want from you
is one email addy.

366
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,169
Give me that,
and I'll leave you alone.

367
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,672
‐ We gave him
that email address,

368
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,382
but we haven't heard
from him since,

369
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,844
and that's got me worried.

370
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,972
Do you know who Mikado
associates with at school?

371
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,432
‐ Huh?

372
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,560
‐ Have you noticed him being
extra chummy with anyone?

373
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,271
‐ Let's see,
he's been hanging out a lot

374
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,064
with a younger boy called Aoba.

375
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,275
They're in the same committee
at school.

376
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,613
Thank you for talking to me.

377
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,072
I really appreciate it.

but it's gotten pretty late.

If you want,
you can spend the night.

but I couldn't impose on you

381
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,913

00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,096
It definitely helped
calm me down.

387
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,600
And then I thought
if he really did change,

388
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,437
what could I do to help get him
back to the way he was?

389
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,314
‐ Hey, Saki.

390
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,274
‐ You're going
to Ikebukuro, huh?

391
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,276
‐ Are you psychic?

392
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,736
I gave myself a headache

393
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,863
thinking about
how to break it to you.

394

reading all those chat logs.

One of them had a rumor
about there being Blue Squares

397
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,623
in the Dollars.

398
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,958
I'm worried they're planning
on taking over the Dollars,

399
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,378

tried.

I can't ignore that.

to get involved?

402
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,635
Is it for a friend?

403

‐ Yeah, that's part of it.

404
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,807
There's also a score
I have to settle.

405
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,435

to tell you not to go,

406
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,687
but it's dangerous,

keep that stuff to herself.

I'm the one
who has to sit here, waiting.

‐ For you to crack
those stupid jokes and laugh

00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,455
and be a dork,
like you used to.

‐ Huh?

I have to go back there,

'cause there's a whole bunch
of people I want you to meet.

They're my friends, and I want

to change.
