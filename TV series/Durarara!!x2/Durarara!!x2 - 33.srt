I'd get it, if somethin' like
the World Cup was goin' on,

307
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,344
but that ain't
what's goin' on.

308
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,377
Hey, wait.
Take a look around us.

309
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:50,844
You see how everyone's walkin'?
Like they're in herd?

310
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:54,377
It's like they're goin'
towards somethin'.

311
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:55,977
Hang on, bruh!

312
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,711
We're gonna break
into one of these buildings

313
00:15:57,844 --> 00:15:59,277
and get some perspective.

314
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,844
[Masaomi]
We'll get a good view
from up there.

315
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,811
It's the easiest
to get in, too.

316
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,944
Jeez, kid!
Break and enter much?

317
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:09,577
Yeah, well, back when we were
taking on the Blue Squares,

318
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,877
we did way worse.

319
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,744
Ha! Spoken like
a true criminal!

320
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:14,311
I don't know if I should

321
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,477
be hangin' around with
shady characters like you.

322
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,211
Then, let's hope
we don't get arrested
for breaking in.

323
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,877
That'd suck balls.

324
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:30,044
[chuckling]

325
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,477
We'll drop you girls
someplace safe before goin' in.

326
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:36,277
You can't! I'm going with you.
Please, you have to let me.

327
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,477
I don't think you know
how dangerous this is.

328
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,044
That doesn't matter.

329
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:42,777
When I needed
someone to talk to,

330
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,677
Erika was always
there for me.

331
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,477
Holy shit, you got red eyes!

332
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:50,044
I think whoever the new
Slasher in the city is,

333
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,711
has something to do with me.

334
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,177
I know it.

335
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,977
I might be the only one
who can stop this.

336
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,544
[Masaomi]
The buildings are
blockin' the view.

337
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:04,177
There's a ton of people in front
of Russia Sushi, though.

338
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,477
Everyone down there's movin'
kinda funky, don't you think?

339
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,911
Like they're all robots,
walkin' around in circles
and shit.

340
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:14,077
I know. What the hell's
goin' on down there?

341
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:20,977
Look! Those dudes in the masks
are Blue Squares.

342
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,877
[Takashi]
Leave them alone
for now, Haruna.

343
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,777
Just make sure you've got
everyone in the area
under control.

344
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,844
I'll let you know
when they can strike.

345
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,844
The last thing we want
is to give the guys
in the sushi place

346
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,411
a window for escape.

347
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:36,877
Yes, Mother.

348
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,944
Mikado Ryugamine...

349
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,877
You'd think
I'd remember a kid

350
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,477
with a fancy-schmancy name
like that, but I don't.

351
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:47,844
Who knew a nobody like him
was the boss of the Dollars?

352
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:50,144
God, the kids these days...

353
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,477
Talk about
a lack of education!

354
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:54,677
Am I right, Shijima?

355
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,711
Well, I can't tell
which one's Mikado, can you?

356
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,177
If he were a chick, I'd know,
'cause that's my special power.

357
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:03,044
A couple of those guys
are his size,

358
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:06,477
but with those damn masks,
I can't tell either.

359
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:09,111
Smart kiddoes.
They use those dorky masks

360
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,277
to keep people
from figurin' out
who their boss is.

361
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:14,577
I know they didn't walk here
'cause they got a car they use.

362
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:17,077
It's gotta be parked
somewhere nearby.

363
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:20,211
[grunts]
Damn expressway's
blockin' my view.

364
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:23,277
The toll on that shit's
insane, yo. [grunts]

365
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:25,211
It looks like
the weirdo crowd's

366
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:27,877
ignoring your pals
in the masks... for now.

367
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:31,977
Well, it's almost time
for me to meet the man,
so I'll be takin' off.

368
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,677
Keep chillin' out up here.
Hey, wait!

369
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,677
What's the point in coming
if I stay here?

370
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,611
What do you mean "what"?
You're the ace
up my sleeve, man.

371
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,344
Anyway, check this out:
I'm gonna go down there
and rip their masks off.

372
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:45,677
If you see one of 'em
is your buddy, come on down.

373
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:48,644
If he's not one of 'em,
I'll make 'em
tell me where he is

374
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,944
and I'll give you a call.

375
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,877
Sound good?
One more thing!

376
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,944
Yeah, what?
I just...

377
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:55,677
I wanna thank you
for everything.

378
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:57,444
Aw, come on, dude,
don't even!

379
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,711
If you thank me now,
I could end up dead.

380
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:01,411
Don't you watch any movies?

381
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,944
And, besides,
you might not wanna thank me

382
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,677
after all this plays out.

383
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,411
What?
I'm just sayin'
I might flip out

384
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,277
and end up beatin' the shit
outta your friend, is all.

00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,177
Oh. Hello, there.

399
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:53,777
I'm sorry if I scared you,
but I won't hurt you.

400
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,977
You're Shinra,
the doctor, right?

401
00:19:57,111 --> 00:20:00,744
I am, but I don't think
we've met before, have we?

402
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,244
I do a lot of house-calls,

403
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:04,777
so maybe I saw you
as a patient once?

404
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,344
We'll figure it out later.

405
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,977
By the way,
do you know Izaya Orihara?

406
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:12,977
Hmm? Yes. He happens
to be a friend of mine.

407
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,611
I guess it must've
been a shock then,

408
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,477
when you found out
he got stabbed, huh?

409
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:20,544
No, not really.
He sort of deserved it,

410
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,944
if you want to know
the truth.

411
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,777
I know that's
not nice to say.

412
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:27,611
No. You're hurt.
Can I help you with anything?

413
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:29,877
Well, actually...

414
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,711
I hate to bother you,

415
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,044
but would you lend me
your phone,

416
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:34,577
so I can make a call?

417
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,044
I have to be somewhere,

418
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,677
and I just want
to let them know--

419
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:41,744
I got ya!
Thanks.

420
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:43,877
You should be out
having fun at this hour,

421
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,044
instead of helping strangers.

422
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:49,477
But if you can wait
till I call my step-mom or dad--

423
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:52,077
On second thought, not dad.

424
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,611
[Manami]
So, um...

425
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:57,477
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

426
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,411
It's about Izaya Orihara.

427
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:02,011
Do you know what he hates
more than anything else?

428
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,677
It's a weird question,
but I need to know.

429
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:08,277
What for?
I want to make him
suffer, horribly.

430
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,877
Is it because
he did something to you,

431
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,877
like break your heart
or something?

432
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,911
Not even.
Let me see...

433
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:19,311
What does he hate
the most? Hmm.

434
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,344
I guess what people do
never really bothers Izaya much.

435
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,911
So, hurting him
through his relationships,

436
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:29,077
like getting someone
to screw him over, won't work.

437
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,144
He doesn't mind that stuff.

438
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:35,477
He's not like that because
he's emotionally strong,
or anything.

439
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,877
It's the opposite.
Huh?

440
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:41,711
The truth is, he's more human
than anyone I know.

441
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,477
His heart's so fragile.

442
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,211
Accepting humanity,
warts and all,

443
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:49,311
is his way of protecting
himself, emotionally.

444
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,744
You follow?

445
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,444
He's kind of like a wind-sock.

446
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,811
Just a long, empty tube.

447
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:59,077
So, there's no limit
to how much he can take in.

448
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,511
I think what he'd hate most

449
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:03,277
are the things
that cause him pain.

450
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:06,877
Like if he got a bad cut,
or had his heart broken.
