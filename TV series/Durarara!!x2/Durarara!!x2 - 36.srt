Silence, human! Be gone!

161
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:08,099
I've had quite enough
of your prattling.

162
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,333
[yelps, muffled yelling]

163
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:13,133
Go! Go! Go on, Shooter!
[whinnying]

164
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,933
Go!
[neighs]

165
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,433
[footsteps departing]

166
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,199
Wait, Celty!
Please come back!

167
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,733
Don't go! You can't go!
Don't leave us!

168
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:23,833
[whinnying]

169
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,999
Hey!
Shizuo?

170
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,833
The hell was that?
Wait, was that Celty?

171
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,933
It was, indeed! Good timing!

172
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,599
Yeah. I saw you come up here,
so I followed you.

173
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,733
What the hell's
goin' on around here?

174
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:42,633
This and that. Anyway,
you're going to help me
be the bad guy now.

175
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,333
Say what?
Remember that promise
you made me,

176
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:47,033
back in high school?
Hm?

177
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,333
I have to do something
incredibly cruel to Celty.

178
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,799
She's the kindest
person I know,

179
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,533
so I'm pretty sure she'll
forgive me for doing it.

180
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,366
Well?

181
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,833
I'm ready. Come on,
kick my ass into orbit!

182
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:08,933
Here goes! Better not
hate me for doing this!
[screaming]

183
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,833
Oh, Shooter,
don't be so grumpy.

184
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,233
It had to end this way.

185
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:17,266
I have all
of my memories back now.

186
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,766
If I stayed here
and lived with these people,

187
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,633
I'd only cause them
even more suffering
and heartache.

188
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,933
[neighs]
Yes, Shooter.

189
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,766
It hurts, a lot.

190
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,066
I want Shinra to forget me,
but I don't want to forget him.

191
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,833
Hey!
Huh?

192
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:39,833
What the--? [stammering]
What are you doing up here?

193
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,233
[whinnying]

194
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,199
Grab on!
Celty... Sorry!

195
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,566
[gasps]
No!

196
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,899
[whinnying]

197
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,666
Shinra...

198
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,499
[echoing]
Shinra!

199
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,999
Shinra! Come on, wake up!

200
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,899
Don't die!

201
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,499
Take it easy, Celty.

202
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:32,599
I'm an injured man, remember?

203
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,866
You dumb, stupid idiot!
Ow!

204
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,233
You're the dumbest,
stupidest idiot in the world!
OW! Stop! Okay!

205
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,799
That hurts, Celty!

206
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:42,366
What are you thinking?
You could've died!

207
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,266
Why are you such an idiot?
You could've died!

208
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:50,899
Sorry for being
selfish again.

209
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:53,999
I got in the way
of your Dullahan-ing duties.

210
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,599
But, if I didn't risk my life,
it wouldn't be fair, would it?

211
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,433
Like I said,
you're an idiot.

212
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,344
[Mikado] I guess...
maybe I wanted people
to hate me.

213
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:13,544
If everyone
thought I was evil,

214
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:16,610
I guess I figured someone
would have to come stop me.

215
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:20,244
[Mikado]
The three of us
had changed so much.

216
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,710
[Anri] We promised,
when we were together again,

217
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,710
we'd tell each other
our secrets.

218
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,310
[Mikado]
Yeah, we did.

219
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:29,177
[Masaomi] Okay, hold it!
When'd you guys do that?

220
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,410
Why am I always the last
to hear about these things?

221
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,910
Whatever!
So, who wants to go first?

222
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:37,244
Are you kidding? You!

223
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:38,977
Anri's secret's for dessert!

224
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,944
If we do this,
we're doin' it right!

225
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,777
[chuckles]
We changed a lot.

226
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,010
[car horn honking]
[gasps]

227
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:48,910
[laughing]
[Mikado]
Mr. Nasujima?

228
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,910
[gasps, grunts]

229
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,010
[groans]

230
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:54,710
[both gasp]

231
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,910
You! You ruined everything!

232
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:01,144
[grunting repeatedly]

233
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:03,577
[Masaomi]
Mikado!
[Anri screaming]

234
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,410
With that,
the night was over.

235
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:12,677
But even after the sun came up,
shadows covered the city.

236
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,710
The news said it was some
kind of natural phenomenon

237
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,544
caused by a freak sandstorm.

238
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:20,310
So, how come y'all got stuck
in this goop, but not me?

239
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,110
Didn't think shit
would end like this.

240
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,444
Oh, yeah? I didn't think
my fight with you

241
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,477
would end with me
stuck to a goddamn pole.

242
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,410
[phone ringing]

243
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:41,110
By afternoon, the shadows
started to go away.

244
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:47,010
[groaning]

245
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:52,810
[Kine]
Leave it. Don't want
to bleed out, do ya?

246
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,577
Mr. Kine?

247
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,510
It's 50/50 you survive,
so don't get your hopes up.

248
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,944
[chuckles]
You might want to thank

249
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:02,177
the lady in the back
before you croak.

250
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,710
I mean, she did help
carry your ass to the car.

251
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,710
Don't get the wrong idea.

252
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,144
I wasn't trying to save you.

253
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:11,410
I just wanted to be around
when you died.

254
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,277
If I was smart, I would've
dumped you in the lobby
of the nearest ER.

255
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,244
But I bet you'd rather see
my underground doc, right?

256
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,410
Yeah. Just so long
as he's not in the city.

257
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:25,010
I want to get as far
away from here as I can.

258
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:28,310
If I'm to die,
the last thing I want

259
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:32,210
is that monster
hanging around my deathbed.

260
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,344
[woman]
The retrieval unit
has the head,

261
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,777
and they're on their way
to main office in Chicago.

262
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,410
They're being extra careful.
Once they deliver it,

263
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:42,244
it'll be filed away
as a special human specimen.

264
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,844
Thanks for
the update, pumpkin!

265
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,410
Well, Namie,
got any plans for the future?

266
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:49,110
What do you mean?
What future?

267
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,177
Your obsession
with that head is an asset.

268
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,110
An asset that could take you
far at a place like Nebula!

269
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,210
What is this? Are you
trying to recruit me now?

270
00:15:57,344 --> 00:16:00,477
Yeah, that should
be pretty obvious.

271
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,844
If you can't tell a job offer
when you hear one, then,

272
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,610
you know, maybe you
should have your head
examined for a change!

273
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,510
[choking]

274
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:11,510
Crushing...
Adam's... apple...
with... thumbs!

275
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:14,244
[Mikado]
Now that the chaos was over,
everyone was busy,

276
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:16,410
searching for closure.

277
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,144
Are you sure you want
to come with me?

278
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,310
Yup! Wherever you go, I go!
That's how it is!

279
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:25,510
Right. But why'd you
tell me they were taking
the head to Chicago?

280
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,844
You could've just
kept quiet about it,

281
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,510
gone there and destroyed it,
or whatever you want
to do with it.

282
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:34,144
I know, but I'd rather
go there with you, Seiji!

283
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:37,110
I'm still in love
with that head, you know.

284
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:39,577
I'm not in love with you.

285
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,144
But, if it's okay,
I can love you
like you were family.

286
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,010
[laughing]
Die!

287
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:58,677
[horn honking repeatedly]

288
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,244
Oh, gosh. Ms. Kujiragi?

289
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,344
My apologies, in advance,
for what I'm about to say.

290
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:10,010
I happen to be
quite jealous of you.
Huh?

291
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,077
I've also decided to steal
an opportunity from you.

292
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,310
The chance to atone
for your sins as Hollywood,
the serial killer.

293
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:21,210
This is both
my crime against you
and my punishment for you.

294
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,710
But I have to turn myself in.

295
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,377
You'd be wasting your time.

296
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,810
I assure you,
I have my claws deep within

297
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,110
both the police department
and the media.

298
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,410
Please wait a minute!
Who are you?

299
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:44,644
What would you call
someone who is extremely
jealous of you?

300
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,944
A villain, perhaps?

301
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,110
I almost forgot! You hear
about how they arrested
Ruri Hijiribe's stalker?

302
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,610
Yeah. His name's
Kisuke Adabashi.

303
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,244
He tried to hit her
with a truck,

304
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:03,910
but a fan of hers
was passin' by

305
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,010
and beat him half to death.

306
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:06,277
Then, dumped his ass

307
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,144
in front
of the police station!

308
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,110
I would've tied
his balls to my fender

309
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,810
and dragged him to death!
[both laughing]

310
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:15,510
Well, at least things are
back to normal around here.

311
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,077
See you tomorrow!

312
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,577
Details of return home
are complicated.

313
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,177
I have issues with Father.
I must rectify them on own.

314
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,110
I won't bug you
about it, but...

315
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,410
seein' as how
you're my trainee,

316
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:37,377
if you ever need
to talk, hit me up.

317
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,477
If ever possibility arise
to return to city again,

318
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,077
I challenge you to duel.

319
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,010
But a duel of word
and promise I will speak to you

320
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:47,577
within inch of life!

321
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,477
After duel,
I wish to experience

322
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,777
joy of living
in this place again,

323
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,910
if would be so kind.

324
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:55,277
Sure.

325
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,577
[whinnying]

326
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,344
So, uh, Celty,

327
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:04,177
you still have all
your head's memories, right?

328
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,644
'Cause this time,
you weren't asleep
when it got cut off--

329
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,477
[screams]
[whinnying]

330
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,810
It doesn't matter
anymore, does it?

331
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,277
Hm?

332
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,477
I'm going to be
with you forever.

333
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,444
Aw... Celty!

334
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,877
Would you stop!
Don't do that out here!

335
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,610
People will see us and--
[man] Yo.

336
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,877
I don't care
if the whole world sees us!
You know that!

337
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,877
Well, well.
The monster's got a boyfriend!

338
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,544
Sexin' it up
in a "no stopping" zone

339
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,677
just earned you
a big, fat ticket.

340
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,110
Huh? What's going on?
Is something wrong?
[sirens blaring]

341
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,777
Hang on. Don't die.

342
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,077
Huh? [screaming]

343
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,410
Oh, my God!
Slow down, Celty!

344
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,977
[Mikado] Okay...
I guess now, I'll tell you
what happened to me.

345
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,477
[groaning]
[panting]

346
00:19:58,644 --> 00:19:59,977
[screaming]

347
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,844
Uh-uh. I won't
let you have Takashi.

348
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,677
H-Haruna?
[laughing]

349
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,277
But I thought you
were under my control.

350
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,777
Of course! I know you like it
when I'm all submissive!

351
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,344
[gasps, whimpering]

352
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:18,377
Wait, Takashi!

353
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,210
Mm? [gasps]

354
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,910
Look! It's him! The boss
of the red-eyed zombies!

355
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,177
He said he was
gonna hurt Mikarun!

356
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,910
No way! He was sittin'
in the car that ran me over!

357
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,310
What?
[engine revving]

358
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,110
[Saburo]
You guys both sure about him?

359
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,977
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

360
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,377
No, Saburo! Wait!

361
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,377
Shit yeah! Drive this thing
right down his throat!

362
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,477
[gasps]

363
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,777
[crash, tires squealing]

364
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,277
[gasps]

365
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,677
[breathing heavily]

366
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,677
What's going on?
Where the hell am I?

367
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,577
[Haruna] We're in one
of Izaya Orihara's hideouts.

368
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,077
Nobody comes here.
It's soundproofed.

369
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,777
So, no matter how violent
our love-making gets,
no one will hear.

370
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,844
[whimpering]

371
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,577
Don't worry, Takashi.

372
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,810
I'll take good care of you.

373
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:10,310
[grunting]

374
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:14,610
We'll share the pain,
over and over and over again.

375
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,610
[whimpering]

376
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,277
[screaming]

377
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:23,910
When I open my eyes,
what'll be waiting for me?

378
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,110
Will I have an ordinary life?

379
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:31,577
You're Aoba Kuronuma,
ain't ya?

380
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,410
You're with the Awakusu.

381
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,977
Let me guess...

382
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,744
You're here to see Mikado
and get your digs in.

383
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:39,210
What do you want from me?

384
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,777
[laughing]
I guess I'm gettin' old!

385
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,510
Whenever I'm around
you young'uns,

386
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:45,244
I tend to speak my mind.

387
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:48,477
Especially around
sneaky little bastards
like yourself.

388
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,144
Yeah, well, if you're worried
about Mikado, don't be.

389
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,977
We got what we wanted,
so we're not gonna mess
with him anymore.

390
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,810
Good. Glad to hear it.

391
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,944
I don't know
if you're a Dollar
or a Blue Square these days,

392
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:02,310
but if you pull
any more of your shit,

393
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:06,810
I'll make you regret
you ever squirted
out your mama.

394
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:11,110
It was good talkin'
with you, Kuronuma.
Get on home now.

395
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:14,510
Or, will my life
be extraordinary?

396
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,977
Well, now, that's a bummer.

397
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,677
I was hopin'
to thank him, in person,

398
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,910
seein' as how
he risked his life
to save you and all.

399
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:26,877
Sorry. He's still
unconscious, though.

400
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,444
Maybe tomorrow, then.

401
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:31,810
Anyway, what's up
with you guys. You like him?

402
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:35,710
Yes, but I'm still trying
to sort my feelings out.

403
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,910
Oh, yeah? You sure
they're your own feelings?

404
00:22:39,044 --> 00:22:41,944
Yes, I'm sure.

405
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,910
You don't have
to worry about that!

406
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,910
Is this is the life
I'm supposed to come back to?

407
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:51,110
How did I end up here?
And why?

408
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:55,910
Was there a point
to anything I did?
Or, wasn't there?

409
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:58,110
[Masaomi]
Mikado? Mikado!

410
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,910
In the end,
I realized something.

411
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,210
Mikado!

412
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:03,877
What's out there...

413
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,510
that's reality.

414
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:08,310
It's not ordinary
or extraordinary,

415
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:10,877
but I can reach out
and touch it.

416
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,710
It's real.

417
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:15,710
That's what
I'm waking up to right now.

418
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:19,010
[monitor beeping]

419
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:22,010
[moaning]

420
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,210
Welcome back!

421
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:28,010
Yeah. We missed you, man!

422
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,177
This right here... is real.

423
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:45,110
[Kururi]
I cannot believe
how quiet it is here.

424
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:47,010
But I'm sure
it'll fill up again soon,

425
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,310
with all kinds
of unsavory characters.

426
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,010
[Mairu]
I can't wait!
