159
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,326
‐ With all due respect,
Mr. Kazamoto,

160
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,371
what happened to Kuzuhara
ain't no laughing matter.

161
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,415
Mr. Kine was kicked out
of the Awakusu because of him,

162
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,917
and it's still a sore topic.

163
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,418
SHUJI:
Please, Officer Kuzuhara,

164
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,795
I'm begging you.

165
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,255
You sure you don't have
any information on him?

166
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,925
‐ Look,
if you don't leave me alone,

167
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:47,926
I'll arrest you for‐‐

168
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,135
RAN: Pan over. Pan over.

169
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,428
There. Asshole.

170
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,555
‐ I'm not obstructing you,
and you know it.

171
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,433
I just thought that, you know,
you're Maju Kuzuhara.

172
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,686
Your family's
the most decorated bunch of cops

173
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,937
the force has ever known.

174
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,522
If anyone knows anything
about the Dollars,

175
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,981
it would be you.

176
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,359
‐ You just talked yourself
into a stalking rap.

177
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,695
I don't know where you learned
your trade, Mr. Niekawa,

178
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,655
but you just crossed the line.

179
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,116
I'm gonna teach you tabloid rats
once and for all

180
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,451
you don't ambush cops
for scoops.

181
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,078
‐ You've got it all wrong.

182
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,455
I'm not asking about the Dollars
for a story.

183
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,998
I've got personal reasons.

184
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,543
‐ Hmm? What do you mean,
"personal"?

185
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,462
‐ Well, see,
I'm looking for my daughter.

186
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,964
She's run away from home.

187
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,173
‐ Oh. I'm sorry.

188
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,466
So how old's your daughter?

189
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,302
‐ She's 17, going on 18.

190
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,221
MAJU: You file a missing persons
report?

191
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,432
‐ No. I sometimes
get a text from her

192
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,892
saying she's crashing
at a friend's place.

193
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,354
I‐I think she ran away
'cause of me.

194
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,400
I was worried, so I checked her
computer without her permission.

195
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,153
She had this one teacher,
Nasujima.

196
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,071
He was involved
in some kind of scandal,

197
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,991
and I sort of thought she might
still be in touch with him.

198
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,826
‐ Go on.
‐ That's how I found out

199
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,162
about them‐‐
the Dollars, I mean.

200
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,914
And now I think
she might be part of them.

201
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,208
These days, you don't see
color gangs

202
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,668
in town all that much,

203
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,754
although I heard
the Yellow Scarves

204
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,672
have regrouped
since last year.

205
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,174
I don't know for sure.

206
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,176
I've sort of been
in the hospital for a while.

207
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,803
Look, I know I wasn't
much of a dad to her.

208
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,764
Maybe I was never cut out
for it.

209
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,808
But I figured the more I can
learn about the Dollars,

210
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,977
the closer I'll get
to finding her.

211
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,270
‐ Hmm.

212
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,691
RAN: You know these Dollars

213
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
you keep hearing about?

214
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,693
All of them are assholes.

215
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,028
Yep, Just a bunch of greedy,

216
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,696
chicken‐shit little assholes

217
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,407
hiding in the middle
of one big anonymous asshole.

218
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,534
Who, Me?
I'm an asshole too, baby!

219
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,869
And you know what?

220
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,662
All you folks
listening to me right now‐‐

221
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,747
you're assholes too.

222
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,540
[laughs]
Hey, you want to know

223
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,459
what kind of asshole
I hate the most?

224
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,877
This kind.

225
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,796
‐ I hear someone's asking
about the Dollars.

226
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,880
You know about that?

227
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,256
WOMAN: Yeah. He's a reporter.

228
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,633
He gave me his card,

229
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,384
and it says he's
with the "Tokyo Warrior."

230
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,761
AOBA: That's weird.

231
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,387
I didn't think
the press cared much

232
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,848
about the Dollars anymore.

233
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,059
Whatever.
Thanks for letting me know.

234
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,520
Hmm?

235
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,439
Great.

236
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,817
[soft whirring]

237
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,695
‐ Well, look who it is.

238
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,947
It's my little brother.

239
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,615
You haven't grown an inch,
buddy.

240
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,409
What's the matter?
You not drinking enough milk?

241
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,870
‐ Yeah, well, you've changed
more than me, for sure.

242
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,581
You look way skinnier now,
and you even dyed your hair.

243
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,167
‐ I figured I'd go
for a full‐on makeover.

244
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,545
See, they make you
shave your head in juvie.

245
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,006
‐ Those burns, they don't look
as bad as people were saying.

246
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,591
‐ Yeah. Lucky me.

247
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,510
‐ When I heard about your fight
with the Yellow Scarves

248
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,054
and how you got nailed
by that Molotov cocktail,

249
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,430
I was so worried.

250
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,099
‐ You got to be shitting me.

251
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,977
You, worried
about my ass getting burned?

252
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,437
You torched my room,
you son of a bitch.

253
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,398
Or did you forget about that?

254

<i>[jazzy music]</i>

255

God! I wasn't smoking!
I swear!

256

[grunts]

257
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,447
‐ Smartass punk.

258
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,783
‐ [whimpering]

259
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,327
You're such a little shit.

260
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,622
You trying to get me back
for smacking you around?

261
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,082
‐ What are you talking about?

262
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,251
I'm just glad
you didn't get hurt.

263
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,794
‐ Oh‐‐thanks.

264
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,629
I'll never forget that day.

265
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,339
Pops damn near broke my nose.

266
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,301
And you still owe me for that,
you little pip‐squeak.

267
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,219
‐ I don't know
why you're so mean to me.

268
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,013
How could you think
I'd do something like that?

269
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,639
You're my brother.
I look up to you‐‐

270
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,350
‐ You can deny it all you want.
I don't give a shit.

271
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,768
After what you put me through,

272
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,104
you think I'm gonna trust
what you say?

273
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,481
Remember how you put me
in charge of the Blue Squares

274
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,401
'cause you said it was getting
too much for you to handle?

275
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,323
‐ Um, I sort of need your help.
‐ What?

276
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,910
For shits and giggles,
the little punk started a gang.

277
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,161
But he let some thug join,

278
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,496
and that's when the shit
got real.

279
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,373
‐ Could you take over as leader?

280
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,960
I don't know what to do,
and I'm scared.

281

RAN: Bullshit.
Yeah, but I'm his big brother.

282
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,257
So what was I gonna do?
Say no?

283
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,967
Okay. Sure.

284
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,303
‐ Thanks, man.
You're the best!

285
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,763
‐ If you want to get
out of this alive,

286
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,723
you're gonna have to beg me,
and maybe‐‐

287
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,434
maybe I'll only
beat you half to death.

00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,269
'Cause I'll be coming for you.

Soon as I get rid
of that little shit Kida,

290
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,357
Yumasaki, and that Kadota prick.

291

‐ Wait. Kadota?
[grunts]

292

What's up?

293
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,155
‐ What are you gonna do?

294
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,616
The Blue Squares aren't
backing you up anymore.

295
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,702
‐ Mikado Ryugamine.
‐ [gasps]

296
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,580
‐ He the new boss?
Your fearless leader?

297
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,209
I hear the two of you got
some epic romance going on.

298
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,712
Ha! I should drop by
and say hey to him soon.

299
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,048
‐ It'd be better
if you didn't.

300
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,508
‐ Why?

301
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,301
‐ You'd be in
way over your head

302
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,262
if you tried
to take on the Dollars now.

303
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,305
But if going back to jail's
what you want,

304
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,807
then go right ahead.

305
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,350

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,227
You didn't get
what I was saying.

00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,229
‐ Huh?
‐ I don't want to hurt him,

308
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,648
just pay him my respects.

‐ [grunts]

310

‐ You see, kid, I'm a member
of the Dollars now too,

311
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,612
and I just wanted
to shake the hand

312
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,155
of the guy who started it all.

313
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,741
Ha! Besides,
you know what they say:

314
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,743
in war, it's more fun
to be a soldier

315
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,620
than a general or some shit.

316
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,873
Ha! If I learned anything from
dealing with you, it's that.

317
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,250
Thanks, bro.

318
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,793
[tires screeching,
horns honking]

319
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,962
‐ Wish he'd get run over.

320
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,755
[sighs]

321
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,633
I guess being locked up has
taught you a couple of things.

322
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,635
I can't wait for the day
I get to bring you

323
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,054
and whoever's pulling
your strings down.

324
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,937
IZAYA: Are you sure you want
to hire me?

325
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,023
Don't you think
that's a little odd

326
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,566
considering you don't trust me?

327
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,900
MIZUKI: You're right.

328
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,986
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

329
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,238
But you're still the best
at what you do.

330
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,995
‐ Ha.
‐ What are you smiling for?

331
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,329
You know him?

332
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,290
‐ He goes to my old high school.

333
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,624
Is he in trouble?

334
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,001
‐ I don't know.

335
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,545
See, I got this old friend.
We go back a ways.

336
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,340
I heard her daughter's going out
with that kid in the photo.

337
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,761
Problem is, I also heard
that kid's in a color gang.

338
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,930
If he is, I want to try
and set his head straight.

339
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,515
‐ I understand your concern.

340
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,226
If he's in a gang,
I'll convince him to leave it.

341
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,770
‐ Thanks.

342
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,646
I figured you'd be right
for the job,

343
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,940
seeing as how you're closer
to his age.

344
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,358
‐ A wise decision.

345
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,860
I'll start the job right away

346
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,987
and dig up
all the info I can on him.

347
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,322
Don't you worry.

348
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,240
In a few days,
you'll know everything

349
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,701
about Mikado Ryugamine.

350
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,952
‐ [grunts]

351
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,832
MAN: Alley‐oop!
‐ [grunts]

352
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,585
WOMAN: Goddamn,
he's such a pussy.

353
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,965
‐ Hey, Aoba, seriously,

354
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,676
are you cool with this guy
being our leader?

355
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,845
‐ Do you know why we're called
Blue Squares?

356
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,180
‐ Why?

357
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,516
‐ Someone way smarter
than any of us once said

358
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,561
we're like a bunch of sharks
stranded in shallow waters.

359
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,979
The city's like an ocean,

360
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,232
and we each got our own
tiny piece of it,

361
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,691
our blue square,

362
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,861
and we're the sharks
protecting our turf.

363
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,531
‐ Say what?
‐ Shut up, idiot.

364
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,784
‐ The Dollars are huge.
It's true. But they're shallow.

365
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,702
They're like a big,
shallow ocean

366
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,913
stretching across the city,

367
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,875
and like the shark, we only
thrive if the water's deep.

368
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,044
We need Mikado
'cause if us sharks

369
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,046
want to go deeper
into the Dollars,

370
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,841
he's the only one
who can get us there.

371
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,718
‐ You busted your ass
like a champ today, Kyohei.

372
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,886
See you tomorrow.

373
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,596
‐ [chuckles] You got it.

374
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,059
[thinking] I checked around,
and so far, nothing.

375
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,145
Damn Kida.

376
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,397
‐ I need your help
to destroy the Dollars.

377
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,024
‐ [sputters]
Are you freakin' high?

378
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,359
Do you know what you're saying?

379
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,570
‐ Come on, man.
You can't be serious.

380
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,239
Whatever happened last year
is over and done with.

381
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,741
Horada's in jail,
so why can't you just drop it

382
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,411
and let bygones be bygones?

383
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,248
‐ This is for someone else,
not for me.

384
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,791
‐ Who, Mikado?

385
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,503
‐ I can't say any more.
Sorry.

386
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,130
‐ So that's it, then?

387
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,464
You want us to turn traitor

388
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,300
and help your ass
take the Dollars down

389
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,011
but you're not gonna give us
any more than that?

390
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,096
‐ I need your help.
‐ I got that.

391
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,891
But this is a big deal,
and you're not making any sense.

392
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,768
‐ Yeah, I know I don't,
but that's how it is.

393
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,188
Look, I know I can't force you.

394
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,441
I'll tell you what I can,
and hopefully it'll be enough.

395
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,775
‐ I'm listening.

396
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,611
‐ The Dollars have changed.

397
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,614
Haven't you noticed that?
‐ Mm.

398
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,866
‐ And have you heard about
how someone's going around

399
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,076
kicking out who they think
are the bad apples?

400
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,246
‐ So what? The Dollars
don't have rules or leadership.

401
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,290
Go figure there'd be folks
causing trouble

402
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,791
and acting like dicks.

403
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,793
And if someone decides
they want to clean things up,

404
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,212
what's the problem?

405
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,297
You ask me,
they're doing us all a favor,

406
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,757
long as they don't kill anyone.

407
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,759
MASAOMI: Things are going
off the rails fast.

408
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,637
What if I told you I knew why?
‐ Huh.

409
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,847
‐ What if I told you
there's a group of guys

410
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,266
that's worked their way
into the Dollars?

411
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,227
Guys with shark masks?

412
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,937
‐ [gasps]
‐ Shit. Seriously?

413
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,647
‐ You mean the Blue Squares?

414
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,441
‐ What if the same thing that
happened to the Yellow Scarves

415
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,152
might be happening right now
to the Dollars?

416
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,946
What would you do?

417
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,864
‐ I don't know,
but you think Mikado

418
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,491
might have something to do
with it, right?

419
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,827
‐ I can't answer
that question, man. I'm sorry.

420
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,455
But after everything
settles down,

421
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,458
I promise I'm gonna tell you
everything I know.

422
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,171
‐ Give me a few days
to think it over.

423
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
‐ Sure. No problem.

424
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,093
I appreciate you hearing me out.

425
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,346
Oh, if you decide
not to help us out,

426
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,682
we should probably talk
about that.

427
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,518
‐ I'm still listening.

428
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,188
‐ Well, I guess I'll try
not to run into you, then.

429
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,607
I doubt I'd stand a chance
against you,

430
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,111
especially if you're
in kick‐ass mode, you know?

431
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,362
Later.

432
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,991
‐ If we wants
to take them out so bad,

433
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,452
he should be planning an ambush
instead of telling us about it.

434
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,747
Huh. That kid's got
a lot to learn.

435
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,166
DENNIS: You got lucky tonight.
‐ Why?

436
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,918
‐ If you kept up
the gangster shit

437
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,837
and scared away
any of my customers,

438
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,214
I would've had to mess up
my wall again.

439
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,050
‐ Well, it's cool.
No need to get violent.

440
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,468
‐ Right.

441
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,846
By the way, that kid took care
of your bill for you.

442
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,431
ALL: Huh?
KYOHEI: What did he do that for?

443
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,392
‐ How should I know?
Maybe he's paying you back.

444
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,227
By the look in his eyes,
he must have had

445
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,104
something big on his mind.

446
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,982
‐ [thinking]
He's right about that.

447
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,693
But how's Mikado fit in
to all this?

448
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,570
When I bumped into him
the other day,

449
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,405
he did seem kind of off.

450
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,865
MIKADO:
Sure, if they're like you.

451
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,658
You're a role model for us.

452
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
As a Dollar,
I'm free to do whatever,

453
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,079
even if it means trying
to make things better here.

454
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,791
‐ [thinking]
Could he really be the one

455
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,794
who's weeding out the Dollars?

456
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,588
Ugh.

457
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,674
I guess maybe I should help Kida
after all.

458
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,052
MAN: Yee‐ha!

459
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,387
Time to die, you asshole!

460
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,930
Hit him!

461
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,973
‐ [gasps]

[crash]

463
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,144
MAN: Whoo‐hoo! Hell yeah!

464
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,898
‐ So what's the deal
with you and Mikun?

465
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,025
I haven't seen you guys together
lately.

466
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,568
‐ What are you saying?

467
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,945
AZUSA: Oh, please.
He can reply to your texts

468
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,947
but can't pick up the phone

Some boyfriend he is.

We're just friends. That's all.

You and Mikapon are like

the king and queen
of the awkward prom.

Or maybe you guys
are more like a rookie butler

475
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,252
and a klutzy maid,

476
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,671
destined to fall for each other

477
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,048

swallowtail romance!

what you're talking about.

They're the same as always.

what Yumatch told me?

He said Masaomi's back in town.

Did you know about that?

485

‐ Oh? Have you guys
seen him around?

486
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,401
‐ I haven't, but the other day,
you know,

487
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,985
when I ran into you
on the street?

488

Dotachin and the boys were
meeting him at Russia Su‐‐

don't be so impatient.

Hey! Speak of the devil.

of my friends and drives away?

son of a bitch and kill him!

There was a hit‐and‐run
outside Ikebukuro today.

or something?

so I doubt it.

about it, Chromium?

Are you saying

this has something to do
with the Dollars?

was one of their big shots.

His name is Kadota.

He's dead?

I can't believe it.

Who would want to go and do that
to him?

Do you want to go see him?

It's kind of late now,

Trust me.
I'd love to go and see him.

But if we went
to visit him tonight,

there's no telling
who we might run into.

‐ Yeah, I guess you're right.

532
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,011

why you shouldn't go see him.

I mean, he did help you out
that one time, didn't he?

I don't care if I get a bad rap

but there's no reason
you should get one too.

was my fault in the first place,

'cause I was the one picking
fights with Toramaru, remember?

Kyohei helped both of us out.

We wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

Sorry.
