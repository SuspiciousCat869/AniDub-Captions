And don't worry.
It's just a simple wager.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,831
The subject of the wager
will be the human soul.

19
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,084
For example, let's say
I ask you this question.

20
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,755
Can all human souls be bought
with money or not?

21

The key word here is "all."

22
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,343
The answer is, there are times
when you can buy them

Humans will sometimes maintain

So look at it this way.

30
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,105
The human soul is random,

31
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,107
and we bet on random things.

32
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,609
This offends some people.

33
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,152
They might say
that the human soul

34
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,780
isn't nearly as random
as a toss of a coin.

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,282
They might even get angry.

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,868
For instance,
let's say we created a bet

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,119
based on the question,

38
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,413
"Will one person
murder another?"

39
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,456
For those who answer,

"That person would never do

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,833
something like that,"

44
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,298
So the odds were greater
that the person wouldn't kill.

Let's put aside what TV says

This is hypothetical, after all.

You see,
it's impossible to predict

00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,643
what kind of person someone is
until they're put to the test,

and working
as an information broker,

50

I've done just that
to numerous people,

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,485
but it's not as if I have 100%
control over the human soul.

52

All I can do
is give them a push.

Let's say
