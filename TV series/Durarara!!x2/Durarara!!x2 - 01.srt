Did something happen to Seiji?

IZAYA: Not really.

165
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,362
He's been with Mika Harima,
as usual.

166

It looks like
they're even deeper in love.

167

‐ I see.

168
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,617
As far as I'm concerned,

169
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,910
that's worthless information.

170
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
‐ [yawning]
It's the truth, though.

171
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,957
Maybe some news will come on
that will entertain me for once.

174
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,796
In our top story this evening...

175
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,464
‐ We'll be covering
the serial murders

176
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,758
that have rocked
Ikebukuro recently.

177
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,802
The perpetrator has
yet to be caught.

178
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,304
‐ The incident occurred
this morning before dawn.

179
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,473
Employees rushed
into a second‐floor room

180
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,766
after hearing a scream

181
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,768
and witnessed a gruesome scene.

182
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,645
What they saw
was an unconscious woman,

183
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,273
drenched head to toe in blood,
and a dead man,

184
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,734
whose body was battered
beyond recognition,

185
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,318
lying in front of her.

186
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,071
This is the third murder
to take place in this manner.

187
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,823
But there's been no evidence
as of yet

188
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,534
to point to a plausible suspect.

189
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,661
Someone in a wolf mask
was spotted

190
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,163
at the first crime scene.

191
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,290
At the second,
witnesses reported seeing

192
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,667
a merman‐like figure
fleeing the site.

193
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,336
And today,
they were in a dinosaur mask

194
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,672
for this bizarre crime.

195
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,967
‐ I heard this scream,
so I ran out into the hall

196
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,136
to see what was going on.

197
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,096
And‐‐and the door was open,

198
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,182
so I could see inside,

199
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,853
but when I looked in, um,
this dinosaur thing‐‐

200
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,230
well, he looked like a monster,
you know?

201
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,108
Going at that guy's chest
with his bare hands.

202
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,194
[both groaning]
I could see him gouging‐‐

‐ The titles due for release
this month are awesome.

204
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,363
‐ Huh?

205
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,907
‐ The irregular
magic high school.

206
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,702
‐ So no new volume
of a certain magical index?

207
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,788
‐ Dotachin,
you're into light novels?

208
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,457
‐ Nope, those things are totally
beyond my understanding.

209
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,417
But that one's a pretty
interesting read.

210
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,545
‐ Sorry, man. Afraid there isn't
a new release out this month.

211
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,255
‐ If they stick
to their usual schedule,

212
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,132
it should come out
in a couple of months.

213
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,383
‐ Gotcha.

214
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,677
Give me a heads‐up
when it does, okay?

215
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,055
‐ Hollywood's at it again?
‐ Huh?

216
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,389
Who's Hollywood?

217
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,433
‐ It's that murderer's nickname.

218
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,018
It's all over the Internet, man.

219
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,437
That's what everyone started
calling him online.

220
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,231
‐ Why do they call him
"Hollywood"?

221
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,482
‐ Probably because he uses all

222
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,192
those badass costumes
and makeup.

223
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,069
‐ It's so Hollywood!
Like that, huh?

224
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,905
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I don't know his deal.

225
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,741
The way he kills isn't normal.
‐ It's beyond normal.

226
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,577
I hear it's actually way more
brutal than the reports say.

227
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,288
Apparently, all the media
were told to tone stuff down.

228
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,749
‐ Breaks down walls and doors
with his bare hands,

229
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,917
and then they say he strips

230
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,585
every shred of flesh
off his victims

231
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,587
so there's nothing left
but the bone.

232
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,840
‐ He takes people out
like he's some animal,

233
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,925
but he's human on the outside.

234
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,343
The guy kind of sounds like

235
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,137
he's Death Gun from "SAO"
or something.

236
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,596
‐ I'm thinking
he's actually more like

237
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,098
Gastrea from "Black Bullet."

238
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,641
‐ I'm thinking he's actually
more like

239
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,018
Yuuki Katakura from
"Double Brid."

240

He debuted in

It was my idea,

Yuhei didn't really like it.
