[chuckles]

165
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,760
‐ [laughs nervously]

166
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,596
‐ I'll go make up with him
right now.

167
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,599
[whistling]

168
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,434
‐ Hey!

169
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,769
That Izaya‐‐

170
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,979
is he tired of being alive
or something?

171
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,732
TOM: You really
kept it together.

172
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,275
That was some act.

173
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,112
I think you deserve the People's
Honor Award right now.

174
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,197
‐ Thanks.
I appreciate that.

175
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,242
And Tom, I've got a little favor
I'd like to ask you.

176
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,201
‐ What is it?

177
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,494
‐ If stuff goes down today

178
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,413
and I get arrested for murder
or worse,

179
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,748
then I want you to make sure
to tell our president

180
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,625
that I was fired yesterday.

181
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,710
Can you do that for me?

182
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,294
[elevator dings]

183
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,506
[growling]

184
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,675
That's twice you've
wasted my time.

185
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,885
So I'm gonna kill you twice!

186
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,973
[panting]

187
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,142
NAMIE: If a painfully obvious
ruse like this one

188
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,476
actually worked on him,

189
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,438
that Shizuo must be
quite the simpleton.

190
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,065
This was such a nuisance.

191
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,900
If he can't kill Shizuo
with a knife,

192
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,819
he could use poison
or something.

193
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,821
MASAOMI: The guy has a friend.

194
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,656
This friend may be
laughing or crying

195
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,324
or be in some kind of danger.

196
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,162
But all the guy ever does
is run away.

197
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,496
MIKADO: This place is creepy,

198
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,831
and it looks like
it's got roaches.

199
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,208
Let's go hang out
a hotel instead.

200
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,461
BOY: They're just roaches.
Eat 'em!

201
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,129
BOY: You eat one.
BOY: [laughing]

202
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,131
BOY: How much will
you pay if I do?

203
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,341
BOY: 300 yen.
BOY: Cheapskate.

204
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,761
BOY: I'm game.
BOY: Ugh, for real?

205
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,262
MIKADO: I know this place.

206
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,221
BOY: Hey, Aoba.

207
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,890
You're driving me crazy.

208
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,641
Can I smack him?
‐ Not yet.

209
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,478
‐ [giggling]
‐ Uhh!

210
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,522
[all laughing]

211
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,864
CELTY: Mikado?
Why is he here?

212
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,747
‐ I'm sorry, I had to step out
for a minute.

213
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,040
Anything happen?

214
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,334
‐ You completed your end
of assignment.

215
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,503
‐ Yes, it was piece of pie.

216
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,880
‐ This factory was abandoned
for some time.

217
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,341
Is now a hangout for
delinquent boys.

218
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,510
‐ Is hangout for
Black Rider, too.

219
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,763
I don't understand need to hide
from those kids, though.

220
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,015
‐ Is unclear.
‐ Shall we shoot?

221
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,351
‐ It was ineffective yesterday.

222
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,019
That thing is real monster.

223
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,354
If we use sniper rifle,

224
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,897
we'll give away position.

225
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,857
Could be fatal.

226
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,068
‐ Hmm?

227
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,946
‐ When it moves, I will
follow after.

228
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,572
Our target is the girl.

229
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,908
The monster may very well
lead us to her.

230
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,869
‐ Sounds as if you're
enjoying this, Verona.

231
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,037
‐ That is affirmative.

232
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,914
I am beginning to enjoy myself.

233
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,707
I am quite fond of Ikebukuro.

234
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,836
Half despair, half jealousy.

235
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,129
A dash of hope.

236
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,589
In other words, that's love.

237
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,092
‐ Last night, you were hanging
out on the Dollars' member site

238
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,469
asking around about some stuff,
weren't you?

239
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,389
You know, about the Dollar's
feud with the guys from Saitama.

240
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,225
‐ Uh, mm, I was looking into it.

241
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,768
Something was bugging me.

242
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,521
‐ I actually happen to know
everything about it.

243
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,981
‐ [gasps] Are you serious?

244
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,440
‐ Yeah, we're the ones
who did it.

245
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,443
‐ Huh?
‐ It wasn't a big deal, really.

246
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,612
Me and all the guys here...
[laughter]

247
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,239
Acting as members
of the Dollars,

248
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,908
we went over to Saitama
and attacked that gang.

249
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,785
‐ Uh, what's that?

250
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,788
‐ You know those guys calling
themselves the Toramaru?

251
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,123
Remember the other day?

252
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,292
They were chasing after us
in Kadota's van,

253
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,793
and that person
on the Black Bike.

254
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,795
‐ Uh, yeah, what about it?

255
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,046
‐ When we were down in Saitama,

256
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,965
we set a bunch of their bikes
on fire.

257
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,175
And while we were at it,

258
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,677
we sent about 20 of them
to the hospital.

259
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,054
‐ In other words, you tossed
a Molotov cocktail

260
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,098
into the parking lot where
they were hanging out at,

261
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,183
right, Aoba?

262
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,311
‐ Ah, but why?

263
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,564
‐ Funny thing is, we're not
just members of the Dollars.

264
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,733
We've also got another name.

265
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,151
‐ Another name?

266
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,737
‐ [chuckling]
I'm sure you must be familiar

267
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,280
with the Blue Squares.

268
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,497
‐ No way.
‐ I'm being honest with you.

269
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,208
Coming into contact
with a painting

270
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,377
is the same thing as meeting
the girl you're destined for.

271
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,670
‐ Yeah?

272
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,672
But in my eyes, you're more
of a masterpiece

273
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,133
than any painting could ever be.

274
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,676
WOMAN: What?!

275
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,386
Well, I think any man
who'd buy a painting like this

276
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,347
would be considered
God's gift to women.

277
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,723
‐ [laughs] You serious?

278
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,934
‐ It's as good as sold.
WOMAN: I really am.

279
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,685
CHIKAGE: Well, then...

280
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,479
‐ Yes?

281
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,940
Is there perhaps something
I can assist you with, sir?

282
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,609
‐ Yeah, there is, actually,
about this painting over here.

283
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,278
This lady's sort of in a bind
unless it's sold.

284
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,988
And so...

285
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
come on.

286
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,157
‐ What?

287
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,493
‐ It costs 1,280,000 yen.

288
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,870
If you don't have cash,
plastic's fine.

289
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,872
‐ Huh?
‐ Hey, get with the program.

290
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,041
She said that she'd be
in a bind and everything.

291
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,543
A real man wouldn't let her
go through that.

292
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,836
And you're standing
right there‐‐

293
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,213
a man who clearly has money.

294
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,049
You probably own this gallery,
don't you?

295
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,093
So naturally,
you've got capital.

296
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,469
‐ Well...

297
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,554
‐ You're supposed to use
your money for women.

298
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,514
Everyone knows that.

299
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,015
Now, if you call yourself a man,

300
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,644
go on ahead and buy this
painting and help the lady out.

301
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,063
‐ Now, now, sir.
Enough joking.

302
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,608
‐ Joking?
Did you think I was being funny?

303
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,527
When did I make you laugh, huh?

304
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,113
‐ Uh, please,
you don't have to.

305
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,407
‐ Hey, old man.
‐ Yes?

306
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,285
‐ It's obvious that young lady
over there is a hard worker.

307
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,869
So just where the hell
do you get off

308
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,079
glaring at her like that?

309
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,998
‐ [gasps]
[cell phone chimes]

310
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,001
‐ Found one?
Where are you?

311
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,586
What?
Which building?

312
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,380
I'll be coming back here
at some point

313
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,425
to check if you actually
bought that painting from her.

314
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,718
Are you serious?

315
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,594
Man, that's right out front.

316
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,224
‐ [moaning]

317
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,687
‐ So you sure about this?

318
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,024
‐ Yeah, it's a Dollars member
who kind of sticks out.

319
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,400
‐ Where is he right now?

320
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,901
‐ Well, that's the funny thing.

321
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,820
Just before you got here,
a girl called him over

322
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,655
and then took him inside
