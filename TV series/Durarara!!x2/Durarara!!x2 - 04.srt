00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,564
and,
once he reached her hideout,

321
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,858
contact my sisters
via cell phone.

322
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,027
At least, that was the plan.

323
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,364
Naturally, a scheme like that
would never work out.

324
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,534
But the 1 million yen
they found on the street

325
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,619
ultimately did make its way
back to Celty,

326
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,329
so I guess you could say

327
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,039
those two actually did
a rare good deed.

328
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,208
‐ Hey, Egor,
you were the one who ended up

329
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,751
beating the snot out
of those bikers

330
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,586
at the underpass, weren't you?

331
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,463
I knew
you had to be someone special,

332
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,423
but you've got to be
a Russian super soldier

333
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,716
to pull off something like that.

334
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,051
‐ You're amazing.

335
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,263
‐ No. That other person deserves
the credit.

336
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,392
IZAYA: In reality,
Egor's known to be

337
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,228
the seventh most feared hit man
in Russia.

338
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,815
Also known as the
"Philosophical Killing Machine."

339
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,984
Well,
if anything did happen with him,

340
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,236
it would be their problem,
not mine.

341
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,905
Now, as for what's going on
with Celty...

342
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,073
‐ All right, guys.

343
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,616
Make sure you pay attention,
now.

344
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,243
For sagohachi‐style pickles,

345
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,745
the quality of the malted rice
and the ratio you use

346
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,581
is what makes or breaks
this dish.

347
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,666
So we start off
with this bed of sagohachi

348
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,960
that I brought from home,
and it's fully fermented.

349
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,046
‐ I'm home. Hey,
what the heck's going on here?

350
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,673
‐ Since I'm between jobs now,

351
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,925
I thought it'd be a good time
to learn how to cook.

352
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,469
I went to ask Anri
for lessons first,

353
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,055
but it seems
she's not a very good cook.

354
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,600
Then I tried
to get Erika to teach me,

355
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,269
but Japanese cuisine
wasn't her thing.

356
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,105
This is who Anri brought over.

ALL: [gasp]
‐ She can really cook, huh?

359
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,449
‐ I think most would say
she's top‐notch,

360
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,743
which means she's
super top‐notch in my book.

361
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,037
‐ You're such a flatterer,
aren't you?

362
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,040
Okay. Now you just lay them
in the bed of sagohachi

363
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,209
and let them pickle all night.

We've got nothing for dinner.

368

369
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,763
Hot pot!
CELTY: Hot pot?

‐ Yeah, and while we're at it,
let's invite all our friends!

371
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,142
We're going to have ourselves
a hot pot party.

‐ Well, it's like this.

379
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,289
Just seeing
the smile on your face

380
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,791
is enough to keep me going.

381

‐ That's a bit much.

382
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,128
But thanks.

383
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,673

have been pretty tough,

00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,840
haven't they?

‐ Yeah.

386
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,261
It makes me wonder
if I'm really doing

387
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,345
the right thing.

388

‐ How so?

389
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,183
‐ I'm just trying to figure out
if being a transporter

390
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,476
is the best job for me.

‐ And what brought this up
all of a sudden?

392

I take on a dangerous job,

00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,695
even if I'm okay with the risk,
it causes trouble for you, and‐‐

A little trouble means nothing.

And as long as I've got
you by my side,

So was I.

At this time of year?

to point us
in the right direction.

KURURI:
I'd greatly appreciate it

420
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,585
if you wouldn't intrude

421

IZAYA: Hmm? Use privacy mode.

425
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,593
Better yet, get out of here,
you two.

BAKYURA: I went to have sukiyaki

Just the two of us.

You heard of these places?

It was delicious.

KANRA: I swear!

00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,779
You guys have no sense
of the seasons.

435
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,906
You're only supposed to eat
hot pot style dishes

436
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,783
in the winter!

to some hot pot.

Shabu‐shabu, or maybe some crab.

440
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,999
You can choose
whatever you want.

441
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,835
‐ Because your little chat room
friends are having hot pot?

442
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,463
If you're looking for someone
to soothe your injured vanity,

443
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,964

You read that?

Namie, it wasn't you
who happened to tell my sisters

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,263
about Celty, now, was it?

447
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,766
‐ Who knows?
I couldn't really say.

448
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,102
‐ [laughs]
You've turned into a force

449
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,479
to be reckoned with,
haven't you?

450
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,980
‐ Still,
I've discovered one thing.

451
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,482
‐ And that is?

452
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,193
‐ That life goes on,
even without your involvement.

453
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,404
And no one invited you
to have hot pot,

454
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,864
so I guess you aren't
the center of the universe.

456

All I did
was make an observation

00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,162
of how some others
spent their day off.

458

But I think it's about time

I start enjoying
my own days off.

potential sparks everywhere.

If...if Saika had stabbed

465
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,394
Mikado and Masaomi
the same way‐‐

466

SAIKA: I love you...
I love you...

467
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,275
I love you...I love you...
I love you...

468
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,028
‐ Nothing? Still haven't had
any luck finding Yodogiri?

469
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,613
‐ Looks like
the other organizations

470
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,866
are starting to think
we offed him ourselves.

471
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,409
‐ That sly old dog.

472
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,454
I can't believe he joined forces
with multiple groups.

473
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,372
‐ We can't let our guard down.

474
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,874
‐ This guy's way too sketchy.

475
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,709
I don't believe for a minute
this bullshit

476
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,753
about being a talent agency CEO.

477
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,671
‐ We got to get
the goods on this guy.

478
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,673
No matter what it costs,
we're gonna make sure

479
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,884
we bury that con artist dead.

480
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,552
‐ That Mikado.

481
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,804
He's interesting,
that's for sure.

482
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,556
No doubt about that.

483
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,724
I told you about that time

484
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,226
the bikers were after him,
right?

485
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,771
I mean, the situation
was just dripping with danger.

486
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,939
Anyone else
would've broke down and cried.

487
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,027
But he didn't flinch.

488
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,236
Even with all that pressure.

489
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,905
He loves
those surreal situations,

490
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,574
like stuff
straight out of some comic book.

491
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,700
It's almost unbelievable.

492
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,744
He thrives on it,

493
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,996
and that's exactly
the kind of guy he is.

494
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,289
See what I mean?

495
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,082
That's why
Mikado started the Dollars

496
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,083
in the first place.

497
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,418
‐ I'm not sure I get it.

498
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,461
‐ Sounds like
Mikado's just trying

499
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,504
to keep from getting bored.

500
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,005
‐ Things got interesting

501
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,673
when the feud between
the Yellow Scarves and Dollars

502
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,300
was heating up.

503
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,054
It'd be lame if it ended without
much damage to either gang.

504
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,597
‐ So,
you want to make a new spark

505
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,932
and have 'em start a fight, huh?

506
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,434
‐ Yeah, but even if we did,

507
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,977
there's someone
catching those sparks

508
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,896
and using them
for his own reasons.

509
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,440
Got to deal with that hyena
first.

510
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,526
Izaya Orihara has got to go.

511
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,236
Oh, but not the twins.

512
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,447
Nobody lays a hands
on Izaya's sisters, okay?

513
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,824
I got a thing for those two.

514
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,492
They kind of kissed me
out of the blue,

515
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,118
know what I mean?

516
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,287
‐ Oh, give me a break, Izumi.

517
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,248
‐ Never use my old name.

518
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,291
It reminds me
of my scumbag brother.

519
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,586
IZAYA: What I'm trying to do
is gather those sparks

520
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,505
and toss them all in one place,

521
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,466
and then
I'm going to say to them,

522
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,385
"Your vacation's over.

523
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,136
You piece of shit."

524
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,973
[man singing in Japanese]

525
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,313
NAMIE: It's so asinine.

526
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,397
I wonder why the world

527
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,316
is teeming with such fools.

528
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,568
Who needs him?
Or him? Or him?

529
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,570
All I need is my Seiji.

530
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,614
Still...next time‐‐

531
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,824
"No One Knows
What the Future Holds."
