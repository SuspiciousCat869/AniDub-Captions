00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,555
MAIRU: Izaya!

160
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,100
Time to die!

161
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,477
‐ It's nice to see how you
really feel about me, sis.

162
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,271
The older you've gotten,
the nastier you've become.

163
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,440
Oh, how modern society
has corrupted you.

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,276
‐ Ha, that's funny coming
from the king of corruption.

165
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,446
Next time you won't dodge
my attack.

166
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,657
‐ Izaya, you better?

167
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,283
‐ What do you think?

168
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,994
As long as I can avoid Mairu
breaking my neck, then yes.

169
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,121
Hmm?

170
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,330
‐ [grunts]

171
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,082
‐ [chuckles]

172
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,877
Oh, it's you.

173
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,797
For a second there,
I thought you were Shizu‐chan.

174
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,965
‐ Hiya, coach!

175
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,633
What the heck
are you doing here?

176
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,802
‐ Stay back, ladies,
'cause I'm gonna beat

177
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,971
the living shit
out of your brother.

178
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,723
‐ Sounds like fun.
Wanna watch?

179
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,765
‐ Mm‐hmm.

180
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,225
‐ It's times like this

181
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,185
I find it hard to believe
we're related.

182
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,563
Master Eijiro.

183
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,440
What's a professional
martial artist doing

184
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,026
attacking a civilian
on the street?

185
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,987
‐ Is that what you're
calling yourself these days?

186
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,865
Anyone who packs a knife
that can dodge my kicks

187
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,617
ain't no civilian, shitheel.

188
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,578
You think you can
waltz by my dojo

189
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,330
acting like nothing happened
between you and my sister?

190
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,001
You ruined her life,
you goddamn son of a bitch!

191
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,003
IZAYA: You want to do this
here in public?

192
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,671
How did I ruin Mikage's life?

193
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,006
I never touched her.

194
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,674
‐ It don't matter
if you touched her,

195
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,926
you slept with her,
or whatever, you piece of shit.

196
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,721
Mikage was a good kid,
got good grades,

197
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,639
was gonna make something
of herself.

198
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,391
Then you come around
with all your smooth talk,

199
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,643
and she dropped out of school!

200
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
[groans]

201
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,025
Damn, Mikage.
What the hell's that for?

202
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,527
You don't still got a thing
for this douche bag, do you?

203
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,112
‐ It's the only way
to shut you up

204
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,782
before everyone in town
starts thinking I sleep around.

205
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,034
Besides, picking fights
in the street?

206
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,870
You want to give our dojo
a bad rep or what?

207
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,456
‐ You snuck up on me
and kicked my ass.

208
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,249
How's that supposed
to help our rep?

209
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,251
‐ Oh, stop it, you big baby.
KURURI: Hey, where'd he go?

210
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,961
MAIRU: Who knows.
‐ A pro fighter's gotta be ready

211
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,546
for sneak attacks
at all times.

212
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,464
ELJIRO: Bite me!

213
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
‐ So this Mikage Sharaku.

214
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,637
Is she your girlfriend
or just a booty call?

215
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,763
Are you thirsty?

216
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,809
Can I offer you a drink
of water?

217
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,102
[laughter]

218
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,603
Oops, I spilled.

219
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,897
Could you get me some more
bottles of water?

220
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,565
‐ Sure, what kind?
‐ Two liters.

221
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,442
Three dozen of them.

222
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,402
And now it's time
for a quiz.

223
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,031
Question, what could I do
with that much water?

224
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,368
Meh, time's up.

225
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,746
The answer is pour every single
bottle over your head

226
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,623
nonstop until you suffocate.

227
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,834
Since you didn't answer,
here's what I'll do.

228
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,628
I'll force your little sisters
to drink it instead.

229
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,713
Ten liters each sounds fun.

230
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,218
You survive by profiting

231
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,262
off the dirty little secrets
of others.

232
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,013
But how will you survive this?

233
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,432
Oh, I'm sure you
gave it some thought,

234
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,685
but I doubt
you prepared for it.

235
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,270
Even if you had,

236
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,439
it wouldn't make
any difference, sweetie.

237
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,321
IZAYA: Hi, transporter.

238
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,282
I hope Shinra's doing better.

239
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,325
Nebula's lab
is state of the art.

240
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,620
Why, I bet he'll recover
faster there than at a hospital.

241
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,622
‐ How can you take this
so lightly?

242
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,624
You do know he was
almost killed, right?

243
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,543
‐ Yeah, well,
when I got stabbed,

244
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,628
he said, "See ya,"
and hung up on me.

245
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,132
Maybe I'm trying to outdo
his insensitivity.

246
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,718
‐ You said you had info
on the man who did it.

247
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,013
‐ I do, but let's talk
about the job first.

248
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,599
‐ I swear, if you're
lying to me about this,

249
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,475
I'll hand you right over
to Shizuo.

250
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,770
‐ I know, I know, but even
though I might be a liar,

251
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,523
I never lie when it comes
to business.

252
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,734
‐ Then why'd you bring company?

253
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,944
‐ Them?
Oh, you don't have to worry.

254
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,490
They're sort of like
foot soldiers/bodyguards for me.

255
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,159
CELTY: Dragon Zombies?

256
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,577
‐ I know, right?

257
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,120
There's a whole lot
of people who there

258
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
who resent me,
don't you know?

259
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,334
So I'm paying these fine folks
top dollar for their services.

260
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,253
‐ Back to business,
what do you want me to deliver?

261
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,714
‐ This will take you
a couple days, first of all.

262
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,341
‐ What are you talking about?

263
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,718
I have to stay here
and take care of Shinra.

264
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,970
I can't be gone
a couple days.

265
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,305
‐ It'll be fine.

266
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,224
You won't be working
the whole time.

267
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,894
Just moving around
a little every day.

268
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,896
‐ What does that mean?

269
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,189
‐ Raring to go, huh?

270
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,692
I want you to transport
some information.

271
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,155
[Cóiste‐Bodhar neighs]

272
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,366
‐ He was meeting
with the Black Rider.

273
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,034
‐ No doubt about it anymore.

274
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,827
He's got ties with it.

275
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,914
MAN: Yeah, so what does
Mr. Kumoi say?

276
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,750
‐ He found out Orihara's
been digging for info

277
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,211
on Amphisbaena
for the past few days.

278
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,796
MAN: So keep an eye on him?

279
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,715
‐ We can't let the Awakusu
take down Amphisbaena.

280
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,802
As soon as you get a chance,
grab that laptop.

281
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,972
When Akabayashi
nabbed our guys the other day,

282
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,515
I found out
we had a client

283
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,559
who plays big
at Amphisbaena's casino.

284
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,145
We used him to get some guys
on the guest list,

285
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:55,233
but after a couple times
we stopped getting invited back,

286
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,611
which means they
found out about us.

287
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,988
See this chip?

288
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,032
It can record your wins
and losses electronically.

289
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,869
That's not all, though.

290
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,955
There's a transmitter
and a bug inside.

291
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,833
It's a clever system
for tracking all their members,

292
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,919
and Mr. Kumoi
wants that system.

293
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,796
He wants to mass produce
the chips

294
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,965
and use them to expand
our business.

295
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,134
If we can team up
with Amphisbaena,

296
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,177
it'll be a win‐win
for both of our outfits

297
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,762
and no one will get hurt.

298
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,764
‐ So that's why we're
following the info‐broker.

299
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,059
‐ Uh‐huh, but if he's snooping
around for the Awakusu,

300
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,229
we want to get to him before
he has a chance to report in.

301
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,648
As soon as we get our hands
on that laptop,

302
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,192
we're gonna make‐‐
[phone chimes]

303
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,861
It's Mr. Kumoi.

304
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,529
He wants to see me again.

305
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,448
‐ Why?

306
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,742
‐ Guess he wants me
to scream some more.

307
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,536
MIMIZU: Want to know what else
I know about you?

308
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,955
You and the Black Bike
are besties.

309
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,125
I also found out
you had that urban legend

310
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,669
checking up on us
for the past few days.

311
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,964
Oh, and on Heaven's Slave,
too.

312
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,258
To be honest,
I don't know much about them,

313
