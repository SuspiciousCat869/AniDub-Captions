don't we, Mr. Akabayashi?

160
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,915
You knew he was the leader
all along, too.

161
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,541
‐ Oh, you think?

162
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,752
Either way,
I kind of figure this info

163
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,129
was something you'd want
to keep to yourself.

164
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,714
‐ Why would I do that?

165
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,384
‐ If you kept it a secret,
it might be worth more later on,

166
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,054
but if you played that angle
and someone like me found out,

167
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,597
that would be bad.

168
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,057
‐ I wouldn't dream of it.

169
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,101
And honestly,
I'm just not that clever.

170
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,312
You'd have to be to keep
secrets from the Awakusu.

171
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,522
‐ Cut the crap.

172
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,107
I doubt you'd be
in business this long

173
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,693
unless you had a trick or two
up your sleeve.

174
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,952
The Dollars have gotten so big,
they're like a goddamn city now.

175
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,955
It's only a matter of time
before it goes up in smoke.

176
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,165
‐ Oh, you think so?
Why's that?

177
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,918
‐ 'Cause there's a firebug
who wants to watch it burn,

178
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,337
but there might be others
starting fires, too.

179
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,839
And if he's not careful,

180
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,467
he just might get caught
in someone else's fire.

181
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,302
ERIKA: While that was happening,

182
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,056
Dotachin was having
a second operation.

183
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,475
Things looked beyond serious
for him.

184
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,730
But all we could do was sit
and wait for it to be over.

185
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,149
You didn't get any sleep
last night.

186
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,692
Go home, get some rest,

187
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,485
and I'll call you
when he comes out.

188
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,656
‐ No, he's helped me so many
times, so I'll manage.

189
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,158
But how are you doing?

190
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,951
You didn't get
much sleep either.

191
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,371
‐ Hmm.
I'm still hanging in there.

192
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,914
I hope they are, too.

193
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,416
If it wasn't for Dotachin,

194
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,501
none of us would be
on the straight and narrow,

195
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,628
especially me.

196
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,172
‐ Oh.

197
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,257
‐ As long as I've known him,
he's never been the type

198
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,176
to turn his back
on someone in trouble.

199
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,386
He's the kind
of nice guy archetype

200
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,388
you don't see much
even in manga.

201
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,849
Oh, and look at how crowded
this waiting room is,

202
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,519
and you'll get a sense
of how many people he's helped.

203
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,355
He can't have visitors yet,
but they keep on coming.

204
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,690
What are they thinking?

205
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,193
He's in surgery
for Christ's sake.

206
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,488
Oh, well, what you gonna do?

207
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,282
‐ So, uh, where's Walker and‐‐

208
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,951
sorry, I forget
the driver guy's name?

209
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,369
‐ Doing what they do.

210
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,955
See, Dotachin's more
than a friend to us.

211
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,499
He's also our brakeman.

212
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,084
‐ Brakeman?

213
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,009
‐ Crap, it's starting to rain.
‐ Told you.

214
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,762
‐ Goddamn, this is good.
‐ Huh? Can I try?

215
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,430
Come on, give me a bite.

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,265
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

217
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,518
[tires squeal]

218
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,103
‐ What the hell?

219
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,979
‐ You asshole!

220
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,231
‐ You son of a bitch!

221
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,191
‐ Yo, you trying to kill us
or what?

222
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,984
‐ Kushi High never changes.

223
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,861
You're supposed to be
on your summer break.

224
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,905
Do you ever take
your uniforms off?

225
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,740
‐ Oh, you got a problem
with that, wise‐ass?

226
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,158
‐ You wanna die or something?

227
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,244
‐ Huh, what's up,
you little dick fart?

228
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,537
[overlapping chatter]

229
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,122
‐ No way, Togusa?

230
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,790
all: Huh?
‐ Hey.

231
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,750
‐ 'Sup?
Yo, show some respect.

232
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,752
He used to go to our school.

233
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,754
‐ Oh, shit.
We had no idea.

234
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,713
Sorry.

235
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,923
both: Sorry, sir.

236
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,967
‐ It's cool.
No harm, no foul.

237
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,469
The reason I'm here
is to apologize

238
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,221
for something I'm gonna do.

239
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,430
‐ Huh?

240
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,224
‐ What are you gonna do?

241
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,310
‐ I'm gonna kill someone
by dragging him behind my van.

242
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,230
You can see how doing that would
ruin Kushi High's rep,

243
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,606
can't you?

244
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,109
ERIKA: It goes without saying
that some people

245
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,612
had a hard time
sitting around waiting.

246
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,406
If I could be out there too,
I would.

247
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,243
Believe me.

248
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,452
‐ I got a problem.

249
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,706
One of my best friends
is heading for trouble.

250
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,082
I want to stop him,

251
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,626
even if I have to kick
his ass to do it.

252
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,795
Thing is,
I can't do it on my own.

253
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,633
I hate dragging you into this,
but I really need your help.

254
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,969
‐ We got your back, chief,
you know that.

255
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,304
‐ Yeah, just tell us
what to do.

256
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,306
‐ Yeah, chief,
we're down for whatever.

257
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,765
‐ Hell yeah.
‐ You're damn straight.

258
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,267
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ You got it.

259
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,770
‐ Yeah, chief, we're with you.
‐ All the way.

260
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,940
‐ All right, guys, the name
of the person we're going after

261
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,817
is Mikado Ryugamine.

262
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,403
He's the leader of the Dollars.

263
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,031
Yatabe should have
been here by now.

264
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,576
[door opens]

265
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,286
‐ What took you so long?
‐ It's about time.

266
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,371
‐ Um...
‐ Yo, what's wrong, man?

267
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,165
‐ Um...

268
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,833
‐ 'Sup, Masaomi?

269
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,169
Short time no see or something.

270
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,297
‐ Walker, how'd you know
we were gonna be here?

271
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,175
‐ Are you kidding?
I just followed your boy here.

272
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,677
I figured if you're bringing
the Yellow Scarves back,

273
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,888
it's a cinch you'd be needing
your right‐hand man.

274
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm all crafty like that.

275
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,807
‐ Oh.

276
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,351
Okay then, why are you here?

277
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,894
You wouldn't happen
to be the guy

278
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,230
that ran Kyohei over,
are you?

279
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,358
‐ The reason I'm sitting here
waiting for Dotachin to wake up

280
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,526
is so I can call the boys
and stop them

281
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,071
before they can
do anything drastic.

282
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,491
They're out there right now
looking for the guy who hit him.

283
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,201
‐ They are?
‐ Oh, yeah.

284
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,954
And if they catch the dude
who did it before the cops do,

285
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,748
they'll most definitely
kill the bastard.

286
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,083
‐ [gasps]

287
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,752
‐ Heck, if I found him,
I'd kill him, too.

288
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,681
‐ What is this place?

289
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,224
It looks like there was a fire.

290
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,018
‐ Halfway through building it,
the owners bailed.

291
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,479
Then a while ago,
something went down here

292
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,563
with the yakuza.

293
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,440
And since then,
people avoid it.

294
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,068
‐ I guess this place is as good
a spot to meet as any,

295
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,821
but don't you think it's kind
of far from Ikebukuro?

296
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,239
‐ That's the best part about it.

297
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,908
No one's gonna bother us
way out here.

298
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,035
‐ Yeah, good point.

299
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,041
Well, let's find out
what the Dollars are up to.

300
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,679
‐ Damn, you're fast.

301
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,765
‐ In one day, things have
gotten worse in the city.

302
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,393
I bet it's 'cause of
what happened to Kyohei.

303
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,648
ERIKA: People who post crap
like that should be banned.

304
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,151
Go get 'em, Mikado.

305
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,610
Boy's got skills!

306
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,572
That's the leader
of the Dollars for you.

307
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,707
ERIKA: This right here
is something to worry about.

308
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,459
‐ Come on, Walker, seriously?

309
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,711
Does it look like
I can afford a car?

310
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,629
‐ You got it all wrong,
Masaomi.

311
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,048
I'm not saying you did it,

312
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,841
but what about
someone from your crew?

313
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,635
It's possible one or two
of these fine, upstanding gents

314
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,429
went rogue behind
the boss's back.

315
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,307
You know, it does happen
in manga and real life.

316
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,850
‐ Yeah, I guess.

317
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,186
‐ There's all these rumors
about the Yellow Scarves

318
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,520
getting back together, right?

319
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,064
And online it's like the war

320
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,316
between the Scarves
and the Dollars never died down.

321
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,734
So there's that.

322
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,652
‐ I don't think
anyone here did it.

323
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,113
But if it turns out
I'm wrong...

324
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,490
‐ Then?

325
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,283
‐ Then you do
whatever you have to

326
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,827
to make it right.

327
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,331
‐ [chuckles]

328
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,124
I'm going to look
for the guy now,

329
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,085
but if I find out
it was one of yours,

330
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,961
I'll be back.

331
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,298
It'd be a shame
if Asuna got singed.

332
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,258
‐ Oh.
‐ What the hell?

333
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,010
‐ That guy's a freak.
‐ Right?

334
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,513
‐ Can't believe we let him
walk out after talking shit.

335
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,932
‐ Don't tell me
you guys can't smell that.

336
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,018
‐ What?
[all sniffing]

‐ What the hell is that?
‐ Kerosene.

338
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,147
He had a Molotov on him,

339
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,941
and depending on how things
went down here,

340
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,526
he would have used it.

341
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,736
‐ Hey, you know what?
I totally forgot something.

342

[all scream]

343
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
Masaomi, I don't know
if you heard,

344
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,033
but Shizuo is in big trouble.

345
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,618
For real.

346
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,745
‐ You can't take
that post seriously.

347
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,497
It could just be
someone trolling.

348
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,040
‐ I don't think so.

349
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,209
This member's posts have all
been legit up till now.

350
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
So it's a good bet
this one is too.

351
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,880
‐ Don't tell me you can remember
every single post

352
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,215
made by every member.

353
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,467
‐ Nah, just the ones
that stick out.

354
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,053
Anyway, this is good.
‐ Huh?

355
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,473
‐ I'm glad Shizuo got arrested
after he quit the Dollars.

356
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,060
Can't have any bad apples.

357
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,396
In a way, I'm glad he's there.

358
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,647
‐ What do you mean?

359
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,566
‐ If Kyohei was still
walking around

360
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,235
and found out about what I'm
trying to do with the Dollars,

361
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,945
he'd stop me for sure.

362
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,572
‐ There's no doubt about it,

363
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,532
Mikado's slipped a cog.

364
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,450
Was he always this twisted

365
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,329
or did he get this way
after we showed up?

366
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,249
Maybe we were drawn to him
because he's broken.

367
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,751
Maybe this is
the best place for us.

368
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,421
Now that they're out of the
picture, what will you do?

369
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,589
‐ About what?

370
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,507
‐ Well, with Kadota
in the hospital

371
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,676
and that Shizuo guy
locked up in jail,

372
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,261
the Dollars will collapse.

373
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,471
They were the ones
people looked up to.

374
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,099
‐ Yeah, you have
a good point there.

375
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,351
If you have an idea,
speak up.

376
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,313
‐ We need someone to take
their place in the Dollars.

377
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,566
The Dollars need a symbol
to represent them, right?

378
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,942
‐ A symbol?

379
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,153
‐ Yeah, someone the whole city
knows by sight

380
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,571
but don't know anything about.

381
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,281
A famous person
who everyone knows

382
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,490
is a member of the Dollars.

383
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,326
There's one person like that.

384
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,619
‐ You mean...

385
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,912
‐ Exactly!

386
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,288
And I have a feeling
they'd be down

387
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,165
with helping us
clean out the Dollars.

388
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,001
Isn't that right,
Headless Rider?

389
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:50,218
‐ Wait, Celty?
What are you doing here?

390
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,678
Hey, wait, what's going on?

391
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,263
How do you guys
know each other?

392
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,182
I mean, what, are you
friends now or something?

393
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,018
When did that happen?
Come on, Celty, say something.

394
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,937
‐ We ran into each other
a little while ago.

395
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,147
I apologized for what
happened at the warehouse.

396
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,109
I gave her my email
and she gave me hers.

397
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,654
Help me.
No actually, it's Mikado and me.

398
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,657
Right now we both
need your help.

399
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,618
Yeah, see, what happened
to Kadota is a huge issue

400
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,994
for the Dollars.

401
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,580
Without him, we've lost
our most ideal member.

402
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,165
Heck, there's talk
about Dollars going nuts

403
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,751
and causing all kinds
of trouble across the city.

404
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,628
Even Heiwajima's quit us.

405
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,673
So now we need a new symbol
to hold us together.

406
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,009
‐ And you want me
to be that symbol, is that it?

407
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,470
‐ Thank God, you understand.

408
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,847
‐ No, thanks.

409
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,267
The Dollars shouldn't
have a symbol.

410
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,978
That's the whole point of it.

411
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,115
We're not exactly friends.
Acquaintances.

412
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,534
‐ I had no idea.
How come you never told me.

413
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,910
‐ I didn't mean anything by it.

414
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,121
I just wanted to surprise you,
is all.

415
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,039
‐ Well, I guess you got
what you wanted.

416
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,749
So what's up?

417
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,086
‐ I came here because there's
something I wanted to ask you.

418
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,838
‐ Sure.
What is it?

419
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,216
‐ Mikado, what do you want
to do with the Dollars?

420
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,136
‐ I guess I want us to‐‐oh.

you call me, Uncle Seitarou?

Kanra's back!
Meow!

SHARO: Yo.
CHROME: Good evening.

KANRA: Sharo, you should change
your name to Meowru.

475
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,698
Cute!

476
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,825
SHARO: No.
And eww.

477
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,869
CHROME: I'm with Sharo
on this one.

478
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,287
KANRA: Oh, I see how it is.

479
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,706
Two big brutes ganging up
on a helpless girl.

480
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,374
And you call yourselves men.

481
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,085
CHROME: Yes, well, we don't know
if you're really a girl,

482
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,462
now do we?

483
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,130
KANRA: Hmm, then I'll
tell you something

484
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,341
that's going to make you
shiver in fear like little boys.

485
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,968
SHARO: I'm shaking already.

486
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,596
KANRA: A biker gang might
go to war with a color gang

487
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,556
in Ikebukuro.

488
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,475
SHARO: Wait, where did
you hear this?

489
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,976
KANRA: You've heard about
the Yellow Scarves

490
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,478
getting back together, right?

491
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,438
I think they're doing it
so they can start a war

492
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,023
with the Dollars.
Meow!

493
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,858
Kadota's hit‐and‐run
was them saying,

494
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,401
"Come at me!"
Meow.

495
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,737
But have you heard the other
rumor floating around?

496
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,031
SHARO: Hold on, that crap
about the Yellow Scarves,

497
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,574
that's for real?

498
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,909
CHROME: So what's
this other rumor?

499
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,411
KANRA:
You know the Dragon Zombies?

500
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,163
CHROME: Sure,
they're a biker gang.

501
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,581
KANRA: Bingo!

502
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,417
Your prize for correctly
answering is one meow, Chrome.

503
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,919
Meow.
CHROME: Keep it.

504
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,796
KANRA: Anyway, the rumor is

505
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,506
people wearing
Dragon Zombie jackets

506
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,675
were seen close to where
Kadota got hit by that car.

507
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,677
And there's
another rumor I heard

508
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,971
that says there are
a whole bunch of Dragon Zombies

509
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,431
in the Dollars.

510
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,016
SHARO: Hang on a minute.

511
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,185
Are you saying the Dragon
Zombies took over the Dollars

512
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,646
and tried to kill Kadota?

513
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,397
CHROME: Hi there, Kanra.

514
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,109
I wanted to talk
about something in private.

515
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,904
Uh‐oh, posting blanks is such
a newb thing to do,

516
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,448
and I know you're not.

517
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,951
That said, who are you?

518
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,704
How very interesting.

519
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,957
Someone has access
to my Kanra account

520
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,500
and is pretending to be me.

521
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,335
And going by
their IP address,

522
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,295
it's not one of my sisters.

523
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,174
Well, hope they're having fun.

524
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,927
Who ends a post with "meow"?

525
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,846
Lame.
