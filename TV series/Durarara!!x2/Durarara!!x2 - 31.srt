00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:26,497
to hide my cheating
from my honeys.

149
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,497
It's amazing you still
got honeys to cheat on.

150
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,731
If you want to keep her
out of the loop and shit,

151
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:35,031
that's up to you,
but be careful.

152
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,897
Chicks know when a guy's
hiding something,

153
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:40,531
and these days,
it's a piece of cake
for them to find out what.

154
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,097
Uh--

161

You know,
on second thought,

162
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,731
I better call her
just in case.

163
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,831
Okay. How far is
her place from here?

164
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,464
It's not too far.

165
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:08,131
A little bit of a walk,
but not too bad.

166
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,697
Hi, Celty?
Um, this is Anri.

167
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:12,664
Can I come over
and see you now?

168
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:15,764
Please call back and let me
know if this is a good time.

169
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:18,031
Talk to you soon. Bye.

170
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,231
I left a message,

heading over.

00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,131
I figured.

177
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,431
Maybe I can climb
that building.

178
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,597
Hmm?

179
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:15,331
Uh-huh.
Whatever happened to Celty,
Team Red-eye's behind it.

180
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,164
They ain't working
for the city,

181
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,331
so let's bust through 'em.

182
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,364
[neigh]

183
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,531
Nice work.
And by the way,

184
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,297
I had no idea you were
a Saika wielder.

185
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:36,931
That said,
is it safe like that?

186
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,197
I can keep it
under control from here.

187
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,364
Although,
if I were to walk away,

188
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:44,097
it would most likely return
to its sword form.

189
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:47,531
Then, do I just take
the body and sword, and go?

190
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:51,064
Have you ever had to deal
with an unrestrained
Dullahan before?

191
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:54,097
If so, you're more than welcome
to do as you wish.

192
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,864
Hmm. You can handle it.

193
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,031
That would be for the best.

194
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:02,464
Well, the head should
be here any minute now.

195
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,097
Oh?

196
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,264
Once it reunites with its body,
it will settle down,

197
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,931
and then it will return
to its original form.

198
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:12,331
When it does,
I shall use Saika

199
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,464
to sever the head
from the body again.

200
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:17,797
Then, we can claim
the body for ourselves.

201
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:20,164
Are you sure
it'll calm down, though?

202
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:23,997
The Dullahan's head contains
its memories from before.

203
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,331
If the body regains
those memories,

204
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:28,531
it should revert
to its former self.

205
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,631
As for its memories
as the Headless Rider,

206
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,364
I'm not sure if those
will transfer over.

207
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:37,197
That could be good.
I bet without them,

208
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,564
that thing'll be a hell
of a lot easier to handle.

209
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,331
Not remembering her life
as the Headless Rider

210
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:45,064
would be preferable
for me as well.

211
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,997
Why do you say that?

212
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,264
It would also be
convenient for me

213
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:52,164
if my rival in love
lost her memories.

214
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,197

I can answer that.

The swirling mass above

What the hell
are you people after anyway?

244

She--or, rather,
what she used to be--

245
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,849
is, in my opinion, nothing more
than a product to be sold.

246
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,616
You don't have
to tell him all that.

247
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:51,882
There's no point in keeping it
a secret from him.

248
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,416
She's not human
or a protected species.

Look at what she has become.

How can you call
a raging monster your friend?

Look, lady, ever since
I was a little kid,

there ain't been a day
when I haven't been
called a monster.

I know what it's like
to lose my shit, too.

But sometimes Celty was
there to talk me down,

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,082
and I was lucky she was,
real lucky.

giving a damn about me.

So now it's my turn

I will take action.

in Toshima Ward,

317
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,882
you were attacked by person

318
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,982
wearing full-face
motorcycle helmet.

319

This person try stabbing you
with Spetsnaz combat knife.

Oh, yeah. Her.

321
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:06,382
You're gonna say
it was you, right?

322
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,182
-Mm.
-Come on.

323
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,882
Give me some credit.
I ain't that dumb.

324
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,482
You're wearing
the same thing now
you did then.

325
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,649
I can't say
I was always sure.

326
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,849
-But I was--
-Aware of possibility?

327
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:20,216
That is unacceptable answer.

328
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,049
It is not like you.

329
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:25,016
If there was hint
I was attacker,
you would have acted.

330
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:27,616
Or else, why did you not
crush my cervical vertebrae

331

when you had chance?

332

'Cause I like having you around

333
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,582

337
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,849
Your statement conflict
with personality.

338
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,049
-Please explain.
-All right, look,

339
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:46,782
I only beat down the things
that don't make sense to me.

340
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,549
But if I understand
where someone's coming from,

341
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,616
it don't matter
if I get shot or stabbed.

342
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,082
I wouldn't get pissed.

343
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,616
So now what?

344
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,782
The ball's
in your court, Varona.

things don't make sense.

[gasp]

359
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,182
If you try
and kill someone,

you gotta be ready
to get killed yourself.

That's how it works.

362
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,849
So, if you're telling
Varona to kill me,

363
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,616
and that is
what you're doing,

364
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,949
it's the same as telling her
to get ready to die

if things work out that way.

You're not telling my trainee

of Mr. Yagiri.

-If one brings their personal
feelings into their work,

374
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,382
it will lead to less
