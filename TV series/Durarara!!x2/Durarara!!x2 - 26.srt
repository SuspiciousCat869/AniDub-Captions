I've had absolutely nothing
to do with them lately.

157
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,433
I don't believe you!

158
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,100
Too bad
because it's true.

159
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:01,133
However, I am planning
to mess with them

160
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,200
-in the near future.
-Wha--

161
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,067
It's true. Mikado and Masaomi
have great potential.

162
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,933
They're more interesting
now than ever before.

163
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,633
How should I put it?

164
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,600
It's like the two of them
are walking on a tightrope

165
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,400
strung between two cliffs.

166
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,067
You see the metaphor?

167
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
The cliffs, the rope,
their friendship?

168
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,200
As they walk along,

169
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,867
another rope is wound
around both their necks.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
If one of them
stumbles and falls,

171
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,300
he'll drag the other
right down with him.

172
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:32,300
Even if one of them
grabbed that tightrope
at the last second,

173
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,200
it would only tighten the noose
around the other's neck.

174
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,800
Talk about suspenseful.

175
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,667
-[quivering]
-Can you imagine

176
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,033
the reactions
of the people watching?

177
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,200
I bet some would
charge admission.

178
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,333
Others would get on the rope
and try bouncing them off.

179
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:49,100
And the do-gooders would be
at the bottom of the cliff

180
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,800
spreading rescue mats
around. Hilarious.

181
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,900
-[Saika] <i>Use me.</i>
-You know what I'd do?

182
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,933
I'd set fire to both
ends of the tightrope

183
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,600
and just sit back and watch.

184
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,800
<i>[voices chattering]</i>

185
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,767
-[Saika] <i>Use me.</i>
-Really?

186
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,800
Why would you
want to do that?

187
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,567
Curiosity, I guess.

188
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,300
I'd like to see what they'd do
in a situation like that.

189
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:10,467
No way.

190
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,633
<i>I can love everyone for you.</i>

191
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:13,800
[Anri] <i>Shut up!</i>

192
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,533
I don't get it.

193
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,767
Why are you
telling me all this?

194
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
What good does
any of this do you?

195
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:22,200
What good does it do, you ask?

196
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,233
I told you once before.

197
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,000
I love all human beings,

198
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,133
no matter
how horrible they are.

199
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,767
In my opinion,
that gives me certain rights,

200
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,167
like messing with their heads
if I want to.

201
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,867
For example, there's a girl
with a grudge against me

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,533
who tried to kill me once.

203
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,000
But I don't hate her.

204
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,200
I still love her
like any other human.

205
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,233
[Shingen] <i>Now, this girl</i>

Well, well.
How's it going, Manami?

215
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,200
What'cha doing here?

216
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,567
I just came by
to mess with Izaya.

217
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,800
Sounds like more work
than it's worth.

[Saika] <i>Your mother knew</i>

<i>-Shut up!</i>

235
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,733
Don't give me that look.

236
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,100
You have no right
to criticize me.

237
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,333
You gave your friends
the cold shoulder.

238
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,367
Yep, you had
Mikado and Masaomi wrapped
around your little finger.

239
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,533
-That's not--
-Forgive me for being blunt,

240
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,200
but in my opinion,
you should have used
Saika on both of them.

241
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,800
[gasp] That's so wrong!
How can you say that?

242
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,133
I'm sorry.
You think it's wrong?

243
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,467
Oh, I don't know.

244
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,333
If we're talking about
normal humans, yes.

245
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,600
But they can't do
the things that you can.

246
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,233
Listen, whatever
you think you are,

247
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,600
you're most definitely
not human.

248
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,967
-[gasp]
-You gave up your humanity

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,833
when you chose
to become one with Saika.

250

That's how the deal works.

251
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,700
And despite you not
being human anymore,

252
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,167
here you are pretending
to brood like a human,

253
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,100
doing nothing even when your
dearest friends are in danger.

254
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:51,067
I swear to Christ,
if you make my friend cry,

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,700
I'll take a soldering iron
to your eyes.

[chuckle] Oh, Erika,

257
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,667
as a fellow human,
I love this side of you.

258
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,900
So, out of respect for that,
I'll back off.

Glad to hear it,

260

you're off the hook

It's been fun chatting,
ladies,

262
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,133
but I'm late for a date
with a cranial nerve exam.

263
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,367
Yeah? Then make sure
they take a good look

264
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,800
while they're poking around.

265
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,233
If your brain looks
like moldy cauliflower,

266

you're screwed.

Take it easy.
Don't let him get to you.

He's just pushing
your buttons is all.

271
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:30,933
But, Erika, another second,

272
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,533
and I would have
slashed him and--

273
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,067
But you didn't,
so relax, okay?

274
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,533
You could be
a demon reincarnated,

275
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,933
one that wiped
everything out

millions of years ago,

277
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,733
but I wouldn't care.

278
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,267
I'd forgive you for it.

Neither wanted the other

You've got a heart

What are you

Nothing. I mean it.

You act more human

That's why you're so kind.

Yeah, I kind of
