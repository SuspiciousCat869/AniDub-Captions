00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,342
a virtue, not a curse.

158
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:02,309
Ultimately, how you decide
to use your power

159
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,575
is entirely up to you.

160
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,475
Yeah, but a little while ago,

161
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,442
someone told me
I wasn't human anymore.

162
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,009
And if that's true,
then I don't think

163
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,742
I have the right to be
in love with anyone.

164
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,142
Really? Then what they said
applies to me as well.

165
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,075
Huh? I'm so sorry.

166
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,942
Th-That came out wrong.

167
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,275
Miss Sonohara,

168
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,442
let's just say
for argument's sake

169
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,009
you weren't human.

170
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,342
All you have to do
to become human again

171
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,309
is simply give up Saika,

172
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:34,775
because, in the end,

173
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,675
your blood and flesh
are human.

174
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,175
[Saika]
<i>I love you.</i>

175
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,275
<i>I can't love you.</i>

176
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,875
<i>What is this? How scary.</i>

177
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,742
<i>Monster. Spare me. Save me.</i>

178
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,842
<i>No, no, no.</i>

179
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:52,109
<i>I'm scared. I'm scared.</i>

180
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,642
<i>I'm scared.</i>

181
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,642
Did you see something?

182
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,075
[quivering]

183
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:14,675
Let me see if I understand
you correctly.

184
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,409
If one is not human,

185
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,209
they have no right to live,
love, or enjoy themselves?

186
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,642
Is that what you think?

187
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:25,575
Ms. Kujiragi, are you human?

188
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,709
Biologically speaking,

189
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:30,275
the answer is quite
convoluted, I'm afraid.

190
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:34,209
However, I can tell you how
I identify in human society.

191
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:38,609
Simply put, I am what is
referred to as a villain.

192
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:41,575
Eventually,
I will be exterminated

193
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,475
by someone seeking
justice or revenge.

194
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,309
Although I'm prepared
for that to happen,

195
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,675
I will try my best
to postpone it

196
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:53,209
and enjoy every moment
of my life until then.

197
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,209
-Miss Sonohara.
-Huh?

198
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:58,475
You are not even remotely
the same as I am.

199
00:09:58,609 --> 00:09:59,909
Instead of sitting here

200
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,809
speaking with a villain
like myself,

201
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,142
you should be with
more wholesome company.

202
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,842
But I can't.

203
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,075
I leech off others

204
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,575
because I can't
survive on my own,

205
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,909
just like a parasite.

206
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,509
-And what's wrong with that?
-Huh?

207
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:18,109
If what you say is true

208
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,442
and there are people
who let you feed off them,

209
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,042
then it means they must be
benefitting somehow in return

210
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,375
for letting you do that.

211
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,109
That is not a parasitic
relationship.

212
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,775
It is symbiotic.

213
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,209
So there's no need to feel
indebted to them at all.

214
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,742
You see, no matter how much
Saika loves humanity,

215
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,342
in the end, she's a blade

216
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,975
that distorts
the human world.

217
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:41,575
There are two ways
to handle her.

218
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,809
You either control her
and make her your slave,

219
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:48,409
or you give yourself
completely over to her.

220
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:52,309
You're much too kind to do
either, Miss Sonohara.

221
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:56,475
You don't want to hurt anyone,
so you try to suppress Saika,

222
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,209
and, at the same time,

223
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:01,442
you can't bring yourself
to treat Saika as your slave.

224
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:05,309
You're trying so hard to find
a way to coexist with her,

225
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:09,142
but all you're doing
is painting yourself
into a corner.

226
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,409
You strike me as a good girl.

227
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,209
Good girls can't wield Saika.

228
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,675
[gasp]

229
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,609
[Haruna laughs]

230
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:20,142
You hear that, Anri?

231
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:24,209
This idiot's
totally asking for it.

232
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:27,142
She's expecting
someone with a grudge
to kill her.

233
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,442
What do you think?

234
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:30,609
Now's as good a time as any.

235
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:32,609
-[Anri sighs]
-Ms. Kujiragi,

236
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,109
If you hadn't sold
that Saika blade,

237
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:38,475
Anri's parents would
still be alive today.

238
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,309
-You're wrong.
-Huh?

239
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:44,875
If it weren't for Saika,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

240
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,775
-I wouldn't be here at all.
-[Haruna] What?

241
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,542
If it hadn't been for Saika,

242
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,709
my dad, he would've
killed me for sure.

243
00:11:56,609 --> 00:12:01,009
I'm sorry, but I can't
give Saika up just yet.

244
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:02,642
She saved me.

245
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,842
I owe her my life
and I have to repay her.

246
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:11,542
I just-- I can't let her go
without doing that first.

247
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:13,242
Is that so?

248
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,175
Yes, and I promised my friends.

249
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,342
I promised to tell them
everything about me and Saika.

250
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,042
Until I can do that,

251
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,875
I have to keep on being
the same as I was.

252
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,475
I understand.

253
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,675
You can reach me there
if you change your mind.

254
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,809
Hold on. Aren't you going
to give me a card, too?

255
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:43,042
I have no potential
transactions with you,
Miss Niekawa.

256
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:44,975
Well, if you're going
to be rude...

257

What if I took your Saika?
What do you say to that?

258

if you can?

that's gonna make you--

265

Hey, what's in the--
No way!

sold out of them!

Oh. Sorry about that.

Whoa. You're mega-hot.

270
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,509
You wouldn't happen to be
a fellow layer, would you?

271
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:14,975
Do you mean cosplayer?

272
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,775
I'm interested in it,
but I've never tried it.

273
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:20,609
Then today's your lucky day.
I have a cosplay club.

274
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,009
If you're a friend of Anri's,

275
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,675
you're more
than welcome to join.

276
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,409
-No, I don't--
-You're gonna love it.

277
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,609
We got around 270 different
kinds of costumes to try.

278

fallen angels, sexy maids.

279
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,175
You name it, we got it.

280

Do you have Gothic
Lolita outfits?

That's my number.

282
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,942
But you can expect a call
from me in the very near future.

283

What a boring day.

284
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:45,975
I think I'll head home now.

285
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:49,542
But you can expect
to see me again soon.

286
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:51,809
Your hot friend didn't seem

287
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:53,909
like she was all that
into cosplay.

I hope I didn't
make her feel weird.

Not at all. And thanks.
