a couple times in Ikebukuro.

And as for Mikado Ryugamine,
it's like we thought.

331

He's been cleaning house

pretty hard, too.

about the girl with the glasses
you used to look after.

Her and the Mikado kid
have been seen together.

They're not dating
or anything,

And now that my son's been hurt,

you're my friend,
