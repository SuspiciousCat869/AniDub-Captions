00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,238
[thinking]
<i>If I only knew what</i>
<i>was really goin' on</i>

156
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,038
<i>between her and Shizuo...</i>

157
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,471
<i>Nah. They'd still be</i>
<i>where they are</i>

158
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,705
<i>and I'd still be here,</i>
<i>eating sushi.</i>

159
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,138
<i>I'd be alone, either way.</i>

160
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:11,805
Hey, Shizuo good person.
Is being enzai.

161
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,905
And what mean "en"
in "enzai"?

162
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,605
"En" between persons
or, "en" in "engawa"?

163
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:19,405
Or, would Mr. Tom
like more engawa?

164
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,438
Buy now, pay with
Japanese En-- uh, Yen!

165
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,238
I swear, Simon!

166
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:27,238
I think you know more Japanese
than you're lettin' on.

167
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,338
What's wrong, Simon?

168
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,538
What's goin' on, big guy?

169
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:39,838
[gasps]
[overlapping voices]
<i>I love you.</i>

170
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:42,438
Wh-- What the hell's
goin' on out here?

171
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:45,438
[overlapping voices]
<i>I love you.</i>

172
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,438
Is this some kinda protest,
or somethin'?

173
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:53,305
[overlapping voices]
<i>I love you.</i>

174
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:54,338
[gasps]

175
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:55,838
Hey, mister.

176
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,605
Fighting no good, <i>da</i> ?

177
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:01,438
Eat sushi good,
but it late and we close.

178
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,238
[Simon speaking Russian]
What's all the commotion?

179
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,471
[speaking Russian]

180
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:12,638
Mister, if I were you,
I wouldn't go outside right now.

181
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,238
Mmm?

182
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:20,338
[overlapping voices]
<i>I love you.</i>

183
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:23,938
The next recruit
in my Saika army's
the guy with the dreads.

184
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,538
He can be my trump card,

185
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:28,538
in case Shizuo Heiwajima
comes around.

186
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,205
What's with everyone?

187
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,538
They're all acting
like how Amphisbaena did!

188
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,305
Don't worry, I told them
not to infect you.

189
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,438
Not for now anyway.

190
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,005
Uh, oh, good.

191
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,171
I never dreamed I could
have so many this fast.

192
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:45,138
Who knew fingernails
and teeth could be Saika, too?

193
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:47,338
I'm glad I took the time
to experiment.

194
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:50,105
Without your help,
I wouldn't have

195
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:51,871
this kind of power
at my fingertips.

196
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:55,105
I'm grateful, Haruna.
Yes.

197
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,771
Well, by tomorrow--
oh, correction-- today.

198
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:02,538
By the end of today,
we'll settle all the scores.
Yes.

199
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,771
Once we're done,
I'm going to treat you so good.

200
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:09,571
I hope you're looking
forward to it, Haruna.

201
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,371
Yes, Mother.

202
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,171
[thinking]
<i>Why don't I feel</i>
<i>the same rush I did?</i>

203
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,205
<i>Why am I not more excited?</i>

204
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,205
[Tom] <i>Something was</i>
<i>definitely goin' on,</i>

205
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:22,338
<i>behind all the stuff</i>
<i>that happened with him</i>
<i>and the Dollars.</i>

206
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:28,271
<i>Something supernatural,</i>
<i>something extraordinary,</i>
<i>but, still...</i>

207
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,738
[thinking] <i>I feel like</i>
<i>I couldn't care less.</i>

208
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,571
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

209
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:36,138
<i>It's like</i>
<i>I'm not myself anymore.</i>

210
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,405
<i>That day,</i>
<i>I found myself</i>

211
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:40,738
<i>standing someplace</i>
<i>I'd never seen before.</i>

212
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:44,071
[Tom]
<i>He might end up</i>
<i>killing someone.</i>

213
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,438
<i>Or, he might end up</i>
<i>getting killed.</i>

214
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,538
<i>Or, even killing himself.</i>

215
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,405
[thinking]
<i>But I don't want to die,</i>

216
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:53,238
<i>and I don't want</i>
<i>to kill anyone.</i>

217
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,071
Well, it's mine now,

218
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,938
so the least I can do
is try it out.

219
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,605
I think the deal is,

220
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,905
I'm supposed to keep
my finger off the trigger,

221
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,438
until I fire it.

222
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,665
[laughing]

223
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:30,406
Izaya! I saw you guys
fighting yesterday.
That was awesome!

224
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,740
Seriously?
That wasn't awesome.

225
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:37,073
I was almost killed
by a single-celled monster,
posing as a human.

226
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,806
<i>What's up</i>
<i>with that guy, anyway?</i>

227
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,873
<i>I lured him right</i>
<i>in front of that truck,</i>

228
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:44,473
<i>and he got up after</i>
<i>like it was no big deal.</i>

229
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,606
'Cause he's awesome!
I can't believe

230
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,940
you're not excited about
meeting a guy like him.

231
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:52,140
You did say you were
interested in humans,
didn't you?

232
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,773
He is not human.

233
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,606
He's either some kind
of wild animal, or a monster.

234
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,540
I was kinda hopin'
you guys would get along,

235
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,606
'cause it'd be better that way.

236
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,640
If you didn't get along,
you guys could end up

237
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,873
enemies, or arch-rivals,
or something.

238
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:08,173
If that happened,
someone could get hurt
before you know it.

239
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,473
Or maybe even worse.
Maybe one of you guys
might end up dying.

240
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,240
If it worries you so much,

241
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,806
why in God's name
did you introduce us?

242
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,073
I always thought
if worse came to worse,
I could smooth things over.

243
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:22,506
Oh, well! It didn't work out,
but it was a good try.

244
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,373
If you guys end up
killing each other,

245
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,573
I'll have two new openings
on my friends list.

246
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,273
If that's how it is,
so be it.

247
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,373
Some friend
you turned out to be.

248
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,273
Sorry, that's how it is!

249
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,840
In the end, I don't care
if everyone in the world dies.

250
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:39,406
The only thing
that matters to me is that
the woman I love survives!

251
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
By the way,
have you heard the saying,

252
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,306
"A tiger dies
and leaves its skin,

253
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,073
but people die
and leave their names"?

254
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,173
No.
Shizuo's kinda like a tiger.

255
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:52,206
When he dies,
he'll leave behind stories
of how strong he was.

256
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,473
People will treasure
those heroic tales
and tell them over and over,

257
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,673
and, eventually,
he'll become an urban legend!

258
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:00,373
Yes! I said "legend,"
not "rumor"!

259
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,473
There's a huge difference,
don't you know!

260
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,940
There's even a chance
he could surpass
his urban-legendary status

261
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:09,473
and live on in people's hearts
as a superhuman entity!

262
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,340
[thinking]
<i>That barbarian, a legend?</i>

263
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:14,440
<i>A superhuman entity?</i>

264
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,673
<i>That's insane.</i>
<i>That guy's a monster, at best.</i>

265
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:21,706
Okay. If tigers leaving skins
behind is true, what about you?

266
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,873
What kind of achievement
will you leave?
If I were to guess,

267
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:27,973
you'd leave behind a legacy
as a serial killer,

268
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,006
and that thrills me!

269
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,173
Well, I'm human, so I'd...

270
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
<i>...I don't care.</i>

271
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,573
[liquid sloshes]

272
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,640
[chuckles]
Guess it's started!

273
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,540
Izaya!

274
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,173
[chuckles]

275
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:11,840
[Tom]
<i>And, once again,</i>

276
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:15,206
<i>I got caught up in shit</i>
<i>that's beyond trippy.</i>

277
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,673
We're so screwed.

278
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:18,906
Please tell me
this is a nightmare.

279
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
[sarcastically] Oh, great.
They're all Saika zombies.

280
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,640
Hey, wait.
You know what's with 'em?

281
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,140
I'm Kine.

282
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:27,240
[thinking]
<i>Kine? Isn't he ex-Awakusu?</i>

283
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm Tanaka.
What's goin' on out there
is sort of complicated,

284
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:32,840
so I'll give you
the short version.

285
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,373
It's a kind of a hypnosis

286
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:36,240
that forces people
to do what you want.

287
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,740
You're shittin' me!
Then, that means

288
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,106
there's gotta
be someone out there,
who did the hypnotizin'!

289
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,773
You catch on quick, pal.

290
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,173
I know a couple of people
who can do stuff like this,

291
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,340
but I can't think
of a reason why any of them

292
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,073
would wanna surround
a sushi joint.

293
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,906
How 'bout you, boss man?

294
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,740
You got any reason
why someone would wanna
give you trouble?

295
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:56,040
No idea. Maybe they're
after you guys.

296
00:15:56,173 --> 00:16:00,040
No, I'm pretty sure
I haven't pissed off
any hypnotists lately.

297
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:02,040
Maybe you didn't, smart-ass,

298
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,906
but maybe someone
you're tight with did.

299
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,340
You ever think of that?
Oh.

300
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,273
[sighs] Man, I think
I might know some folks
like that, after all,

301
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:18,606
Hey! We have fun
sleepover tonight, <i>da</i> ?

302
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,706
Have plenty firecracker
to go around!

303

Masaomi's a friend of yours.

Oh, well, he's a friend
of yours, isn't he?

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,087
Yeah, but he's also the leader
of the Yellow Scarves,

412
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,687
so that makes him your enemy.

Now, I see what
you're getting at.

414

I can't speak for my brother,

415
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,220
me and my guys
never fought him.

416
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,954
As far as I'm concerned,
we don't hold any grudges
against him.

417
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,654
He's not a friend, or an enemy.
He's just another guy.
