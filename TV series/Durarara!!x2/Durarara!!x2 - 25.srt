[screams]

4
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:09,408
It would be in your best
interest to come quietly.

5
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:12,659
As a matter of fact, I sent
Aoba and the rest of the guys

6
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,367
to attack
the Yellow Scarves today.

7
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,033
[Sloan]
Mother, I have captured Izaya.

8
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,950
[Kasane]
Would you please bring him
to Number Twelve's office?

9
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,742
You've got a penalty round
coming your way.

10
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,283
Bastard!

11
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,742
[singing resumes]

[music ends]

13
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,125
-[Celty] Uh...
-Long time no see!

14
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:06,292
-How you been?
-Walker? And, uh, driver guy?

15
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,874
-Hi, Celty.
-It's been awhile!

16
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:10,417
Well, not really, 'cause we
met up just the other day, huh?

17
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,833
I guess since me and Seiji
are together all day every day,

18
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,708
it feels like it's been forever
since I've seen anyone!

19
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,958
-[Emilia] Why did I buy these?
- [Celty] Seiji and Mika?

20
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,208
Even Namie Yagiri's here.

21
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,375
[Shingen]
Oh, hey there, Celty!
Took you long enough.

22
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,958
How dare you show
your face here!

23
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,624
-It's nice to meet you.
-Who the--?

24
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:31,166
Welcome home, Celty!
I missed you so much today!

25
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,083
You'd think having
all these people hanging out

26
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,166
would help kill the loneliness,
but they don't.

27
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,791
You're the only one
who can do that.

28
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,333
Thank you. You're sweet.
What's going on?

29
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,417
Why is everyone
in our apartment?

30
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,749
Yeah, funny story...

31
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,749
[Shinra narrating]
A storm is brewing.

32
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,542
A sword is drawn.
Nature convulses.

33
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,125
Chaos reigns and--
Oh, never mind.

34
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,916
The point is, once again,
something's brewing
in the city.

35
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,833
Something bad.

36
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:59,208
And caught in the middle is,
you guessed it.

37
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:03,833
Look, I already told you
I don't know her.

38
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,500
-[banging]
-[man] Cut the shit!

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,749
Three days ago, you busted up
her arm real good! Admit it!

40
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:12,874
Now, why the hell would I go
and do something like that?

41
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,708
You should be checking her out,
instead of giving me
the runaround.

42
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,250
[man]
Keep playing cool, tough guy!

43
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone's got their breaking
point, even a thug like you!

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,708
[scoffs]

45
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,583
I hear your little brother's
a big celebrity.

46
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,417
All it'd take is finding
a little dope on him

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,166
and his career goes
right in the shitter!

48
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,874
All right, if I did something
to piss you guys off--

49
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:34,916
You didn't piss us off.

50
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,958
We just want you off the streets
of Ikebukuro for a little while.

51
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:42,749
-That's all.
-Huh? The hell you say?

52
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:46,208
Did that goddamn flea
pay you off to--?

53
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,166
Oh, I get it. That sword's
got you under its spell--

54
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,916
It'd be easy for us
to hang a rap on you.

55
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:55,125
Me and my partner
could beat each other up
and say you did it.

56
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,874
I see.

57
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,375
-If that's how you want it.
-Huh?

58
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:01,333
Believe it or not, I have
a lot of respect for cops,

59
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,041
but you guys?

60
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,583
You're not cops anymore.

61
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:08,542
I'm going to enjoy
taking your asses apart!

62
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,458
-Who the hell--?
-Excuse me.

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,333
How's it going?

64
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,375
I hear you and the Headless
Rider are buddies.

65
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,166
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

66
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,708
Do me a favor if you are.

67
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,458
In the interests
of public safety,

68
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,000
tell it to turn
its goddamn headlight on.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,208
And you can also tell it
to expect a ticket

70
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,000
for no license and no plates.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,125
Could you do that for me,
big guy? Thanks.

72
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:38,000
-Have a nice day. Move.
-What the hell is this? [grunts]

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,791
You want to lose
your badge, officer?

74
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,417
I could hear you guys
down the hall,

75
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,417
talking all kinds of stupid.

76
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,583
I hate ratting out fellow cops,

77
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,833
but you'll be getting a visit

78
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,333
from one of my pals
in Internal Affairs.

79
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,166
-[groans, breathes heavily]
-[chuckles]

80
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,500
-What are you laughing at?
-Hmm.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,375
Next time you see that cop,
you should thank him.

82
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,208
He's the reason
you're still alive.

83
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,916
Come again?

84
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,916
You heard me, guy.

85
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,000
Up until a minute ago,

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,583
I thought this place was full
of possessed dickheads like you.

87
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,624
Now, I know there's
some normal people left.

88
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,542
So, let's go.

89
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,333
Give me all you've got,
'cause I can take it.

90
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,583
[Shinra]
They say, patience is a virtue.

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,244
Good luck with that!

92
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,438
[Mikado]
Are you guys okay?

93
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,438
Oh, they're fine.

94
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:30,272
It takes more than a couple
scratches to get us down.

95
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,896
[growls] Where were you
when it was going down?

96
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:35,021
Yeah, Aoba!
You didn't do shit!

97
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,729
-Yeah!
-What? Listen, I--

98
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:37,980
Come on, guys! Stop fighting!

99
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,063
We're not really fighting.
Just messing around, is all.

100
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,813
It didn't look like it to me.

101
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:48,272
Wait. Didn't you say there was
someone who wanted to see me?

102
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,855
Yeah. He's downstairs.

103
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,147
[Shinra] Could it be another
member of the Dollars?

104
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:56,188
Or maybe it's someone who heard
about Mikado's big purge

105
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,272
and came by to say
they wanted to help.

106
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:02,938
It's okay!
You can let him up now.

107
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,938
I'm Shijima.

108
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,021
How's it going?

109
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:11,563
[Shinra]
Watch your back!
He's a schemer!

110
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:15,063
So? What about the guy
who ran Kadota down?

111
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:18,355
-You find out who did it yet?
-No.

112
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,188
And there's that Orihara prick.

113
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:23,021
I bet Shiki thinks Sloan
can keep him in line,

114
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:26,771
but I don't trust
that Russian son of a bitch.

115
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:27,521
Yeah.

116
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,980
I don't know
what kind of twisty shit

117
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,105
that info broker and your kid
brother are cooking up next,

118
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:34,563
but these Dollars smell
like an opportunity

119
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,272
to score some fast cash.
[chuckles]

120
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:39,855
[Shinra] Ooh, he's definitely
planning something sinister.

121
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:40,604
Scary!

122
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:44,397
Finally, we come back
to my better half: Celty.

123
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:45,646
So, here's what happened:

124
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,147
My stepmom came over
to clean the place,

125
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,313
and then Walker showed up.

126
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:50,896
He said something
about the apartment

127
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,438
being a cool place
for a secret base.

128
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,563
I didn't know
what he was talking about,
so I just let him ramble on.

129
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,896
Anyway, that's when
Seiji and Mika showed up,

130
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,147
looking for a place to crash
for a while.

131
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:03,896
Then, while I was asking
what they meant,

132
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,188
my dad came over
with Egor there.

133
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,521
I was listening to my dad
explain why they were here,

134
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:10,563
and that's about the time
you came home!

135
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,479
Someone tell me
what's going on!

136
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,896
Um, we're putting you out.

137
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:18,188
I think we'll go look
for another place to stay.

138
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:23,646
You always speak calmly
and clearly, no matter what.

139
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:27,188
So, let's have it. What are you
and Mika doing here?

140
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,063
Well, actually--

141
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:31,604
Take your dirty hands
off my Seiji, you no-good
miserable pig!

142
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:32,438
[growling]

143
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:35,147
Relax, Namie. It's plutonic.
Tell me why you're here.

144
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:38,438
-That's my business, not yours!
-[Shinra] Disorganized clutter.

145
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,397
A mix of the good and the bad.

146
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,272
[Mairu]
Hey, where is everybody?

147
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,438
[Kururi]
I know, right?

148
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,479
It's like, every time something
strange happens in town,

149
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,521
all the users in the chatroom
are off doing something else.

150
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:53,604
I don't like feeling lonely.
Come on, let's have fun!

151
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:55,479
-[dings]
-[Aoba]Hey there!

152
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,646
Oh, hello!
Thanks for joining us!

153
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,729
And just in time, too.

154
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,188
Our minds and bodies
were starting to ache
from loneliness.

155
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:05,855
It's a good thing you showed up
when you did, or else we'd--

156
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:08,980
Kururi, Mairu,
do you have a sec?

157
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,604
[Kururi] It must be serious,
if you don't want to discuss it
on the forum.

158
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:14,771
[Mairu]
What's up?

159
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:16,397
[Aoba] It's not
that big a deal, but...

160
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:19,813
you might want to stay away
from Ikebukuro for a while.

161
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,771
Things are getting
kind of hairy around here,

162
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,980
and there's a chance
your brother might
get caught up in it.

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,604
I have a feeling
there'll be people out,

164
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:29,771
looking for you guys.

165
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,646
It sounds to me
like you're mixed up

166
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,646
in whatever's going on
out there, too.

167
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:35,397
Scary!

168
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:36,729
[Kururi]
For the past few days,

169
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,355
I could feel something weird
was going on in the city.

170
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:41,563
I wonder if you're the one
behind it.

171
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,397
And behind Kyohei's
hit and run, too.

172
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:48,313
I'm in so deep now, whether
I did or didn't is irrelevant.

173
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:52,604
If anything, I'm glad
I got to know the two of you.

174
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,521
But, right now,
there's things happening

175
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,729
that I've sort of been
looking forward to.

176
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:59,896
And I want you to know that
if, after the dust settles,

177
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,188
you still want to be friends,

178
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:07,230
um, that'd make me... happy.

179
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,938
[man]
Hey, Sloan. What's going on?

180
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:13,938
[Sloan]
I think he fell down stair
and hit back of head.

181
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:16,272
I take to hospital.

182
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,230
-Maybe we should go with you.
-Nyet.

183
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,230
This, I can handle on own.

184
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,105
Nah, uh-uh.

185
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:24,896
For all we know, you could still
be working for the Awakusus.

186
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:30,230
You might drop him off
on their doorstep
and we wouldn't want that.

187
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,688
[groans]

188
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:39,355
-It's me.
-[car engine starts]

189
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:42,438
I think we got us a lead.

190
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:50,948
[slow footsteps]

191
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,157
-[man] Hold it right there!
-Huh?

192
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,823
-[gasps]
-[groans]

193
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:57,906
-[grunts]
-[groans]

194
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,614
That's not--

195
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:11,614
-I sense Saika.
-[laughs]

196
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:16,823
[Shingen]
I guess tailing Namie was
a good idea after all, eh?

197
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:17,865
Shingen... Kishitani...

198
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:21,948
[growls] What are you
standing around for? Get him!

199
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:23,115
[groans]

200
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,740
[body thuds]

201
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,073
What-- What do you think
you're doing?

202
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:30,323
[Shingen] I told you
this would happen. Remember?

203
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:34,990
"You leave me no choice,
now that you've hurt my boy,"
or something like that.

204
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,364
I said I'd smash
your goddamn face in
and here we are!

205
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,906
[Eijiro]
Crap. I didn't smash
his goddamn face in.

206
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,364
[Egor]
I don't think it matters.

207
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:47,614
[Shingen]
Now, it's my turn to ask you,
what do you think you're doing?

208
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,157
Nebula hasn't gotten
a single report from you

209
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:52,115
on any of your activities.

210
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,740
-[grunts]
-[Egor] Uh-oh. Shingen?

211
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,032
[Eijiro] We should get
while the getting's good.

212
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:01,157
[Shingen] Almost done,
Gas Mask Two and Three!

213
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:02,573
[gasps, groans]

214
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,198
-[Shingen] We'll meet again!
-[coughing]

215
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:08,198
And, when we do,
I hope you've had a chance
to bone up on your skills!

216
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:12,990
The Fiend with Three Masks
only accepts worthy opponents!

217
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,032
There it is, Shinra.

218
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:17,906
I gave the villain who hurt you
a good, sound clobbering.

219
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:19,865
Sure, I could've sued
the pants off that dirtbag,

220
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:23,906
but the last thing
you and Celty need
is the law sniffing around.

221
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:25,823
I think I handled him
pretty good.

222
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,282
I didn't go too overboard.

223
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:29,448
Actually, you sort of did.

224
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,448
Check out what was
on the news yesterday.

225
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:35,656
Looks like this has your dad
written all over it, Dr. K.

226
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:36,906
[man]
This afternoon,

227
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,990
in a residential area
in Shinjuku,

228
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,614
several smoke bombs
were detonated,

229
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:44,282
sending residents into a panic
and snarling traffic.

230
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:47,489
According to eyewitnesses,
three men in white lab coats

231
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,115
were seen fleeing the area
shortly after--

232
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:51,531
[Shingen]
Click! Click! Click!

233
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:55,948
Whoa! Easy, easy! Can't we talk
about this like adults?

234
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,157
[Egor]
Hold on a sec.

235
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,115
Celty, those were
my smoke grenades,

236
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:02,032
so I'm the one
you should be upset with.

237
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,573
I'm sorry. Who are you?

238
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,323
Where are my manners?
My name is Egor.

239
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:09,198
Simon and I go back many years.

240
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:09,906
Really?

241
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:14,323
Dr. K, your dad
is like the coolest dad
in the history of dads!

242
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:15,740
His gas mask is so dope!

243
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,282
Oh, dude, I just thought
of something.

244
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:19,073
What if when he takes it
off at night,

245
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,323
there's a hot girl underneath?

246
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,948
Hot girls with gravelly voices
do it for you?

247
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:25,073
My first wife, Shinra's mom,

248
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,740
she and I would
swap clothes sometimes.

249
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,614
True story!

250
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,406
It must be weird
hearing your dad blurt out
his kinks in public.

251
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,781
I love you, but don't ever
mention that again.

252
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:38,157
You want to try swapping clothes
with me sometime?

253
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,781
God, no. That's creepy.

254
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,448
Don't be such a copycat!

255
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,656
When Seiji was a little kid,

256
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,740
he used to wear my hand-me-down
pajamas all the time,

257
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,906
you thieving little bitch.

258
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,073
Hang on. I thought
those were boy pajamas.

259
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:54,198
No, I wore them once
and let the pants out
so they'd fit you!

260
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:55,448
-[Seiji] Oh.
-Ugh.

261
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:59,573
The only normal people here
are that Egor guy and...

262
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,240
whatever the driver's name is.

263
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,698
[Namie and Mika
continue bickering]

264
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,698
Excuse me, there's something
I want to say to you.

265
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,948
I have no intention
of lending an ear

266
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:09,323
to anything you have to say.

267
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,906
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant, "lending an eye."

268
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:14,698
Woman, do you realize
you're in my house?

269
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,282
You stole my head
and I want it back!

270
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:19,698
[chuckles] Ask your boyfriend.
He did help me, after all.

271
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,656
Uh, could we talk
about this later?

272
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,990
Izaya Orihara has my head,
doesn't he?

273
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,073
Tell me now, or else!

274
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,573
Would you just tell her, sis?
I'd like to know, too.

275
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,448
Seiji!

276
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:34,157
[sighs]
All right, fine.

277
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:36,115
I had it the night
I ran away from you,

278
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,157
and I turned it over to Izaya.

279
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:39,948
-Happy?
-Seriously?

280
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,781
I can't tell you exactly
where it is, though,

281
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,406
because he doesn't keep it
in one place for long.

282
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,157
He'd bring it
to the office sometimes

283
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:48,073
and play catch with it,
like a ball.

284
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:51,573
Bastard! You don't treat
someone's head like that!

285
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,823
Who does he think he is?
I'll kill him.

286
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:56,781
Don't talk that way, Seiji.
You have too much to live for!

287
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,656
But if you really want him dead,
I'd gladly go to prison for you!

288
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,573
-What kind of big sister--
-Don't you dare lecture me!

289
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:07,990
You're the one playing house
with the unlicensed doctor
that hid your head!

290
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,157
Point taken.

291
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,990
But, just so you know,
he hasn't escaped my wrath.

292
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,073
If, by wrath, you mean
you smacked him once,

293
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,990
then fornicated
like a couple of animals,

294
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,198
I'm sure you showed him!

295
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:20,698
How did you know?

296
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,489
She's definitely
not an animal in bed.

297
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:25,906
She's more like a little bunny,
all timid and skit--

298
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,740
[choking]

299
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,990
This is not the type of stuff
we talk about

300
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,115
with company around!

301
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:31,573
[Shingen]
Hold on there, Celty!

302
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,240
What exactly do you
and my son do in bed?

303
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,948
-I'm asking as your doctor.
-You and your son are pervs!

304
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:39,990
Excuse me, but what's this
about your head?

305
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,531
Huh?

306
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:44,614
What? You mean,
your body is dating Dr. K here,

307
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:48,240
while at the same time,
your head is dating Izaya?

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,323
How's that possible?

309
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,032
My head and body
have separate minds,

310
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,990
and I promise you,
my head is not dating Izaya.

311
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,073
Not true. Izaya and your head
are madly in love.

312
00:14:58,073 --> 00:14:58,781
Huh?

313
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,906
You'd be much better off
forgetting all about
that trashy flirt.

314
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:02,990
At night, all they do

315
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,781
is talk about how much
they love each other.

316
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,990
Her mouth coos, "Izaya, Izaya,"

317
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,865
while her body lies in bed with
Shinra, doing God knows what!

318
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:11,906
You're such a liar!

319
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:16,531
Oh, stop freaking out. You know
Izaya only cares about humans.

320
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,990
I bet he's playing catch
with it now.

321
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,323
Or maybe putting flowers in it,
like a vase or something.

322
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:22,948
You're not helping at all!

323
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,489
It makes no difference to me

324
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,906
if she's in love
with another man.

325
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:30,448
As long as I'm the last one
she smiles at, I'll be happy.

326
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:31,157
[sighs]

327
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:34,157
I hate hearing that, but your
obsessiveness is so attractive!

328
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:38,656
Don't worry, Seiji. If you want
smiles, I've got tons for you.

329
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:39,906
Shut up, you mangy alley cat!

330
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:44,448
Or I'll rip your damn skin off
and turn you into a shamisen!

331
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,323
Even if you did,

332
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:49,531
as long as I can make beautiful
sounds for Seiji, I'd be happy.

333
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,157
Seiji, you've got the potential
to be a true fan of the arts.

334
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:56,364
If you want, I could loan you
some really kinky doujinshi

335
00:15:56,364 --> 00:16:00,198
about Dullahans and sexy demons
with expanding necks!

336
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:01,698
[Celty]
They make stuff like that?

337
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,614
Hey, would you mind
if I checked some of it out?

338
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,531
Especially the ones
about Dullahans!

339
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,240
Shinra!

340
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,865
You have nothing to worry about.

341
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,198
You know me.
I'm a one-Dullahan man.

342
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:12,531
But, like, maybe those stories

343
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,198
could give us some ideas
for when we-- [yelps]

344
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,032
Sorry, Celty! Ow!
Too tight! Too tight!

345
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,448
-[coughing] Ow!
-[gasps]

346
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,157
[groans]

347
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:24,032
Sorry, I shouldn't be so rough
with you. Are you okay?

348
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, yeah.
It's good physical therapy.

349
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,781
I see how it is, Celty.

350
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,906
Out in the world, you're
a no-nonsense kind of gal,

351
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,656
but, with Shinra,
you act all needy and helpless.

352
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,781
That's going in my non-human
report for Nebula.

353
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:39,614
-Hold it. Report?
-There's a non-human report?

354
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:41,364
Does it have
a centuries-old vampire

355
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,823
with a body
of a cheerleader in it?

356
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:45,073
[Walker] Or how about
a tsundere were-wolf?

357
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:48,406
There's a pedophile vampire,
who loves video games, in it.

358
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,032
There's also
a couple of shape-shifters,

359
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,614
who like to disguise themselves
as gorgeous girls.

360
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:55,573
Where have you been all my life?
This is great!

361
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,614
Listen, if you introduce me
to that vampire,

362
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,240
I'll sell you one half
of my soul!

363
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,448
Then, I can get her to bite me.

364
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,489
Then, I can use
my brand new vampire power

365
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,073
to find the guy
who ran Kyohei over

366
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:06,781
and beat the living shit
out of him!

367
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,198
[Shingen] I'm sorry
for whoever got run over,

368
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:10,573
but I can't introduce you.

369
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:14,198
That's confidential. I'd get
my credentials taken away.

370
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:19,448
Stop making things
more complicated!

371
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:25,032
So, I guess this means
you're a spy for the Awakusus.

372
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:31,198
Not exactly, but you are
in right ball park, malyshka!

373
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,823
[grunts]

374
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,157
-[electricity crackling]
-[groans]

375
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,489
He's not as tough as he looks.

376
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:42,573
He was acting weird,

377
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:45,614
like someone was controlling
him, or something.

378
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,573
That's why he went down so easy.

379
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,032
[Mikage]
You get a look at his eyes?

380
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,282
They looked the same
as those guys Haruna took out.

381
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:54,198
Do you think maybe
she turned traitor on Izaya?

382
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,489
I don't know about that. I ran
a check on this house, though,

383
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:00,406
and it definitely doesn't belong
to the Awakusu Group.

384
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:04,115
What do you think's
going on, Izaya? Get up.

385
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,990
Well, that was fun
while it lasted.

386
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,698
So, when did you realize
I wasn't really unconscious,

387
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:10,531
Mr. Kine?

388
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,906
When Mikage hauled off
and gave you that kick.

389
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,740
I could totally see you
grit your teeth.

390
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,282
Yeah, that took me completely
by surprise.

391
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:20,823
You should be thankful
I didn't put all I had into it.

392
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,906
-You're right. Thank you.
-Well?

393
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:25,656
Sloan was acting
under the influence of Saika.

394
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:29,489
However, neither Anri
nor Haruna were behind it.

395
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:32,948
It was someone else:
Kasane Kujiragi.

396
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:36,115
She's yet another wielder
of Saika.

397
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,531
Can you believe our luck?

398
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,240
The second
we declare war on her,

399
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,614
we manage to find
one of her hideouts.

400
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,990
Not too shabby.

401
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,448
[chuckles]
Here's an idea.

402
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,656
Let's wait for her
to come home.

403
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:52,073
We'll throw her
a surprise party!

404
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:54,364
[Celty] All right,
let me get this straight.

405
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,240
Walker, you,
and whats-his-name the driver

406
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,032
were looking for the person
who ran Kyohei over

407
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,032
and some whacko attacked you.

408
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:01,740
Mm-hmm.

409
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,781
Then, you guys decided to stop
here and lay low for a while.

410
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,865
After all this time,
you still don't know my name?

411
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:07,823
[Walker]
Mmm?

412
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:11,240
-I don't.
-Jeez, it's Saburo! Sa-bu-ro.

413
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,698
Right. Sorry.
As for you, Namie,

414
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:16,740
you say your uncle's
after my head,

415
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,240
and he and the secretary
of some guy called Yodogiri

416
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,282
tried to kidnap you.

417
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:23,573
Seiji and Mika,
you guys got tipped off

418
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,781
that someone wanted
to kidnap you, too.

419
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,198
Actually, Mika was the one
who found out.

420
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:29,865
Yeah, I bugged
Yagiri Pharmaceuticals

421
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,115
and overheard someone
talking about it.

422
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:35,489
-I was so scared.
-[Celty] I can imagine.

423
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:36,531
And tonight, I found out

424
00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:39,032
Izaya's an even bigger bastard
than I thought.

425
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:42,698
I'll beat him senseless
and get my head back!

426
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,990
-But, Celty...
-Don't worry.

427
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,073
I'll figure out a way to get it
without actually touching it.

428
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:50,823
Then, I'll give it
to your dad to hold onto.

429
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,698
I don't care
if he uses it for research.

430
00:19:55,656 --> 00:20:00,240
It's going to be a long time
before I take it back. Decades.

431
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,990
And I'll only take it back
after you're gone.

432
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,698
-Thank you.
-[Emilia] Okie-dokie, then!

433
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:09,323
As a representative
of the Nebula Corporation,

434
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,906
I promise your donation will be
treated with the utmost care.

435
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,823
The board might have
other ideas, pumpkin.

436
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,073
Don't be such a worry-wart!

437
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:20,198
A little sweet-talk and those
suckers will fall for anything!

438
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:26,323
I wonder who the bigger sucker
is: Me or the company?

439
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,364
Okay, Namie,
what's Izaya planning next?

440
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,323
I'm not obligated
to tell you anything.

441
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:35,573
Scratch that,
I'll tell you something
that'll make your blood boil.

442
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:39,489
The pervert in the mask knew
Izaya had your head.

443
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,698
He's known this whole time.

444
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,990
[Shingen]
You think maybe you could've
saved that revelation for,

445
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,948
oh, I don't know,
a more appropriate occasion?

446
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:49,656
I'm too tired to play
these games anymore.

447
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,198
-Besides...
-Hmm?

448
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,073
I'm stuck in a weird spot now.

449
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,781
Should I tell them
what's going down

450
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:58,157
between the Dollars
and the Yellow Scarves?

451
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,157
I don't know.

452
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,364
[Shinra narrating]
Trouble's brewing in Ikebukuro,

453
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:05,364
and smack-dab
in the middle of it,

454
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,157
are the Dollars and Celty.

455
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,656
You guys,
I think I have an idea.

456
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:14,531
Let's team up. You know,
join forces and stuff!

457
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,240
-Well? What do you think?
-What, and be like the Dollars?

458
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,364
Uh-uh, I was thinking

459
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:22,781
we could all pool our resources
and share information.

460
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,073
Mmm, I guess kind of
like a guild?

461
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:29,073
I love it! A guild!
Swords, dragons, fantasy!

462
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:31,781
Next, we should appoint
a leader.

463
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,823
How about it, Celty?

464
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:34,157
-Want to be our leader?
-What?

465
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:36,406
It's not like you'll have
to give orders or anything.

466
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:40,282
You'll be the person
everyone reports to. Sound good?

467
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,614
Wait, report to me? Why me?

468
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:43,906
What are you talking about?

469
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:47,865
Think about it, Celty. You're
tied in to the whole city.

470
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,531
We can come to you
with whatever info we find,

471
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:53,698
and you can be the one
to make sense of it all.

472
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:54,906
Is everyone okay with this?

473
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:57,531
[Shinra]
The woman I love is caught up
in something big,

474
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:00,115
and I'm going to help
get her out.

475
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:04,823
Don't worry, Celty.
I'll be here to help you.

476
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:07,990
All right.

477
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,906
If everyone's fine with it,
so am I.

478
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:13,990
[chuckles]
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're a guild!

479
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,489
[Shinra]
And now, as a team,

480
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:17,282
we have a chance
to get to the person

481
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:19,656
who's responsible
for all of our troubles.

482
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:23,656
Whoever it is,
we're going to get them.

483
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,823
Count on it!

484
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:30,198
[theme song playing]

485
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:59,032
[Shingen]
Let's talk about women
for a second.

486
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,282
All kinds of women.

487
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,240
Suffering women,
powerful women,

488
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,032
warrior women,
sneaky, conniving women.

489
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:09,740
Next time: Bell the Cat.
Women will be women.
