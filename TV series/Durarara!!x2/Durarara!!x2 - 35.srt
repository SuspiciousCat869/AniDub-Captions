is a Dollar.

It gave me
kind of a thrill at first.

139
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:18,904
But, then,
I got bored with it.

140
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,438
And that got me thinking...

141
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,238
"What if I could
turn it into something

be a part of?"

143
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,338
I was so proud
of this thing I made,

144
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,238
and I wanted
to share it with you.

145

What's the point
if it ain't gonna
be around anymore?

146

After the Dollars'
first meeting,

147
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,238
Izaya gave me a warning.

148
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:38,371
He said, even if I escaped
my boring life,

149
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:40,938
it'll all seem ordinary
soon enough.

150
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,471
He was right.

151
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:46,071
The Dollars were ordinary
before I knew it.

152
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:47,738
Sure enough, I was bored.

153

tells you one thing,

155
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,971
then tells someone else
the opposite!

156
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:54,471
Then, he sits back and laughs

157
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:56,138
at how everyone
around him suffers!

158
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,404
I know that's his deal,

159
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,338
but still, even if
he didn't say anything,

160
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,171
I would've gotten bored.
That's just another trick!

161
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:07,038
He makes you think
that you're the one who--

162
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:11,471
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

163
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:15,838
I guess even a guy like you
is afraid of getting shot.

164
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,404
It's my fault.

165
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:21,171
No. I ended up like this
because I chose to.

166
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:23,304
You had nothing
to do with it.

167
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,304
Then why are you
pointing that at me?

168
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:30,338
I don't know.
I guess I haven't thought
this whole thing through yet.

169
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,471
Then what the hell
do you have it for?

170
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,004
You got no business
carryin' that thing around!

171
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:37,338
Throw that thing
in the goddamn river
before you use it!

172
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:41,038
But I already have.
[gasps]

173
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,138
[gasps]

174
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,538
[gasps]

175
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,138
Dotachin!

176
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,604
You're all right! Dotachin!

177
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,138
[grunts]
Yumatchi, let go of me!
Take it easy, Erika!

178
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:13,138
We're gonna perform
an exorcism on you!
Huh?

179
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:16,338
I'm sorry about this, Erika.
It won't hurt at all.

180
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,138
Just a little cut
on your fingertip.

181
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:20,771
[screams]
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,371
Don't deny it!
You're totally infected!

183
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,871
Your red eyeballs
are a dead giveaway!

184
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,804
No, they're contacts!
Contacts!

185
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:28,838
I'm wearing
my red cosplay contacts!

186
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,838
Huh?
Contacts?

187
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:33,004
Can't you tell
by how she's acting?

188
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,538
Let her go already.

189
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:35,738
[moaning]

190
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,138
I swear, you guys...

191
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,638
Way to spoil
the tearful reunion scene!

192
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,338
Sorry we scared you.
Yeah, sorries!

193
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,971
Dude!
... are still coming in,

194
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,538
but here's what
we know so far.

195
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,104
There were two shootings
earlier today.

196
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:49,838
The first happened outside
Ikebukuro Police Station.

197
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:54,238
The second happened
at the entrance to the home
of Doh-gen Awakusu,

198
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:58,038
the head of the powerful crime
syndicate, the Awakusu Group.

199
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,738
What appears to be graffiti,

200
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,871
spray-painted on the wall
next to the entryway,

201
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:05,371
looks to be the work
of a local group
of troublemakers.

202
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:07,171
Police are still
trying to determine

203
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,838
if the two shootings
are related.

204
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,438
Oh, great.

205
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:13,238
Take a guess who
the local troublemakers are.

206
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:16,038
Dollars. They just stepped
in some deep shit.

207
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,038
[Aozaki]
Goddamn it.

208
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,004
I didn't think
he was so off his nut,

209
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,838
he'd pull
somethin' like this.

210
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,604
If he's takin' shots
at his place,

211
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:27,304
it's the same as takin' 'em
at the Awakusu's.

212
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,038
It's my fault
that little shit did this,

213
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:33,838
and now, I get to lose
a couple of fingers over it.

214
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:36,704
Get Mikado and take him
somewheres quiet.

215
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,038
Right.

216
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,438
Sir! Mr. Akabayashi
just showed up

217
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:42,738
and says he wants
to talk to you, alone.

218
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,938
Just what I needed.

219
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,871
This is how
the Dollars ends.

220
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:49,671
Once the word gets out
about the shootings

221
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:52,904
at the police station
and at the Awakusu boss' house,

222
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,138
everyone who's
in the Dollars now, will quit.

223
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,738
No members, no Dollars.

224
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:00,371
And then, it'll become
an urban legend.

225
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:04,171
People are gonna talk about 'em
for years and years and years.

226
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:07,138
And, as the rumors about 'em
pile up, it'll evolve.

227
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,938
And, in the end, the Dollars
will finally become perfect.

228
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,571
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

229
00:12:13,704 --> 00:12:17,404
Shooting up a Yakuza's house
and a police station for that?

230
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,238
Are you gonna stop me?
What do you want to do?

231
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:32,708
I never did a single
good thing for you, did I?

232
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:36,942
Well, right now,
all I want to do is beat
the living hell out of you!

233
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,042
Masaomi...
I'm gonna knock your ass

234
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,842
back to that dumb,
boring, ordinary life
you hate so much!

235
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,008
You're not some legend
like the Headless Rider,

236
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,108
that's for sure!

237
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:48,242
You're Mikado Ryugamine!

238
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,342
A stupid, skinny,
plain-old kid!

239
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:54,075
The same decent, ordinary kid
I used to know!

240
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,842
Nothing ever
gets you down, does it?

241
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,808
I wish I could be like that.

242
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:02,908
I always wanted
to be as strong as you.

243
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,175
No matter how
this ends tonight,

244
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:07,408
no matter if I get
called a coward,

245
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:10,408
I'm gonna prove
I'm anything but ordinary!

246
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,108
[grunts]

247
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:23,708
Jesus! I'm gonna kick
your ass for that! [gasps]

248
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:26,308
[indistinct chatter]

249
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,508
[groaning]

250
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,475
Dude, did you hear
what I just heard?

251
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:33,608
What?
Like a bang.

252
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,208
Who are you?

253
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,908
It's a bigger crowd
than I expected.

254
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,942
I see half
are Saika zombies.

255
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,108
This is great!
I can work with this.

256
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:45,608
What are you doin' here?

257
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,408
[chuckles]

258
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:54,508
[Chikage]
Holy shit. It's Heiwajima.

259
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,942
Don't tell me you called him
to back you up, too.

260
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,608
No, man. He's not
in the Dollars anymore.
Huh?

261
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:07,408
Alrighty,
time to start the show.

262
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,342
Did anyone else hear
a popping noise just now?

263
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,408
Uh-huh, I think
someone fired a gun.

264
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:17,008
Are you sure? All I can hear
is these goddamn bikers.

265
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:27,908
[Kujiragi]
You amaze me.
Huh?

266
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:32,775
I didn't think you would
overcome Saika's influence
so quickly.

267
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:37,308
Oh, you're Kasane
Ku-- Kujiragi!

268
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,608
You're, uh, not gonna
kidnap me again, are you?

269
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:43,542
Not at all. It would
be a waste of time
for both of us.

270
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,608
It's obvious your will
is too strong for Saika
to have control over.

271
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:49,275
Thank God!

272
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,408
I hope that doesn't mean
you're gonna kill me instead.

273
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,775
Actually,
I'm here to apologize.

274
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:57,075
Originally, I thought
you were pretending
to be in love with Celty.

275
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,008
I assumed your father
wanted you to keep her
under observation.

276
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:03,842
But, upon investigating
your situation further,

277
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:07,708
I became convinced
that your feelings
toward her were genuine.

278
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:12,708
As for myself,
I have never experienced
being loved by anyone.

279
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,742
And that gave me an idea.

280
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,708
Instead of waiting for love,
I would seek it out for myself.

281
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:20,975
That's why you kissed me!

282
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:22,875
If you could love
a creature like her,

283
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:24,208
you could love me.

284
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,408
Therefore, I could love you.

285
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,308
I was also jealous.

286
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,608
[gasps]

287
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:33,742
Forgive me
for being blunt,

288
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,475
but do you think
you could love me
as I love you?

289
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:41,775
Sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't return the sentiment.

290
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:46,008
I should be angry,
I mean, after everything
you put me through.

291
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:48,475
But I'm not
and you know why?

292
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:51,642
It's because I have Celty.

293
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:55,475
See, with her, I don't need
anything else in my life.

294
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,475
She's the reason
I can talk to you like this,

295
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,508
the reason I'm happy.

296
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:02,275
I'm who I am
because of her.

297
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,508
That's why
you feel about me
the way you do.

298
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:06,908
Very well.

299
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,842
Hearing you
say it so clearly,

300
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,308
I have to accept it.

301
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:13,208
[grunting]

302
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,742
The kind of love
she and I have,
anyone can have.

303
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,275
Would you like me
to prove it?

304
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,308
A guy like me
and a Headless Rider...

305
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,042
She and I couldn't
be any more different,

306
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:28,508
but even so, the two of us
fell in love, somehow.

307
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,408
You will too, I promise.

308
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:34,708
Until then, it doesn't matter
if it's family, or yourself.

309
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:38,442
The important thing
is to love someone.

310
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:41,242
What a horrible
person you are.

311
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,908
First you reject me,
then you make me
love you more.

312
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,042
[chuckles]

313
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:50,675
By the way, Ms. Kujiragi,
could you do me a little favor?

314
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:54,008
I don't know.
I could've sworn it came
from the building on the left.

315
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:56,908
I'm not 100% sure, though.
[gasps]

316
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,442
[gasps]

317
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,608
[all scream]

318
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,008
That dick!

319
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:05,908
Chill out, Saburo!

320
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,508
[laughing]

321
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,008
It's my lucky day today!

322
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:13,808
The league
of extraordinary assholes!

323
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:14,808
[laughing]

324
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,242
Izumii?

325
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,108
Huh? Izumii?

326
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:20,108
You dye your hair,
or somethin'?

327
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,008
Damn, you sure got skinny.

328
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,108
What's the matter?
Didn't they feed you in juvie?

329
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,475
Aw, shit! Kadota!

330
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,775
I hear you got hit
by a car, man!

331
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:30,508
You look okay to me, though.

332
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:34,675
Hot damn! Looks like I get
to kill you after all!

333
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,308
Uh-uh! I didn't say
you could come out yet!

334
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:41,408
[laughs] Sit tight.
The demolition show's
about to start!

335
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,108
[indistinct chatter]

336
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,808
Your fight's with me,
not with these guys.

337
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,908
What do you think I am,
an idiot?

338
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:50,008
Naw, man, you know
I ain't gonna let anyone go!

339
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,608
Punk bastard.
All right!

340
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:54,008
Yo, Walker!
How 'bout you--?

341
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,742
Hey. What the--?

342
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,408
That little bitch
ain't here. Huh?

343
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,608
Dude! No way,
it's Masaomi's piece of ass!

344
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:05,708
Holy shit, this day's
gettin' better and better!

345
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:10,475
[laughing] What are the odds
I'd run into all y'all tonight?

346
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,808
This is some
straight-up fate shit!

347
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,208
And I got Mikado
to thank for it!

348
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,208
[laughing]
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

349
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:20,442
Oh, that's right!
You don't know shit, do ya?

350
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,375
I ain't the boss
of the Blue Squares
anymore, bitch-face.

351
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,542
What?
You know that little pip-squeak,
Mikado Ryugamine?

352
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,208
He's our boss now,
asshole! [laughing]

353
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,608
I don't believe it.
It can't be true.

354
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,508
[both grunting]
[gun fires]

355
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,575
[groaning]

356
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:42,408
I bet you learned to shoot
reading how-to's online,
didn't ya?

357
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:44,675
I didn't think
you'd fire that thing

358
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,675
unless you had
both hands on it!

359
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,108
[groans]

360
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,108
You idiot!

361
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,242
You wanted us
to be part of this?

362
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,908
What's the goddamn point
if you're not with us?

363
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,008
Yeah, I ran away
from everything,

364
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,308
but Anri's been here
this whole time!

365
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:08,108
You ever think about her?
Ever think about how she feels?

366
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:11,175
And how you're
breaking her heart?

367
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:13,475
It doesn't matter
what I do, or say,

368
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,908
about the Dollars anymore.

369
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,308
So, now, I'm gonna end it.

370
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,642
Wait, what are you--?
[fires gun]

371
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,008
[screams]

372
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,908
What the hell you up to?

373
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,775
No good, as usual!

374
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,708
I just wanted to chat about
a problem called the Dollars.

375
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:27,942
[gasps]

376
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,475
I hear you hooked Mikado up

377
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:31,142
with a little
somethin'-somethin'.

378
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,708
I don't gotta say shit
to you, pal.

379
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,142
Aw, come on!

380
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,042
You don't have
to be like that.

381
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,242
Keepin' all the youngsters
in check's my job.

382
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,308
You know that.
I'll deal with the Dollars.

383
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:45,242
What, are you out
of your freakin' mind?

384
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,308
Let's talk
about your plan, then.

385
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:50,475
You were gonna
use these shootings
as an excuse to ice Mikado.

386
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:54,742
Then, you were gonna get
some punk you picked out
to take his place.

387
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,208
Set yourself up
with a nice new racket.

388
00:19:57,342 --> 00:20:00,175
You don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

389
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:01,975
That kid dishonored
the old man,

390
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,242
takin' pot shots
at his place.

391
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,408
You think I'm gonna let
that shit slide?

392
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:10,442
I hear ya,
but I'd really appreciate it
if you let me handle this.

393
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,275
Why are you protecting
that son of a bitch?

394
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,942
Like you said,
I don't gotta say shit
to you, pal.

395
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,642
[scoffs]
Sir?

396
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,808
We just found out
the bullets were . 22 caliber.

397
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,342
[sighs]
You know what?

398
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:27,308
It looks like you and me
were barkin' up the wrong tree.

399
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:28,608
Huh?

400
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:30,042
The bullets they dug

401
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,508
out of the old man's place

402
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:32,675
and the cop shop

403
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,042
were small caliber.

404
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,008
Not the kinda shit I deal.

405
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,542
[groaning]
Cool, huh?

406
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:43,075
Some American terrorist
designed it years ago.

407
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,975
It fires if you push it
against something.

408
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,142
Handy, huh?

409
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:52,708
Hey, Nasujima?
I think Mikado just used
that gun I gave him.

410
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:56,308
[stammering]
What the goddamn hell
is he doing here?

411
00:20:56,442 --> 00:21:00,908
Are you okay?
[stammering]
He's supposed to be in jail!

412
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,075
Break down the door
of that sushi place

413
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,908
and get your asses in there!

414
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,275
Find the guy
with the dreadlocks
and infect him!

415
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,508
Go on! Go!

416
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,508
I love you...

417
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,308
[grunting]

418
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:14,908

[men murmuring]

425
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:37,508
I hope I didn't keep you waiting
for too long, Mr. Izumii!

426
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:41,908
You bastard!
Ultimate move,
Walker Style, Innocentius!

427
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,708
[screaming]

428
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:45,708
Ashes to ashes!
Dust to dust!

429
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,708
I'm gonna kill you, Walker!

430
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,308
It's now or never, guys!

431
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,408
Go on, get yourselves
out of here, now!

432
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,508
But what about--?
Don't worry,
we can handle 'em!

433
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:57,108
[laughing]
That's a Death Flag
if I ever heard one!

434
00:21:57,242 --> 00:22:01,242
It's okay, we got this.
You go find Mikado
and do what you do.

435
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,408
Okay.

436
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:08,108
[Walker]
You like it crispy?
How 'bout extra crispy?

437
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,475
Hey, they're gettin' aw--
[groans]

438
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:18,608
You shit-heels.
Y'all jacked up my van.

439
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:22,275
So, now, I'm gonna eat
your friggin' souls!

440
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,775
Oh, wow.

441
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,908
I can't believe I did it.

442
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,975
I shot you.

443
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,475
It was so easy,
like nothing.

444
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:34,842
If I can do that to you,
then what's to stop me

445
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:38,075
from shooting
someone else, like Anri?

446
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,475
And, if I can do that,
then I can do worse.

447
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:46,842
I could make everyone
around me suffer!

448
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:49,308
I can't let the Dollars
keep going,

449
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,675
and I can't let
myself, either!

450
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,375
Stop talking like you're--

451
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,075
You can't fix anything
by killing yourself, you pussy!

452
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:04,942
I've been thinking
about how bad I wanted
an extraordinary life,

453
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:07,175
how far I've had to go
to get it,

454
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:10,075
and what I have to do now
to stop my endless searching.

455
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,442
You don't have to do this!
You're being played!

456
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,475
Izaya's been playin' you
from he star!

457
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,075
I swear I'll kill him!

458
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,942
I'll kill him!
I'll make that bastard pay!

459
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:26,942
I swear it!
Even if it takes
the rest of my life!

460
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,442
Thank you. And sorry.

461
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,575
I know this'll sound weird,
but I'm kinda looking forward
to this next part.

462
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:38,175
Like, what if, after I die,
there's something else?

463
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:42,375
Then I'll get to go someplace
I've never seen before.

464
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,275
No! You don't have to!

465
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:46,475
Sorry, I do.

466
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:49,808
[Masaomi]
See what I mean?
Everything's gone to shit.

467
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:51,608
[gun fires]

468
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:55,275
Nobody's sicker of it than me.

469
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,442
[Mikado] The events
that changed destinies

470
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:02,642
and threw the city into chaos
are coming to an end.

471
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,275
We've all changed so much.
Where do we go next?

472
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:08,675
Is there anything left
to go back to?

473
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,142
Next time:
Those Who Meet Must Part.
