what you're doing now?

159
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,565
You don't feel guilty
about it?

160
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,265
No. The only thing I regret

161
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,899
is creating the Dollars
in the first place.

162
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,032
And that's the whole reason

163
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,565
I'm trying
to bring it all down

164
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,332
and reset it
back to that night.

165
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,032
Remember?

166
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,065
<i>That night when I called</i>
<i>that first meeting?</i>

167
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,099
To get it back,
I have to destroy everything

168
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:27,465
that's not essential
to the Dollars.

169
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,265
<i>That's pretty much</i>
<i>all I want to do.</i>

170
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,165
I thought the point
of the Dollars

171
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,032
was that it belonged
to everyone.

172
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,765
So, if you're
claiming ownership,

173
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,365
that makes you nonessential.

174
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,665
<i>You should know me better</i>
<i>by now, Mr. Orihara.</i>

175
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,765
Is that so?

176
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,332
The truth is,

177
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:45,765
I've been nonessential
for quite a while now.

178
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,665
Please, stay away
from both of them.

179
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,565
[laughing]

180
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,365
Don't worry.
I won't do anything.

181
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,199
Believe me, I know
how much they mean to you.

182
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,665
That makes them
just as special to me!

183
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,065
Hold on.
What are you saying?

184
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:01,932
I'm not like
all the other people

185
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,065
who got slashed
willy-nilly by your Saika.

186
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,965
You stabbed me because you
wanted to get into my head
and stop me, remember?

187
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,632
Saika's wasn't
the only voice I heard.

188
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:13,832
There was another voice
talking to me.

189
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,665
It was so weird.

190
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,265
I thought
I'd lost my mind.

191
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,132
And then, after I got Saika
and me back under control,

192
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:23,332
I found out I had
all these new feelings

193
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:24,765
swirling around inside,

194
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,865
feelings for boys
called Mikado and Masaomi.

195
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,765
Boys I'd never met
or talked to before!

196
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,165
-No way!
-Thank God

197
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,199
your feelings for them
were so mixed up.

198
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:37,132
If the same amount of love
I feel for Takashi

199
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:38,732
came whooshing out of you,

200
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,732
my poor little body
would've shattered

201
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,465
into three pieces for sure.

202
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,299
-You know my feelings?
-Yep, every last one.

203
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,665
But don't worry.
They're deep inside me now.

204
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,665
All I want is for you
to take responsibility for it.

205
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,199
I'm sorry about that.

206
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,365
But what do you
want me to do?

207
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,965
-[gasp]
-Simple.

208
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,432
I want to be with Takashi,
and I want you to help me.

209
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,265
Oh. Wait.

210
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,732
Huh?

211
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:09,432
If you do, I'll help you
with your romance!

212
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,965
You see, I used to work
for Izaya Orihara,

213
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,999
so I know all about
those boys.

214
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,232
-You worked for that--
-Uh-oh!

215
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,465
It's pretty obvious
you don't like him.

216
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,932
Did he mess with you, too?

217
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,265
It's funny seeing you
so flustered.

218
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,899
I've never seen
this side of you, Anri.

219
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:28,932
Oh, sorry.
I just realized

220
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,265
I've been talking with you
like you're my friend.

221
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,065
Do you want
to be my friend, Anri?

222
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,232
I'd like us to be friends.
The best of friends!

223
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:40,765
Anri Sonohara.

224
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:43,599
Are Mikado and Masaomi
in danger?

225
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,865
Do you know if Izaya wants
to hurt them or something?

226
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,065
Sorry, I don't know.

227
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,899
But if you think
it's so important,

228
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,532
why don't you use Saika
to find out for yourself?

229
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:54,565
I couldn't.

230
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,032
Too bad.

231
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:57,665
I guess you've changed,
haven't you?

232
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,999
Huh?

233
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:01,165
Remember what you said
when you cut me?

234
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:04,565
You said Saika was lonely
and told me to love her back.

235
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,999
You also said
she isn't something
to be used or contained,

236
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,965
like it was bad manners.

237
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,199
But, right now,
between the two of us,

238
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,765
you're the only one
who's trying to contain her.

239
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:17,165
You are, aren't you?

240
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,265
Well, since you don't
want to use her,

241
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,465
I could take her
off your hands for you.

242
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,299
Give Saika to you?

243
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:29,365
No, I couldn't do that.

244
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:33,799
Oh, that's a shame.
It was such a good offer, too.

245
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:39,499
I'm glad you turned me
down, though.

246
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,599
It's all the reason I need
to fight you now.

247
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:49,799
I mean, even friends fight
to the death once in a while.

248
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:51,365
Right?

249
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,672
[Mikado] <i>The truth is</i>

250
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,205

<i>for quite a while now</i>

251
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,405

<i>This is awesome!</i>

252
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:08,139
<i>He puts all the fools</i>
<i>I've seen up to now to shame!</i>

253
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:10,172
Yes! Congratulations!

254
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,072
You, sir, are a human!

255
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:15,839
Thanks...I think.

256
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:18,505
It wasn't exactly a compliment,
but you're welcome.

257
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,605
See, you can be wishy-washy,
but when you act, you act.

258
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,639
You look unassuming,
but you're so unpredictable,

259
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,739
like one of those ground
bloom flower fireworks!

260
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,339
So, what you're saying is,
in the end, I'm going
to explode and die?

261
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:32,705
Oh, that's not
up to me to decide.

262
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,572
The path you take's
all up to you, my friend.

263
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:37,339
You could end up
at the bottom of the ocean

264
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:39,739
or on a sun-soaked beach
in the Bahamas.

265
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,105
Okay, but what if
I don't want to end up

266
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,505
in either of those places?

267
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,939
-No?
<i>-Going off your analogy,</i>

268
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:49,172
I pretty much want to stand
at the water's edge.

269
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:52,972
What I mean is, whether I choose
to live a normal life

270
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,172
or stay a Dollar, either way,

271
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,339
I know I'm going to get
bored eventually.

272
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,172
In the end, I think
what I really want

273
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:02,439
is to be someplace other
than where I'm at now.

274
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,605
I'd like to be in a boat
on the water's edge,

275
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,072
letting the waves rock me
as I sit and stare at the sky.

276
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,472
I guess that's
how I'd put it.

277
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:14,072
[Mairu] <i>He likes watching</i>
<i>from a safe distance--</i>
<i>always from the sidelines,</i>

278
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:15,605
<i>never the center</i>
<i>of attention.</i>

279
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,639
<i>He's the type</i>
<i>who'd start a fire,</i>

280
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:19,472
<i>then sit and watch</i>
<i>as the fire department</i>
<i>puts it out,</i>

281
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,439
<i>which is pretty darn low.</i>

282
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,272
So, basically, what you want
is to sit in the front row,

283
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:26,039
controlling people's
happiness and misery,

284
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,505
playing God.

285
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,272
[Kururi]
<i>He's not God. He's the devil.</i>

286
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,639
Sounds like you're
talking about you, Izaya.

287
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:35,205
Hold on. You were calling me
"Mr. Orihara" before.

288
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,139
-Why'd you stop?
<i>-Sorry.</i>

289
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,739
<i>-Is that a problem?</i>
-No, not at all.

290
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,672
My hobby's observing humans,

291
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:43,872
so I tend to pick up
on stuff like that.

292
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,372
Anyway, I'm relieved.

293
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:47,939
<i>-You haven't changed one bit.</i>
-Huh?

294
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,672
I bet the people
closest to you

295
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,772
are thinking you've
either lost your mind

296
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,139
or you're being
tricked somehow.

297
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:54,339
Is that right?

298
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:56,439
Nothing to be ashamed about.

299
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,272
It happens to the best of us.

300
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,372
I mean, that's what
people are going to think

301
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,339
if you start something
like the Dollars.

302
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,105
And talk about ambition.
With one text,

303
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,905
you got all those
people together

304
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,839
to rise up against
a corporation.

305
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,739
That's both ballsy and crazy.

306

<i>Even with all that twisted</i>
<i>baggage you carry,</i>

<i>a path of normalcy.</i>

308
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,839
Color me jealous!

Yeah, well, after all that,

311
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,239
what do you have in mind
for the Dollars?

312
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:27,872
I don't know what
you're talking about.

313
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,372
You're going to do
the same to us

314
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,005
as you did
to the Yellow Scarves

315
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,472
two years ago,
aren't you?

316
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:38,672
<i>[Izaya laughs]</i>

317
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,539
I didn't think
you'd figure that out,

318
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,839
seeing as you and Masaomi aren't
on speaking terms anymore.

319
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:46,239
I have an offer for you, Izaya.

320
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,939
I'd like you to come
over to my side.

321
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,672
Thanks, but I'll pass.

322
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:53,172
I'm not good at palling
around with people.

323
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,739
I prefer staying
in the background,

324
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:57,439
watching how they react
to unpredictable crises.

325
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,439
Since observing is my hobby,

326
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:02,872
I like creating as many
as I can to pursue it.

327
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,239
I bet.
Like Celty's head.

328
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,939
<i>-Oh, shoot!</i>
-Hmm.

329
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,305
Sorry. I just remembered
why I called you.

330
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,039
Listen, did you happen
to see the news today?

331
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:15,039
No. I only just finished
running an errand.

332
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,505
Why, what happened?

333
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,605
<i>Something you'd be</i>
<i>very interested in.</i>

334
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,005
Huh?

335
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,439
It's better if I don't
try and describe it.

336
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,339
You should just see it
for yourself.

337
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:27,039
I've got to go now.
Thanks for the chat.

338
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,739
Hmm.

339
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:31,505
[thinking] <i>Did Shizu-chan</i>
<i>break out of jail?</i>

340
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,072
<i>How great would that be</i>
<i>if he were shot while escaping?</i>

341
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,039
I see.
So, that's her move.

342
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,272
[laughing]

343
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,439
Meow.

344
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,539
[meowing]

345
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,405
Meow, meow, meow.

346
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,439
[meow]

347
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,439
Meow, meow.

348
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:54,672
[meow]

349
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,039
Uh-oh, Anri. I got ya.

350
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,639
So, now what?

351
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,872
If only you weren't
such a kind-hearted girl.

352
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,905
If you'd killed me quick,
it wouldn't have come to this.

353
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,039
I might have good reason
to cut you, but not to kill you.

354
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:14,572
Funny, that's totally
not the vibe I'm getting.

355
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,939
Listen, whatever
you think you are,

356
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:21,539
you're definitely not human.

357
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:25,139
[thinking]
<i>Have I become one with Saika?</i>

358
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:26,639
What's wrong with you?

359
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,805
What happened to the Anri
who cut me that night?

360
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,872
Am I human still?

361
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,505
Or do you think
I'm a monster?

362
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,572
You're not human
or a monster.

363
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,739
You're a parasite.

364
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,872
That's what you said, remember?

365
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:44,272
Oh. I guess I did. Sorry.

366
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,872
You're right.

367
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,139
I guess, in the end,
I'm not human.

368
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:50,772
But you are.

369
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:54,039
So, if I'm a parasite,
you'll be my host.

370
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,739
You can cut me.
I won't try to resist.

371
00:16:56,872 --> 00:17:00,172
I don't know if what I'm doing
helps Mikado and Masaomi,

372
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:03,005
but I can't think
like a human anymore.

373
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,572
First, though,
I have to ask.

374
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:08,805
If you were me
and you had the chance,

375
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,472
would you save them?

376
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,239
You scared the cats.

377
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,072
This is the first time
I've ever seen

378
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,239
a mother and child
try to kill each other.

379
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,105
And, frankly, it's a nuisance.

380
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,039
Would you mind
taking it somewhere else?

381
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,205
This doesn't concern you.

382
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,205
You know about us?

383
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,805
What the hell? Who are you?

384
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,305
I'll introduce myself.

385
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,539
My name is Kasane Kujiragi.

386
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,705
And what you see
is the original Saika.

387
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,805
[gasp]

388
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,739
[grunting]

389
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,305
There are many reasons
a child defies their mother:

390
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,239
rebellion, independence.

391
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,205
I can relate to both,
I assure you.

392
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:04,705
But this? Baring your fangs
at your mother?

393
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,739
It's beyond disrespectful.
It's immoral.

394
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:12,239
[grunting]

395
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,405
What was that?
What'd you do to her?

396
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,405
I gave her
an electric shock.

397
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,272
The voltage wasn't
enough to kill her.

398
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:25,439
Hang on.

399
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,005
I thought I was
the only one with Saika.

400
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,372
And why does yours look
totally different than mine?

401
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:36,905
What a shame.
You haven't mastered Saika
at all, have you?

402
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,772
Just now, for example.

403
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:40,372
You could've drawn
two Saikas.

404
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:41,905
That's all
it would've taken,

405
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,639
and you could've
overpowered her.

406
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,205
Wait. I can do that?

407
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:48,005
Of course. Don't tell me
you thought Saika

408
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,472
could only take the form
of a Japanese sword.

409
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:51,839
Oh.

410
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,605
I don't know what to do.

411
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,939
I thought I'd found
my freedom at last,

412
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,872
and now I meet you,
of all people.

413
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,672
It seems fate has
other plans for me.

414
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,339
I want your Saika.

415
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,405
Name your price, and I'll
take her off your hands.

416
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,572
But, Ms. Kujiragi, you just
said you already have one.

417
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,605
Yes, I do.

418
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:11,972
Why do you want mine?

419
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,139
Simple. One is
for personal use.

420
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:16,639
-The other is to sell.
-To sell?

421
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:20,405
I have a contract to procure
Saika for a client of mine.

422
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,405
I was planning
to deliver mine to them,

423
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,105
but now that I've met you,

424
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:28,172
not only do you not know
how to control Saika,

425
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:30,905
you aren't controlled by her
like her past owners.

426
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,705
That kind of coexistence
is quite rare.

427
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,305
You don't seem to want her
anymore, so I will buy her.

428
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,472
-Mmm.
-You hag.

429
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,139
What are you going on about?

430
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:43,739
I wouldn't try to move
just yet if I were you.

431
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:47,605
I'm taking her Saika.
You got that?

432
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,305
And, lady, where did you
come from anyway?

433
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,339
You butt into our conversation,
say you want Saika--

434
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,105
I swear,
you're like a thieving cat!

435
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,705
A "thieving cat."
I like it.

436
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,272
You're crazy.

437
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:04,139
All right, then,
we should discuss this further.

438
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:07,605
Shall we find a café
and talk about it there?

439
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,205
Hey, you're Shijima, right?

440
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:13,705
I work for Jinnai Yodogiri.

441
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,572
What's with that getup?

442
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:18,539
Yeah. Well,
I have a few debts,

443
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,072
so I'm trying
to keep a low profile.

444
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:22,905
Call me a coward.
I don't care.

445
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,905
And I don't care if you're
an enemy of Yodogiri's, either.

446
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,172
As long as you're cool with me,
I'm cool with you.

447
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:30,705
Where's all this going?

448
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,272
Jinnai Yodogiri
was in a car accident.

449
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,139
What? That's great! Then--

450
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:37,872
Hold it. That doesn't mean
you're off the hook.

451
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,539
Neither one of us is.

452
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,105
So, here's my pitch.

453
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,172
How would you like
to score some big money?

454
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:45,139
-Huh?
-I want to make a grab

455
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:47,205
for that fortune
Yodogiri's got hidden.

456
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,672
Hold on.
Why should I even trust you?

457
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:52,205
[chuckle] You're right.
I wouldn't trust me, either.

458
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,205
After all, we just met
and everything.

459
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,139
Who's to say I wouldn't
screw you over?

460
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,605
Yeah. Right.

461
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,305
Kyohei Kadota.

462
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,205
Huh?

463
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,939
The big shot in the Dollars?

464
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:04,539
Oh, yeah.
Heard he got hit by a car.

465
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,805
-So what?
-What if I told you

Whoa. No shit?

470
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,905
Nope. In fact, if you
want to know the truth,

471
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,805
I told the driver
to hit him.

Why are you telling me?

Because I want you

Are you going to tell me
your name or what?

00:21:41,272 --> 00:21:43,705
Yeah, of course.
I thought you'd never ask.
