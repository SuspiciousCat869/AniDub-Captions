Not even! I didn't ask you
to get involved, you dick!

00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,658
Huh? Uh!

157
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,724
Holy crap,
you're totally right.

158
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,491
Dude, sorry about that.
My bad.

159
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,458
Whatever. Just get the facts
straight next time.

160
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,791
Like what? Like how you up
and left without telling him?

161
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:19,424
Or how you think kicking
his ass will fix things?

162
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,691
Someone should kick your ass.
That's what I think.

163
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,458
You think I'm not thinking
the same thing?

164
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,058
How come you didn't stop
Mikado when you had the--

No. Forget it.
It's not your fault.

bent out of shape

170
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,824
over the stupidest
little thing?

171
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,558
Well, that's what
you guys are doing now.

172
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,424
-What?
-You heard me.

173
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,158
The problem both you guys got
is you hate being weak.

-[scoff] What do you know?
-That's how it is, man.

175
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:51,791
You think being stronger

176
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,224
is gonna cover up
the fact you're weak,

177
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,891
and he thinks
destroying everything

178
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,558
is gonna cover up
the fact he's weak.

179
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,358
Same stupid problem,
different ways
of dealing with it.

Yeah.

Uh-huh. Like a leech

205
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,658

Really?

212
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,991
Yes. They both saved me,

213
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:19,191
so, in a way, they're kind of
like guardian angels to me.

214
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:22,291
I don't know how
I'll pay them back yet,

Wow, Anri.

You really are
a good person.

-Huh?
-When I came here tonight,

219
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,791
I thought I was going
to have to fight you.

00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,958
-Huh?
-It's true.

221
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,991
And if it turned out
you were in love with Masaomi,

222
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:37,524
I was ready to go toe-to-toe.

223
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,491
I even knew what I was
going to say to you.

224
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,058
"Keep your hands off my man,

225
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,024
you rotten, thieving bitch!"

226
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,424
It's melodramatic, I know,

227
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,991
but that's what I was thinking.

228
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,824
No. Like I said, I--

229
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,391
I have no idea
how to love anyone, so--

230
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:54,291
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

231
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:57,791
I don't think anyone knows
how to fall in love.

232
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,458
It just sort of happens

233
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,224
without you even knowing
it's happening. [chuckles]

234
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,824
That's kind of weird,
don't you think?

235
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,591
But I don't have the right
to fall in love.

236
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,991
-You do.
-[gasp]

237
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:10,958
You call yourself a parasite,
which is weird enough,

238
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:12,591
but even if you were,

239
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,791
it's okay for you
to fall in love with someone.

240
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,391
For example,
I was a puppet.

241
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,091
-Puppet?
-Uh-huh.

242
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,324
I know this one guy in town.

243
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,224
-Izaya?
-[gasp]

244
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,258
[laughing]

245
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,224
I guess that means
you know him, huh?

246
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:30,358
So, did he mess
with you, too?

247
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:31,924
Yeah, sort of.

248
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,491
Sorry about that.

249
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:36,691
So, anyway, I'm his puppet,
or I used to be.

250
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:40,524
Izaya told me to fall in love
with Masaomi, so I did.

251
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,091
And then, I ended up
falling in love for real.

252
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,891
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I follow.

253
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:49,491
I'd have to tell you
about Masaomi's past
to explain it.

254
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:52,458
And he'll be pretty mad
if he finds out I did.

255
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,424
Do you want me to tell you?

256
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,091
I don't know.

259
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:06,224

00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:10,291
Okay, go ahead.
Tell me about him.

00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:12,024
Uh, you sure?

262
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,958
We promised

263
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:15,491
we'd tell each other
all our secrets

264

the day when we got
back together again.

265
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:20,524
But I can't keep running
away from the truth

266
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,991
because of a promise.

[thinking]

268

Still, I'd feel horrible

00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,991
if you break
your promise to him.

270
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,724
So, if he does get mad at you,

00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,858
I'd be happy
to share the blame.

why he cares about you.

he's not gonna pick up.

Of course we can.

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,416
Mm-- But you can't--

311
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,083
Like I said, don't worry.

312
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,850
I'm just buying you
a little time.

313
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:03,216
I'm no dumb-ass. I know
I can't take them on alone.

314
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,350
Hmm? Ah, come on, man.

315
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,983
I'm not trying
nothing shady here.

316
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,483
I just want to help you.

317
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,016
Our fight was a draw,
so we're even now.

318
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,516
What the hell does that mean?

319
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,983
And what happened to you
being my bodyguard, huh?

320
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,616
Yeah, that's not happening.

321
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,850
[growling]

322
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,383
Don't give me that look, bruh.

323
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,183
Come on,
we'd better get moving.

324
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,683
Something bad's coming our way.

325
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:25,250
What do you mean?

326
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:27,183
Even if this fight's
between kids,

327
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,750
if it gets out of hand,

328
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,916
it's gonna end up
on the Yakuza's radar.

329
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,516
Then, the shit will
really hit the fan.

330
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,316
The last thing you want is
the Yakuza getting involved.

331
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,316
Nothing I can do for you then.

332
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,116
[Chikage]
<i>Truth is, it was too late.</i>

333
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,850
<i>They were already closing in.</i>

334
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,550
<i>But I didn't care.</i>

335
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:49,816
<i>Hell, I still had</i>
<i>to pay Kadota back.</i>

336
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,750
Oh, you know what?

337
00:14:57,883 --> 00:14:59,750
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

338
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:00,883
Sure. What's up?

339
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,583
Summer break's done soon.

340
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,616
Did you and the rest of the guys
finish your homework?

341
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,216
Seriously?

342
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,683
Well, yeah.

343
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,316
I'd feel bad
if you didn't get it done

344
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,216
because you were
too busy helping me.

345
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,216
[chuckle]
Don't worry.

346
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,416
We finished that stuff
the first day of the break.

347
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,050
Really? Because if you're
not done, I'll help.

348
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,816
[boy]
Hey! Aoba!

349
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,283
What's wrong?

350
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,150
You need to come
downstairs right now.

351
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:25,150
There's a guy who wants
to talk to Mikado.

352
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,483
Who?

353
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:30,250
It's, uh...
His name's Izumii.

354
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:31,516
Is he alone?

355
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,916
I think.
For now, anyway.

356
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,216
Bastard.

357
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,683
[Mikado]
Izumii. Ran Izumii?

358
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,216
What? I knew you had
an older brother.

359
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,416
[gasp]

360
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,516
[laughing]
Surprised?

361
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,016
I have a pretty decent
info-gathering network, too.

362
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,350
[gasp]

363
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:52,716
I guess you do.
How much do you know?

364
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,650
I know he was the leader
of the Blue Squares

365
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:57,516
and that he fought
the Yellow Scarves,

366
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,283
broke both of Masaomi's
girlfriend's legs,

367
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,516
and got arrested.

368
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,950
Oh, and he's out of juvie now.

369
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,416
[sigh]

370
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,016
If you know all that,

371
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,050
then I guess I don't have
to explain anything.

372
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:11,083
My brother's a dangerous guy,
though, so stay here.

373
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,350
We're gonna go tell him
you went out or something.

374
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,016
[Mikado]
No, send him up.

375
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,750
Maybe he came here because
he's worried about you.

376
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:19,916
Besides, I should
tell him face-to-face

377
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,250
about what I'm planning,

378
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,583
instead of him
finding out from a text.

379
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,250
Uh, but what if he wants
to hurt you--

380
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:26,850
It's fine. And like I said,

381
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,916
he was the boss
of the Blue Squares once.

382
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,650
As the new boss,
I should meet him.

383
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,250
[footsteps]

384
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,616
[chuckle]
Hey, Aoba.

385
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,916
I'm here to say hi
to the boss, like I said.

386
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,349
It would've been nice

387
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,015
if you told me you were
coming over first.

388
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,315
Geez, Aoba. Jealous?

389
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,749
I plan on spending some
quality time with you later.

390
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,349
Hmm?

391
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,415
[chuckle]

392
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,715
[footsteps]

393
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,749
I didn't think
getting a meeting with you

394
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,449
would be so easy.

395
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:16,415
Um, I'm sorry
about your arm.
What happened?

396
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,315
Huh? Oh.

397
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,415
I tripped and fell
down some stairs.

398
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,449
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

399
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:25,215
Um, my name's
Mikado Ryugamine.

400
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,082
I'm having a hard time
picturing you

401
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,715
as the boss
of the Dollars.

402
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,182
Well, actually,

403
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,849
the Dollars don't
really have a boss,

404
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:35,282
so I'm sort of filling in
as the boss of the Blue Squares.

405
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:37,382
Ha! That makes you
the third one

406
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,349
after Aoba and me had a spin.

407
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:42,749
[chuckle]
Fourth, if we count
that dick Horada.

408
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:44,215
But we won't count him.

409
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,415
You okay talking with me
all alone like this?

410
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,282
You don't look
like you can fight.

411
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,815
Maybe you think you can
take me because of my arm.

412
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,749
-Is that it?
-No way.

413
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,382
It wouldn't matter
if both your arms were broken.

414
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:58,315
I wouldn't stand a chance
against you.

415
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,015
Although, if you hurt me,

416
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:03,115
you won't leave this place
alive.

417
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,715
The Blue Squares are some
of the nastiest fighters

418
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,249
-I've ever seen.
-Oh, yeah?

419
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:08,882
So, now,
because you got a gang,

420
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:10,849
-you think you're tough?
-Not me.

421
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,782
I'm still as weak as ever.

422
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,715
That's why I rely on numbers.

423
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:18,715
If you're so weak,
what'cha talking to me
alone for? [gasp]

424
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,582
I'm really sorry about this,

425
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,082
but I don't want you

426
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,815
to be in the Dollars
anymore, Mr. Izumii.

427
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:25,415
What?

428
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,915
I'm in the process
of cleaning up the Dollars.

429
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,015
I'm having Aoba and the guys
kick people like you out.

430
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:32,382
[grunt]

431
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,215
What is this, a freakin' joke?

432
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,015
Because I'm not laughing!

433
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,782
No, it's no joke.
I'm being serious.

434
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,049
Oh, yeah?

435
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:42,149
People like you
terrify me a lot.

436
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:44,115
So much so, in fact,

437
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,515
that I don't really know
how to deal with them.

438
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,615
That's why I'm kicking
all of you out.

439
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,749
[wild laughter]

440
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:52,449
What are you, freakin' nuts?

441
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,615
You gotta be
to talk to me like that.

442
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,115
[laughing]

443
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,249
I gotta hand it to you.
You're totally different

444
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:00,415
than that little
son of a bitch Kida.

445
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:03,282
You've got no idea
what you're doing!

446
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:04,949
Goddamn, you're naive.

447
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,715
Way more than Aoba.

448
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:11,082
So, Mikado, when you say
you rely on numbers,

449
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,982
you're talking
about people, yeah?

450
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:14,582
-Yes.
-[chuckle]

451
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:19,249
You ever think about
relying on something else?

452
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:21,715
[murmuring]

453
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,949
What the hell?
They're not done talking yet?

454
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,682

[wild laughter]

456
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:31,049
Ah.

457
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:33,849
Well, that was fun.

458
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:35,015
Good talking with you.

459
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,415
It was nice meeting you.

460
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,815
And thank you
for coming by to see me.

461
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,749
[chuckling]

462
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,182

[vehicle departs]

464
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:08,374
He just left,
but you won't like who with.

465
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:12,574
Well? You give him
the present, or what?

466
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,174
Yeah, he's got it.

467
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,274
If the cops grab
