Whenever you
tell me about 'em,

00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,859
Well, that and we didn't
have a girl in our group.

155
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,825
You kind of kept
your distance from us.

156
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,159
To be honest, back then,

157
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,525
I didn't really want to have
anything to do with humans.

158
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,859
I bet things would've
turned out differently,

159
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:32,992
if you hung out with us.

160
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,259
Can you imagine?

161
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,859
Us four,
the best of friends?

162
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,759
I hope things work out for
Mikado and his friends, though.

163
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:40,825
I really do.

164
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,325
You jealous of them?

165
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,059
No, not at all.

166
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,159
I've got you in my life,
so I couldn't be happier.

167
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,859
And with an amazing life
like this,

168
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:50,525
what have I got
to be jealous about?

169
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,492
Why'd you have to get
all mushy about it?

[car horns honking]
Um, aren't you guys
afraid of me?

177
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,125
Why on earth
would I be afraid

178
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,159
of a puny
little girl like you?

179
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:24,559
I'm kind of surprised,
but scared? Not so much.

180
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,959
But you should be!

181
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,959
'Cause I'm not human.

[Kyohei]
Seriously?
Yes.

183
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:35,759
I wonder...
What do you think
Celty'd say to that?

184
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:39,825
I mean, she's way less human
than you are, that's for sure.

185
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,859
But, still,
everyone here likes her.

186
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,925
Oh, please.
Speak for yourself.

187
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,292
Come on, sis.
Dial it down.

[gasps]
I-I'm sorry, Seiji.

189
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:51,025
You wanna know why
we're not afraid of Celty?

190
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,725
It's 'cause we know
the kind of person she is.

191
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,759
We've seen what she's done
for us and for others.

192
00:10:56,892 --> 00:11:00,525
What makes her happy and sad.

193
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,059
We're cool with who she is,

194
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:03,859
just like we're cool
with who you are.

195

You seem like a good kid.

196
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:09,759
Besides, you never
gave us any reason
not to trust you... yet.

197
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:13,059
So, go easy on yourself.

Thank you so much.

00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,792

Thank you for saying that.

Come on, you! Stop cryin'.

201

Save that stuff

and Masaomi again. Okay?

I have
an announcement to make!

218
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,225
You are hereby a full-fledged,
official member of our guild!

219
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,692
What guild?
A guild of adventure!

220
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,692
It's something Dr. K whipped up
to get us to work as a team

221
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,225
and fix what's goin' on!

222
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,892
Uh...
What sucks is,
Dr. K got kidnapped.

223
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,825
This mysterious woman
in glasses

224
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,492
shot some wires
out of her hands
and took off with him!

225
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,492
Hang on. Are you talking
about Ms. Kujiragi?

226
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,425
Wait, you know
who Kasane Kujiragi is?

227
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,992
Uh-huh. I talked to her
for a bit. I have her card.

228
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,125
Do you have it on you?
'Cause we could call her!

229
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,925
Oh. I'm sorry, I don't.
It's at my apartment.

230
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,359
Well? Wanna go get it?

231
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,859
Naw, man. We can go
pick it up later.

232
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,659
Getting Erika
is more important now.

233
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,925
[Anri]
Oh! Erika has one, too!

234
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,892
She told her
about her cosplay group.

235
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:03,259
Ms. Kujiragi wants to try it,
so she gave her her card.

236
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,425

I am so screwed. What do I do?
Come on, Erika, think!

239
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,329
What do you have that'll save
the heroine of this story?

240
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:27,929
You've read tons of manga,
so you know there's something
in here you can use!

[Takashi]
Shijima, can you tell
which one's Mikado?

244
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,595
A couple look
about his size,

245
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,162
but they're all wearing
those dumb masks.

246
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,895
Well, we'll have them all
under control soon.

247
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,995
Once we do, they can capture
Jinnai Yodogiri for us,

248
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,529
along with his secretary.

249
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,595
Then, what are you
gonna do with them?

250
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:15,495
If we can get
Yodogiri and Kujiragi
under our control, great.

251
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,895
If not, I'll just
bury 'em somewhere.

252
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,262
[chuckles]
I'll make sure to have
some fun with Kujiragi

253
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,695
before I do, though!

Yes, Mother.

Well, well!

<i>Correct. It's been so long</i>

<i>Would you like to meet?</i>
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

<i>We could catch up</i>
<i>on old times.</i>

273

Where's Haruna?
Is she okay?

274
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,629
Don't worry,
she's standing right here.

275
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:21,929
She calls me "Mother" now.
Isn't that the sweetest thing?

Or, I'll--

I want you to watch those boys
in the masks carefully.

Okay. What for?

296
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,062
If I know Anri
as well as I think,

297
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:10,895
she's going to call Mikado
in the next couple of minutes.

298
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,095
If he is under
one of those masks,

299
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,395
he'll be the one
whose phone starts ringing.

What?

I'm going out to find
the woman I love.

I know she's somewhere
out there in the city.

367
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:23,216
I can feel it.
I have to hurry, though,

368
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,616
because she probably has
her head back by now.

369

You sure? Maybe she
went back to Ireland.

370

I don't think she did.
Why not?

371
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,516
Because the sky's
the same color as her,
that's why.

372
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,683
I can't sit around
cooped up inside,

up there, in that sky.

I envy you. I don't have
happy dreams like that anymore.

What I want
is simple, actually.

376
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,183
I want to keep on loving
the woman I love forever,

377
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,383
and to be with her, forever.

That's pretty much
all I want.

379
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,883
Of course, I want her
to be happy, too,

380
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:03,983
but... not if it gets
in the way of my happiness.

than beating her up.

I hate that it has
to be this way.

387

But, still, I have
to go through with it.

388
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:22,216
Otherwise,
everything I've told her
up to this point will be a lie.

389
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,416
By now, she might have
her old memories back
and she might even kill me,

390

Yeah, but even now,
on a scale from one to ten,

Wow, Mikado!

it's really you.

Well, of course it is!
Who'd you expect?
