00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,753
‐ Thanks.

164
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,341
‐ That's a relief.

165
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,509
I'm glad she came around

166
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,886
and is finally
in better spirits.

167
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
Hold on.

168
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,222
Hey, Celty?

169
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,598
This shadow cocoon thing,

170
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,725
I can't seem to break out of it.

171
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,310
Hey, Celty.

172
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,354
Hello?
Hello?

173
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,480
Are you there?

174
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,150
I can't get out.
[sighs]

175
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,528
And that's how
I got into this situation.

176
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,780
Honestly, I'd like to keep going

177
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,949
so that you know
what happens to Celty and me,

178
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,702
but to do that,
we'll need to rewind a little,

179
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,373
starting with Raira Academy's
opening ceremony two days ago.

180
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,543
There's an eccentric new student
this year...

181
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,253
‐ I'm Mairu Orihara.

182
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,338
That's "Mairu,"
as in "to dance and flow

183
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,798
down a field of origami."

184
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,799
Nice to meet you.

185
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,967
My favorite books to read

186
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,052
are encyclopedias,
manga, and porn.

187
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,847
And I swing both ways
when it comes to love and sex.

188
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,307
But I already have
a male bed partner in mind,

189
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,517
so just forget it.

190
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,768
As for girls,

191
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,145
I can go out
with as many as I want to,

192
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,980
so keep that in mind
when you ask me out.

193
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,481
SHINRA: And another new student

194
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,151
who happens to be
even more eccentric...

195
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,194
‐ I'm Kururi Orihara.

196
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,822
‐ Is there anything else
you'd like to share with us

197
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,823
at this time?

198
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,575
‐ Not really.

199
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,163
SHINRA: And a new student
who seems to have some baggage.

200
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,832
These two
are in the same class again.

201
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,250
[both chuckle nervously]

202
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,462
And they're
class representatives again too.

203
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,678
‐ Hey, Anri!
‐ Excuse me.

204
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,847
You're Mikado, right?

205
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,350
‐ Uh, yeah.
And your name is Kuronuma?

206
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,435
‐ That's right.

207
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,020
Aoba Kuronuma.
First year.

208
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,355
I was surprised when I heard you
introduce yourself.

209
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,150
I couldn't believe
it was really you.

210
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,735
‐ What?
Uh...

211
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,153
‐ Oh, I'm so sorry.

212
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,864
This is actually the first time
we've ever met.

213
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,866
‐ Oh, I see.

214
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,535
Um, then,
why were you surprised?

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,579
‐ You know.

216
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:46,002
It was because
you're a member of the Dollars.

217
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,088
SHINRA: He's not only
a member of the Dollars,

218
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,215
he's also one of the founders.

219
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,925
No way he can answer yes.

220
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,886
‐ What‐‐
what are you talking about?

221
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,013
[phones vibrating]

222
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,516
AOBA: Oh, I finally got it.

223
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,226
It's the Dollars' mailing list.

224
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,019
‐ [gasps]

225
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,066
‐ I'm Wakaba Mark.

226
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,567
‐ But how did you know

227
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,736
I had anything to do
with the Dollars?

228
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,154
‐ You remember
that first meeting

229
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,366
the Dollars had
in front of Hand's Plaza?

230
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,576
I was there!

231
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,745
You know what?
I kind of got the feeling

232
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,497
you were one of the leaders
of the Dollars

233
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,581
or something like that.

234
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,999
‐ You've got it all wrong.

235
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,918
There's no such thing
in the Dollars.

236
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,795
‐ Oh, I didn't know.

237
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,755
But still,
just getting this close

238
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,257
to a member of the group

239
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,675
is pretty exciting.

240
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,969
‐ Don't talk about it too much
at school, okay?

241
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,764
If you could keep it quiet,
that'd be great.

242
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,723
‐ Not a problem.

243
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,058
But could I get a favor from you

244
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,978
in exchange for keeping this
on the down low?

245
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,938
ANRI: An Ikebukuro tour?

246
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,066
‐ Yeah, one of the first‐years
asked me to show him around,

247
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,402
but I'm not that familiar
with the area.

248
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,862
‐ I'm not really either.

249
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,655
‐ I'm still at the point
where I'd get lost,

250
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
even with a guidebook.

251
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,950
‐ That's a serious handicap.

252
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,702
‐ So,
since you two seem like experts,

253
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,037
I was wondering if
you could tell me where to go.

254
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,414
‐ Let me think.

255
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,791
They've got to check out
Anime Café for sure.

256
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,293
‐ You can't say
they've seen it at all

257
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,336
if they missed out
on a visit to Swallowtail.

258
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,880
‐ And there's Namja Town too.

259
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,089
‐ And a real connoisseur

260
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,424
knows about Toshima Hall.

261
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,466
‐ As you can see,

262
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,968
it's probably gonna be tough

263
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,470
getting familiar with all these
places in a short time.

264
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,056
Hey, did you want us
to come along with you?

265
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,974
BOTH: Huh?

266
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,017
‐ Maybe it'd be better

267
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,018
to decide where to go

268
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,227
after we've met this kid.

269
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,645
I mean, we don't have any idea

270
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,314
what kind of stuff they're into.

271
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,733
‐ You guys don't mind?
‐ We don't mind at all.

272
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,943
I'm free,
as long as we go in the evening.

273
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,111
‐ All right, then.

274
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,487
To celebrate
this Ikebukuro tour,

275
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,073
let's sing
a traditional anime song medley!

276
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,617
‐ Pick a theme.
WALKER: Let's go with...

277
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,410
magical girl numbers
from the '90s tonight.

278
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,995
ERIKA: All right!
Book us for two hours.

279
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,622
WALKER: Easy, now.
ERIKA: Whoo‐hoo!

280
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,297
[Erika singing]

281
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,259
‐ Huh?

282
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,429
[gasping]

283
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,224
SHINRA: Every cell in her body
was screaming at her,

284
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,726
"That man is dangerous."

285
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,436
[door opens]

286
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,273
SHINGEN: You're the Sonoharas'
daughter, aren't you?

287
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,192
‐ What?
‐ I remember you.

288
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,403
You're Sonohara's daughter.
Am I wrong?

289
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,615
‐ I'm sorry, are you an old
acquaintance of my parents?

290
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,284
‐ Well,
I guess you could say I was.

291
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,828
Hmm, speaking of which,
how do I put this?

292
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:30,750
I also know about
a sword in your possession.

293
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,878
SAIKA: Oh.
He's my former owner.

294
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,963
I knew I recognized him.

295
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,422
Although he only let me slash

296
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,092
the soul of a bizarre monster
overseas,

297
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,510
and never humans.

298
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,179
SHINRA: The power within her‐‐
Saika‐‐

299
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,307
has uttered curses at her
for a long time.

300
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,226
And recently, it has grown able

301
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,312
to express its thoughts
more clearly.

302
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,274
‐ Excuse me.
Who are you?

303
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,567
Tell me,
what exactly do you know

304
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,568
about me?

305
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,820
‐ Hmm.

306
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,905
It's not an easy question
to answer, miss.

307
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,740
Perhaps I should say,

308
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,285
I know about you
to a certain degree.

309
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,078
Ah, whatever.
Forget it.

310
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,579
I know you're a powerful being,

311
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,331
but I don't think
you should take advantage

312
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,960
of weaker beings like me,
even if you're in trouble.

313
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,420
‐ I don't know
what you're implying.

314
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,382
‐ Here is my answer
to your other question.

315
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,889
‐ Aah!
‐ Forgive the intrusion,

316
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,684
my lovely young lady.

317
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,187
He and I were discussing
some important business.

318
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,733
‐ Excuse me.
I've got to go.

319
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,819
EGOR: The data you gave me
has all the details, correct?

320
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,904
You needn't
explain things further.

321
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,281
SHINGEN:

Come to think of it,

Raira Academy themselves.

You know how they have
skill sets in games, right?

342
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,198
Like how those good at magic
are bad at combat,

343
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,409
or how good fighters
are light on brainpower.

344
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,994
That's how my sisters are.

345
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,163
They're trying to compensate
for their own flaws

346
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,832
by forming
a well‐balanced party.

347

‐ [groans] I don't see
where you're going with this.

348
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,795
‐ It's simple, actually.

349
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,589
Those two deliberately
created personality traits

350
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,174
that were distinctly different.

351
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,343
Even though they're twins,
they each want to have

352
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,012
their own unique identity.

353
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,597
And by doing everything
together,

354
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,849
they think
they're incredibly competent,

355
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,434
deluding themselves
into thinking

356
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,103
they're capable of anything.

357
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,146
‐ Oh?
IZAYA: They chose their style

358
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,565
in grade school
by drawing straws.

Kururi wears gym clothes
despite being terse and gloomy.

360

On the other hand,
Mairu, the younger one,

361
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,323
looks like a bookworm

362
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,700
but acts like
a cheerful chatterbox.

363
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,993
‐ Is there some significance

364
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,870
behind
that contradictory behavior?

365
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,413
‐ Nope.
But for those two,

366
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,332
having looks
that do match what's inside

367
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,210
probably doesn't
hold any significance either.

368
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,629
Because in the end,
they're one person.

369
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,840
They're thinking as long as
all the parts are there,

370
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,049
then there's no problem.

371
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
Anyway, those two stand out,

no matter what crowd they're in.

373

I guess it's no wonder
the aspiring master mind

00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,518
doesn't want to spend much time
with him.

But are they
going to be all right?

377
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,063
If they stand out so much,

378
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,941
won't they wind up being
the targets of bullying?

379

‐ Hadn't thought about that.

380

It's unfortunate
when people get bullied,

You made her happy when you said

00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,751
that she was cuter
than that Tsukiyama girl.

She's kind of lame
the way she's not very athletic

wearing gym clothes, right?

Boys don't usually compliment
her like you did,

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,551

I'm sorry.

I'm sure getting kissed by girls

496
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,197
who aren't even your girlfriend
is kind of a shock.

00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,949
But even though my sister
may seem like the quiet type,

498
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,367
the truth of the matter is

499
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,452
that she's way more aggressive
than I am.

500
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,495
‐ That's not true.

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,375
you can't hog her
all for yourself, okay?

504
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,836
Because Kururi belongs to me,
got it?

Oh, and I should mention,

506

I've already got my heart set
on Yuhei.

Actually, since my sister's
also a huge Yuhei fan,

508
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,096
it's possible that kiss is as
