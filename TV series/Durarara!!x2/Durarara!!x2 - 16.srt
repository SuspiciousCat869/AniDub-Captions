‐ Should've known you'd have
some tricks up your sleeve.

322
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,098
After all, you're friends
with Simon and Dennis.

323
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,935
‐ So, uh, you into
martial arts or something?

324
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,439
'Cause you're
pretty damn strong.

325
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,984
‐ I have studied basic of many
different kind of discipline.

326
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,112
Dennis and Samya,
or rather Simon,

327
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,530
as you call him‐‐

328
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,866
I learn everything
I know from them.

329
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,286
‐ Hmm, well, whatever your
deal is, you're a badass.

330
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:52,373
‐ Comment seems facetious coming
from someone with your skill.

331
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,710
‐ Hmm?
You know about Shizuo's rep?

332
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,255
‐ One cannot help but hear rumor
on streets of Ikebukuro.

333
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,049
TOM: Ain't that the truth.

334
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,552
‐ Now I am closer
to Shizuo Heiwajima...

335
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,514
and closer to discovering
limits of human strength.

336
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,308
However...

337
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,518
SHIZUO: I don't know what kind
of rumors you've been hearing.

338
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,271
But I guarantee
I got nothing on you.

339
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,815
‐ I am afraid
I do not understand.

340
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,359
‐ I didn't train to be this way;
I just am.

341
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,653
It's like being strong
ain't the same

342
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,489
as having real strength.

343
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,284
I think people like you who work
hard and train to be stronger,

344
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,328
they're the ones
who deserve the props.

345
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,497
That takes determination.

346
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,998
‐ That reminds me,

347
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,876
who's that one martial artist
guy you were into?

348
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,503
You know, the weird name guy?

349
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,755
‐ Yeah,
Traugott Geissendorfer.

350
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,757
Man, that guy's something else.

351
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,133
‐ Well, if you ask me,

352
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,385
I think you kick way more ass
than he does.

353
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,804
Hell, if you wanted to,

354
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,680
I bet you could win yourself
a gold medal

355
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,057
in weightlifting easy.

356
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,519
Wait...are gold medals
even made out of gold?

357
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,855
VARONA: Gold medals in
Olympic Games contain real gold,

358
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,024
but they are not solid gold.

359
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,234
It will be too expensive

360
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,694
for economically challenged
host country.

361
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,823
Medals are 92.5% pure silver.

362
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,284
Then it is plated
with 6 grams of gold.

363
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,830
Solid gold was used for
Nobel Prize medals until 1980.

364
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,252
Since then, medals are only
75% gold with pure gold plating.

365
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,879
‐ Why'd they do that
to the Nobel Prize?

366
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,590
‐ Pure gold
extremely soft element.

367
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,968
If you bite,
it will leave mark.

368
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,387
Using alloy instead
prevents damage.

369
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,805
‐ Wow.

370
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,224
‐ You're hot, a badass,
and friggin' smart.

371
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,017
Triple threat, yo.

372
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,394
‐ I disagree.

373
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,437
I am neither pretty nor smart,

374
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,231
nor am I strong.

375
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,191
AKANE: Hey, Shizuo!

376
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,401
‐ Here comes trouble.

377
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,570
‐ Shizuo!
SHIZUO: Hey, Akane.

378
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,947

379
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,407
MAN: Yo, dude, check it.

380
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,992
The rumors about him are true.

381
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,660
MAN: Holy crap, that kid
just hugged him.

382
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,203
MAN: That's Shizuo's kid?

383
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,247
MAN: That's his baby
<i>and</i> his baby mama!

384
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,041
‐ If she's here,
so are Awakusu.

385
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,918
‐ Whoa!
‐ She's so pretty.

386
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,712
‐ Who's your friend?
Can I hug her?

387
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,088
Huh?
‐ Better not.

388
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,965
‐ Thanks so much for yesterday.

389
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,426
‐ [chuckles]
Yeah, sure, it was nothing.

390
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,888
You want to really thank me,
just keep right on smiling.

391
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,474
‐ So Shizuo and Akane
are friends?

392
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,684
‐ I know, right?

393
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,603
‐ So how did you guys
end up together?

394
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,731
‐ Akane just signed up
at Mairu's dojo today.

395
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,942
‐ Yeah? You're taking some
self‐defense classes, huh?

396
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,569
Smart move, kiddo.

397
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,945
Doesn't hurt to learn that.

398
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,572
‐ Wow, you think so?

399
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,199
I'll work really hard.

400
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,742
‐ Hey, you hear about
what happened?

401
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,076
It's all over the news.

402
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,620
SHIZUO: No, what's up?

403
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,496
‐ How does he not know
about it?

404
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
‐ I can correct that.

405
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,791
Izaya was‐‐
TOM: Whoops, sorry, ladies.

We got to get going.
‐ Yeah.

407
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,712
TOM: The next stop's got
a wife and kids.

408
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,880
Might be tricky.

409
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,215
You mind sitting this one out?

410
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,507
‐ I will stay here then.

411
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,092
AKANE: I'll wait
for you, Shizuo!

412
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,469
Hurry back!

413
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,430
[cell phone ringing]
MAN: Hey, it's me.

414
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,806
He just left the girls.
You ready?

415
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,433
MAN: Yeah, yeah, give me a sec,
will ya?

416
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,602
MAN: What are we gonna do
with them high school chicks?

417
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,479
MAN: Screw it, we'll take 'em
with us, too.

418
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,981
‐ Since you're Russian,
I bet you know Simon.

419
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,025
Do you know this other Russian
called Egor, too?

420
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,693
‐ Yes, I know him.

421
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,863
I am surprised a girl like you
would be aware of him, though.

422
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,240
Most unusual.

423
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,784
MAIRU: Wow, small world.

424
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,495
‐ Excuse me, but are you
Shizuo's friend,

425
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,038
or his girlfriend?

426
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,793

427
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,044
and girlfriendship.

428
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,713
We are coworkers,

To test human strength
was only pleasure.
