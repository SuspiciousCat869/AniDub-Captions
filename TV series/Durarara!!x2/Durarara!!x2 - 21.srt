00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,159
because you got pushed
down some stairs.

157
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,744
How could you not tell me?

158
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,287
‐ I thought I did.

159
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,414
No, on second thought,
you know what, you're right.

160
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,084
I guess I never told you
how I got this thing.

161
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,711
Even now,
after all these years,

162
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,797
I still have mixed feelings
about it.

163
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,923
[bell ringing]

164
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,634
It goes all the way back
to 12 years ago.

165
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,929
I met him on the first day
of school.

166
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,765
Excuse me, do you want to join
the biology club?

167
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,433
I mean,
you want to start one?

168
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,268
[voiceover]
Izaya Orihara.

169
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,104
‐ Sorry, not interested.

170
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,189
‐ Oh, you don't have to be
interested.

171
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,733
Just help set it up.
It'll be fun.

172
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,568
‐ Your name's Kishitani, right?

173
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,862
‐ Call me Shinra.
You're‐‐

174
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,031
sorry, hey,
what's your name again?

175
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,491
‐ Izaya Orihara.

176
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,327
‐ Oh, yeah, that's right.
Orihara, huh?

177
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,037
Like I said,
call me Shinra.

178
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,622
Can I call you Izaya?

179
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,417
‐ Why would you want me to help
start a biology club with you

180
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,293
when you don't even know
who I am?

181
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,546
‐ Well, didn't you hear
what the teacher just said?

182
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,465
To start a club here you need
two or more people to do it.

183
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,051
‐ Yeah, I get that,
but why me?

184
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,096
‐ 'Cause you like observing
living creatures, that's why.

185
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,514
‐ Huh?
‐ Remember,

186
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,141
when you introduced yourself?

187
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,644
You told the class you like
to observe all kinds of people.

188
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,772
‐ So what does that have to do
with a biology club?

189
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,649
‐ Aren't humans
living creatures?

190
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,320
‐ Uh‐‐whatever. I still don't
want to start a stupid club.

191
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,157
‐ All right then.
If you say so.

192
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,200
But I'm gonna ask you again
tomorrow.

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,828
‐ Don't bother.
My answer tomorrow's gonna be

194
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,163
the same as it is today.

195
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,665
‐ Then how about the day after?
‐ Same answer.

196
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,001
‐ Come on, please?
I'll let you be the president.

197
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,587
‐ I don't care about being
president of your club.

198
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,255
Why don't you go ask
someone else, like‐‐

199
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,548
I don't know,
one of your friends

200
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,008
from grade school
or something.

201
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,761
‐ Do I look like I have friends?
Yes or no.

202
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,096
[children laughing]

203
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,515
‐ Well, since you put it
that way, no, you don't.

204
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,517
‐ Wrong answer!
‐ [groans]

205
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,353
‐ I have one friend.

206
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,521
‐ Huh?

207
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,148
‐ He's at a different school
though,

208
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,691
so he doesn't count.

209
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,068
Maybe I'll make some here.

210
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
‐ Sorry to be the one
to break this to you,

211
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,571
but I highly doubt that.

212
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,114
I'm sure if you look
hard enough,

213
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,784
you'll find someone else
who's into biology junk.

214
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,036
‐ Yeah, maybe, I guess,

215
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,663
but if I find someone
and they really like biology,

216
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,499
that's not gonna work for me.

217
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,834
I don't want to have to do
projects all the time,

218
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,835
know what I mean?

219
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,087
‐ I'm confused.

220
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,297
Do you like biology
or don't you?

221
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,965
‐ Well, if you want
to know the truth,

222
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,550
I don't even want to be
in a club.

223
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,511
The girl I love,
she said, "Shinra,

224
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,929
"you don't have any friends.

225
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,140
Why don't you join a club?"
And here we are.

226
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,350
[laughs]

227
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,727
Anyway, you'd be perfect
for the club.

228
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,270
I don't care that you're
not into it.

229
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,064
In fact,
I like that about you.

230
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,442
Please? We'll have fun
looking for Tsuchinokos.

231
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,321
‐ No thanks. Biology clubs
don't do that anyway.

232
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,867
NAKURA: [voiceover] So Izaya
blew me off and walked away.

233
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,245
I thought that was
the end of that.

234
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,414
But then he started
asking around about me.

235
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,960
I guess he found me amusing
because we were so different.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Unlike him, I didn't seem
interested in people much.

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,926
I guess he was curious about how
someone like me looked at life.

238
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,763
‐ About the club, if I can be
vice president, then I'm in.

239
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,140
‐ Oh! Oh, thank you!

240
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,100
[voiceover]
I was so happy.

241
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,434
That was the start

242
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,479
of the Raijin Junior High
Biology Club.

243
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,981
Then, during our summer break‐‐

244
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,613
SHINRA: I'm expecting
great things from you,

245
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,865
Vice President.

246
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,324
‐ So what you're saying is,

247
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,535
you're not gonna do a thing,
Mr. President?

248
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,621
‐ No, not exactly.
I'll be cheering you on.

249
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,999
We're officially
a two‐member club.

250
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,793
That means you can come up
with your own activities.

251
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,379
What do you say?
‐ 'Kay, then.

252
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,632
If you die here, I propose
to observe how your corpse rots,

253
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,593
then exhibit it
at the cultural festival.

254
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,971
Right. American universities
have research facilities

255
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,431
where they do
that kind of stuff.

256
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,142
They call them body farms.
Pretty creepy, huh?

257
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,561
‐ How do you know that?
‐ My dad does research

258
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,605
for a pharmaceutical company
there.

259
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,482
He tells me all kinds
of cool trivia like that.

260
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,109
I just thought of something.

261
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,945
What are you gonna do
if my body doesn't decompose?

262
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,280
‐ Huh?

263
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,157
‐ Let's suppose you have
a female corpse‐‐

264
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,076
a gorgeous female corpse
with her heart intact,

265
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,495
and say her corpse
doesn't rot.

266
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,581
People would just see
a beautiful corpse,

267
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,335
but what if you saw her
as the love of your life?

268
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,713
And what if you want to find out
how she feels about you?

269
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,423
I mean, she's a corpse.

270
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,301
‐ Well, if you're crazy enough,
I guess you can

271
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,678
fake talking to her
with ventriloquism.

272
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,847
‐ Let's say
this beautiful woman's corpse

273
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,683
that doesn't rot
can also walk around?

274
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,310
In other words,
it went from being

275
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,022
a non‐decomposing corpse
to a non‐decomposing zombie.

276
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,941
If you could talk to her,
do you think

277
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,026
it would be possible
to fall in love with her?

278
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,527
‐ Are you serious?

279
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,571
‐ Suppose all the zombie's
internals are fine,

280
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,366
just the heart stopped,
and suppose you could talk

281
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,868
and joke around with her?
What would that be like?

282
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,204
‐ I guess it'd be the same
as talking to a person

283
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,790
without a heartbeat
and a funny way of walking.

284
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,583
‐ Then it wouldn't be weird
to fall in love

285
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,377
with that zombie, would it?

286
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,045
I mean, if it's normal
to love a human

287
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,674
but abnormal to love a zombie,
what do you do then?

288
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,261
Where do you draw the line?

289
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,221
‐ Well, I don't think
it really matters

290
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,723
who you fall in love with.
It's cool as long as

291
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,309
you don't hurt anyone, right?
‐ Uh‐uhh.

292
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,479
I'd gladly hurt someone,
'cause I love her.

293
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,067
‐ Wow. Seriously?
‐ You know it!

294
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,027
Even back then I loved you
as much as‐‐

295
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,946
[bones cracking]
[groans] Ow.

296
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,656
Without you...
‐ Take it easy,

297
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,324
don't get excited.
‐ Life is just a big, black...

298
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,575
‐ Okay, I get it, I get it.
Easy, it's okay.

299
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,370
‐ Icky hole of despair.

300
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,249
Guess I overdid it.
Sorry for spazzing out.

301
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,501
‐ It's fine,
please just stay in bed.

302
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,963
‐ The next month was
when it happened.

303
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,089
[baseball announcements]
SHINRA: Oh, come on,

304
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,507
we talked about this.

305
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,926
You were gonna stop taking bets
on baseball games.

306
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,720
‐ Stop nagging me.

307
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,555
It's none of your business
anyway.

308
