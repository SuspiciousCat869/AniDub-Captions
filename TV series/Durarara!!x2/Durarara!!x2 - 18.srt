her own destiny.

Ruri Hijiribe was born
and raised in a little town

26

tucked deep
in the Kanto Mountains.

27
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,460
After her father

the family home burned

Then her mother disappeared,

Her mother was a Hijiribe,

feel warm inside, comforted.

50

and at the movies.

53

They represented freedom
and destruction.

54
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,197
And since she lived
in an oppressive home,

she wanted more than anything
to know what they felt like.

After the fire,
Ruri left home to find work.

She apprenticed with
Tenjin Zakuroya,

maybe she could get closer
to her grandmother.

316
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,749
‐ Why can't you
be more like them?

317
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,628
You arrived here
20 minutes late.

318
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,172
‐ Time is relative.
Or something.

319
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,342
Besides, what's 20 minutes
out of the 13 billion years

320
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,593
of the history
of the universe?

321
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,720
Nothing, I tell you!
Nothing!

322
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,390
Then again, what's the saying,
time is money?

323
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,267
Sure, I'll give 'em that,
I guess.

324
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,811
But there's more to life
than money, kids.

325
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,187
Am I right?

326
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,897
I can think of two things,
babies.

327
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,357
Heart and soul.

328
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,401
I've gone off on
another tangent, haven't I?

329
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,862
‐ Yes, and you've wasted
25 minutes.

330
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,531
‐ Then let's get to it!

331
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,791
Now, Mr. Yuhei, would you
please go stand in that corner

332
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,251
and face the wall?

333
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,586
You can listen in
if you'd like.

334
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,879
‐ Of course.

335
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,926
‐ This arrived in the mail
yesterday.

336
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,928
I do not like having
to show it to the star

337
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,431
I'm sworn to protect,
but if it means

338
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,808
we can catch this creep
or kill him or whatever,

339
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,852
we need to make sure
it's legit.

340
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,061
‐ Huh?

341
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,445
[gasps, whimpers]

342
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,155
‐ I was afraid of this.

343
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,490
This thing didn't look fake
like the others we've gotten.

344
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
Sorry to put you
through this, hon,

345
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,662
but you have any idea
who might have sent it?

346
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,123
‐ I do, but first I‐‐

347
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,001
I'd like for Yuhei to take
a look at it.

348
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,882
WOMAN: Shall we start?
ADABASHI: I don't know.

349
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,967
WOMAN: Don't worry,
Mr. Adabashi.

350
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,427
There's no risk.

351
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,972
Once we begin, everyone here
will be an accomplice.

352
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,977
ADABASHI: [gasps]
Incredible.

353
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,188
The wound is closing up
all on its own.

354
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,814
Is she immortal or something?

355
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,192
WOMAN: It's possible,
but I'm not sure.

356
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,611
We haven't been able
to confirm it yet.

357
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,744
‐ Where did President Yodogiri
find this girl?

358
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,248
‐ He only just learned of the
Hijiribes' strange bloodline.

359
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,833
‐ He's a lucky man.
I always said so.

360
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,168
‐ He's not the only one.

361
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,505
Things are looking up
for us now as well.

362
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,257
WOMAN: Until that night,
she had no idea

363
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,301
the blood of a monster
coursed through her veins.

364
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,845
That night she discovered
the real reason

365
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,681
Yodogiri approached her,

366
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,559
the reason he was interested.

367
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,193
‐ Your father
came to see me today,

368
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,529
and he said
he wanted you back.

369
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,697
‐ [gasps]

370
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,907
‐ I asked him to leave
but he wouldn't,

371
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,244
so we took him someplace where
he wouldn't cause problems.

372
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,871
You know what that means,
yes?

373
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,416
It would be in your father's
best interests,

374
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,875
and mine as well,

375
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,504
for you to carry on
as my dutiful product.

[crowd cheering]

377
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,759
WOMAN:
It was easy to verify.

378
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,928
While searching online
for information

379
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,847
on her father's whereabouts,

380
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:22,226
a man told her what he knew,
free of charge.

381
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,022
Her father had been killed
by Yodogiri and his men.

382
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:30,067
She remembers screaming,
and so it was born,

383
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,863
deep in her heart,
the monster.

384
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,740
A demon called Hollywood,

385
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,034
terrifying, homicidal,

386
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,910
bent on revenge.

387
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:47,043
‐ Yuhei, when I tried to tell
you about my past before,

388
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,628
you told me it didn't matter,

389
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,422
that you didn't need
to know about it, but I have‐‐

390

‐ I don't think now is the best
time to tell me about it.

391

‐ [gasps]

392
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,387
‐ You should wait until
you're up to it.

393
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,889
Nothing I say can help you.

394
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,682
You'll have to make peace
with your past.

395
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,769
I can't do it for you.
‐ [gasps]

396

‐ Can I just say
you're the perfect couple!

397
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,151
Here's an idea,
let's put out a photo book

398
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,486
with you guys together!

399
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,862
Yeah, but first things first,

400
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,697
we gotta deal with this photo.

401
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,699
This Jinnai Yodogiri guy,

402
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,743
he sounds nastier
than the rumors say.

403
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,788
Only a dyed‐in‐the‐wool perv
would force an innocent flower

00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,956
like yourself
into performing in some‐‐

405
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,125
some kinky porno.

‐ Huh?

407
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,129
‐ He talks a good game,

408
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,132
but I'm sure he knows
that picture isn't from a porn.

409
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,801
So don't worry about it, okay?

410
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,845
Even though Max
is a selfish, overambitious,

411
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,348
lawbreaking criminal,
I believe underneath it all

412
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,767
he's got your best
interests at heart.

‐ I'm back, but I need
to find out what's going on.

414
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,526
Maybe I should square things
with everyone first.

415
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,028
Uh.

416
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,488
Oh, crap.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

on the spot.

I'm sorry.
‐ No worries!

By the way, how's Mikado
doing these days?

You guys getting along okay?
You kiss him yet?

Oh, no, of course not.

Anyhoo, if you need anything,
give me a shout.

I'm sorry for a while now,

for getting in your way.

We never met.

I'm Masaomi.

That's right.
I remember now.

I deserve it.

But I don't go around
beating up kids.

Celty told me about you

Never mind, it's all my fault.

I should have been paying
