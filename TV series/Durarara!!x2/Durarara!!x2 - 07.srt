It's all about the freedom.

324
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,526
So from that standpoint,

325
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,860
the concept of the Dollars

326
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,487
makes it
an even bigger category

327
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,531
than a color gang
or something like that.

328
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,117
I mean, you couldn't call it
a nation or a tribe,

329
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,994

good guys and bad guys in it.

MIKADO: Right.
IZAYA: Let me show you

331
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,081
what I'm getting at.

332
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,208
Now, hypothetically,
let's say that you wanted

333
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,544
to stop the Dollars
from attacking someone

334

It wouldn't be
the Dollars anymore.

336
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,551
If you can bend the whole group
to your single will,

337
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,137
then it turns into
something entirely different.

338
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,223
You founded the Dollars
as a joke online,

339
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,393
but when members started tagging
and pulling crap in real life,

340
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,937
you wanted to do something
about it, didn't you?

341
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,690

If you really felt that way,

then why would you want
to keep the Dollars going?

345
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,283
It would have been better
to forget about it instead

346
