313
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,281
filled her with
a nameless dread.

314
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,992
Dragging her friends
into something horrible

315
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,079
was the one thing
that scared her the most.

316
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,707
‐ Sorry to call you
out here like this,

317
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,835
but I wanted you to know what's
going on with me right now.

318
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,295
‐ No need to apologize.

319
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,422
I've been meaning
to catch up with you.

320
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,591
‐ Don't think I'm weird,
but talking to you

321
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,176
makes me feel like
I'm in a dream.

322
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,719
It doesn't feel real at all,

323
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,223
like I'm walking around
inside of a movie or something.

324
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,016
‐ You can still
tell the difference

325
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,310
between reality and fiction,
though, right?

326
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,188
‐ I'm not sure
I get what you're saying.

327
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,524
‐ Anri was talking about you
a while ago.

328
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,858
She's worried.

329
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,945
She said you seem
a little too cheerful lately.

330
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,030
‐ Yeah. I guess in a way
I have been.

331
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,033
But I can't help it.
It's fun to be alive.

332
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,493
I know what I wanna do now,

333
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,204
and it feels great
to finally have a purpose.

334
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,540
All my life I was just
going with the flow,

335
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,709
which was fine, I guess...
but I can't go on doing that.

336
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,337
‐ Is that why you're trying
to clean up the Dollars?

337
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,006
‐ You know about that?

338
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,967
It's really
not that big a deal.

339
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,345
I want the Dollars to be perfect
like how it used to be.

340
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,514
That's all I'm trying to do.

341
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,932
‐ But using violence

342
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,976
to kick out the so‐called
troublemakers is wrong.

343
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,062
You can't get rid of all of
them‐‐don't you know that?

344
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,189
Violence never solves anything.

345
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,732
‐ I know it's wrong, Celty,

346
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,068
but I'm doing it
for all the right reasons.

347
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,737
See? It's the same as why
I founded the Dollars.

348
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,824
And that's something
society frowns on too.

349
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,076
‐ Have you heard the rumor
going around

350
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,078
about the Yellow Scarves?

351
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,205
[neon buzzing]
‐ Yeah. I heard.

352
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,708
He's getting the surviving
members back together.

353
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,586
‐ Then you know Masaomi's
gearing up to come after you.

354
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,505
‐ It's better for everyone
you forget I know about that.

355
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,134
And about how me and Masaomi
are leading these gangs and all.

356
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,595
And I'm pretty sure
you know about Anri too.

357
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,929
You know everything.

358
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,514
But please don't tell her
any of this.

359
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,058
See, Anri and I made a promise
a while ago

360
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,144
that when us three
were back together again

361
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,979
we'd talk about
everything that's happened.

362
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,190
‐ But when the Yellow Scarves
come after the Dollars,

363
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,859
and they will,
what are you gonna do?

364
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,444
‐ We're gonna fight, of course.

365
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,820
As a matter of fact,

366
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,447
I sent Alba
and the rest of the guys

367
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,032
to attack
the Yellow Scarves today.

368
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,533
[train wheels rattling]

369
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,452
AOBA: Here we go.
We're about to find out.

370
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,830
how loyal this guy is
to Masaomi Kida.

371
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,874
‐ Tailing them to their hideout
would be easier

372
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,584
than beating the info
out of him.

373
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,711
‐ I don't care if he doesn't
give it up to us.

374
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,173
We need a declaration of war,
and this guy fits the bill.

375
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,800
‐ You did what?
That's insane!

376
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,052
You're insane!

377
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,970
‐ You're overreacting a bit,
Celty.

378
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,889
I'm perfectly sane.

379
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
‐ No, you're not!
Why are you doing this?

380
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,228
Is it because you think the
Scarves are being manipulated

381
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,063
like before?
Well, guess what.

382
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,232
You're the one
being manipulated.

383
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,152
Can't you see Aoba's using you?
How can you trust him?

384
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,072
‐ You got it all wrong.
This isn't about trust.

385
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,740
We have an agreement
between us.

386
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,867
He can use me,
and I can use him.

387
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,327
That's all it is.

388
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,371
Don't take this
the wrong way, Celty,

389
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,831
but you have no idea
how strong the bond is

390
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,167
between Masaomi, Anri, and me.

391
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,503
‐ Don't even give me
that high and mighty crap!

392
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,881
‐ The threads that tie me and
Masaomi together got so twisted

393
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,800
we can't untangle them anymore.

394
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,385
So instead...

395
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,345
the only thing to do is burn 'em

396
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,264
and start all over from scratch.

397
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,059
‐ He's serious about this.

398
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,686
MIKADO: I don't know why
Aoba's pushing

399
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,105
for you to be
the Dollar symbol.

400
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,191
But if you don't want to do it,
that's totally fine.

401
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,318
Whatever you end up
deciding, though,

402
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,738
I'd appreciate it if
you ignored what we're doing.

403
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,283
‐ Shut your mouth
and come with us!

404
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,119
Unless you wanna
get your legs broke.

405
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,871
‐ What the hell are they doing?
They're supposed to follow us.

406
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,956

AOBA: Oh, shit.

410
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,298
Come on, wake up!
We got trouble!

411

‐ [groans]

412
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,842

413
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,885
Oh, well, it's not a big deal.

414
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,305
Did any of our guys get hurt?

415
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,223
Crap.

416
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,641
Naw, just be careful.

417
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,768
‐ So they made a move on us
after all.

418
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,562
That Aoba guy
has got some balls.

419
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,856
‐ No. Mikado might have
ordered it.

420
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,942
‐ No way! Then I guess Mikado
don't know you're our boss.

421
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,652
That wouldn't have happened
if he did.

422
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,071
‐ Even if he knows about me,
he's comin' for us.

423
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,657
I mean, it's only fair.
I know he's their boss,

424
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,826
and I'm still going after
the Dollars.

425
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,744
‐ Mmm.

426
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,579
‐ I'm coming, Mikado.

427
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,665
You're stuck in the middle of
something you can't get out of.

428

I get what that's like,

429
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,379
but I'll dig to the rotten
heart of it to get you out.

433
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,765
‐ I'm sorry about that, sir.
Unfortunately,

434
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,058
we lost track of him yesterday

435
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,685
after we made contact
with Namie Yagiri.

eventually.

It's been a while.

I'm so sorry.

Allow me to introduce myself
again.

I'm Izaya Orihara,

this is a surprise.

I was just talking about you,
you know.

Let me get to the point.

Where is Namie Yagiri?

You see,

You sound stressed.

It seems your boss doesn't wanna
tell me where Namie is.

Would you please tell me?
That is, if you don't mind.

You don't need anyone's

because everyone

‐ As a matter of fact,
no one told me,

483

but after looking at it
from all the angles,

484
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,179
that's the conclusion I came to.

485
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,555
As for the name Kujiragi,

486

I'm thinking
it's not your real name.

Kujiragi and stole her identity.

KUJIRAGI:
I didn't steal anything.

It was a mutual transaction.

Right. So are you going to
tell me where Namie is?

Saika has another way

I like to call it replication.

if you break Saika's blade,

you can make new swords
from the pieces.
