Hello?
Mikado speaking.

IZAYA: Hey there.
It's been a long time, Mikado.

482
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,352
Or should I call you
Taro Tanaka?

‐ Oh, Kanra,
you haven't called in a while.

484
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,232
IZAYA: I just read the chat log.

485
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,611
I heard something about
that Saitama incident myself.

486
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,946
MIKADO: Yeah,
I was just looking into that

487
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,573
to see what I could find out.

488
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,909
It must have been
some new members of the Dollars

489
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,703
going off on their own.
IZAYA: That's my guess too.

490
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,414
So what'll you do?
‐ I'd like to figure out

491
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,417
some way to stop this.
IZAYA: Why?

492
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,253
It's not like the Dollars
ever had a rule saying,

493
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,505
"Thou shalt not pick fights

494
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,507
in other prefectures,"
am I right?

495
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,634
And the whole point is
that you don't have any rules

496
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,552
in the first place.

learn your lesson

00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,473
from that thing with
the Yellow Scarves a while back?

I heard that it created a rift

between you and that
former best friend of yours.
