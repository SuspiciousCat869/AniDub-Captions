1
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,625
- Sara: RALPH WEREC IS HERE.

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:22,166
HE'S OUTSIDE.
THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,291
BUT I'M STUCK ON BOARD THIS SHIP
INSTEAD OF OUT THERE WITH HIM.

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,083
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF EVEN BEING HERE,

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,208
IF I CAN'T GET TO MY BROTHER?

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,250
( grunts )

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,208
YOU READY, EMILY?

8
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,583
BROTHER, I'M COMING FOR YOU!

9
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,041
- ( theme song playing )

10
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,916
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS, RALPH WEREC!

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,625
YOU MADE A MISTAKE COMING HERE!

13
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,333
HE DODGED IT.

14
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,416
NO!

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,125
WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE A STRAIN BUT...

16
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,125
- Carris: ARE YOU OKAY, LOTTIE?
- IS THAT YOU, CARRIS?

17
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,833
- DID YOU GET A GOOD
LOOK AT THAT STRAIN?

18
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,291
- YEAH, WHO'S IT'S REASONER?

19
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,791
- Sara: RALPH! I KNOW YOU CAN
HEAR ME, ANSWER ME!

20
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,583
COME ON, RALPH! ANSWER!

21
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,333
I HAVE TO KNOW.

22
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,375
( grunts )

23
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,708
- LISTEN, WHOEVER YOU ARE,

24
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
IF ANYONE KILLS THAT TRAITOR
IT'S GOING TO BE ME,

25
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,791
SO BACK THE HELL OFF!

26
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- Sara: MOVE, STAY OUT OF THIS.

27
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,708
- HEY, HOLD ON. WAIT!

28
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,750
SARA?

29
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,750
- OPERATOR, IS THE GLOIRE CLOSE
ENOUGH TO GET A CLEAR FIX ON IT?

30
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,000
- YES, GOT IT.

31
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,791
SIR, THE GLOIRE APPEARS
TO BE LOCKED IN COMBAT

32
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,041
WITH A STRAIN-LIKE UNIT

33
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,750
THAT LAUNCHED FROM OUR
SHIP A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

34
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "STRAIN-LIKE".

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,208
IT'S EITHER ONE OF OUR UNITS
OR IT'S NOT.

36
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,333
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

37
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,416
AFFIRMATIVE, IT'S
DEFINITELY A STRAIN,

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,000
BUT I'M NOT RECEIVING OUR
IDENTIFICATION CODE FROM IT.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,000
- ITS ORIGIN IS UNKNOWN?
WHERE THE HELL DID IT COME FROM?

40
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,125
- I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS,
IT CAME FROM THEM.

41
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,458
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED!
MY STRAIN WORKS AWESOME!

42
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,208
WOO HOO! ANYONE COULD
SEE THAT BABY WAS

43
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,791
AS MOBILE AS ANY GLOIRE.

44
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,333
AND TO STILL BE THAT
AMAZINGLY POWERFUL!

45
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
I'M SUCH A GENIUS!

46
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,291
( laughs )

47
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,791
- OH, GREAT, I'M NEVER GOING
TO HEAR THE END OF THIS ONE.

48
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,541
- BROTHER!

49
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,041
( grunts )

50
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,833
- THAT STRAIN SHOWS
INCREDIBLE AGILITY!

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,041
- AND IT EVEN APPEARS TO HAVE

52
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,250
EQUAL FIGHTING
CAPABILITIES TO THE GLOIRE.

53
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,250
- ( rumbling )

54
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,375
- GIVE ME A REPORT!
- TUMOR CONCENTRATION

55
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
SEEMS TO BE ON THE PORT QUARTER,

56
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,041
AND THEY'RE ATTEMPTING
TO ATTACH TO THE SHIP!

57
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,625
- YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE
ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET INSIDE?

58
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,666
- WHAT'S THE SQUADRON'S
CURRENT LOCATION?

59
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,875
- THE TUMORS ARE MOVING TOGETHER
AND BLOCKING THE STRAINS

60
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,416
FROM GETTING CLOSE
TO THE LIBERTAD.

61
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,291
- BUT WHY NOW?
THEY'RE ACTING SO STRANGE.

62
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,875
- STRANGE?
- YES, SIR.

63
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,125
THE ENEMY HAS DEMONSTRATED
THAT THEY HAVE THE FIREPOWER

64
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,625
TO TAKE DOWN TWO ESCORT
SHIPS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,

65
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,375
SO WHY THEN WOULD THEY
GO TO ALL THE TROUBLE

66
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,333
OF ATTEMPTING TO
BOARD THE LIBERTAD?

67
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,958
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS THOUGH
DESTROYING OUR SHIP

68
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,500
IS THEIR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE, SIR.

69
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,375
- BUT WHAT OTHER OBJECTIVE
COULD THEY POSSIBLY HAVE?

70
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,541
- ATTENTION GAMBEES IN
TRENCHES THREE THROUGH EIGHT.

71
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,125
YOU ARE ORDERED TO REMOVE ALL
TUMORS ATTACHED TO THE SHIP!

72
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,625
DO NOT LET THE ENEMY INSIDE!

73
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,458
GOOD, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT,

74
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,208
BUT THE ENEMY IS STILL
MOVING A LOT FASTER

75
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,458
THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

76
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,208
WHAT THE...

77
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
SIR, NOW THEY'RE GATHERING
HERE AT THE BRIDGE.

78
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,750
THE GAMBEE SQUADS WON'T
MAKE IT AROUND HERE IN TIME!

79
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,125
- RAISE AN EMERGENCY
OMNI-DIRECTIONAL LIGHT BEACON

80
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,791
AND CONTACT THE STRAIN SQUADRON!

81
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,541
THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS TO ENGAGE
THE TUMORS ON THE BRIDGE,

82
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,125
AND DESTROY THEM.

83
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,750
- THOSE DAMN TUMORS ARE TRYING
TO GET INSIDE THE BRIDGE!

84
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,875
HOLY...

85
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,708
( screams )

86
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,916
- LOTTIE! COME IN, YOU ALRIGHT?
- I THINK I'M FINE.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,458
- YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE BRIDGE!
- ROGER THAT!

88
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,708
DAMN IT! THEY'RE BLOCKING ME!
I CAN'T GET THROUGH!

89
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,000
- ( all screaming )

90
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:06,875
- NO! ALL HANDS FALL BACK!
EVERYONE GET OUT OF HERE!

91
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
- Dufarge: TRANSFERRING
COMMAND TO THE SUB-BRIDGE!

92
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,791
- GO!

93
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,833
- ( grunts )

94
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,500
- HURRY UP, JAKE,
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!

95
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,458
- YEAH. I THINK
ALL THE STUDENTS ARE EVACUATED.

96
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,125
( grunts )

97
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,375
( screams )

98
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,250
- SEAL THE BRIDGE!

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,166
- THE BRIDGE WAS BREECHED!

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,291
WE WEREN'T STRONG ENOUGH
TO PROTECT OUR OWN SHIP.

101
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,333
- CRAP. I'M NOT ABLE TO
INCREASE ITS OUTPUT!

102
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,541
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO CATCH HIM NOW!

103
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,375
- LOTTIE! THE SHIP'S IN TROUBLE,
WE HAVE TO GO BACK!

104
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,833
- SCREW THAT, DICKON!

105
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,291
I CAN'T RETREAT UNTIL I'VE
PERSONALLY SENT RALPH WEREC

106
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,791
STRAIGHT TO HELL
IN A BALL OF FLAMES!

107
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,708
- COME ON DON'T BE STUPID!
IN YOUR CONDITION

108
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,500
YOU WOULDN'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST HIM,

109
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T
LOOKED AROUND LATELY

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,958
ONLY HALF THE STRAINS
ARE STILL STANDING.

111
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,333
THE LIBERTAD WILL BE DESTROYED
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING.

112
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,250
THOSE OF US LEFT HAVE
GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER

113
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,708
AND PROTECT THE SHIP!

114
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,666
- ( grunts )

115
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,875
- PLEASE, JUST TELL ME WHY.

116
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,958
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU!

117
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,333
( gasps )

118
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,375
- OH, NO YOU DON'T!

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,958
- ( gasps )

120
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,916
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

121
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,416
RALPH, WAIT!

122
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,583
( gasps )

123
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,833
IT'S MY MERCURION!

124
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,750
COME ON, I CAN'T BE
OUT OF ENERGY NOW!

125
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,208
- YOU HAVE TO STOP!

126
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,333
YOU WON'T MAKE IT BACK TO
THE SHIP IF YOU FOLLOW HIM!

127
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,083
THE TUMORS ARE RETREATING, TOO.

128
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,583
GOING AFTER RALPH
WEREC NOW WOULD BE

129
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,500
BOTH STUPID
AND SUICIDAL.

130
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,791
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
I HAVE TO GO.

131
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,125
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY!

132
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,208
LET GO OF ME.
I SAID LET GO! PLEASE!

133
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,333
( grunts )

134
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,333
( screaming ) NO!

135
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,291
- SHE'S A CADET IN THE MOBILE
TROOPS DIVISION, NOT A REASONER.

136
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,083
AND WE HAVE NO RECORD
OF HER BEING ONE

137
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,791
PRIOR TO COMING HERE, EITHER.

138
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,833
- WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW,

139
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
BUT SHE DID SOMEHOW LINK UP

140
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,833
WITH THE MIMIC I'D BEEN PREPPING
FOR THE STRAIN START-UP TEST.

141
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,083
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

142
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,916
YOU CAN'T LINK UP WITH
ANOTHER PERSON'S MIMIC!

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,666
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT SHE DID.

144
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,291
THAT'S WHY I NEED
TO RESEARCH IT.

145
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,083
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THIS GIRL

146
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,166
UNTIL WE FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT WHO SHE IS.

147
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,791
- WELL, NOW, I DON'T THINK...
- ALRIGHT, WE'RE WASTING TIME.

148
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,333
- BYE.
- NOW WAIT JUST A MOMENT!

149
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,916
THERE'S STILL BEEN NO
EXPLANATION FROM YOU

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,416
ABOUT CREATING YOUR OWN STRAIN!

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,541
- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
DETAILS WITH YOU, ISN'T IT?

152
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,708
WELL, I HAVE FAITH YOU'LL
UNCOVER ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW,

153
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,208
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

154
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,708
- ( exhales )

155
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,916
I SUPPOSE HIS BEHAVIOR IS
NOTHING IF NOT PREDICTABLE.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,750
I'M INCLINED TO LET IT SLIDE,

157
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,166
SINCE IT'S LARGELY
THANKS TO HIS STRAIN

158
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,750
THAT WE SURVIVED THE ATTACK.

159
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,208
- ( crying )

160
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,291
- ( gasps )

161
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,041
ALRIGHT!

162
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,958
- I'M SORRY, QUEEN,

163
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,125
BUT ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
IT WAS THAT GAMBEE PILOT?

164
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,500
- HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME!

165
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,791
- IT REALLY WAS HER, DICKON!

166
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,125
WHEN SHE SPOKE I RECOGNIZED
HER VOICE, TOO.

167
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,500
- HEY, ERMY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

168
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,500
- BEATS ME,
I'M JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

169
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,083
- IT'S HER!

170
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,916
- WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY
MAJOR DAMAGE.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,333
I GUESS FUEL CONSUMPTION
IS ITS BIGGEST PROBLEM

172
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,000
SO I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND
DOWNLOAD THE COMBAT DATA.

173
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,458
HUH?

174
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,166
- CAN I HELP YOU?
- SARA CRUZ? I KNOW SHE'S HERE!

175
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,583
WAS IT REALLY YOU?

176
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,791
I'M ASKING IF YOU WERE
PILOTING THE OTHER STRAIN

177
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,125
THAT SHOWED UP OUT THERE?

178
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,166
WERE YOU?

179
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,208
- MMM-HMM.

180
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,625
- ( gasps )

181
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,916
- OH, WHOA.
- BUT THEN WHY?

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,750
WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO HIDE THE
FACT THAT YOU'RE A REASONER?

183
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,916
WHY DID YOU TRANSFER HERE

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,208
PRETENDING YOU WERE
JUST A GAMBIE PILOT?

185
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,250
- I...

186
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,583
- ARE YOU DEAF? I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU WOULD LIE TO US!

187
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,875
ANSWER ME!

188
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,958
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK
JUST DIED IN THAT BATTLE, HUH?

189
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,958
IF THIS STRAIN HAD BEEN
ENGAGED FROM THE START

190
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,083
WE WOULD HAVE HAD FEWER
CASUALTIES, DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

191
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250
- I'M NOT...
- LOTTIE!

192
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,833
THIS STRAIN AND
REASONER ARE TOP SECRET,

193
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,458
AND ONLY A FEW HIGH
RANKING OFFICIALS

194
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,291
EVEN KNOW THEY'RE
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

195
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,541
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT!

196
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,625
- WELL, IT IS A SECRET,

197
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,541
WHICH MEANS THAT
EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO,

198
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,291
SARA COULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

199
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,375
AND BESIDES, WE'D
DETERMINED THAT THIS STRAIN

200
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,875
WASN'T IN COMBAT-READY
CONDITION YET.

201
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,791
SHE ACTUALLY TOOK IT OUT
WITHOUT PERMISSION, TO HELP YOU.

202
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,833
- WAIT, YOU TOOK IT
WITHOUT ASKING?

203
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,666
- YES, AND SHE'S
HANGING AROUND HERE

204
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,875
BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO GET
A LECTURE ABOUT RECKLESSNESS.

205
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,208
- I SEE.

206
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,958
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HADN'T ENGAGED HIM

207
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,083
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

208
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,916
WE PROBABLY WOULD
HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,916
SO THANK YOU.

210
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,208
- AW! YOU'D BETTER WATCH
YOURSELF NOW, GIRL,

211
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,583
HE'S TRYING TO CHARM YOU!

212
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,416
- DICKON, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
- OH, YOU'RE ADORABLE!

213
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,541
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
HIDING ALL THIS TIME, HUH?

214
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,541
IT'S GOTTA BE FATE
THAT WE MET HERE.

215
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,666
I JUST KNOW WE'RE GOING
TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS!

216
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,291
- DON'T FREAK HER OUT, LAVINIA,
SHE JUST MET YOU. JEEZ.

217
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,000
- OH, MARTHA,
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC!

218
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,166
- SO, IF YOU'RE A TOP SECRET
WEAPON OR SOMETHING

219
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,041
DOES THAT MEAN THEY ATTACKED
US TO GET TO YOU AND THE STRAIN?

220
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,750
- DON'T BE STUPID,
I JUST SAID THAT IT'S A SECRET!

221
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,125
LIKE I'D BE DUMB ENOUGH

222
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,666
TO LET THE DEAGUE LEARN
SUCH IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

223
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,458
( gasps )

224
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,333
- WHY ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT ME?
- OH, COME NOW. SERIOUSLY.

225
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,125
- GET OUT, ALL OF YOU!
- All: WHY?

226
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,583
- BECAUSE I SAID SO!

227
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,458
GOOD, THEY'RE GONE. NOW.

228
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,458
LOSING YOUR MIMIC IN AN
ACCIDENT IS UNFORTUNATE BUT,

229
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,375
WELL, IT DOESN'T HELP US
SOLVE OUR PRESENT CONUNDRUM.

230
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,083
- HAVE YOU LINKED TO
ANOTHER PERSON'S MIMIC BEFORE?

231
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,541
- NO.

232
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,625
- THIS IS ALL VERY STRANGE.

233
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,250
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY I WAS ABLE TO DO IT?

234
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,333
- NOPE.

235
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,916
- WHILE WE TRY
TO FIGURE THIS OUT,

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,458
YOU'RE GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED
INTO THE SPATIAL ARMOR DIVISION.

237
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,083
SO UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE YOU'LL
BE UNDER OUR SUPERVISION.

238
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,666
- OKAY.

239
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,958
- AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOUR NEW
QUARTERS WOULD BE RIGHT OVER...

240
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,666
UM, WELL, WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

241
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,916
REMEMBER, DON'T TELL ANYONE
THAT YOU LINKED WITH

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,875
SOMEONE ELSE'S MIMIC, OKAY?

243
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,791
- GOT IT.

244
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,583
- I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

245
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,833
THE MIMIC AND THAT
STRAIN BELONG TO ME.

246
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,208
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

247
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,916
THAT MEANS THEIR REASONER
IS MY PROPERTY, ALSO.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,708
SO WATCH YOURSELF
AND BE CAREFUL.

249
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,333
- OH? WOW, YOUR PROPERTY!

250
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,083
- SHUT UP, CARMICHAEL!
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO DIRTY!

251
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,583
- MELCHI'S BEING A PERV!
- THERE'S NOTHING DIRTY

252
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,708
ABOUT IT!

253
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,000
- RALPH WEREC'S GLOIRE HAS
JUST RETURNED TO THE SHIP, SIR.

254
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,250
- THE MISSION OBJECTIVE
WASN'T ACCOMPLISHED.

255
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,708
SINCE THE TARGET WASN'T SEIZED

256
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,000
HOW SHALL WE PROCEED,
CAPTAIN MEDLOCK?

257
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,750
- OPERATOR MAINTAIN
CURRENT DISTANCE

258
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,000
FROM THE ENEMY AND
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEM.

259
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,625
- UNDERSTOOD.

260
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,458
- CAPTAIN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
IF WE FOLLOW OUR PRESENT COURSE

261
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,208
WE RUN THE RISK OF
MISSING THE RENDEZVOUS

262
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,750
FOR THE NEXT OPERATION.

263
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,041
- AND SHOULDN'T THE ONE SAMPLE
WE HAVE BE MORE THAN ENOUGH?

264
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
- FORGET ABOUT THAT.

265
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,583
RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE
ON THE MERCURION PURITY LEVEL.

266
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,833
WEEREC BELIEVES THAT THE
STRAIN HAS SUFFERED DAMAGE

267
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,541
DUE TO POOR REFINEMENT.

268
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,000
- HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WE USE MERCURION

269
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,375
IN A FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT WAY THAN THE UNION!

270
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,166
OUR EQUIPMENT IS DIFFERENT!

271
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,083
FORGIVE ME BUT
MERCURION IS FUEL,

272
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,625
AND WEEREC'S
INSISTENCE IN USING IT

273
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,708
TO CONTROL A UNIT IS RIDICULOUS.

274
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,291
- I AM WELL AWARE OF YOUR
OPINION, LIEUTENANT COLONEL.

275
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,500
BUT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING

276
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,791
TO UNDERMINE THE OPERATION.

277
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,208
SEND RALPH TO MY QUARTERS.

278
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,541
I WANT TO HEAR HIS
REPORT IN PERSON.

279
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,458
- HMM?

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,416
- I SEE.

281
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,958
SO IT TURNS OUT YOU DIDN'T FIND
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?

282
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,583
- NO.
- HMM.

283
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,125
WHICH MEANS WE'LL HAVE TO
STRIKE AGAIN I SUPPOSE.

284
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,125
- THAT'S TRICKY.
- YES.

285
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,666
- AND YOU FEEL CERTAIN THAT
THERE'S ANOTHER SAMPLE?

286
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,083
- YES.

287
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,083
- I BELIEVE YOU,
BECAUSE IT'S YOU SAYING IT.

288
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,000
BUT I'M CHOOSING TO TAKE
QUITE A BIG RISK WITH THIS.

289
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,791
SO WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO FAIL HERE, YOU SEE?

290
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,500
LET'S GET IT, NEXT TIME.

291
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,333
- Craven: THE BATTLE WAS
OBVIOUSLY UNEXPECTED,

292
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,541
BUT ALL OF YOU DID VERY WELL.

293
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,333
BOTH OF THE ESCORT SHIPS
ACCOMPANYING US WERE SHOT DOWN,

294
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,958
AND REGRETTABLY,

295
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,166
WE LOST OVER HALF
OF OUR INSTRUCTORS

296
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,916
AND CADETS FROM THIS SHIP.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,875
OUR MAIN BRIDGE WAS
DESTROYED AS WELL,

298
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,333
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSFER
CONTROL TO THE SUB-BRIDGE,

299
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,833
SO OUR NAVIGATION
HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED.

300
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,083
IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WHY
THE DEAGUE WOULD ATTACK

301
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,833
A TRAINING SHIP
LIKE THE LIBERTOD.

302
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,250
WE HAVE REASON TO ANTICIPATE
FURTHER ENEMY ATTACKS,

303
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,875
AND HAVE ACCORDINGLY
REDUCED SPEED

304
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,583
AND SET A DETOUR COURSE TO
THE GALL SPACE SUPPLY DEPOT.

305
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,708
WE WILL REPAIR AND
RE-SUPPLY THE SHIP THERE,

306
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,500
AS WELL AS TRANSFER OUR
INJURED CREW MEMBERS AND CADETS.

307
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,166
UNTIL THEN,

308
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,500
I ASK THAT EVERY ONE OF YOU
REMAIN ON CONSTANT ALERT,

309
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,958
AND BE READY TO RESPOND
TO ANY SITUATION.

310
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,000
THAT IS ALL.

311
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,500
( exhales )

312
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,416
IT'S VERY FORTUNATE FOR
US THAT GALL WAS NEARBY.

313
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,333
- TRUE.

314
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,958
BUT SINCE THE PRIMARY
FUNCTION OF THE GSSD

315
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,666
IS THAT OF CIVILIAN SUPPLY,

316
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,875
WOULD IT NOT BE BEST FOR
THE SHIP TO SEEK PROTECTION

317
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,041
AT THE MILITARY POST
ON PLANET BREGMA?

318
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,166
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THEY
WERE ALREADY EXPECTING US?

319
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,500
- PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

320
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,458
I WOULD LIKE ALL UNITS TO
BE READY TO FIGHT BACK

321
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,791
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

322
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,041
- YES, WE WILL MAKE THEM
PAY THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.

323
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
- OH, ARE YOU
MOVING OUT ALREADY?

324
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,000
GOOD. NOW I'LL HAVE THE
WHOLE PLACE TO MYSELF!

325
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,500
- SO THE RUMOR GOING
AROUND THE SHIP

326
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,500
IS THAT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY A REASONER.

327
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,541
- YEAH.

328
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,083
- ( crying )

329
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,000
- ( crying )

330
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,833
BROTHER.

331
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,750
WHO'S THERE?

332
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,916
OH.

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,333
YOU CAUGHT ME AT A BAD TIME.

334
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,583
SO DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID JUST NOW?

335
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,458
- YES, I'M SORRY.
- OH, I DON'T MIND.

336
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,291
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING.

337
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,125
YOU SEE, I HAD AN OLDER
BROTHER WHO WAS A REASONER.

338
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,125
MY ONLY DREAM WAS TO BE
AS GREAT AT IT AS HE WAS,

339
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,541
SO THAT WE COULD FIGHT SIDE
BY SIDE SOMEDAY BUT THEN...

340
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,041
HE...

341
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,166
THEN HE WAS KILLED ON GRABERA.

342
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,333
HE WAS...

343
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,000
HE WAS MURDERED BY THAT
AWFUL TRAITOR RALPH WEREC!

344
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,458
AND THAT'S...
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO...

345
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,791
( sobs )

346
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,083
I'M SORRY.

347
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:56,166
THIS ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN
WHEN I THINK OF MY BROTHER.

348
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,458
DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU
SAW ME CRYING, OKAY?

349
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,791
ARE THEY STILL HARASSING YOU?

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,125
GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE STILL
AS STUBBORN AS EVER.

351
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:24,958
- SARA! IT'S ABOUT TIME!
I SET UP A ROOM FOR YOU.

352
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,708
I CLEARED OUT THAT
STOREROOM OVER THERE.

353
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,458
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT.

354
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:30,916
- ( exhales )

355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,541
EMILY.

356
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,833
- I FIGURED YOU TWO WOULD WANT
TO BE TOGETHER, IS THAT OKAY?

357
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,375
OH, AND I TRIED
TO MAKE HER A DRESS

358
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,250
LIKE THE ONE IN THE
DRAWING YOU LEFT.

359
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,791
I LIKE IT, BUT CHECK IT OUT
AND SEE IF IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

360
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,875
- YES, LOOKS GREAT, CARMICHAEL.

361
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:53,916
- GET SOME REST.

362
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,250
WE'RE GOING TO START
TESTING TOMORROW

363
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,875
AND WE'VE GOT OUR
WORK CUT OUT FOR US.

364
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,916
- OH, EMILY.

365
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I WISH THAT YOU COULD
TELL ME WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

366
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,291
I HAVE SO MANY
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

367
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,416
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE ME?

368
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,750
THE PERSON WE FOUGHT,
THAT MAN IS MY BROTHER,

369
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,458
THE ONLY BROTHER I'VE EVER HAD,

370
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,750
AND I LOVE HIM.

371
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,791
SO MUCH.

372
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
BUT HE'S CHANGED NOW.

373
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,291
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE.

374
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,208
BUT NOW HE'S INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING EVIL.

375
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,291
AND HE'S PULLING
OTHERS INTO IT WITH HIM.

376
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,625
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO DO,

377
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,250
BUT I CAN'T LET HIM
HURT ANYONE ELSE.

378
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,083
ALL I WANT IS FOR HIM TO...

379
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,958
TO BE THE PERSON I KNOW AGAIN.

380
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,208
PLEASE, EMILY, HELP ME.
I MUST STOP RALPH.

381
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,166
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO GET HIM BACK.

382
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,208
I'LL EVEN...

383
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,333
I'LL EVEN FIGHT HIM.

384
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,750
I'LL FIGHT MY OWN BROTHER
AND BRING HIM BACK TO ME.

385
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,166
- ( theme song playing )

386
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

387
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,500
- Sara: I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

388
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,041
I'M NOT EVEN ABLE TO
BE A FRIEND TO ANYONE.

389
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,083
THEN, SPARKS FLY
AS ANGER COLLIDES.

390
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,083
NEXT TIME ON STRAIN,
ENDLESS LOVE AND HATE.

391
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,458
ARE YOU SATISFIED?
