1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,625
- ( siren blaring )

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,083
- Male operator: GAMBEE SIX
TO PLATFORM NINE.

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,125
- GET SOME RETARDANT
ON THAT FIRE.

4
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,833
- SHE'S ABOUT TO
GO UP IN FLAMES.

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,250
LET'S GET THE
PILOT OUT, QUICK.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,750
THE COCKPIT RELEASE
IS MALFUNCTIONING.

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,750
- STAND BACK,
I'VE GOT THE E.M. CUTTER.

8
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,083
- ( buzzing )

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,416
- MEDIC!

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,291
- ( gasps )

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,875
- HURRY UP!
- OKAY.

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,500
- OKAY, THE PILOT HAS MAJOR
HEAD TRAUMA. CHECKING HER PULSE.

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,375
HER PULSE IS WEAK, AT BEST.

14
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,791
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
ARE REQUIRED.

15
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,375
I NEED TO PERFORM
A MANUAL SEAT BELT RELEASE.

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,458
OH, CRAP. WHERE WAS IT AGAIN?

17
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,333
THE SWITCH, THE SWITCH.
WHERE'S THE STUPID SWITCH?

18
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,958
WHERE IS IT? OH, NO.

19
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:59,833
OH. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
HEY, HELP ME. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,250
- DOWN.
- WHAT WAS THAT?

21
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,583
- HURRY BECKY. THE TIME.

22
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,833
- ( bell ringing )

23
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,041
- Ben: THAT'S ENOUGH
CADET BALBOA.

24
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,541
IT'S OVER. CADET CRUZ IS DEAD.

25
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,416
- ( gasps ) NOT AGAIN.

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,000
( crying ) I KILLED ANOTHER ONE.

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,750
- ( theme song playing )

28
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,416
- ( crying )
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,958
I LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

31
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,875
- IT'S ONLY A DRILL, BECKY.
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,708
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. THANKS
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

33
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,666
- SO. WHAT DID YOU TRY
TO SAY TO ME EARLIER?

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,416
- YES, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

35
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,625
I TRIED TO TELL YOU THE SWITCH
IS ON THE LOWER LEFT-HAND PANEL.

36
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,250
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON? GET THAT BODY OUT OF THERE.

37
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,416
- HEY, COME ON ENGINEERING.
PICK UP THE PACE.

38
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,750
- Carmichael: NEXT TEAM MOVE IN.
GO! GO! ARE YOU GUYS EVEN READY?

39
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,666
- Both: YOU, PEOPLE,
ARE MISSING THE BASICS.

40
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,500
PUT OUT THE FIRE, OPEN THE
COCKPIT AND SAVE THE PILOT.

41
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,541
HOW HARD IS THAT?

42
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,291
- I'M SORRY, I ALWAYS PANIC
IN HIGH PRESSURE SITUATIONS.

43
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,750
- LOOK GIRLS,
IT'S A FUNERAL MARCH.

44
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,208
POOR SARA CRUZ
HAS BEEN KILLED IN ACTION.

45
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,833
IF ONLY WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH
FOR THAT TO BE TRUE.

46
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,958
- ( sniggering )

47
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,833
- THIS CONCLUDES THE RESCUE
AND RECOVERY JOINT EXERCISES.

48
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,333
SINCE I OVERSAW THIS
AS THE CHIEF INSTRUCTOR,

49
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,333
I HAVE SOME WORDS
FOR EVERYONE.

50
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,083
( clears throat )
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

51
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,375
ONLY FOUR DAYS HAVE PASSED

52
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,583
SINCE WE TOOK THE TACTICAL
TRAINING SCHOOL'S MOTHER SHIP,

53
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,750
THE LIBERTAD, FROM PORT FOR
THE SUB-LIGHTSPEED EXERCISES.

54
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,541
FOUR DAYS FOR YOU THAT IS.

55
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,791
BUT BACK ON BASION,
AN ENTIRE MONTH HAS GONE BY.

56
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,625
THOSE CADETS WHO STILL HAVEN'T
MASTERED THE DESCENT EXERCISE,

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,833
ARE FALLING WAY BEHIND
THE REST OF THE CLASS.

58
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,208
THE SUB-LIGHTSPEED
EXERCISE IS COMING UP.

59
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,500
YOUR GOAL SHOULD NOT BE
TO SIMPLY PARTICIPATE IN IT,

60
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,833
BUT TO PERFECT IT.

61
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,458
KEEP FOCUSED, ESPECIALLY
SOME OF YOU GAMBEE PILOTS,

62
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,666
WHO SEE THIS AS A GAME.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,875
THAT TYPE OF THINKING
WILL GET YOU KILLED.

64
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,833
- GEE, DO YOU THINK HE
COULD BE REFERRING TO

65
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,166
THE CORPSE STANDING BEHIND ME?

66
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,666
- Jake: HE WAS REFERRING
TO YOU, ISABELLA.

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,208
- ( gasps )

68
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,125
- Ben: THAT IS ALL. DISMISSED.

69
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,791
- ( gasps )

70
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,208
- ( gasps )

71
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,750
- ( footsteps approaching )

72
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,291
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING LOOK.

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,333
ARE YOU TRYING TO START
A NEW FASHION TREND?

74
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,208
SO, ARE THOSE IDIOTS
BACK THERE HASSLING YOU AGAIN?

75
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,875
DID THEY HIDE YOUR CLOTHES
OR SOMETHING?

76
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,708
STOP. I THINK I MAY BE
ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT.

77
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,125
YOU CAN SQUEEZE INTO MY SPARE.

78
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,916
OH, YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT FIT
BETTER IN JESSIE'S UNIFORM.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,416
- ( gasps ) WHY IS IT
HAVE TO BE MINE?

80
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,125
- OH, ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO.
- NO, THANK YOU.

81
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,666
- AH, YOU SURE?

82
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
- THAT GIRL JUST NEEDS TO LEARN
HOW TO LIGHTEN UP A BIT.

83
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,875
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING SUCH
AN EFFORT TO BE NICE TO HER?

84
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,958
EVEN THE OTHER DAY, YOU...

85
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,583
- JESSIE. I'VE BEEN SEEING
A LOT OF MYSELF IN HER.

86
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,666
SO, I'M CURIOUS.

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,500
- YOU ARE? I DON'T KNOW.

88
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,458
- LUCKY ME RUNNING INTO A PRETTY
GIRL STRIPPING IN THE HALL.

89
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,708
- DICKON, HANDS OFF HER.

90
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,291
- HEY, WAS THAT THE GAMBEE PILOT
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

91
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,083
- WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU SPYING?

92
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,291
- I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

93
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,916
THE QUEEN GETTING
THE COLD SHOULDER.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,750
YOU KNOW
THAT'S A RARE OCCURRENCE.

95
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,375
- ( chuckles ) THAT WAS HER
AND HER NAME IS SARA CRUZ.

96
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,833
SHE WAS A LATE TRANSFER.
SHE'S BEEN TRAINING BY HERSELF

97
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,125
AND EVEN GOT PERMISSION

98
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,583
TO TAKE PART IN THE
SUB-LIGHTSPEED BATTLE

99
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
WEEKS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,875
THE GIRL'S GOT GUTS, MAN.
AND I RESPECT THAT.

101
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,125
- SOUNDS LIKE A PRODIGY.
NOT BAD.

102
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,833
- QUIT IT!

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,125
- ( laughing )

104
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,625
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING

105
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,500
COMING IN HERE COVERED
IN BLOOD LIKE THAT?

106
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,625
- DO YOU NOT HAVE ANY RESPECT
FOR YOUR ROOMMATES?

107
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,916
- OBVIOUSLY NOT.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,041
- OH WAIT, SHE PLAYED
A CORPSE, RIGHT?

109
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,041
- FUNNY 'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF
LIKE TALKING TO A CORPSE.

110
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,666
- I THINK IT'D BE
BEST FOR EVERYONE

111
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,458
IF SHE SLEPT IN HER
GRAVE INSTEAD.

112
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,541
- MAYBE SHE'S ACTUALLY A ZOMBIE.
- GROSS.

113
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,666
- HMM.

114
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,208
- ( all sniggering )

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,208
- ( whirring )

116
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,791
- THAT IS NOT WHAT WE
AGREED TO EARLIER, MELCHI.

117
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,958
WHY ARE YOU CHANGING IT?

118
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,833
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP CARMICHAEL?

119
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,041
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE MY WAY'S COOLER.

120
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,541
- WHATEVER.
- YOU'RE NUTS.

121
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,500
- FIX IT, DO IT NOW.
- COME UP HERE AND MAKE ME.

122
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,208
- YOU JERK. HEY, I'M NOT
DONE WITH YOU.

123
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,166
- WHERE'S EMILY?
- THE SAME PLACE SHE ALWAYS IS.

124
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,750
- UM, WHO'S EMILY?

125
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,250
- IT'S THE DOLL WITH
THE MIMIC INSIDE.

126
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,916
HOW CAN YOU STILL
NOT KNOW HER NAME?

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,041
SHE COMES HERE EVERY DAY.

128
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,166
- HMM, I COULD CARE LESS
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE NAME HER.

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,750
AFTER ALL, I'M THE ONE
WHO CREATED HER, REMEMBER?

130
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,458
- HEY HOW'S IT GOING, EMILY?

131
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,208
I HAVE A GIFT. I HOPE
YOU LIKE SURPRISES.

132
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,208
I MADE IT MYSELF.
IT LOOKS CUTE.

133
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,125
- HMM. I DON'T KNOW, SARA.

134
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,375
IT DOESN'T MATCH
HER OUTFIT AT ALL.

135
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,416
- CONTRARY TO WHAT SHE SAID,
I THINK YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

136
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,291
AND SO WHAT IF YOUR
CLOTHES DON'T MATCH.

137
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,250
I'LL JUST MAKE YOU
SOME NEW ONES.

138
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,791
HMM, THERE'S AN IDEA FOR A TOP.

139
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,541
- ( screams ) THAT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK EITHER.

140
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,416
WHY CAN'T THIS THING
SUPPORT A HEAVY LOAD?

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,291
- YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S BECAUSE
YOU KEEP FIDDLING

142
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,333
WITH THE SETTINGS TO INCREASE
THE REACTION TIME.

143
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,958
- THAT'S IT'S BEST FEATURE.

144
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
I CAN'T PUT IT BACK THE
WAY IT WAS BEFORE.

145
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,083
- OKAY. WHY NOT
TEST IT WITH HER?

146
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
YEAH. THAT MIGHT JUST WORK,

147
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,791
SINCE SHE'S NOT
A STANDARD MIMIC,

148
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,541
IT MIGHT OUTPERFORM
A NORMAL UNIT.

149
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,208
- NO WAY.

150
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,375
IN ORDER TO DO THAT I'D HAVE TO
RECONFIGURE THE ENTIRE COCKPIT.

151
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,791
- THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

152
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,500
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET ANYWHERE

153
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,875
IF THAT JALOPY WON'T START?

154
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,166
- IT'LL BE SO AWESOME
IF WE CAN GET IT WORKING.

155
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,541
IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE
THE KEY TO WINNING THE WAR.

156
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,291
- WITH THE KEY WORD BEING "IF".

157
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,500
- Jake: THIS IS THE MOMENT
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

158
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,875
THE SUB-LIGHT SPEED
BATTLE EXERCISE.

159
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,416
NOW, SINCE YOUR GAMBEES
ARE FAR LESS MANEUVERABLE

160
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,375
THAN THE STRAINS,
YOUR UNITS WILL BE USED

161
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,583
AS STATIONARY GUN
BATTERIES THIS TIME.

162
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,083
- BUT IN A REAL SUB-LIGHTSPEED
BATTLE WE'D BE FLYING,

163
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
SO, ISN'T THIS EXERCISE
A COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR TIME?

164
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,625
- NO, IT'S NOT.

165
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
USING GAMBEES AS
STATIONARY BATTERIES

166
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,125
IS A COMMON DEFENSIVE TACTIC,

167
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,791
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY
WE ARE TRAINING FOR IT TODAY.

168
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:32,625
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? THEN GET
TO YOUR STATIONS. MOVE OUT!

169
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,750
- ( engine revving )

170
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,541
- HEY, WORK.

171
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,791
CRUZ TO CONTROL.

172
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,708
GAMBEE SIX-OH-SIX WON'T
ACTIVATE. IT'S DEAD.

173
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,833
- Jake: WHAT? THEN COME
ON UP TO THE BRIDGE,

174
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,416
YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH FROM THERE.

175
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,083
GAMBEES, STAY PLANTED.

176
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,208
IF YOU BECOME DISLODGED
FROM THE SHIP,

177
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,083
YOUR UNIT WILL BE
SWEPT INTO DEEP SPACE,

178
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,625
AND YOU WILL DRIFT AWAY.

179
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,083
REMEMBER, NEVER
ATTACK FORWARD, GOT IT?

180
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,541
AT SUB-LIGHT SPEED, ALWAYS FIRE
TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE SHIP

181
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,791
NO MATTER WHERE THE ENEMY IS.

182
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,666
AT THOSE SPEEDS,
SHOOTING FORWARD WILL

183
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,416
SPRAY YOUR OWN AMMO
BACK INTO YOUR FACE,

184
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,708
WHICH YOU DO NOT WANT.

185
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,000
- Male cadet: TUMORS?

186
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,333
- THE MOBILE TROOPS DIVISION IS

187
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,791
CONDUCTING THEIR SUB-LIGHT
SPEED TRAINING TODAY.

188
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,916
- IS IT POSSIBLE THOSE
ARE THEIR TARGETS?

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,958
- BUT THERE'S SO MANY.

190
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,125
- ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY
DURING ANY FORM OF

191
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,541
LIGHT-SPEED TRAVEL
IS ALMOST UNHEARD OF.

192
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,791
- LET'S DOUBLE CHECK
THE RADAR SIGNATURES.

193
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,625
- YES SIR.

194
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,666
- ( beeps )

195
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
- SURELY THE ENEMY WOULD KNOW

196
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,041
WE'RE JUST A TRAINING
SCHOOL RUNNING EXERCISES.

197
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,458
IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH
THEIR TIME TO ATTACK.

198
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,416
- ( gasps ) HOLD ON,
LET ME SEE THAT.

199
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,041
- ( beeps )

200
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,541
- NO WAY. IT'S THEM.

201
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,250
- THE ENEMY'S APPROACHING.
THEY'RE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US.

202
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,500
- WHAT?

203
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,916
- ESCORT SHIP NUMBER ONE
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,875
- ALL SHIPS ENGAGE COMBAT
DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOLS AT ONCE.

205
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,375
- INCREASE ACCELERATION.
MOVE OUT IN FRONT OF THE ENEMY.

206
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,791
- ENGAGE MERCURION REACTOR.
INCREASING OUTPUT.

207
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,833
- UH, CAPTAIN. WOULDN'T A
BETTER COURSE OF ACTION BE

208
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,583
TO DECELERATE THE FLEET SUDDENLY
AND THEN ALTER OUR VECTOR?

209
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,958
- BOY ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

210
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,333
THE SHIP WOULD
BE CRUSHED TO BITS

211
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,416
IF WE JUMPED OUT OF LIGHT SPEED

212
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,291
WITHOUT TAKING
THE PROPER STEPS FIRST.

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,375
THE SAME APPLIES
TO CHANGING COURSE.

214
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,708
WHAT THE HELL DID THEY
TEACH YOU IN SCHOOL?

215
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,875
- ONE PERCENT ACCELERATION.
WE'RE MOVING AHEAD.

216
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,416
- PREPARE TO ATTACK.

217
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,583
- REMEMBER, DON'T SHOOT
FORWARD. ONLY BACKWARDS.

218
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,166
- AH, THE ENEMY'S ATTACKING?

219
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,291
- ( gasps )

220
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,500
- WE'VE ALREADY LOST
AN ESCORT SHIP.

221
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,041
WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE
THE ATTACK MOMENTARILY

222
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,166
SO, BE READY.

223
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,625
GET TO THE BRIDGE,
AND TAKE COMMAND OF

224
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,166
THE MOBILE TROOPS
DIVISION AT ONCE.

225
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,833
- YES SIR.

226
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,875
DID EVERYONE HEAR THAT ORDER?

227
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,541
THE DEAGUE HAVE BEEN
KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE US

228
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,958
SOME REAL-LIFE COMBAT EXPERIENCE

229
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,333
SO, BE READY TO FIGHT
'CAUSE THIS WON'T BE EASY.

230
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,541
REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING.

231
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,916
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO SUPPORT
THE GAMBEES FROM HERE

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,083
WHILE I HEAD TO THE BRIDGE.

233
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,166
- RIGHT.

234
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,083
- WAIT, SIR. IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

235
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,541
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO PREPARE
ANOTHER UNIT FOR YOU. STAY HERE.

236
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,375
- ALL STRAINS LAUNCH NOW.

237
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,500
DON'T LET THE ENEMY GET ANY
CLOSER THAN THEY ALREADY ARE.

238
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,000
JUDGING BY THE WAY
THE FIRST SHIP WENT DOWN,

239
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,083
WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING TUMORS
TO SMASH INTO THE HULL.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,041
IS THAT?

241
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,125
- SIR, I'VE GOT A VISUAL
ON THE ENEMY.

242
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,458
- NO. IT'S A GLOIRE TYPE.

243
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,625
COULD THAT REALLY BE
THE STRAIN OF RALPH WEREC?

244
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,166
- ( gasps )

245
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,916
- ( siren blaring )

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,708
- ANOTHER ONE. DEAR GOD.

247
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,041
- WHAT? HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

248
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,916
- THEY'RE ABOUT TO CROSS OUR
SHIP'S SECONDARY DEFENSIVE LINE.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
STAND BY.

250
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,166
- GLOIRE TYPE STRAIN CONFIRMED.

251
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,958
IT'S DEFINITELY THE SAME
ONE THAT ATTACKED GRABERA.

252
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,000
- IT'S HIM, RALPH WEREC.

253
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,208
WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD CAUSE
HIM TO ATTACK A TRAINING FLEET?

254
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,708
- ATTENTION CADETS, REPORT
TO BATTLE STATIONS AT ONCE.

255
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,958
ALL STRAINS ATTACK
THE GLOIRE TYPE.

256
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,833
GAMBEES KEEP THOSE DAMN TUMORS
OFF THE HULL OF THE SHIP.

257
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,375
THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

258
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,500
I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
IT'S THE REAL THING, CADETS.

259
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,125
WE'RE UP AGAINST TUMORS
AND A GLOIRE TYPE STRAIN,

260
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,500
THE MOST ADVANCED OF IT'S KIND.

261
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,916
THEY'VE ALREADY DESTROYED
OUR TWO ESCORT SHIPS

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,125
AND ARE NOW GUNNING FOR US.

263
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,791
EVERYONE REMEMBER
WHAT YOU LEARNED

264
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,458
IN YOUR SUB LIGHT SPEED
TRAINING YESTERDAY,

265
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,291
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE
IT WILL COUNT.

266
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,041
- NEVER SHOOT FORWARD. ONLY TO
THE SIDE OR REAR, CORRECT?

267
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,666
- CORRECT. THERE'S JUST
ONE LAST THING.

268
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,833
TWO-WAY COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE AT SUB-LIGHT SPEED.

269
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,916
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,041
BUT NOT WITH THE MOTHERSHIP.

271
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,458
JUST DON'T BE RECKLESS.

272
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,041
- WE'RE ABOUT TO FIGHT
IN OUR FIRST COMBAT OPERATION.

273
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,208
IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE
RECKLESS THAN THAT.

274
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,583
- Operator: ALL STRAINS
HAVE LAUNCHED.

275
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,125
- TRY TO STAND YOUR GROUND.

276
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,958
YOUR GAMBEES WILL BE
UNABLE TO FUNCTION,

277
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,708
IF YOU'RE KNOCKED INTO SPACE.
MOVE TO THE OUTER TRENCHES

278
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,708
AND ENGAGE ANY TUMORS THAT
ATTACH TO THE HULL OF THE SHIP.

279
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,375
- Student 1: THIS SUCKS.

280
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,541
- Student 2:
OUR FIRST REAL BATTLE

281
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,583
AND IT'S AT SUB-LIGHTSPEED.

282
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
- Jake: IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
A BODY BAG, THEN FOCUS.

283
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
- Student 3: STOP PUSHING.
- Student 4: MOVE IT.

284
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,541
- YOU PEOPLE ARE IN MY WAY.

285
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,083
IF WE KEEP STANDING AROUND

286
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,041
THE REASONERS WILL HAVE ALL
THE GLORY AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

287
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,291
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

288
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,500
PLATOON SIX-ZERO ALREADY
HAS ROUTE ONE-ONE-FIVE.

289
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,166
- PLATOONS EIGHT-ONE
AND FIVE-FOUR CONTINUE

290
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,250
TO THE UPPER PATHWAY
FROM CURRENT LOCATION.

291
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,708
- Operator 1:
PROCEED TO THE DETOUR ROUTE

292
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,541
MARKED ON YOUR H.U.D.
AND STAND BY.

293
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,375
- Operator 2: LOWER STARBOARD
PATHWAY IS OPEN. PROCEED.

294
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,791
- Operator 3: DID YOU GUYS HEAR?

295
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,041
THE ENEMY HAS ONE OF THOSE
GLOIRE STRAINS WITH THEM.

296
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,416
- ( gasps )
- Operator 2: WAIT,

297
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
THEN THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING
UP AGAINST RALPH WEREC.

298
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,833
- Operator 1: THIS IS TURNING
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

299
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,250
- Sara: MY BROTHER IS HERE?

300
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:56,166
RALPH WEREC IS HERE. HE'S
OUTSIDE. THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY.

301
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,291
BUT I'M STUCK ON BOARD THIS SHIP
INSTEAD OF OUT THERE WITH HIM.

302
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,500
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF EVEN BEING HERE

303
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,500
IF I CAN'T GET TO MY BROTHER?

304
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,541
( grunts )

305
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,291
- YOU IDIOT. YOU'RE GOING
TO GET YOURSELF KILLED

306
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,625
IF YOU FIGHT LIKE THAT.

307
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,791
I TOLD YOU SO.

308
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,500
FIGHTING THESE STUPID TUMORS
IS JUST WASTING MY TIME.

309
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,083
OKAY, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU HIDING, WEREC?

310
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,875
- Jake: THE FIRST WAVE OF TUMORS
HAVE ARRIVED. DESTROY THEM ALL.

311
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,458
BE PATIENT AND WAIT UNTIL
THEY'RE WITHIN RANGE TO FIRE.

312
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,916
- YES. I CAN TAKE CARE
OF ALL THESE MYSELF.

313
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,750
- ABOVE YOU. LOOK.

314
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,000
- ( gasps )

315
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,041
NO, STOP. GET OFF!

316
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,625
( screams ) HELP,
SOMEONE HELP ME.

317
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,791
- ISABELLA!

318
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,916
- ( screams )

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,125
- ( loud explosion )

320
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,333
- Craven: THE SHIP'S RATE
OF ACCELERATION IS DROPPING.

321
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,291
- SIR, THE NUMBER
OF STRAIN CASUALTIES

322
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,541
JUST PASSED THIRTY PERCENT.

323
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,083
- WE'VE LOST OVER TWENTY
PERCENT OF OUR GAMBEES.

324
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,958
- THIS IS A BLOODBATH.

325
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,750
THESE KIDS HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
A CHANCE TO GRADUATE YET.

326
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,125
- ( loud explosion )

327
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,166
- DAMN. WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?
- Dickon: CARRIS, YOU ALL RIGHT?

328
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,166
- HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE?

329
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,416
- YEAH ERMY, MARTHA AND
LAVINIA ARE ALL FIGHTING

330
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
OVER THE STARBOARD WING.

331
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,125
- GOT IT. WHAT ABOUT JESSIE AND
THE QUEEN? HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

332
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,708
- I'M RIGHT HERE, YOU GUYS.

333
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,750
BUT WHEN LOTTIE HEARD THAT
RALPH WEREC WAS AROUND,

334
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,583
SHE WENT OFF TO LOOK
FOR HIM ON HER OWN.

335
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,791
- ( screaming )
WHERE ARE YOU WEREC?

336
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,291
- THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD.

337
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,500
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
ACTUALLY BEING ATTACKED.

338
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,458
PRETTY CRAZY, HUH?

339
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,125
- I DON'T GET WHY THE DEAGUE
WOULD ATTACK A TRAINING SHIP.

340
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
I MEAN THEY'VE REALLY
CROSSED THE LINE

341
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,000
WHERE THE MORALS OF
WAR ARE CONCERNED.

342
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,166
- ( gasps )

343
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,750
- ( rumbling )

344
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,041
- Lottie: THERE HE IS.
I FOUND YOU, BASTARD.

345
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,166
IT'S TIME I PUT A STOP
TO THIS TRAITOROUS SCUM!

346
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,583
- HMM.
- OH, HI.

347
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,500
- WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PITY
PARTY, SO, SAVE IT FOR LATER.

348
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,791
UNLESS YOU WANT TO JOIN US,
OF COURSE.

349
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,458
BUT WE'LL PROBABLY BE DEAD
LATER, SO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

350
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,708
- THAT STRAIN THERE.
IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL, RIGHT?

351
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,500
BECAUSE I WANT TO FLY IT, NOW.

352
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,166
- BUT YOU'RE JUST A GAMBEE
PILOT. WHAT ARE YOU STUPID?

353
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,041
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
DO ANYTHING WITH IT

354
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,541
SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE A MIMIC.

355
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,375
- YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT,
I DO HAVE A MIMIC. IT'S EMILY.

356
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,666
- OH, PLEASE. EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU CAN'T PILOT A STRAIN

357
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,916
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S MIMIC.

358
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,583
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IMPOSSIBLE.
- GO AHEAD.

359
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,208
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
AND IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY

360
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,208
'CAUSE I JUST RECONFIGURED THE
COCKPIT SO THE DOLL WOULD FIT.

361
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,833
IF NOTHING ELSE, IT'LL BE GOOD
FOR TESTING PURPOSES.

362
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
- YOU READY, EMILY?

363
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,041
- Melchi: WHAT A DOWNER.

364
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,458
THIS SHIP WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER

365
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,833
UNLESS A MIRACLE HAPPENS
AND THAT STRAIN STARTS,

366
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,375
WE'RE BREATHING
OUR LAST BREATHS, CARMICHAEL.

367
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,708
- DO YOU THINK IT'LL START?
- DOUBT IT.

368
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,333
- OH, WELL. BUMMER.

369
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,583
- Sara: TO PILOT A STRAIN,

370
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,041
YOU CAN ONLY USE THE
MIMIC ASSIGNED TO YOU.

371
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,041
THAT'S THE RULE.

372
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,583
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

373
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,250
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THIS GIRL
CALLED OUT FOR ME BACK THERE.

374
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,000
YEAH. YOU DID IT, RIGHT?

375
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,916
YOU KNEW I NEEDED YOUR HELP
SO, YOU SUMMONED ME HERE?

376
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,208
NOW THAT I'M HERE,
I'M BEGGING YOU. TAKE ME.

377
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,833
TAKE ME TO MY BROTHER. TAKE ME.

378
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,458
- Melchi: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

379
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,625
- Both: IT'S WORKING.
- THAT LIGHT IS

380
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,750
FROM THE MERCURION.

381
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,625
- NO WAY!

382
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,291
- Both: THEY'RE LINKED.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

383
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,541
- Melchi: A MIRACLE REALLY
DID HAPPEN.

384
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,041
- ( siren blaring )

385
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,416
- ( both gasp )

386
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,958
- BROTHER, I'M COMING FOR YOU.

387
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,583
- ( theme song playing )

388
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

389
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,458
- Sara:
AS A NEW DAILY ROUTINE SETS IN,

390
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:44,041
I LEARN WHY THE QUEEN
DESPISES MY BROTHER SO MUCH.

391
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:49,333
ON THE NEXT STRAIN, REASONER
SARA. MY BROTHER IS MY ENEMY.
