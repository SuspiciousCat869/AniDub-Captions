1
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,083
- ( panting )

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,416
- OH SARA, BELIEVE ME,
I'M SO SORRY!

3
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,541
OH, WHAT DO I DO NOW?

4
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,708
FORGIVE ME, SARA!

5
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,791
- Lottie: YOU DID WHAT?
YOU IDIOT!

6
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,125
I MEAN HOLY HELL, LAVINIA,
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

7
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,916
ISSUES WITHOUT YOU
CAUSING TROUBLE!

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,583
- Lavinia: ( crying )
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

9
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,875
- Lottie: WELL, WHERE'D SHE GO?

10
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,833
- Lavinia: I THINK SHE'S
GOING INTO TOWN.

11
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,416
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS
HER DAY TRACER, THOUGH.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,208
- OKAY, STOP CRYING
AND GET OVER HERE NOW!

13
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,500
LET'S GO AHEAD
AND CALL THE OTHERS.

14
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,083
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE
TO HELP SEARCH.

15
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,375
- GOT IT.

16
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,875
- Carris: YEAH, CARRIS HERE.
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

17
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,416
HOW IS EMILY GONE?

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,083
- Lottie: I DON'T KNOW,
BUT SARA'S MIA TOO.

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,541
SHE WENT LOOKING BY HERSELF.

20
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,125
- Carris: OH, MAN.

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,583
- Lottie: LISTEN, WE NEED TO
FIND HER IMMEDIATELY, GET IT?

22
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,708
- Martha: SARA OR EMILY?
- Lottie: OH COME ON!

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,333
BOTH OF THEM, OBVIOUSLY!

24
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,083
NOW, WE THINK SARA'S HEADED
FOR A WASTE COLLECTION POINT

25
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,625
SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY.

26
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,583
LET'S SPLIT UP AND CHECK OUT
ALL OF THEM UNTIL WE FIND HER.

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,958
- Lottie: UNDERSTOOD?
- Team: ROGER!

28
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,875
- ( breathing heavily )

29
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,166
- ( theme song playing )

30
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

31
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,875
- Worker: HEY!
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE!

32
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,125
- EMILY!

33
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,125
- ( grunts )

34
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,625
- EMILY!

35
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,541
- SARA, STOP!
- LET GO.

36
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,833
I CAN SEE HER,
SHE'S GETTING AWAY.

37
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,291
I HAVE TO SAVE EMILY!

38
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,416
- EMILY!
- STOP IT!

39
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,166
LOOK CLOSER.
THAT'S NOT EMILY!

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
LOOK, SARA, I KNOW SHE
MEANS A LOT TO YOU.

41
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,458
IF YOU WANT TO FIND HER,
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

42
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,750
- BUT I'VE GOT TO...
EMILY IS OUT HERE.

43
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,666
- JUST STOP FOR A
SECOND AND BREATHE.

44
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,208
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BE ANY GOOD TO HER

45
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,875
IF YOU'RE JUST RUNNING ALL
OVER THE CITY LIKE THIS.

46
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,458
- BUT I...

47
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,291
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.
WITH ALL OF US LOOKING,

48
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,583
WE'LL FIND HER.

49
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,375
I ACTUALLY LIVED HERE
UNTIL I LEFT FOR BASION,

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,333
SO I KNOW MY WAY
AROUND PRETTY WELL.

51
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,583
AND I HAVE SOME CONNECTIONS
THAT MAY HELP US OUT.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,291
- WELL, HELLO THERE!

53
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,666
HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAY?

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,458
- CAN YOU CALL DONNY?

55
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,541
PLEASE, IT'S URGENT
THAT I SPEAK WITH

56
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,125
DONALD RADOFRICS
IMMEDIATELY!

57
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,500
- YOU'RE ASKING TO SEE
THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR?

58
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,750
MAY I ASK WHY YOU...

59
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,250
- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!

60
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,791
JUST TELL HIM CARRIS IS
WAITING AND HE'LL UNDERSTAND!

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,166
- CARRIS, DON'T.
- BUT SIR, I'M NOT...

62
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,625
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET IN TROUBLE.

63
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,916
HE'LL TELL YOU THAT I'M HIS...

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,541
- Radofrics: BROTHER?

65
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,083
- CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR!

66
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,250
- CARRIS, BIG BROTHER.

67
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,833
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU!

68
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,208
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

69
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,875
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

70
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,416
- Sara: SO, HE'S YOUR
YOUNGER BROTHER?

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
- YEAH, BUT SEE, I'VE DONE SO
MUCH SUB-LIGHTSPEED TRAVEL THAT

72
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,416
HE IS ACTUALLY
OLDER THAN I AM NOW,

73
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,041
WHICH IS REALLY
WEIRD TO THINK ABOUT.

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,666
ANYWAY, HE'S CHIEF SATELLITE
ADMINISTRATOR HERE

75
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,375
AND KNOWS ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT
COMES IN AND OUT OF THIS PLACE,

76
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,416
SO DON'T WORRY, WE SHOULD
KNOW SOMETHING SOON.

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
PLUS ALL OF THE OTHERS ARE
OUT LOOKING FOR EMILY, ALSO.

78
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,208
- ALL OF THE OTHERS?

79
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,375
- ( watch device beeps )

80
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,500
- OH, UH, CRAP.
- YOU FREAKING JERK!

81
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,125
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET
THE REST OF US KNOW

82
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,916
AS SOON AS YOU FOUND HER!

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,833
- LISTEN SARA. DON'T EVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.

84
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,958
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
WORRIED WE'VE ALL BEEN?

85
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,500
WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN
YOU NEED TO CALL US, OKAY?

86
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,833
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

87
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,083
- YOU BETTER BE,

88
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,875
BECAUSE ALL WE'VE BEEN
DOING IS TRYING TO BE...

89
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,583
- HEY, LAVINIA. CAN YOU PLEASE
COME OVER HERE AND HOLD HER?

90
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,000
- UH, SURE!

91
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,000
- HEY, STOP! I'M NOT DONE!
- SORRY BOUT THAT.

92
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,666
- SHE NEEDS TO KNOW EXACTLY...
- SARA, YOU STILL THERE?

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,166
- WE'RE ALL RIGHT BEHIND
YOU HELPING OUT,

94
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,916
- SO DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING, OKAY?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,625
- YEAH. THANKS A LOT.

96
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,125
- ALRIGHT, WE'LL KEEP
LOOKING FOR EMILY OVER HERE.

97
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,916
YOU GUYS LET US KNOW IF YOU
FIND ANYTHING. OVER AND OUT.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,125
I'M HUNGRY. WE SHOULD
GO GET SOME FOOD.

99
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,250
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN AT ALL
SINCE THIS MORNING, HAVE YOU?

100
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,958
- UH, NO.

101
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,541
- ( stomach grumbles )

102
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,750
- WELL, THAT DECIDES IT.

103
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,125
I REMEMBER A RESTAURANT
NEARBY. LET'S GO!

104
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,416
- BUT SHOULDN'T WE...

105
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,625
- Carris: GALL IS QUITE A WAYS
FROM THE NEUTRAL ZONE,

106
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,958
SO THE CIVILIANS WHO LIVE
HERE HAVE A LOT OF SAY

107
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,416
ABOUT HOW THINGS HAPPEN.

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,875
YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT
HOW PEACEFUL IT IS,

109
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,125
AND WHEN YOU GROW UP HERE

110
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,500
EVERYBODY TENDS TO TURN
OUT PRETTY LAID-BACK.

111
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,125
- ( clock strikes five )

112
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,000
- WOW, THAT REALLY
TAKES ME BACK.

113
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,583
- HI, THERE!
SO WHAT'LL IT BE?

114
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,708
- WELL...
- CARRIS?

115
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,625
OH MY GOODNESS, IT IS YOU!

116
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,666
WOW, HOW MANY
YEARS HAS IT BEEN?

117
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,083
- YOU DON'T MEAN, JANET!

118
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,958
"SKINNY AS A TWIG" JANET?

119
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,166
- YOU SWEET THING!

120
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,333
HOW LUCKY ARE YOU
TO STILL BE SO YOUNG?

121
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,083
AND TO HAVE USED
THOSE GOOD LOOKS

122
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,500
TO GET HITCHED TO
SUCH A PRETTY GIRL.

123
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,500
- HITCHED?

124
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,083
UH, HOLD IT, JANET.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

125
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,708
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
ON A BIG SHOW FOR ME, CARRIS.

126
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,250
YOUR DADDY IS
BEING SHY, ISN'T HE?

127
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,416
- DID YOU SAY "DADDY"?

128
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,708
- Janet: UH-HUH.

129
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,875
- ( both gasp )

130
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,583
- SHE IS JUST ADORABLE!

131
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
WHO DOES SHE FAVOR?

132
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,083
- IS UPSTAIRS OPEN?

133
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,625
- Carmichael: SO, WE'RE LOOKING
UP INFO ON SARA, RIGHT?

134
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,583
THEN SHOULDN'T WE BE DOING
THIS FROM A MILITARY FACILITY?

135
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,625
- I DON'T LIKE HOW STRICT
EVERYTHING IS THERE.

136
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,458
ALL THOSE RESTRICTIONS
AND PROCEDURES.

137
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,458
YES, WE'RE IN!

138
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,083
NOW THEN, THIS IS WHERE
THE GOOD STUFF STARTS.

139
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,500
- WOW, THIS IS ALL
SARA'S BIO-DATA?

140
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,083
- I'M CHECKING IT
AGAINST THE DATA

141
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,083
OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON JOINT HQ RECORDS.

142
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,875
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO
NARROW DOWN HER REAL IDENTITY.

143
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,791
- YOU'RE RIGHT, AGAIN.

144
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,166
BUT THAT COULD TAKE FOREVER.

145
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,458
- Janet: HERE YOU GO!

146
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,583
- HEY THERE, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

147
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,833
- AND TELL US.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE?

148
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,000
- ( both chuckle )

149
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,083
- Sara: SHE MUST BE LOST.

150
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,541
- Carris: WE'LL TAKE HER TO
THE ADMINISTRATION BUREAU

151
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,541
AFTER WE FINISH EATING.

152
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,791
- ( whimpers )

153
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,291
- WHAT'S WRONG?

154
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,500
- HERE. DRINK THIS!

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,250
- ( breathing rapidly )
- ARE YOU OKAY?

156
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,625
HEY, WAIT!

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,125
LOOK OUT!

158
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,458
- SARA, DON'T!

159
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,666
- ( honking )

160
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,666
- ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?

161
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,583
- ( chuckles ) I'M OKAY.

162
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,041
- I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T RUN OFF ANYMORE.

163
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,416
- THAT WAS CLOSE!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,333
- YEAH.

165
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,416
( gasps )

166
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,916
WAIT UP!

167
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,791
- ( both laughing )

168
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,583
- OH, MAN.

169
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,208
WHERE SHOULD WE EVEN BEGIN?

170
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,541
- Lavinia: THERE ARE EIGHT
PLACES JUST ON THIS FLOOR!

171
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,916
- COME IN, ERMY!

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,708
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON YOUR END?

173
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,458
- NO LUCK. WE'RE ON OUR
WAY TO THE NEXT STATION.

174
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,083
- Lottie: DICKON?
- YEAH, I GOT NOTHIN' HERE.

175
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,291
NONE OF THE DOLLS I'VE
SEEN LOOK LIKE EMILY.

176
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,291
- Carris: UH-HUH.
SURE, OKAY.

177
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,458
YEAH, THANKS, JUST KEEP AT IT.

178
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,416
IT SEEMS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE
DONNY A LITTLE MORE TIME.

179
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
- I SEE.

180
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,791
- HEY, CHEER UP!

181
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,708
THEY'VE REALLY NARROWED DOWN
THE PLACES SHE COULD BE,

182
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,833
AND LOTTIE AND THE OTHERS
ARE ON THEIR WAY HERE NOW.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,208
WOW, SHE REALLY SEEMS
SO INNOCENT, DOESN'T SHE?

184
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,333
- YES, SHE DOES.

185
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,291
- YOU HAVEN'T HAD
THE EASIEST DAY.

186
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,500
- MAYBE. BUT YOURS
WAS CRAZY, TOO.

187
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,291
- YOU KNOW, I MANAGED TO
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

188
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,958
- WELL, I THINK YOU'LL
MAKE A GOOD DAD SOMEDAY.

189
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,958
- YOU THINK SO?
YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT MOM.

190
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,750
I MEAN...

191
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,291
DEGAUSSING.

192
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,125
YOU SEE, MAGNETIC
ENERGY HAS ALWAYS

193
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,541
BUILT UP EASILY IN THIS CITY.

194
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,666
IF IT'S NOT CHECKED,
IT'LL TURN ELECTRONICS

195
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,125
INTO USELESS JUNK. LOOK!

196
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,250
WAIT FOR IT.

197
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,750
THEY EXPEL THE BUILT-UP
MAGNETIC ENERGY

198
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,416
EVERY 24 HOURS BY DOING THAT.

199
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,250
OH, ALMOST FORGOT.

200
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,958
I PICKED SOMETHING UP.

201
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,458
- IT'S A LITTLE
PRESENT FOR EMILY.

202
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,750
- FOR EMILY?

203
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,500
- YEAH. IT'S JUST A NEW DRESS.

204
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,208
SHE MIGHT BE DIRTY FROM
ALL OF THE GARBAGE

205
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,125
AND I THOUGHT SHE COULD
USE A SET OF NEW CLOTHES.

206
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,458
- THANKS, CARRIS.

207
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,708
BUT WHY?

208
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,541
WHY IS EVERYONE...

209
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,500
WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP
LOOKING OUT FOR ME?

210
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,750
IT'S NICE BUT, I GUESS I
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

211
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,416
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

212
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,750
- IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS,
AREN'T WE SARA?

213
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,458
- BUT, I...

214
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,500
- DO ME A FAVOR?
QUIT TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF

215
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,375
LIKE YOU DON'T DESERVE
GOOD THINGS.

216
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,708
THE TRUTH IS,
EVERY TIME I SAW YOU

217
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,291
SITTING OFF BY
YOURSELF SOMEPLACE,

218
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,666
I ALWAYS WISHED THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO FOR YOU,

219
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,041
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

220
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,541
I HOPE WE HAVEN'T BOTHERED
YOU OR ANYTHING.

221
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T, NOT AT ALL.

222
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,125
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S GOOD.

223
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,666
SARA.

224
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,375
- ( watch device beeps )

225
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,833
- DAMMIT, DONNY,
YOU HAVE CRAPPY TIMING.

226
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,958
YEAH, IT'S ME.
UH, WHAT?

227
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,000
- ( gasps )

228
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,916
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,291
THE DEGAUSSING HASN'T
ENDED HERE YET!

230
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,541
- OH, SO YOU'RE AWAKE!

231
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,166
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

232
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,041
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME, HUH?

233
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,166
DID YOU DISCOVER
SOMETHING OVER THERE?

234
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,750
WAIT.

235
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,458
- SECTION S-THIRTY-FIVE-B?

236
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,833
AH! YEAH YOU MEAN THE ONE WITH
THE WEIRD-SHAPED NEON LIGHT?

237
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,541
THAT'S GREAT. SARA!

238
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,916
- SARA?
- Radofrics: HOLD ON, CARRIS,

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,375
YOU NEED TO STAY AWAY
FROM THERE FOR NOW.

240
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,750
WE'VE JUST RECEIVED
AN ODD REPORT.

241
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,416
IT'S SHOWING THAT
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED

242
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,125
IN THE OUTER WALL OVER THERE.

243
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,500
- HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED?

244
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,833
- NOT SURE, JUST BE CAREFUL.

245
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,125
I'LL CALL AGAIN SOON
AS I CAN. BYE.

246
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,250
- HEY, DONNY!

247
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,500
- ( watch device beeps )

248
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,791
- WHAT? ORDERS TO GET BACK
TO THE SHIP?

249
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,166
- ( siren buzzing )

250
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,083
- AN UNREGISTERED UNIT?

251
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,791
- THE LOCAL GARRISON
HAS REQUESTED,

252
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,958
THAT WE SEND STRAINS
OUT TO CONDUCT RECON.

253
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,125
I'VE ISSUED ORDERS FOR
ALL CADETS IN THE CITY,

254
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,250
TO RETURN TO THE SHIP.

255
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,791
THEY'VE ALREADY DISPERSED ALL OF

256
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,000
THEIR AVAILABLE MANPOWER
TO PATROL THE PORTS.

257
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,083
SO, CONSIDERING THE FACT
THAT WE'RE THE CLOSEST,

258
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,833
- WE GET TO DO THE DIRTY WORK.
- AFFIRMATIVE.

259
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,458
- UGH. YOU'RE USELESS!

260
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,458
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TAKE
YOUR EYES OFF HER!

261
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,750
- UH, SORRY.

262
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,833
- OKAY, HE SAID S-THIRTY-FIVE-B.

263
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,416
THEN I'LL HEAD OVER
THAT WAY NOW.

264
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,000
YOU GUYS GET BACK TO THE SHIP
AND GET READY TO MOVE OUT.

265
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,958
- JESSIE, YOU'RE IN
CHARGE, UNDERSTOOD?

266
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,166
- YES, MA'AM.

267
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,875
- LET ME GO.
- DON'T BE AN IDIOT!

268
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,791
WE CAN'T SPLIT UP
OUR TEAM ANY FURTHER!

269
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,166
- LET'S GO.
COME ON, CARRIS.

270
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
- YEAH. YEAH!

271
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,958
HEY, JESSIE!
THIS IS MY HOMETOWN,

272
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,833
- IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME,
I KNOW A SHORT CUT!

273
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,000
- OKAY!

274
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,875
- ( panting )

275
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,333
- A WASTE COLLECTION POINT?

276
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,083
WHY WOULD SHE COME
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?

277
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,250
- JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

278
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,333
- IT REALLY DID TAKE FOREVER.

279
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,041
AND MELCHI, WHAT ABOUT
GETTING BACK TO THE SHIP?

280
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,291
- IT'S PROBABLY NO BIG DEAL.

281
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,125
BESIDES, I'M ALMOST DONE.

282
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,916
- Martha: WHERE'S LAVINIA?
- Ermy: SHE'S WITH LOTTIE.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,875
SHE SAID THEY WERE GOING
WITH SARA TO LOOK FOR EMILY.

284
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,875
- MAN, I SHOULD BE DOWN
THERE WITH THEM HELPING!

285
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,458
- WHOA NOW, ARE YOU WORRIED?

286
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,583
DOESN'T A TORTURED BOY IN LOVE
JUST TUG ON THE HEARTSTRINGS?

287
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,708
- YEAH. I AM WORRIED!
SO SHUT IT!

288
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,375
- THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH
WITH THE CHIT CHAT,

289
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,291
THIS IS THE SITUATION WE HAVE.

290
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,250
THE SIGNAL OF AN
UNIDENTIFIED UNIT

291
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,416
WAS LOST NEAR SECTOR
S-THIRTY-FIVE-B.

292
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,791
- BUT, THAT'S...

293
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,041
- Dufarge:
THE RECENT DEGAUSSING HAS

294
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,625
JAMMED THE VARIOUS
SENSORS OUT THERE,

295
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,541
SO, EXERCISE
EXTREME CAUTION.

296
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,291
- WE'RE OUT HERE
FOR RECONNAISSANCE.

297
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,208
DON'T GET ANY CLOSER
THAN NECESSARY!

298
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,625
EVERYBODY GOT THAT?

299
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,375
- WHERE DID SHE GO?

300
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,916
- ( gasps )

301
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,541
- THERE SHE IS!

302
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,083
- ( gasping )

303
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,625
( gasps )

304
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,500
SARA!

305
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,916
( chuckles )

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
- EMILY?

307
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,291
EMILY!

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,750
THANK GOODNESS.
THANK GOODNESS!

309
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,166
( sobbing )

310
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,166
- ( digital beeping )

311
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,250
- THAT'S THE TENTH REMINDER
TO RETURN TO THE SHIP!

312
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,875
- FORGET THAT! THIS IS
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

313
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,250
- ( computer beeps )

314
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,333
- HERE WE GO.

315
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,833
- YOU'RE SAFE NOW, EMILY.

316
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,166
I'M SO SORRY,
I LEFT YOU ALL ALONE.

317
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,375
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

318
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:51,041
SEE, I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D
FIND ME AGAIN SOMEDAY, SARA.

319
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,333
IT WAS SO DARK
FOR A LONG TIME,

320
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,958
AND NO ONE WAS THERE.

321
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,916
I WAS SCARED,
AND COLD, AND LONELY.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,250
BUT THEN, YOU CAME AND
FOUND ME IN THE DARK, SARA.

323
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,041
AND THAT'S ALSO WHEN
YOU GAVE ME A NEW NAME,

324
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,750
AND YOU TALKED TO ME EVERYDAY,

325
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,416
SO, I WASN'T LONELY ANYMORE.

326
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,666
- I DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING? WHO ARE YOU?

327
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,250
- EMILY.

328
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,083
MY NAME IS EMILY.

329
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,625
SARA. SARA WEREC.

00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,833
- LOOK, SARA MIGHT
STILL BE SOMEWHERE

333
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,916
IN THE VICINITY, JESSIE!

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,583
I CAN'T HANG BACK, UNDERSTAND?

335
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,666
FOUND 'EM!
I'VE LOCATED TUMORS!

336
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,750
THEY MIGHT BE THE
UNIDENTIFIED UNITS.

337
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,291
I'M WORRIED ABOUT SARA.

338
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,833
- LET'S TAKE CARE
OF THIS, DICKON.

339
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,958
- Jessie: WAIT!

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,041

341
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,458
- EMILY IS...

342
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,541
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
HER FOR A LONG TIME.

343
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
I MISSED HER.

344
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,958
IT WAS SO LONELY.

345
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,291
FOR HER, AND FOR ME.

346
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
BUT YOU WERE ALWAYS
SO NICE TO ME,

347
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,791
SO, I CAME TO SEE YOU.

348
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,375
BUT HOW CAN YOU, BE HER?

349
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,333
- Ralph: EMILY.

350
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,833
- ( gasps )

351
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,416

- Dickon: ROGER THAT!

354
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,166
- THAT'S IT, BOYS.
JUST KEEP FOLLOWING ME.

355
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,416
WHAT IS THAT?
A HOLE?

356
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,208
CRAP, THEY'RE FALLING
INTO THAT THING!

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,958
- ( screams )

358
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,333
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON IN THIS DAMN PLACE?

359
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,458
WHERE'S SARA?

360
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,166
- ( metallic creaking )

361
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,541

362
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,000

367
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,541
FORGET ABOUT ME.

368
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,375
AND FORGET ABOUT
THIS LITTLE GIRL.

369
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,833
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE DECIDED TO DO,

370
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,166
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

371
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,208
YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

372

WHY'S HE HERE?

375
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,000
- I'LL SHOW NO MERCY
TO ANYONE IN MY WAY.

376
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,333
NOT EVEN TO YOU,
MY OWN SISTER.

377
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,458

378
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,750

00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,583

00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,000
THAT HOLE WE SAW DOWN THERE.

388
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,208
