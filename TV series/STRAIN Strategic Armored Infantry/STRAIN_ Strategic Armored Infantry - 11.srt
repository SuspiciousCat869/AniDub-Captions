1
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,250
- Female operator:
I DON'T SHOW ANY...

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,833
SIR, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
CRAFT IN THE PLANET'S VICINITY!

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,500
- Craven: HOW CAN THAT BE?

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,791
- BUT WE WERE TOLD THERE'S AN
EXERCISE HAPPENING ON BREGMA,

5
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,375
WITH OVER A
HUNDRED-THOUSAND SHIPS!

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,333
- I KNOW THAT, BUT I'M NOT
PICKING UP ANYONE OUT THERE!

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,541
WE'RE THE ONLY
ONES SHOWING UP!

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,291
- BUT, THEN, WHERE COULD
THE FLEET HAVE GONE?

9
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,000
- AND THIS MEANS THAT
THE LIBERTAD IS...

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,250
- ( beeping )

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,041
- IT'S A MESSAGE FROM AN
UNMANNED BREGMA BASE!

12
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,166
SENT BY THE UNION'S EXERCISE
MANAGEMENT DIVISION.

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,625
IT'S CODED LEVEL ONE, SIR!

14
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,958
- GOOD! LET'S DECIPHER
IT AT ONCE!

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,791
MEDICAL AND
TECHNOLOGY INSTRUCTORS

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,666
REPORT TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,291
WE'VE ONLY JUST
LEARNED THAT THE DEAGUE

18
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,000
ARE PLANNING AN ASSAULT
WITH A MILLION-SHIP ARMADA.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,916
- BUT THAT'S AN
INCREDIBLE SCALE, SIR.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,666
- THE LARGEST IN HISTORY.

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,208
- THESE ARE THE ENEMY'S
ESTIMATED STAGING POSTS.

22
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,833
IN RESPONSE TO THIS ATTACK,

23
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,000
THE UNION DECIDED TO
INTERCEPT THEM HERE,

24
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,250
AND PROMPTLY NOTIFIED
ALL FLEETS.

25
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,000
IT SEEMS THE FORCES AT BREGMA
CEASED THEIR EXERCISES

26
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,000
AND HEADED FOR AN
INTERCEPT POINT AS WELL.

27
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,125
- WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY THERE'S NOT ANYONE HERE.

28
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,375
- SO, LET ME GUESS. OUR ONLY
CHOICE IS TO HEAD BACK TO BASION

29
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,500
WITHOUT ANY NEW
SUPPLIES OR REPAIRS.

30
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,916
- BUT, IT'S NOT ALL
BAD NEWS NOW, IS IT?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,458
SOUNDS LIKE THE
ENEMY'S TRYING TO

32
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,083
DEVOTE EVERY SHIP IN THE
AREA TO THIS MISSION.

33
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,041
- EVERY SHIP?
SO, DOES THAT MEAN?

34
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.

35
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,500
- I THINK IT'S SAFE TO
ASSUME THE DEAGUE SHIP

36
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,958
THAT'S BEEN CHASING
US WAS SENT OFF

37
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,708
TO JOIN THE REST OF THEIR FLEET.

38
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,333
- ( theme music playing )

39
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

40
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,250
- ( Ralph crying )

41
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,958
- HOW COULD WE DO
SOMETHING SO UNFORGIVABLE?

42
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,916
HOW CAN I EVER
MAKE ATONEMENT?

43
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,916
- Emily: YOU CAN,
BROTHER. YOU CAN.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,125
- YOU CAN IF... IF I OPEN
THE BAXTER GATE INSIDE ME.

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
- SARA? ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

46
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,125
- I DON'T...

47
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,458
- YOUR MENTAL LOAD
HAD A HUGE INCREASE

48
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,500
WHILE YOU WERE LINKED TO HER,

49
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,958
AND YOU BLACKED
OUT PRETTY QUICK.

50
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,291
- Carmichael: DON'T WORRY.
EMILY'S JUST FINE.

51
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,416
- IT WASN'T A DREAM,
IT ALL REALLY HAPPENED.

52
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,083
- DO YOU HAVE ANY PAIN ANYWHERE?
- I'M FINE.

53
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,500
- GREAT! THEN WE CAN GET
BACK TO THE EXPERIMENT!

54
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,208
WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE
OF WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO YOU.

55
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,666
- INVESTIGATE?

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,833
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
HANDED OVER TO THE MILITARY.

57
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,083
- THAT PLAN'S BEEN PUT ON
HOLD FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

58
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,541
- Martha: WHAT A LETDOWN!

59
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,958
- YEAH, WE WORK SO
HARD TO GET TO BREGMA,

60
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,833
JUST TO FIND OUT THAT
NO ONE'S HERE TO HELP

61
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,791
AND THE DEAGUE'S NOT
CHASING US ANYMORE.

62
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,958
- ARE WE REALLY SURE
THEY'RE NOT COMING?

63
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,666
- WELL, THE TIME LIMIT
WAS REALLY TIGHT

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,708
AND IF THEY WERE
GOING TO MAKE IT,

65
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,041
THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE
GONE STRAIGHT TO

66
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,666
THE STAGING POINT
FROM GALL'S DEPOT.

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,625
- I SEE.

68
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,083
- I'M TELLING YOU,
MY BROTHER WILL SHOW UP!

69
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,416
- OH, COME ON NOW!

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,791
THEY'RE STAGING AN INCREDIBLY
MASSIVE OPERATION!

71
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,958
JUST BECAUSE HE'S
RALPH WEREC DOESN'T MEAN...

72
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,916
NO, ACTUALLY, THE FACT THAT
HE'S A PROVEN TRAITOR ENSURES

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,916
THEY'D NEVER ALLOW HIM
TO ACT ON HIS OWN!

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,791
SO EVEN IF HE WANTED
TO COME HE COULDN'T!

75
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,208
- HE'LL DO IT ANYWAY!

76
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,625
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

77
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,625
MY BROTHER IS OBLIGATED
TO COME HERE.

78
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,541
- WAIT, LET'S GET CRAVEN.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,750
- HE HAS TO, BECAUSE HE
MADE A VERY SERIOUS PROMISE.

80
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,875
AND THAT'S WHY,
I KNOW HE WILL.

81
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,791
- BEGINNING OUR THIRD
DECELERATION NOW.

82
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,333
COUNTDOWN. THREE.

83
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,416
TWO. ONE.

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,083
- ( rumbling and clanging )

85
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,125
- ( groaning )

86
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,125
- ( whines )

87
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,583
- BROTHER!
- I'M FINE.

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
- Craven: SARA,
PLEASE TELL US EVERYTHING.

89
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,041
EVERYTHING YOU
SAW AND LEARNED,

90
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,291
WHEN YOU WERE
LINKED TO THE MIMIC.

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,875
- WELL, SIR. IT HAPPENED
OVER SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

92
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,541
THE SPACESHIP WAS INDEPENDENT.

93
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,375
IT DIDN'T BELONG TO
THE UNION OR THE DEAGUE,

94
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,541
BUT, IT LANDED ON

95
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,000
THE UNION RESOURCE
SATELLITE OF NIEREN SIX.

96
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,875
- THEY WERE ALIENS THAT
ALL LOOKED EXACTLY ALIKE?

97
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,125
- THEY WERE REFERRED
TO AS UKs.

98
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,833
"UNKNOWNS," AND THEY WERE PLACED
UNDER MILITARY SUPERVISION.

99
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,166
AND THEN, THE RESEARCH BEGAN,

100
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,708
IN ABSOLUTE SECRECY.

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,708
- UGH! THAT'S UNFORGIVABLE.

102
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,875
- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT
THINGS THEY DISCOVERED,

103
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,625
WAS THAT THE GIRLS ALL
SHARED SOME OF THEIR SENSES.

104
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,750
- THEY SHARED...

105
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,750
- Sara: SIGHT, HEARING,
AND EMOTION.

106
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,250
- WHEN YOU SAY ALL
THE GIRLS, DO YOU MEAN?

107
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,666
- EVEN LIGHT-YEARS APART
THEY COMMUNICATE,

108
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,125
WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY
OR TIME-LAG.

109
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,541
- BUT THAT COULD
HAVE APPLICATIONS

110
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,916
IN ALL SORTS OF FIELDS.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,791
THINK ABOUT IT. INSTANT
INTERSTELLAR COMMUNICATION!

112
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,041
- THAT'S THE POINT, IT WAS FOR
EXACTLY THAT KIND OF GAIN.

113
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,500
ALL OF THOSE GIRLS WERE...

114
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,666
- SORRY.

115
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,666
SO THAT EXPLAINS
THE MIMIC EMILY.

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,875
SHE WAS ONE OF
THE ALIENS THEY FOUND.

117
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,250
- AND, IF THEY WERE RESEARCHING

118
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,875
INSTANT INTERSTELLAR
COMMUNICATION,

119
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,083
THEN WHY ISN'T
IT POSSIBLE YET?

120
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,708
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

121
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,958
- NIEREN SIX WAS NEVER INTENDED
TO BE A RESEARCH FACILITY.

122
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,041
TECHNOLOGY COULD
ONLY DEVELOP SO FAR.

123
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,625
SO, THEY DECIDED TO MOVE
THE WHOLE OPERATION

124
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,458
TO PLANET GRABERA.

125
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,666
- Carmichael: THEY'D BE FAR
FROM THE FRONT LINES THERE.

126
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,208
IT'S A PERFECT PLACE FOR
DOING SECRETIVE RESEARCH.

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,666
- ( turbines whirring )

128
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,416
- Sara: BUT,
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY...

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,750
- ( indistinct shouting )

130
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,125
- Melchi: THE BAXTER GATE?

131
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,625
- Sara: A GATE THAT
CONNECTS LOCATIONS IN SPACE,

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,625
AND OUT OF IT CAME...

133
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,375
- Dufarge: THEY CAME TO
RETRIEVE THEIR COMRADES.

134
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,166
- Ben: INCREDIBLE.

135
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,458
A SUB-LIGHTSPEED BATTLE IN
AN ERA WITHOUT STRAINS.

136
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,291
THE UNION'S ONLY
OPTION WOULD BE TO RUN.

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,333
- Melchi: BUT THERE WOULD
BE ONE WAY TO SURVIVE.

138
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,541
SEND AS MUCH OF THE RESEARCH
AS POSSIBLE TO GRABERA

139
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,666
AND USE IT TO CREATE A WEAPON
CAPABLE OF DEFEATING THEM.

140
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,041
- YEAH! A FEW HOURS
OF SUB-LIGHTSPEED TRAVEL

141
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,625
WOULD EQUAL CENTURIES
OF OBJECTIVE TIME!

142
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,958
- IF THINGS GO WELL,

143
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,250
REINFORCEMENTS COULD BE
ARRIVING IN MERE MINUTES!

144
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,625
- THEN WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

145
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,708
THAT'S HOW STRAIN TECHNOLOGY
CAME TO BE DEVELOPED.

146
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,083
- YES.

147
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,625
- AND THEN, THEY
MUST'VE SENT OUT

148
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,083
THE UNION'S BEST TO
DEFEAT THE UNKNOWNS,

149
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,750
AND THAT MEANT RALPH WEREC.

150
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,041
- MY BROTHER DIDN'T HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

151
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,375
HE WASN'T TOLD ANYTHING.

152
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,625
HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THEY WERE UNMANNED DEAGUE UNITS.

153
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,333
IT WAS ONLY AFTER
MY BROTHER DESTROYED

154
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,708
THE LAST MOBILE WEAPON
THAT HE LEARNED THE TRUTH.

155
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,791
- ONE TO GO.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,041
NOW IT'S DONE.

157
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,708
( gasps )

158
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,708
- WAIT A MINUTE, SOMETHING
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.

159
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,958
RALPH LEFT GRABERA IN
SEVEN THOUSAND THREE

160
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,166
STANDARD ERA, RIGHT?

161
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,916
WHICH MEANS HE SHOULD
STILL BE TRAVELING

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,458
AT SUB-LIGHTSPEED NOW!

163
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,958
HE HASN'T EVEN CAUGHT UP TO
THE TARGET AUXILIARY VESSEL YET!

164
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,291
- Carmichael: I GET IT.

165
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.

166
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,666
RALPH ACTUALLY CAUGHT
UP WITH THE TARGET

167
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,166
IN SEVENTY-FIVE SIXTY-FOUR
STANDARD ERA.

168
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,083
- BUT IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN HOW
DID HE MANAGE TO SHOW UP HERE?

169
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,250
HE COULDN'T HAVE!

170
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,375
- YES, HE COULD,
BECAUSE THE LAST GIRL

171
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:53,291
MY BROTHER DEFEATED
OPENED A GATE.

172
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,708
- Carmichael: BUT I THOUGHT
THE GATES WERE FOR

173
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,583
INSTANT TRANSPORTATION
THROUGH SPACE,

174
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,708
NOT TIME.

175
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,208
- Melchi: OF COURSE!

176
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,333
MULTIPLE TIMES EXIST WHEN
TRAVELING AT SUB-LIGHTSPEED!

177
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,708
AND SHE CHOSE RALPH'S SUBJECTIVE
TIME OF SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE!

178
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,958
- SO, THAT WOULD MEAN
THE BAXTER GATE CONNECTED

179
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,875
WITH SPACE IN SEVEN
THOUSAND FIVE, RIGHT?

180
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,958
- YEAH.

181
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,375
- AND THAT'S HOW RALPH WEREC
WAS CAPABLE OF RETURNING HERE.

182
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,416
- AMAZING. SIMPLY AMAZING.

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,125
- THIS IS ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE.

184
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,833
- WHEN IT HAPPENED, THE SUM
OF ALL OF THE MEMORIES AND

185
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,375
FEELINGS OF THE GIRLS.

186
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,833
THEY CAME, THEY FLOWED
STRAIGHT INTO MY BROTHER.

187
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,375
- ( Ralph screaming )

188
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:07,250
- Sara: AND THAT'S WHY,
HE WILL COME WITHOUT FAIL.

189
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,750
- Medlock: FINAL DECELERATION
COMPLETE. TARGET CONFIRMED.

190
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,625
AM I USELESS TO YOU NOW?
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?

191
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,166
- ( beeping )

192
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,291
- HEY. I NEED TO GO
TO THE RESTROOM,

193
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,750
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

194
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,375
DON'T TRUST ME?

195
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,000
( thinking ) WHAT COULD
THIS MAN BE THINKING?

196
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,208
IF I'D HAD ANY IDEA THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

197
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,416
I WOULDN'T HAVE...

198
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,916
AN OLD MODEL UNION SHIP?

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
STRANGE, HOW DID IT COME
THIS FAR IN THAT CONDITION?

200
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,916
- WE HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM
A RECONNAISSANCE TUMOR UNIT.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
- GOOD.

202
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,916
- Barrow: A SURVIVOR?

203
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,791
- I WISH TO DEFECT.

204
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,416
LET ME SPEAK WITH
YOUR COMMANDER.

205
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,250
I WISH TO DEFECT.
LET ME SPEAK.

206
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,125
I AM A REASONER OF
THE UNION, RALPH WEREC.

207
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,541
- Medlock: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

208
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,166
- Barrow: I HAVE
A HARD TIME BELIEVING

209
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,208
INSTANT INTERSTELLAR
COMMUNICATION IS POSSIBLE,

210
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,375
BUT, THERE IS
A CHANCE IT'S REAL.

211
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,250
IF IT'S WITHIN OUR
POWER TO OBTAIN IT,

212
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,833
I ADVISE WE GIVE IT A TRY.

213
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,958
- Medlock: INDEED.

214
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,416
- Barrow: IF WE
RETURNED HOME NOW,

215
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,083
WE WOULD HAVE THREE YEARS
UNTIL OUR NEXT OPERATION.

216
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,333
AND I DON'T DOUBT THEY WOULD
GIVE US A FULL VACATION.

217
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,458
- Medlock: SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WOULD RATHER

218
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,208
TAKE A SHOT AT GAINING GLORY?

219
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,333
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

220
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,875
- YOU'RE IN NEED
OF ANOTHER ONE?

221
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,125
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS
ONE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT

222
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,708
TO DEVELOP INSTANT
INTERSTELLAR COMMUNICATION?

223
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,125
- IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE,

224
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,583
A SENDER AND RECEIVER
ARE NECESSARY.

225
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,000
ONE OTHER EXISTS THAT
WOULD PARALLEL HER,

226
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,750
AND SHE WISHES FOR IT, TOO.

227
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,416
- ANOTHER TO PARALLEL HER.

228
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,791
WELL, WE'VE COME THIS FAR.

229
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,416
WE MIGHT AS WELL
SEE IT THROUGH.

230
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,708
THOSE EYES.

231
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,541
THOSE EYES ARE WHAT
CONVINCED ME TO...

232
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,958
DAMN IT!

233
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,875
I WAS SUCH AN IDIOT.
HOW COULD I LET HIM...

234
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,541
- ( thudding )
- ( gasping )

235
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,625
- ( groaning )

236
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,458
- Computer: YOUR IDENTIFICATION
HAS NOT BEEN AUTHENTICATED.

237
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,166
- THIS IS MY SHIP, YOU IDIOT!

238
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,958
- Computer: YOUR IDENTIFICATION
HAS NOT BEEN AUTHENTICATED.

239
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,291
ADMITTANCE INTO THIS
SECTION IS FORBIDDEN.

240
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,083
- COME ON!

241
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,833
I NEVER DREAMED I WOULD
ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE THIS.

242
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,708
- ( alarm blaring )

243
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,583
- Computer: THE SELF-DESTRUCT
MECHANISM HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.

244
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,916
- LETS GO.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,583
- Computer: ALL PERSONNEL,
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

246
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,541
THE SELF-DESTRUCT
MECHANISM HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.

247
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,833
- ( cries ) NO,
- ALL PERSONNEL,

248
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,458
- BROTHER!
- EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

249
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,375
- LISTEN, THIS SHIP
IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE

250
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,083
AND WE HAVE TO ESCAPE NOW!

251
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,583
- WHERE'S BROTHER? BROTHER!

252
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,541
- COME ON, SURELY EVEN
YOU CAN TELL THAT

253
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,458
YOUR "BROTHER"
HAS GONE CRAZY?

254
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,833
HE CAN'T TELL WHO'S ON HIS
SIDE AND WHO'S THE ENEMY!

255
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,583
IN FACT, IT WOULDN'T
SURPRISE ME IF

256
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,708
HE ATTACKED HIS OWN FLESH
AND BLOOD RIGHT NOW.

257
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,750
- ( whimpers )

258
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,208
- ( alarm blaring )

259
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,291
- ( coughs )

260
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
- Sara:
WHAT'S DRIVING MY BROTHER NOW

261
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,708
IS OVERWHELMING GUILT.

262
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,333
HE'S MADE A PROMISE,

263
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:16,291
AND HE FEELS BOUND BY A DUTY
TO SAVE ANY SURVIVORS.

264
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,041
I KNOW HE WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

265
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,166
HE HAS NO ALLIES OR ENEMIES.

266
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,250
- THEN, THIS SHIP
CAME UNDER ATTACK,

267
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,458
BECAUSE WE HAVE POSSESSION
OF THE MIMIC?

268
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,250
- IT WOULD'VE COMMUNICATED
TO THE OTHER ONE,

269
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,500
SO THEY WOULD KNOW
SHE WAS HERE.

270
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,125
- BUT, IT'S ONLY THE BRAIN NOW!

271
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,708
- Sara: I SUSPECT MY BROTHER
PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

272
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,583
- DOES THAT MEAN THIS
SHIP WILL BE SAFE

273
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,833
IF WE GIVE EMILY TO THEM?

274
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:42,291
- HEY, THAT BELONGS TO ME!
- SHUT UP, MELCHI!

275
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,375
- I TOLD YOU, MY BROTHER
IS BEING MOTIVATED NOW

276
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,041
BY AN INTENSE FEELING OF GUILT.

277
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
HE DESPISES ALL OF MANKIND
FOR THE TERRIBLE THINGS

278
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,833
THEY DID TO THE GIRLS.

279
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,416
IN HIS EYES, VENGEANCE MEANS

280
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,250
THE ANNIHILATION
OF ALL HUMANS.

281
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,166
- ( footsteps approaching )

282
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,583
- Lottie: I TAKE IT YOU HEARD?

283
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,083
- DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

284
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,125
I HEARD, BUT IT
DOESN'T CHANGE THE...

285
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,500
IT DOESN'T MEAN
CARRIS HAD TO...

286
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,625
- ( alarm blaring )

287
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,625
- YOU THINK THIS COULD
BE A REAL ATTACK?

288
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,041
- LET'S GO!

289
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,166
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

290
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,250
- Dufarge: IS IT A SHUTTLE?
- Female operator: YES, SIR!

291
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,750
IT'S SENDING A DISTRESS
SIGNAL AND CLOSING IN!

292
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,125
- Craven: IT'S NOT EVEN
THREE LIGHT-SECONDS AWAY!

293
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,166
TELL ME, WHY WASN'T
IT NOTICED SOONER?

294
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,291
- BECAUSE, SIR, WE WEREN'T
AT GALL LONG ENOUGH

295
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,625
TO REPAIR THE SENSORS!

296
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,000
- SIR, IT'S A MESSAGE
FROM THE SHUTTLE!

297
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,416
( exclaims ) IT SAYS
THEY WANT TO SURRENDER!

298
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,666
- SURRENDER?

299
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,166
- Male operator:
THE SENDER IS VIVIAN MEDLOCK,

300
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,166
CAPTAIN OF THE
DEAGUE SHIP KUNRUN!

301
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,083
- A DEAGUE CAPTAIN?

302
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,583
BUT WHY WOULD SHE SURRENDER?

303
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,625
- CONNECT US, SO I CAN
SPEAK WITH HER DIRECTLY.

304
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,750
- YES, SIR!

305
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,166
- THIS IS CRAVEN SPEAKING,

306
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,916
ACTING HEAD OF THE UNION
EXERCISE SHIP, LIBERTAD.

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,166
- I'LL SAVE THE DETAILS
FOR A LATER BRIEFING,

308
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,541
FOR NOW I REQUEST PERMISSION
TO COME ABOARD.

309
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,333
- Craven: TELL US WHAT HAS
HAPPENED, CAPTAIN MEDLOCK.

310
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,791
- I HAVE BEEN BOTH BETRAYED AND
THREATENED BY RALPH WEREC!

311
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,166
AND SO I'VE ESCAPED!

312
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,625
- ( alarm blaring )

313
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,333
- Medlock: THE MAN
HAS GONE INSANE!

314
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,916
HE MURDERED ALL OF MY CREW
AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE SHIP.

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,125
ALL TO GET TO THE
OTHER ONE YOU HAVE.

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,541
- ( buzzing )

317
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,333
- OTHER ONE?

318
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,291
- IT DOES SEEM TO MATCH UP
WITH THE ACCOUNT SARA TOLD US.

319
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,708
- AS LONG AS YOU CAN
GUARANTEE ME MY LIFE,

320
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,500
I'LL RETURN THE SAMPLE WE STOLE
FROM GRABERA LABORATORY.

321
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
- CAPTAIN MEDLOCK.

322
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,625
IF WE AGREED TO THOSE TERMS,
I HAVE NO DOUBT RALPH WEREC

323
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,708
WOULD COME AFTER US EVEN
MORE FIERCELY THAN BEFORE.

324
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,583
- Medlock: OH, I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT THAT IF I WERE YOU.

325
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,666
THE KUNRUN IS ABOUT
TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

326
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,208
- HEY, DO YOU THINK ALL DEAGUE
SOLDIERS WALK AROUND LIKE THAT?

327
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,708
- SURELY NOT!

328
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,291
- THEIR PHYSICAL CHECKUPS
MUST BE A BREEZE.

329
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,708
- EXCUSE ME, IS IT
THE UNION'S POLICY TO

330
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,250
KEEP CAPTURED OFFICERS NAKED

331
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,250
OR ARE YOU GOING TO
PROVIDE ME SOME CLOTHES?

332
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,166
- SO, THAT'S REALLY EMILY!

333
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,750
- ( beeping )

334
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,500
- ENEMY SHIP IS DETECTED!

335
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,666
IT'S CLOSING IN, SIR,
IT'S ON A COLLISION COURSE!

336
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,833
- HE'S TRYING TO TAKE THE
LIBERTAD DOWN WITH HIM.

337
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,041
- Dufarge: CAN WE SHAKE HIM OFF
WITH EMERGENCY ACCELERATION?

338
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,375
- MERCURION LEVEL RISING!

339
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,583
THREE MINUTES FORTY
SECONDS TO ACCELERATION!

340
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,375
- HE'S GOING TO CATCH UP TO US!

341
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,791
- Dufarge: ALL HANDS
TO BATTLE STATIONS!

342
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,750
YOUR MISSION IS TO DESTROY
THE APPROACHING ENEMY SHIP!

343
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,708
- Melchi: SARA, YOU STILL
HAVEN'T BEEN CLEARED FOR BATTLE.

344
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,375
BUT IF RALPH WEREC IS REALLY
OUT THERE GUNNING FOR US

345
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,708
THEN I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO FIGHT HIM.

346
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,791
- Sara: THANK YOU.

347
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,666
- Melchi: WE'LL GO
GET THINGS READY.

348
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,541
- Dufarge:
COURSE PROJECTION INDICATES THAT

349
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,583
IT'S COMING AT US IN
SUICIDE ATTACK MODE.

350
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,625
WE MUST DIVERT IT AT ALL COST!

351
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,000
- I'M AMAZED THAT YOU CAN
SLEEP AT A TIME LIKE THIS!

352
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,916
- DAMMIT. I DON'T
WANNA STAY HERE!

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,625
- STOP COMPLAINING!

354
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,458
JUST LEAVE THIS TO US AND FOCUS
ON WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP!

355
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,166
EASY ENOUGH, ISN'T IT?

356
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,041
- YEAH, THIS IS A DRAG BUT
I'M BEHIND YOU ALL THE WAY!

357
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,166
- THANKS A LOT.

358
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,333
- Craven: PREPARE FOR
EVASIVE MANEUVERS!

359
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,291
OPERATOR, HOW ARE
THE ENGINES HOLDING UP?

360
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,625
- OUTPUT INCREASING FOR BOTH

361
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,500
SECOND AND THIRD
AUXILIARY ENGINES!

362
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,666
ONE-TEN TO MAIN ENGINE DRIVE!

363
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,041
- ( clanging )

364
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,750
- ( whirring )

365
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,250
- ( whooshing )

366
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,250
- Male operator: GAMBEE
E-ZERO-ONE TO LAUNCH POSITION!

367
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,500
- ROGER!

368
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,041
- ( crackling )

369
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,333
- ( whirring )

370
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,291
- ( whooshing )

371
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,833
- ALL UNITS PREPARE TO STAY
CLOSE TO THE LIBERTAD

372
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,291
OR YOU'LL GET LEFT BEHIND!

373
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,791
- Lottie: ONLY FIVE OF US LEFT.

374
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,500
THE SPATIAL ARMOR DIVISION
LOOKS A LITTLE LONELY TO ME.

375
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,166
- Jessie: LOTTIE! IF THAT GLOIRE
SHOWS UP WITH US OUT HERE...

376
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,291
- I KNOW, JESS.

377
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,333
LIBERTAD BRIDGE,
DO YOU READ ME?

378
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,083
SEND HER OUT.
SEND SARA WEREC INTO BATTLE.

379
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,875
WE NEED HER HELP!

380
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,958
SHE CAN HELP STOP
THE DEAGUE SHIP.

381
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,916
SEND OUT SARA WEREC'S STRAIN!

382
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,750
- LOTTIE, ARE YOU SURE?

383
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,916
- THINK ABOUT IT,
SHE'S RALPH WEREC'S SISTER!

384
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,166
- I KNOW AND SO WHAT?

385
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,333
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
IT MAKE WHO SARA IS?

386
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,250
I JUST KNOW THAT SHE'S A MEMBER
OF THE SPATIAL ARMOR DIVISION.

387
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,041
AND THAT FACT ALONE
MAKES HER A FRIEND

388
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,375
WE CAN TRUST
WITH OUR LIVES.

389
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,500
- OH, LOTTIE!

390
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,833
- WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY.

391
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,833
- ALRIGHT, QUEEN, LET'S DO IT.

392
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,208
- WELL, HOW ABOUT WE GIVE
THEM A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY

393
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,041
UNTIL SHE CAN CATCH UP, OKAY?

394
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,333
- DID YOU GET THAT, BRIDGE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

395
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,458
- UM-HM.

396
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
CALL SARA NOW.

397
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,666
- STRAIN EX WILL PREPARE
TO LAUNCH IMMEDIATELY!

398
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,916
- WE MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS,

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,833
IF ALL GOES WELL THE LINK
SHOULDN'T MALFUNCTION AGAIN.

400
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,916
- HERE.

401
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,875
- THANKS VERY MUCH.

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,333
- ( siren blaring )

403
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,125
- BROTHER.

404
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:58,125
RALPH, I KNOW WHAT YOU SAW.
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU FELT,

405
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,291
BUT STILL...

406
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,500
I HAVE TO STOP YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!

407
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,041
- ( theme music playing )

408
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

409
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,708
- Sara: I KNOW THAT THE
BROTHER IN FRONT OF ME NOW,

410
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,750
ISN'T THE BROTHER I KNEW.

411
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,750
ON THE NEXT STRAIN,
ATTACK ON THE LIBERTAD.

412
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,708
- BROTHER, LET'S PUT
AN END TO THIS.
