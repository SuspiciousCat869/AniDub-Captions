1
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,458
- Sara: SARA WEREC. AT ONE TIME
THAT WAS MY NAME, BUT NO MORE.

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,166
I AM NOW KNOWN AS SARA CRUZ,

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,125
MOBILE TROOPS CADET AT THE
BASION TACTICAL TRAINING SCHOOL.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,666
THIS IS THE NEW ME.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,166
- Jake: TEAM SIX INTERCEPT.
TUMORS AT T SIX-FIVE-THREE.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,583
- Isabella: SIX-OH-ONE, ROGER!

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,958
- Female Student 1:
SIX-OH-TWO, ROGER!

8
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,333
- Female Student 2:
SIX-OH-THREE, ROGER!

9
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,583
- Male Student 1:
SIX-OH-FOUR, ROGER!

10
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,791
- Male Student 2:
SIX-OH-FIVE, ROGER!

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,708
- Jake: SIX-OH-SIX!
CADET CRUZ, RESPOND!

12
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,458
- SIX-OH-SIX, ROGER!

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,500
- WAKE UP AND DO
YOUR JOB, NEWBIE!

14
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,750
- Jake: STRAIN CONTACT.
COMMENCE EXERCISE!

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,875
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,208
- Female operator: EXERCISE
DURATION, TWENTY-THREE MINUTES.

18
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,500
STRAIN AND GAMBEE
CASUALTIES ZERO.

19
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,083
- Dufarge: HEADMASTER CRAVEN.

20
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,333
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL EXERCISE.
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

21
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,958
- HMM. YES, BOTH DIVISIONS
ARE DOING WELL.

22
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,416
- WAIT.
- WHAT IS IT, SIR?

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,916
- Craven: IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S DECIDED TO

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,166
GO OFF ON THEIR OWN.

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,291
JAKE, WHO IS THAT?

26
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,916
- THAT'S SARA CRUZ.
SHE PILOTS GAMBEE SIX-OH-SIX.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,625
SHE'S A TRANSFER,
GOT HERE THREE MONTHS AGO.

28
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,000
SHE'S A BIT BEHIND THE
OTHERS IN TERMS OF SKILL.

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,166
- INTERESTING.

30
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,083
SHE'S PERFORMING QUITE
WELL NONETHELESS.

31
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,333
- ( panting )

32
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,000
I COULD TAKE THESE OUT
SO EASILY IN A STRAIN.

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,791
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE NOW,

34
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,833
SINCE I LOST MY ABILITY
TO PILOT A STRAIN

35
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,000
WHEN MY MIMIC WAS DESTROYED.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,333
MY BROTHER BETRAYED ME THAT
DAY, AND I LOST EVERYTHING.

37
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,625
ALL THAT REMAINS,
NOW ARE QUESTIONS.

38
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,375
WHY DID MY BROTHER,
WHO WAS ALWAYS SO PATRIOTIC,

39
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,666
COMMIT TREASON?

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,375
WHAT IS IT,
THAT MADE HIM CHANGE?

41
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,416
WHAT HAVE THOSE COLD EYES
SEEN, SINCE HE'S BEEN GONE?

42
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,791
- EXERCISE COMPLETE.
ALL SHIPS RETURN TO BASE.

43
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,291
- Sara: IN ORDER TO
FIND THE TRUTH,

44
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,666
I'LL NEED TO CONFRONT MY
BROTHER FACE TO FACE.

45
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,833
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT,

46
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,083
IS TO GET TO THE FRONT
LINES OF THE WAR.

47
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,416
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE.

48
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,541
- Isabella: HEY CRUZ!
EVER HEARD OF TEAMWORK?

49
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,750
I'VE BEEN LOOKING THE
OTHER WAY SINCE YOU'RE NEW,

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,291
BUT NOW, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

51
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,000
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU CAN WIPE OUT

52
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,583
EVERY TUMOR BY YOURSELF?

53
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,916
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOOD
AT PILOTING A GAMBEE.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,958
OR MAYBE YOU'RE IN
DESPERATE NEED OF APPROVAL.

55
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,500
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

56
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,208
- NO.

57
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,791
I DID IT FOR A REASON,

58
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,208
BECAUSE THE TEAM WENT
AFTER WEAK TARGETS.

59
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,791
THAT'S HARDLY A
REALISTIC COMBAT SCENARIO,

60
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,958
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

61
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,833
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE!

62
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
- IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE
THAT IN REAL COMBAT,

63
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,125
TUMORS ATTACK IN GROUPS.

64
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,125
SO, TO WIN YOU HAVE TO
TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM.

65
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
- HOLD ON.
- (grunts)

66
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,000
WHAT IS IT, MARIETTE?

67
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,291
- Isabella: LOTTIE GELH FROM
THE ARMORED DIVISION!

68
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,041
- WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT,
DOWN THERE?

69
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,458
NOBODY LIKES A BULLY, ISABELLA.

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,333
- IT'S "MOBILE TROOP
DIVISION'S" BUSINESS,

71
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,583
SO BUTT OUT.

72
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,708
- WELL EXCUSE ME,
IT'S JUST THAT SARA CRUZ'S

73
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,500
STRATEGY IS CORRECT, SO I DON'T
SEE WHY YOU WOULD CHALLENGE IT.

74
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,791
BUT, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE A
GAMBEE PILOT OF YOUR CALIBER

75
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,750
WOULD ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR TARGETS.

76
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,833
IF THAT WERE THE CASE,
THEN OUR SHIP'S DEFENSES

77
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,708
WOULD BE PUT AT GREAT RISK,
WOULD THEY NOT?

78
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,791
- ( scoffs )

79
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,333
- GEEZ, LOTTIE. WHY DID
YOU HAVE TO GET INVOLVED?

80
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,291
- WHY? BECAUSE
I CAN'T STAND IGNORANCE.

81
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,166
BUT SARA CRUZ,

82
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,041
SHE PILOTS HER GAMBEE
AS IF SHE WERE A REASONER.

83
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,250
STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

84
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,541
- Roommate 1:
SHE IS SO NOT CUTE.

85
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,500
- Roommate 2: WHY'S SHE
SUCH A DOWNER ALL THE TIME?

86
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,791
- Roommate 3:
I THINK SHE'S CREEPY.

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,208
- ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE,

88
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,041
IT'S UP TO YOU,
TO ACCOMPLISH IT.

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,875
AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,

90
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,833
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO.

91
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,625
- Cadet: I HEARD YOU HAD A
LITTLE CONFRONTATION WITH

92
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,208
THE QUEEN OF SPATIAL
ARMOR YESTERDAY.

93
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,791
- YEAH, I DID.
THAT ANNOYING BITCH.

94
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,541
ALL I DID WAS GIVE THE NEWBIE
SOME ADVICE AND SHE SNAPPED.

95
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,500
- WHICH NEWBIE?

96
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,583
- HER. THE SMART ASS
BLONDE OVER THERE.

97
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,583
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
SHE CAME FROM.

98
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,416
EITHER WAY SHE'S USELESS.

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,333
- WHAT ABOUT THE
SUB-LIGHTSPEED TEST?

100
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,083
YOU THINK SHE'S GOOD
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT?

101
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,750
- HEY! YOU KNOW,
THAT REMINDS ME.

102
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,125
I HEARD HER ARGUING WITH JAKE
ABOUT SPEEDING UP HER TRAINING.

103
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,458
- SHE JUST TRANSFERRED HERE.
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'LL CATCH UP.

104
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,375
OR MAYBE SHE'LL DECIDE
TO START FLIRTING

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,666
WITH ALL THE INSTRUCTORS.

106
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
- ( cadets laugh )

107
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,291
- FORGET IT. HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

108
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,666
I CANNOT CHANGE THE TRAINING
SCHEDULE FOR ONE PERSON.

109
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,791
- BUT, SIR...

110
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,125
- ( sighs ) I DON'T
GET YOU, CRUZ.

111
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,416
WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A RUSH
TO FINISH YOUR TRAINING?

112
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,458
- BECAUSE, I...

113
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,625
- HERE'S WHAT I CAN DO.

114
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,500
PASS THE BASION DESCENT
EXERCISE IN FOUR WEEKS.

115
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,791
IF YOU CAN MANAGE THAT,

116
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,666
I'LL CONSIDER YOU FOR
THE SUB-LIGHTSPEED TEST.

117
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,708
- Dufarge:
THINK SHE CAN PULL IT OFF?

118
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,166
- Jake: I DOUBT IT.

119
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,625
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT
GIRL WILL REFUSE TO GIVE UP,

120
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,750
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

121
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,750
- ( grunts )

122
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
- ( beeping )

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,500
- THE THRUSTERS!

124
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,750
- ( alarm wailing )

125
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,875
- ( screams )

126
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,166
( breathes heavily )

127
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,583
- BEHIND ME IS A TUMOR.

128
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,250
THEY ARE THE GRUNTS
OF THE DEAGUE ARMY.

129
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:55,958
- DONE.

130
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,958
- Lottie: WAIT.
- IS THAT...

131
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,291
- IT'S THAT SARA CRUZ GIRL.
LET'S GO TALK TO HER, JESSIE.

132
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,291
- Female automated voice:
SWITCHING TO REQUESTED GRAVITY.

133
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,458
- WOW. YOU'RE REALLY
AT FOUR G'S?

134
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
LET'S TRY THAT.

135
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,958
- Female automated voice:
SWITCHING TO REQUESTED GRAVITY.

136
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,833
- WHY AM I DOING THIS?

137
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,875
- SO, I HEARD A RUMOR.

138
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,375
SOMETHING ABOUT A GAMBEE
PILOT REALLY PUSHING THE EDGE.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,625
WHAT ARE YOU IN
SUCH A HURRY FOR?

140
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,000
- I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

141
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,666
- WELL, YOU HAVE
GOT A POINT THERE!

142
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,458
YOU UP TO A CHALLENGE,
LIKE WHO GETS TIRED FIRST?

143
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,833
- SO THEN, I TOLD HER
THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTE...

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,125
IT'S HER!

145
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,875
- LET'S JUST SAVE
IT FOR ANOTHER TIME.

146
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,250
- Isabella: WHY'S LOTTIE
IN THERE WITH HER?

147
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,333
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
SHE THINKS SHE CAN MOCK ME.

148
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,750
- ISABELLA, WAIT.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,541
- ( panting )

150
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,041
HOW ARE YOU TWO ABLE
TO KEEP GOING LIKE THAT?

151
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,083
MY HEART'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE!

152
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,666
- SHEER WILLPOWER
IS THE ONLY THING

153
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,000
KEEPING ME UP AT THIS POINT.

154
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,583
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

155
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,291
- IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP, THEN YOU
BETTER STOP BEFORE YOU FAINT.

156
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,916
BESIDES, THIS IS
MY DAILY ROUTINE.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,625
- I'M NOT GOING TO FAINT!
I'M FINE!

158
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,958
- ( both panting )

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
- ( sighs )

160
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,958
( yawns )

161
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,083
- UH...

162
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,000
ALL THAT WORK FOR A TIE?
HOW LAME.

163
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,750
- YEAH. SHE'S GOT GUTS.

164
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,583
- LOTTIE, HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF THE SAYING,

165
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,666
"ALL THINGS IN MODERATION"?

166
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,916
HOW ARE YOU FEELING MISS CRUZ?

167
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,291
- EASY, YOU NEED TO STAY IN BED.
- BUT...

168
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,125
- YOU STILL HAVE AT LEAST AN
HOUR UNTIL YOUR IV IS DONE.

169
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,666
JUST TRY TO RELAX
UNTIL THEN, OKAY?

170
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,208
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE

171
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,541
WHO LIKES TO PUSH
THE LIMITS, EH LOTTIE?

172
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,666
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

173
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,583
- Female Operator:
INSTRUCTOR BEN HUGHES,

174
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,416
PLEASE REPORT TO THE
BRIDGE IMMEDIATELY.

175
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,708
- THAT'S ME. LIKE I SAID,
TRY TO GET SOME REST.

176
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,541
- YOU KNOW I NEVER ACTUALLY
THOUGHT YOU WOULD GO THAT FAR.

177
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,416
- MY NAME'S LOTTIE GELH.
AND YOU ARE?

178
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,208
- SARA. SARA...

179
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,000
- Female newscaster: WE'RE
JUST GETTING NEW INFORMATION

180
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,583
ON THE ATTACK OF GRABERA IN
- SARA CRUZ.

181
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,791
- THE YEAR SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT.
- SARA, HUH? NICE TO MEET YOU.

182
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,416
- A VIDEO SHOWING RALPH WEREC,
THE SUSPECTED DEAGUE DEFECTOR,

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,833
HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED
TO THE MEDIA.

184
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,875
THE VIDEO WAS RECOVERED
FROM A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

185
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,458
ON THE GROUNDS OF THE MILITARY
RESEARCH AND TRAINING FACILITY

186
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,208
THAT WAS DESTROYED
IN THE ATTACK.

187
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,958
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE RALPH WEREC,
WHO APPARENTLY LED THE ATTACK,

188
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,500
MOVING THROUGH THE FACILITY,
THOUGH IT IS STILL UNCLEAR

189
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,166
WHY THE ONCE NATIONAL
HERO AND PROLIFIC REASONER

190
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,958
DECIDED TO TURN ON HIS COUNTRY.

191
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,916
THE DISASTER CLAIMED
THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,208
OF STAFF, AS WELL AS YOUNG
RECRUITS STILL IN TRAINING.

193
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,333
- RALPH WEREC.

194
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,250
- TODAY YOU WILL BEGIN
YOUR DESCENT EXERCISE

195
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,916
INTO THE GAS CLOUDS
OF PLANET BASION.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,125
AFTER TODAY, THE SUB-LIGHTSPEED
EXERCISE WILL BE THE ONLY TEST

197
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,750
REMAINING BEFORE GRADUATION.

198
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,250
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE YET
TO QUALIFY FOR ADVANCEMENT,

199
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,375
THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO DO SO.

200
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,916
GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,791
THE OBJECTIVE IS TO
RETRIEVE A FLOAT

202
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,416
INSIDE THE GAS CLOUD
AND RETURN TO BASE.

203
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,166
- ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE,

204
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,000
ONLY YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IT.

205
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,500
AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,

206
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,375
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO.

207
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,875
THAT'S RIGHT.
I CAN DO ANYTHING!

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
- Jake: NO ONE HAS SUCCESSFULLY

209
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,375
FINISHED THIS EXERCISE
IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS

210
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,625
DUE TO THE EXTREMELY HARSH
ENVIRONMENT OF THE PLANET.

211
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,250
POWERFUL ELECTROMAGNETIC
STORMS ENGULF THE GAS CLOUDS

212
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,458
AND WILL MOST LIKELY INTERFERE

213
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,583
WITH THE ELECTRONICS
ON BOARD YOUR GAMBEE.

214
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,250
YOUR RADAR AND COMMUNICATIONS
UNIT WILL BE USELESS.

215
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,291
YOU MUST RELY ON YOUR OWN SKILLS
AND INSTINCTS TO SUCCEED.

216
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,125
- Melchi: ALRIGHT, THERE WE GO.

217
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,458
HEY, WILL YOU HAND
IT TO ME ALREADY?

218
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,583
( screams )

219
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:28,541
- GEEZ MELCHI. I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

220
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,250
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP, CARMICHAEL!

221
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,583
A.I. IS SUPPOSED TO LEARN
FROM REPEATED MISTAKES,

222
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,875
SO BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THAT WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCTIVE.

223
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,291
ALRIGHT, NOW GIVE ME THAT THING.

224
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,583
( screams )

225
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,083
- I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE LEARNING.

226
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,333
- ( Lottie chuckles )

227
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
SO, IS THAT A TECHNIQUE YOU
LIKE TO TEACH TO EVERYONE

228
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,625
IN THE ENGINEERING DIVISION?

229
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,708
- ( sarcastic laugh )

230
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,500
SO, WHAT EXACTLY BRINGS
THE QUEEN REASONER,

231
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,250
DOWN TO THE GREASE
MONKEY DUNGEON?

232
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,750
- WELL, I HAVE A
SMALL FAVOR TO ASK.

233
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,208
- I'M AT THE RIGHT
COORDINATES BUT...

234
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,000
- I FOUND HER.

235
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,416
- NO PROBLEM AT ALL!
- NICE.

236
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
- SO, WHY DO YOU
WANT TO WATCH THIS?

237
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,666
- I'M JUST CURIOUS
TO SEE HER IN ACTION.

238
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,708
- CONTACT!

239
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,458
WHAT THE...

240
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,625
- I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO STOP YOU, SARA.

241
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,750
- DAMMIT! WHY DID YOU
DO THAT, ISABELLA?

242
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,208
- IS IT NOT OBVIOUS?

243
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,500
IT'S BECAUSE I HATE YOU
AND I WANT TO SEE YOU FAIL.

244
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,541
- I WON'T BE BEATEN BY
A CONDESCENDING BITCH

245
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,125
WHO SUCKS UP TO REASONERS
WHENEVER SHE CAN.

246
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,791
- Carmichael: UH-OH, LOOKS
LIKE WE HAVE A CAT FIGHT

247
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,000
ON OUR HANDS.

248
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,083
- ISABELLA! WHAT IS SHE DOING?

249
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,625
- IT'S MINE!

250
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
NO!

251
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,208
- ISABELLA!

252
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,916
- ( alarm blaring )

253
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,041
- Carmichael: SHE'S IN
A CRASH ORBIT NOW.

254
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,791
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ACT RECKLESS.

255
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,583
- THE UNIT DOESN'T
APPEAR TO BE DAMAGED,

256
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,750
THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE THE
PILOT IS UNCONSCIOUS.

257
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,458
- WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT

258
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,500
FROM WHERE WE ARE?

259
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,916
LIKE REMOTE CONTROL?

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,125
- NO, THE GAS CLOUDS
ARE TOO THICK FOR THAT.

261
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,666
JAKE PROBABLY ISN'T EVEN
AWARE OF THE SITUATION YET.

262
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,291
- THEN?
- YEAH.

263
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,333
- Jake: EXCELLENT
WORK, CADET CRUZ.

264
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,083
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D
BE THE FIRST TO PASS THE TEST.

265
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,500
AS PROMISED, YOU
CAN NOW TAKE PART

266
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,125
IN THE SUB-LIGHTSPEED EXERCISE.

267
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,083
WITH YOUR
PERMISSION, HEADMASTER.

268
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,250
- YES. LET'S SEE
WHAT SHE CAN DO.

269
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,416
THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE
OF PILOT WE'RE IN DESPERATE

270
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,666
NEED OF ON THE FRONT LINES.

271
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,375
- YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT.
YOU HEAR ME?

272
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,250
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING
ATTACKING ME OUT THERE?

273
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,791
WERE YOU REALLY THAT DESPERATE
TO BEAT ME ON THE TEST?

274
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,958
SAY SOMETHING, DAMMIT!

275
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,375
DON'T WALK AWAY!

276
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,666
- I'LL BE REPORTING THIS
TO THE INSTRUCTOR.

277
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,416
- Lottie: YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

278
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,958
I THINK YOU'D END UP
FEELING EMBARRASSED

279
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,833
CONSIDERING THE FACTS.

280
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
- Mariette: EXCUSE ME?

281
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,125
- YOU COLLIDED WITH A METEOR
AND LOST CONTROL OF BOTH

282
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,000
YOURSELF AND YOUR
UNIT DURING A MISSION.

283
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,958
TELL ME, WHAT WOULD BE
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY

284
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,291
FOR HER TO SAVE YOU?

285
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,250
- WHAT THE...

286
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,166
- SARA SAVED
YOUR LIFE, ISABELLA.

287
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,333
- ISABELLA!

288
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,541
- WAIT!
- HOLD ON!

289
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,291
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STAND
UP FOR YOURSELF?

290
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,958
- OH NO!

291
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,708
WHERE IS IT? WHERE'S MY PENDANT?

292
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,625
IT MUST BE HERE SOMEWHERE!

293
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,541
OH, NO. DON'T TELL ME!

294
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,166
- ALRIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE HAVE TO WORK TO DO.

295
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,208
COME ON, GET OUT OF THERE.

296
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,458
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
- HUH!

297
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,875
- OH, WOW. IT'S A STRAIN.

298
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

299
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,250
ALL ALONE IN THE DARK.

300
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,625
YOU'RE SO DIRTY.
OH, YOU POOR THING.

301
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,291
NO WAY. YOU'RE A MIMIC!

302
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,291
EMILY.

303
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,208
I GUESS, YOU DON'T HAVE A
REASONER ANYMORE DO YOU?

304
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,833
YOU'RE ALL BY YOURSELF.
YOU MUST BE LONELY.

305
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,916
I KNOW, HOW YOU MUST BE FEELING.
IT'S AWFUL, ISN'T IT?

306
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,125
EVERYONE THAT WAS IMPORTANT
TO ME. I'VE LOST THEM ALL.

307
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,708
( crying )

308
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,166
IN MANY WAYS, WE'RE ONE AND
THE SAME, AREN'T WE, EMILY?

309
