00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,958
- Lottie: THIS IS IT, GUYS.
SPREAD OUT.

2
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,250
- CREW, REPORT.
- Both: IN POSITION.

3
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,375
- ( beeping )

4
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,916
- HERE WE GO. LET'S GET
IN THERE AND KICK SOME ASS!

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,166
( yelling )

6
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,875
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,000
- ( Lottie grunts )

8
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,791
- GOOD. LOOKS LIKE
WE MADE IT THROUGH

9
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,500
THE FIRST CLUSTER OF TUMORS.

10
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,416
IT'S ABOUT TIME TO BRING ON
THE NEXT BATCH.

11
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,458
THEY WERE PLAYING DEAD AGAIN.

12
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,333
- ( siren blaring )

13
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,041
- I'VE GOT ONE READY
TO SELF-DESTRUCT. DAMN IT.

14
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,958
- Sara: LOOKS LIKE
YOU NEED A HAND.

15
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,250
- SARA? WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

16
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,416
ALL UNITS PREPARE
FOR CHANGE IN FORMATION.

17
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,875
MARTHA, TAKE THE RIGHT WING.
ERMY, THE LEFT.

18
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,458
LAVINIA, YOU'RE
BRINGING UP THE REAR.

19
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,291
- Laivina: ROGER.
- Lottie: UNITS, GO.

20
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,625
- I WILL STOP YOU, BROTHER.

21
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
- ( siren blaring )

22
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,000
- ( breathing heavily )

23
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,250
- Automated voice: EXACTLY
THIRTY MINUTES TO SELF-DESTRUCT.

24
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,541
ALL HANDS,
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

25
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,833
- WAIT FOR ME, EMILY.
I'M COMING.

26
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,458
- Craven: WHAT IS THE STATUS
OF THE ENEMY SHIP?

27
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,833
- THE DEAGUE SHIP
IS STILL FOLLOWING

28
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,375
THE LIBERTAD CLOSELY, CAPTAIN.

29
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,333
- SO FAR THE STRAINS HAVE
NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO

30
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,583
BREAK THROUGH THE WALL OF TUMORS

31
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,875
SURROUNDING THE ENEMY VESSEL.

32
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,291
- DAMN. CAN'T WE SHAKE THEM OFF?

33
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,791
- WITHOUT FURTHER REPAIR,

34
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,083
WE STILL CAN'T ACCELERATE
ENOUGH TO LOSE THE DEAGUE SHIP.

35
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,458
- Dufarge: ALL RIGHT, PREPARE
THE REAR CANNONS FOR ATTACK.

36
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
AND FIRE.

37
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,000
- Lottie: WE HAVE CANNON FIRE
FROM THE LIBERTAD.

38
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,250
ALL UNITS EVADE.

39
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,625
- ( buzzing )

40
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,750
- ARE WE ON TARGET?

41
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,125
CONTINUE WITH THE
CANNON ASSAULT.

42
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,333
WE'RE TAKING THESE
BASTARDS DOWN.

43
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,000
WE HAVE TO EVADE.
SHIFT COURSE DOWNWARD.

44
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,583
- THERE'S NO TIME. WE HAVE
LESS THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS

45
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,000
BEFORE THE COLLISION, SIR.

46
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,458
- ALL HANDS, BRACE YOURSELVES
FOR IMMEDIATE IMPACT.

47
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,750
- WHAT THE... RUN.

48
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,416
- ( siren blaring )
- Operator: MAJOR DAMAGE

49
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,916
SUSTAINED IN PORT QUARTER BLOCK.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,750
ALL CREW MEMBERS
EVACUATE AT ONCE!

51
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,083
- WHAT IS THIS?

52
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,416
- Martha: THE LIBERTAD.

53
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,750
- ( gasps ) DAMN IT!

54
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,000
- ( gasps )

55
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,750
- I'VE FINALLY FOUND YOU,
RALPH WEREC!

56
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,916
WEREC!

57
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,208
HEY, SARA! DON'T JUST SIT THERE
AND STARE, GO AFTER THAT STRAIN.

58
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,625
GET OUT THERE AND FINISH HIM
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

59
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,333
- Operator: THE ENGINE BLOCK
IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

60
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,875
WE CAN'T MOVE.

61
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,833
- ( gasps )

62
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,541
- ( screams )

63
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,166
- Operator: ENEMY INTRUSION ON
STARBOARD BLOCK D TWENTY-FOUR!

64
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,541
LOWERING DEFENSE BARRIERS.

65
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,250
THE TUMORS HAVE BOARDED.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO.

66
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,875
- IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST
TWENTY MINUTES

67
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,666
TO REPAIR THE
DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE.

68
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,666
BUT IF THE DEAGUE SHIP
SELF-DESTRUCTS AT THIS RANGE,

69
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,166
WE'LL BE DEAD BY THEN.

70
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,416
- ( grunts ) THIS IS IT.

71
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,125
ALL HANDS MAKE READY
TO EVACUATE THE SHIP.

72
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,083
BEGIN PREPARATIONS TO BOARD
AND LAUNCH THE ESCAPE PODS.

73
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
- Melchi: NOT SO FAST.
- Both: HUH?

74
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,958
- UNTIL I HAVE FAILED TO
ACCOMPLISH THE TASK AT HAND,

75
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,875
PLEASE HOLD OFF
ON ABANDONING THE SHIP.

76
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:49,666
- HOLD OFF? WHAT TASK?
EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

77
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,500
- IF THAT DEAGUE WOMAN
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

78
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,833
WE HAVE TEN MINUTES LEFT.

79
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,083
PLENTY OF TIME FOR ME
TO STOP THE SELF-DESTRUCT.

80
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,000
AND WITH MY SKILLS, THIS
MISSION IS BARELY EVEN RISKY.

81
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,458
- BUT...

82
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,208
- ONCE MELCHI GETS A DUMB IDEA,
THERE'S NO STOPPING HIM.

83
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,083
- THANKS FOR THE OUTPOURING
OF SUPPORT.

84
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,208
- THEN I WILL HAVE
TO ACCOMPANY YOU.

85
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,125
- FINE. JUST TRY YOUR BEST
TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY.

86
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,375
- Automated voice:
EXACTLY FIFTEEN MINUTES

ALL HANDS, EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

89
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,333
- COME ON!
WHERE ARE YOU, DAMN IT?

90
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,291
- ( rumbling )

91
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,416
( rumbling continues )

92
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,375
- Ben: DAMN! THIS ISN'T GOOD.
GET FIVE MORE TRANSFUSION PACKS.

93
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,333
- NO, ON SECOND THOUGHT
YOU'D BETTER MAKE IT EIGHT.

94
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,500
- RIGHT.

95
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,166
- CADET MISERY, GO GET THE
CARDIAC MASSAGE PREPPED.

96
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,583
IMMEDIATELY.

97
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,500
BECKY, GO ASSIST THE EMERGENCY
TEAM OVER IN E BLOCK.

98
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,208
- I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

99
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,333
- I'M GONNA KILL RALPH WEREC.
- HMM.

100
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,333
- BUT THAT'S BROTHER.

101
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,500
- HUH?
- WHO WAS THAT?

102
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,166
- ( gasps )

103
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,083
- Man: HURRY UP! WORD
IS IN THAT THE TUMORS

104
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,875
HAVE ALREADY
BREACHED AREA FIFTEEN!

105
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,208
- ( loud explosion )

106
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,458

- ( gasps )

109
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,000
- EXACTLY WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

110
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,208
- HEY, DON'T GRAB HER LIKE THAT.
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT SHE'S SCARED?

111
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,958
- YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
- YEAH, DON'T BE SCARED.

112
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,500
BECKY AND I ARE GONNA
TAKE YOU SOME PLACE

113
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,083
YOU WON'T GET HURT, OKAY?

114
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,208
- ( all gasp )

115
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,416
- IT'S EMILY!

116
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,333
- ( all exclaiming in fear )

117
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,000
- STAY BEHIND ME.
- DO SOMETHING.

118
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,916
- ( loud explosion )

119
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,541
- SARA.

120
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,750
- LOOK WHO FINALLY
DECIDED TO SHOW UP.

121
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,291
- SARA, SARA, SARA,
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK.

122
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,083

00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,625
EMILY.

126
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,291
- Becky: YOU KNOW,
LOOKING AT HER LIKE THIS,

127
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,416
SHE SEEMS LIKE
SUCH AN ORDINARY LITTLE GIRL.

128
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,166
- I WONDER WHAT'S
SO SPECIAL ABOUT HER.

129
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,666
- YEAH, RIGHT?

130

131
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,333

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

132
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:46,375

137
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,416
- ALL RIGHT. WE MADE IT
ON BOARD SOONER THAN I THOUGHT.

138
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,958
CAN I GET A ROUND OF APPLAUSE
FOR OUR LOVELY TOUR GUIDE?

139
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,375
- OH, SHUT UP.

140
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,291
- HURRY UP, MELCHI. WE DON'T
HAVE VERY MUCH TIME.

141
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,083
- I HAVE THE SITUATION

- ( siren stops )

148
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,750
- SEE, I TOLD YOU THERE
WAS NO REASON TO PANIC.

149
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,250
ALL WE NEEDED WAS MELCHI'S
PATENTED HANDY HELPERS

150
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,083
AND WE FINISHED
WITH ROOM TO SPARE.

- OH, NO. THE COUNTER
JUST RESET.

155
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,416
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

156
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,916
- I SWEAR.
I HAVE NO IDEA. UNLESS...

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,625
- I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M IMPRESSED.
NICE WORK, RALPH WEEREC.

158
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:04,708
- THAT'S IT. I'M LEAVING.
I AM NOT GOING TO DIE IN HERE.

159
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,208
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

160
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,333
- ( gun clicking )
- DAMN IT.

161
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,583
- GOOD LUCK GETTING
THAT WEAPON TO FIRE

162
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,500
THROUGH A PRESSURIZED,
STEEL-REINFORCED PANEL.

163
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,708
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
THERE'S A FAR EASIER WAY

164
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,791
OF GETTING OUT OF HERE.

165
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
- YEAH? AND WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU'LL SEE.

166
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,708
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE, I THINK
WE OUGHT TO GIVE IT A TRY.

167
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,041
- Automated voice:
MANUAL DISARM DENIED.

168
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,666
EXACTLY NINE MINUTES
TO SELF-DISTRUCT.

169
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,791
- RALPH. ALL OF THIS
IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF HIM.

170
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,875
IF I HAD NEVER MET THAT MAN,
MY LIFE WOULD BE SO MUCH...

171
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,416
EVERYTHING WOULD BE SO...
SON OF A BITCH!

172
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,541
- ( buzzing )

173
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,250
- THAT BASTARD ACTIVATED
THE SECURITY UNITS.

174
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,000
MY SECURITY CODE. IN THIS SUIT,
THEY'LL THINK I'M THE ENEMY.

175
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,666
STAY BACK.

176
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,083
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M CAPTAIN VIVIAN MEDLOCK.

177
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,875
I'M NOT WITH THEM.

178
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,541
( exclaiming )

179
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,583
STOP. PLEASE GOD, STOP.

180
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,041
- ( screams )

181
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,083
- GIVE THE LITTLE GIRL TO ME.

182
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,000
- NO WAY. EMILY IS GOING
TO STAY RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

183
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,625
- GIVE HER TO ME.

184
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,250
- RALPH.

185
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,041
- ( rumbling )

186
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,458
- THE DEAGUE SHIP. WHAT THE...
BUT HOW?

187
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,958
- THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

188
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,416
- WE WERE UNABLE TO DISARM
THE SELF-DESTRUCT MECHANISM.

189
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,875
- WE'RE GOING TO
PULL AS FAR AWAY

190
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,000
FROM THE LIBERTAD AS WE CAN.

191
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,916
- NOW, WAIT ONE MINUTE HERE.

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,291
- Melchi: I'M NOT SURE HOW BIG
OF AN EXPLOSION TO EXPECT,

193
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,125
BUT WE MUST AVOID FURTHER
DAMAGING THE LIBERTAD.

194
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,625
FORTUNATELY,
BEING ON THE BRIDGE

195
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,583
GRANTS US THE CHANCE
TO LIMIT THE IMPACT.

196
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,791
- MAYBE FORTUNATELY
IS NOT THE WORD.

197
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,041
- NOT AT ALL.

198
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,333
- MELCHI, THIS ISN'T THE TIME.

199
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,291
STOP PRETENDING TO BE BRAVE.

200
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,875
- SHUT UP, CARMICHAEL.

201
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,041
- Lottie: INSTRUCTOR MELCHI.

202
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,041
- Ralph: LET'S GO, EMILY.

203
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,791
- MMM-MMM.

204
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,333
- CHILD, I SAID COME HERE!

205
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,500
- ( gasps )

206
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,708
- THAT'S...

207
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,916
- DON'T TELL ME.
IT'S NOT...

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,833
- Sara: THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER.

209
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,333
THE OTHER EMILY
YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR

210
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,666
IS NOW MY PARTNER, MY MIMIC,
AND MY BEST FRIEND.

211
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,208
- THAT CANNOT BE.

212
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:14,375
AH, YES. I UNDERSTAND.

213
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,375
- ( chuckles )

214
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:24,125
GIRL! COME DOWN HERE AT ONCE!
BRING THE DOLL AND COME WITH ME.

215
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,458
AND THE THREE OF US
WILL GO BACK TO YOUR HOME.

216
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,916
ALL OF THIS CAN BE OVER

217
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,500
IF YOU JUST TAKE THAT DOLL
AND COME BACK WITH ME.

218
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,250
THERE ISN'T ANY NEED
FOR YOU TO STAY HERE

219
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,166
AND ALLOW THESE
HUMANS TO ABUSE YOU.

220
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,958
COME ON. IT'S DONE.
IT CAN ALL BE DONE.

221
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,625
YOU COME BACK WITH ME!

222
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,083
GET OUT OF THE WAY, SARA.

223
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,041
I WARNED YOU BEFORE.
ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO

224
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,250
STAND IN MY WAY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

225
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,333
VERY WELL.

226
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,666
- Emily: NO!
- ( gasps )

227
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,791
- STOP. NO MORE.
- EMILY.

228
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,666
- I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

229
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,333
I WANT TO STAY.
I WANT TO STAY HERE WITH SARA.

230
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,333
- BUT YOU CAN'T.
WHY WOULD YOU?

231
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,875
YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME?

232
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,250
AFTER ALL I'VE DONE
FOR YOUR CAUSE?

233
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,458
- ARE YOU GOING TO KILL A LOT?
LIKE YOU DID BACK THEN?

234
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,416
- ( gasps )

235
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,458
- YOU KNOW YOU DID.

236
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,958
I WISH YOU HADN'T.
WE NEVER WANTED THAT.

237
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:44,833
- YOU DIDN'T?
BUT THAT'S NONSENSE.

238
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,208
AFTER ALL THAT, WHAT THEY...

239
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,708
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO YOU.

240
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,166
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
WE'VE COME THIS FAR.

241
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,458
WE'RE CLOSE. WE'RE SO CLOSE.

242
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
LET'S GO!

243
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,375
- NO. NOT THIS TIME.

244
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,375
- OF COURSE, YOU
WANTED THEM ALL DEAD.

245
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,625
THE HUMANS DESERVE TO DIE.

246
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,875
HOW CAN YOU FORGO YOUR REVENGE?
THE HUMANS HAVE TO DIE!

247
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,750
- I DON'T THINK SO.

248
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,291
- EMILY.

249
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:19,875
COME HERE. RIGHT NOW.
EMILY. COME HERE!

250
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,250
- SARA!

251
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,208
- ( gasps )

252
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,958
- SHE'S RIGHT.
NO ONE ELSE HAS TO DIE.

253
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,125
NOBODY WANTS THIS, RALPH.
NOBODY BUT YOU.

254
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,583
- YOU DON'T KNOW.
HOW COULD YOU UNDERSTAND?

255
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,416
- I KNOW HER. I KNOW EMILY.

256
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,666
BELIEVE ME.

257
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:58,583
I KNOW SHE HURTS,
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT THIS.

258
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,958
- Dufarge: WE HAD SOME
INCREDIBLE STUDENTS THIS YEAR.

259
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
- I GUESS. BUT I
THOUGHT A LOT OF THEM

260
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,916
WERE JUST BEING SMARTASSES.

261
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,458
- ( loud explosion )

262
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:25,333
- DON'T BE STUPID. YOU KNOW
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU DO THIS.

263
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,750
"I WON'T LET ANYONE ELSE DIE."
REMEMBER SAYING THAT, SARA?

264
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,041
- BROTHER, IT'S TIME
WE PUT AN END TO ALL OF THIS.

265
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,125
- SHUT UP. SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

266
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,125
- ( loud explosion )

267
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,583
- THE LAST FEW TUMORS
ARE BEGINNING TO REGROUP.

268
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,041
I THINK WE SHOULD HEAD BACK NOW.

269
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,541
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

270
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,291
- I SAY LET'S GO AND FINISH OFF
THE REST OF THOSE SUCKERS.

271
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,875
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO
GET THESE TUMORS OFF THE SHIP.

272
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,708
- FOR WHAT? WHY HAVE YOU
DONE THIS TO ME?

273
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,708
WHY AM I THE ONE
WHO GETS THE BLAME?

274
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,041
- BROTHER!

275
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,166
- SARA!

276
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,458
- SARA.
- I'M OKAY.

277
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,375
- BECKY, DICKON, WOULD YOU LOOK
AFTER HER FOR ME?

278
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,750
- HUH?

279
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,125
- JUST FOR NOW.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,708
- IT'LL BE OKAY.
I WILL COME BACK FOR YOU.

281
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,500
- ( engine revs )

282
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,541
- DON'T GO.

283
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,000
- SARA.

284
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:55,125
- RALPH. THIS IS IT.
NO MORE HURT AND LONELINESS.

285
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,708
I'M FINALLY GOING TO PUT
A STOP TO IT, RIGHT NOW.

286
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,083
- ( theme song playing )

287
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

288
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,375
- Sara: MY BROTHER
IS DEAD WRONG.

289
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,375
AND I SWEAR I WILL STOP HIM.

290
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,041
ON THE NEXT STRAIN, LAST WALTZ.

291
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,666
LET'S GO, EMILY.
