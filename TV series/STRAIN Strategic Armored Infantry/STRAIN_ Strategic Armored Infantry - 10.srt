1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,000
- Melchi: WOW.
I KNEW IT WAS OLD, BUT...

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,500
THE CONNECTORS USE A STANDARD

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,541
THAT'S BEEN AROUND
FOR GENERATIONS.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,916
STILL.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,166
- YEAH, SIX HUNDRED
YEARS OLD, HUH?

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,958
THAT KINDA MAKES MY HEAD HURT.

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,958
YOU REALLY DIDN'T
NOTICE ANYTHING

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,416
WHILE YOU WERE
TINKERING WITH HER?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,916
- WHY WOULD THAT EVEN CROSS
MY MIND WHILE I'M WORKING?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,250
I WAS FOCUSED
ON OTHER THINGS, YOU KNOW.

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,208
- LET'S TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,875
STRAINS WERE FIRST
DEVELOPED, ABOUT WHAT,

13
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,083
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO?

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,791
- YES, BUT I BELIEVE
I HEARD THAT

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,208
MIMICS WERE ENGINEERED MUCH
EARLIER THAN THE STRAINS.

16
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,750
- AND THAT COULD MEAN
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,250
ONE OF THE VERY FIRST MODELS.

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,291
- Ben: SO CAN WE ASSUME
THAT THE ENEMY'S ATTACKS

19
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,000
ARE AIMED AT GETTING THIS MIMIC?

20
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,666
- Melchi: WE CAN'T SAY
THAT FOR SURE, YET.

21
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,791
MAY I TAKE A LOOK INSIDE?

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,916
- GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,250
- I HEARD THAT
SARA TESTED NORMAL,

24
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,916
WHICH MEANS THERE
HAS TO BE SOMETHING

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,125
ABOUT THIS MIMIC
WE DON'T KNOW.

26
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,125
SEE, I REALLY HADN'T
GOTTEN THE CHANCE

27
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,375
TO CLOSELY EXAMINE
EITHER ONE OF THEM, YET.

28
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,625
( gasps )

29
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,708
- ( all gasp )

30
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,916
- MY WORD.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,458
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

32
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,208
- Ben: THIS IS NOT
FROM A HUMAN BEING.

33
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,333
- WELL THEN,
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

34
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,166
- IT'S DEFINITELY A BRAIN,
BUT WHAT KIND IS IT?

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,666
- Carmichael: SO SARA ACTUALLY
LINKED WITH THAT THING?

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,250
- Melchi: NO WONDER
IT ACTED DIFFERENTLY

37
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,583
AND WE COULDN'T FIGURE
OUT HOW IT HAPPENED.

38
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,458
SARA DIDN'T LINK WITH THIS.
IT PROBABLY LINKED WITH HER!

39
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,833
- ( theme music playing )

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

41
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,291
- Ben: I MUST SAY.

42
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,166
I KNOW OF NO CREATURE
THAT HAS A BRAIN LIKE THIS.

43
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,458
- Craven: WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

44
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,208
- YOU THINK IT'S FROM AN ALIEN?
CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE?

45
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,458
- Melchi: ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,
AND WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

46
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,208
BUT REALLY, THE MORE
PRESSING QUESTION IS

47
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,333
WHY THIS WOULD EVEN EXIST.

48
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,833
- IF THE DEAGUE KNOW ABOUT IT,

49
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,416
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THEY'D WANT
TO GET THEIR HANDS ON HER.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,208
- I THINK I NEED TO PERFORM
A DETAILED EXAMINATION.

51
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,833
GIVE ME A HAND, WOULD YA,
BEN? CARMICHAEL?

52
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,208
- Emily: NO.

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,125
NO. NO!

54
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,583
( gasps )

55
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,708
( staggered breathing )

56
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,791
- Ralph: WHAT IS IT?

57
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,666
- IT'S HER!
OH, PLEASE, HELP HER!

58
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,166
SHE NEEDS US!

59
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,166
HURRY!

60
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,875
PLEASE!

61
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,375
HELP HER!

62
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,666
PLEASE HELP!

63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,750
HELP HER!

64
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,500
- IF WE DON'T HURRY, THEN...
- I ALREADY KNOW.

65
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,750
- Medlock: OUR TIME IS UP.

66
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,500
IF WE DON'T FINISH
OUR COURSE CHANGE

67
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,958
BY TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS TOMORROW

68
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,541
AND RENDEZVOUS
WITH THE MAIN FLEET,

69
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,750
WE WILL MISS OUR OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

70
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,750
SO, WE CAN'T ALLOW OURSELVES
TO BE SIDETRACKED ANYMORE.

71
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,291
I WILL GUARANTEE YOUR
STATUS, OF COURSE.

72
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,041
AFTER ALL,
WE'VE OBTAINED A COMPONENT

73
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,083
OF INSTANT INTERSTELLAR
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY.

74
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,708
I WON'T LET ANYONE QUESTION YOU.

75
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,458
I PROMISE I'LL PROTECT
YOU NO MATTER WHAT,

76
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,750
SO DON'T WORRY, RALPH.

77
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,208
I'M GOING TO USE
A SHOWER FIRST, ALRIGHT?

78
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,250
( gasps )

79
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,250
( exhales )

80
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,083
- ( clicking )

81
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,125
IT'S LOCKED.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,375
IS THAT YOU, RALPH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
RALPH? RALPH?

84
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,958
- HM?

85
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,500
WELL, NOW.

86
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,625
RALPH. I TAKE IT
YOU'VE COME TO COMPLAIN?

87
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,250
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE TOO LATE.

88
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,833
YOU'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE
YOUR WAY UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

89
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,000
BUT FROM NOW ON...

90
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,500
( gasps )

91
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,708
( grunts )

92
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,750
- ( women scream )

93
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
- ( beeping )

94
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,083
- ( woman gasps )

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,791
- ( gunshots )

96
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,833
- ( gunshot )

97
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,333
- Ralph: I'M CLOSING IN.
I SHOULD SEE IT ANY MOMENT NOW.

98
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,875
THE TARGET! I SEE IT!

99
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,416
NO SIGN OF THE ENEMY,
I'M MAKING CONTACT.

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,750
LOOKS LIKE THE HULL HAS
SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.

101
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,375
( gasps )

102
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,041
- Ralph: WHAT WAS THAT THING?

103
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,375
MAYBE IT WAS THE NEW ENEMY MODEL
WE'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT.

104
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,916
THESE THINGS ALMOST
LOOK LIKE STRAINS.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
HOW DID THE DEAGUE MANAGE TO

106
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,333
GET THEIR HANDS ON
STRAIN TECHNOLOGY?

107
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,250
ONLY ONE LEFT.

108
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,958
( thinking ) ONLY ONE LEFT.

109
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,500
- NO!

110
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,291
PLEASE DON'T!

111
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,083
- WHAT?

112
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,000
THERE'S A PERSON?

113
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,250
THEY'RE NOT UNMANNED?

114
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,208
IT'S A...

115
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,583
IT'S A KID. A KID!

116
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,166

118
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,291
STAY IN YOUR ROOM.

( grunting )

124
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,416
STOP IT! STOP IT!

( grunts )

126
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,625

- ( switch clicking )

129
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,541
AH!

130
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:25,916
- GET OUT.

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,125
- CAN I GET DRESSED?

132
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,000
- I'VE DISPOSED OF YOUR CLOTHES.

133
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,958
- RIGHT. YOU MEAN
YOU DISPOSED OF

134
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,583
ANYTHING THAT HAS MY
IDENTIFICATION ON IT

135
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,166
TO PREVENT ME
FROM GETTING AWAY.

136
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,041
A SINGLE TOWEL, REALLY?

137
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,958
I HOPE SOMEONE DOESN'T
HAPPEN TO SEE ME.

138
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,000
- THERE'S NO ONE LEFT
TO SEE YOU.

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,041
- ( gasps )

140

( gasps )

142
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,083
RALPH, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US?

143
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,125
- WE WILL CONTINUE
IN OUR PURSUIT.

144
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,958
ONE PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE
TO PILOT THIS SHIP.

145
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,666
QUICKLY. THERE'S
NO TIME TO WASTE.

146
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,666
- YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,666
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON
TO PILOT THE KUNRUN.

148
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
AND LUCKY FOR YOU I'M EVEN
SKILLED ENOUGH TO CONDUCT

149
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,458
SUB-LIGHT SPEED TRAVEL WITHOUT
ASSISTANCE FROM ANYONE ELSE.

150
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,791
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAD TO...

151
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,375
WHY, RALPH?
WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?

152
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,458
TELL ME WHAT I DID
TO DESERVE THIS?

153
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,916
I'VE BEEN ON YOUR SIDE
FROM THE BEGINNING!

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,791
I'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT HELP YOU IN ANY WAY I COULD!

155
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,833
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

156
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,583
TELL ME WHY!

157
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,125
WHY, RALPH?

158
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,875
- Female operator: TEN SECONDS

TRAVELING AT SUB-LIGHT SPEED

165
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,416
TOWARD PLANET BREGMA,

166
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,875
WHICH WAS OUR
ORIGINAL DESTINATION.

167
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,458
WE ARE SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE THERE
IN TWO DAYS' SHIP TIME.

168
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,375
UNION FORCES ON BREGMA

169
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,500
ARE REPORTEDLY CONDUCTING
SEVERAL LARGE SCALE EXERCISES,

170
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,000
AND WE WILL CONSULT WITH HIGH
LEVEL MILITARY OFFICERS THERE.

171
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,583
AFTER RESUPPLYING AND
REPAIRING THE LIBERTAD,

172
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,250
AS WELL AS TAKING CARE OF
OTHER NEEDS AND OPERATIONS,

173
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,625
WE PLAN TO RETURN HOME.

174
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,208
- WHAT DOES "OTHER NEEDS
AND OPERATIONS" MEAN?

175
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,250
- HE MEANS SARA, OBVIOUSLY.

176
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,916
- WELL, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER?

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,291
- WHO KNOWS.

178
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,791
THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST
HAND HER OVER TO THE ARMY

179
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,083
AND LET THEM WORK IT OUT THERE.

180
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,041
- SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T
SEEM RIGHT ABOUT THIS,

181
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,083
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

182
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,791
- OKAY, ALL DONE.

183
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,833
- HEY, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO SARA,

184
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,000
WOULD YOU, BECKY?

185
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,875
- UH. NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD.

186
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,875
- DAMN IT!

187
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,958
- ( gasps )

188
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,958
- Craven: THE UNEXPECTED
AND MULTIPLE INCIDENTS

189
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,625
ON THIS VOYAGE HAS SADLY LEFT
US WITH MANY CASUALTIES.

190
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,666
HOWEVER, I WOULD ASK THAT YOU
TAKE THIS EXPERIENCE WITH YOU,

191
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,166
AND USE IT WELL IN YOUR
POST GRADUATION DUTIES.

192
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,208
THAT IS ALL.

193
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
- ( footsteps approaching )

194
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,666
- Melchi: COME ON, CRAVEN!

195
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,541
I'VE COMPROMISED
AS FAR AS I CAN

196
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,583
AND I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
SHORT OF DISSECTING IT

197
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,958
TO GET A GOOD ANALYSIS!

198
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,500
HOW CAN YOU REFUSE SUCH
A TINY REQUEST, HUH?

199
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,208
- ( grunts )

200
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,833
ALRIGHT, FINE, BUT ONLY
UNTIL WE REACH BREGMA.

201
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,041
- THANK YOU!

202
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,958
THAT'S THE CRAVEN
I KNOW AND LOVE!

203
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,166
I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK!

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,833
- ( door humming )

205
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,166
- ( grunts )

206
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,666
HE'S TOO MUCH.

207
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,708
I GIVE UP.

208
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,666
- ( door humming )

209
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,791
- COME ON.

210
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,791
OKAY, I BROUGHT HER.

211
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,833
- GOOD WORK.

212
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,000
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING TO EMILY?

213
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,958
- WE WANTED TO TAKE A CLOSER
LOOK AT THE MIMIC INSIDE HER.

214
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,541
SARA.

215
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,916
DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS MIMIC WAS
CREATED SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO?

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,458
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

217
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,333
- YEAH, AND THIS WOULD
ALL MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE

218
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,958
IF YOU WERE ALSO BORN
SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

219
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,583
BUT SINCE YOU'RE
RALPH WEREC'S SISTER

220
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,875
I THINK WE CAN
SAFELY RULE THAT OUT.

221
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,375
- EMILY, WHO ARE YOU?

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,041
- ( beeping )

223
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,333
- COURSE PREDICTION COMPLETE.

224
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,416
THE ENEMY SHIP'S
DESTINATION IS PLANET BREGMA.

225
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
AFTER THE INCIDENT AT
THE GALL SUPPLY DEPOT

226
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,416
I'M GUESSING THEY'RE AWARE
THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING THEM.

227
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,708
I SHOW MILITARY
PRESENCE ON BREGMA.

228
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,458
ARE WE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO TRACK?

229
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,583
- WE ARE.

230
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,333
- WE'RE AT A DISADVANTAGE
IF WE ENGAGE IN COMBAT.

231
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:18,000
AS SECOND IN COMMAND, BARROW HAD
THE TUMOR ACTIVATION PASSWORD.

232
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,375
IF WE CAN'T ENGAGE TUMORS

233
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,041
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE
CONSIDERED UNARMED.

234
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,250
- YES, I KNOW.

235
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,416
- WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

236
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,875
WHAT WOULD POSSESS YOU
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

237
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,500
- I DON'T GET HOW IT IS
THAT I CAN LINK

238
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,875
WITH A SIX HUNDRED YEAR
OLD MIMIC LIKE THAT.

239
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,958
I MEAN, STRAINS DIDN'T EVEN
EXIST BACK THEN, DID THEY?

240
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,083
- THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU IN
HERE SARA, TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

241
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,708
YOU DO WANT TO KNOW, DON'T YOU?

242
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,750
- WELL, I...

243
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,291
- I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED TO THE LIBERTAD

244
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,666
HAS TO REVOLVE
AROUND THIS MIMIC.

245
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,083
THEREFORE, I NEED TO
INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY.

246
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,916
BESIDES, IF DON'T LEARN
WHO THIS MIMIC IS,

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,583
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
YOU MAY NEVER DISCOVER

248
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,500
WHAT YOUR BROTHER
IS TRYING TO DO.

249
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,375
- YOU'LL NEVER MOVE FORWARD
UNLESS YOU ACT, SARA.

250
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,083
- Melchi: LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
JUST RANDOMLY SEEING

251
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,291
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
START UP THIS TIME.

252
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,750
YOUR GOAL IS TO LINK
EVEN DEEPER THAN USUAL,

253
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,625
AND GET ANY INFORMATION
YOU CAN FROM THE MIMIC.

254
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,083
I'VE HONESTLY NEVER DONE
ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS BEFORE,

255
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,250
AND I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

256
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,166
SO BE EXTRA CAREFUL.

257
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,958
- ALL SENSORS ARE GO.
ACTIVATION SET UP COMPLETE!

258
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,666
- ALRIGHT! LET'S GET TO IT THEN!

259
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,916
- MELCHI.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,750
I'M WONDERING IF
WE SHOULD TELL HER

261
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,708
THE BRAIN INSIDE
EMILY ISN'T HUMAN?

262
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,083
- I DON'T THINK
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW YET.

263
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,541
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WOULD ONLY FREAK HER OUT.

264
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,083
SARA, PREPARE TO BEGIN.

265
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,166
- RIGHT.

266
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,125
- ( machine whirring )

267
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,666
- EMILY?

268
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,208
- ( alarm beeping )

269
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,333
- OH NO,
THE LINK LEVEL IS TOO HIGH!

270
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,041
THREE TIMES MORE THAN PREDICTED!

271
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,083
- BUT HOW?

272
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,375
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WEIRD

273
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,875
WHEN YOU WERE
DISSECTING IT, DID YOU?

274
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,625
- NO! WAIT.

275
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,916
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT

276
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,291
THE MEMORY CORTEX
HAS BEEN STIMULATED?

277
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,375
- WHAT IS THIS?

278
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,541
ARE THESE HER MEMORIES?

279
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,583
- ( clanking and clattering )

280
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,875
- WHAT THE...

281
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,333
- OH, WOW.

282
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,375
WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK
EXACTLY THE SAME?

283
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,666
- CLONES!

284
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,625
COULD THESE ACTUALLY BE
THE NEWEST DEAGUE WEAPONS?

285
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,875
- Sara: NIEREN SIX.

286
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,875
SIXTY THREE SIXTY ONE.

287
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,041
OVER SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

288
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,625
- Scientist 1: FROM ALL
OUTWARD APPEARANCES,

289
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
THEY APPEAR TO BE LITTLE
GIRLS FROM OUR WORLD,

290
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,166
BUT THEIR INTERNAL COMPOSITION

291
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,333
IS FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT FROM OURS.

292
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,583
THESE ARE ACTUAL ALIENS.

293
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,708
- ARE WE SAYING THAT THIS IS
MANKIND'S FIRST CONTACT?

294
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,541
- YES, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
EVEN MORE FASCINATING THAN THAT.

295
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,875
- Scientist 3:
THEY ALL SEEM TO SHARE

296
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,750
A COLLECTIVE
CONSCIOUSNESS.

297
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,458
- Scientist 2: SHARE?

298
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,000
- Scientist 3: THAT'S RIGHT,
AND WITHOUT ANY TIME LAG.

299
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,625
- Scientist 4:
BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE FAR AWAY

300
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,708
FROM ONE ANOTHER?

301
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,666
- Scientist 3:
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE,

302
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,500
EVEN LIGHT YEARS APART.

303
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,041
- Scientist 4:
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY!

304
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,000
- NONE OF OUR ANESTHETICS
SEEM TO BE WORKING ON THEM,

305
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,250
NOW DO THEY?

306
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,166
- Doctor 1: NO,
THEY'RE STILL RESEARCHING IT.

307
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,458
- Doctor 2: BUT IF THEY ALL
SHARE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS,

308
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,375
THEY'LL GET USED TO BEING
DISSECTED ANYWAY, RIGHT?

309
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,833
- ( burbling )

310
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,833
- YOU SEE, SHARING CONSCIOUSNESS

311
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,875
IS SYNONYMOUS WITH
SHARING INFORMATION.

312
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,250
IF WE CAN CLARIFY HOW
THIS ABILITY WORKS

313
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,458
THROUGH OUR RESEARCH,

314
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,333
IT COULD MEAN A NEW
SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATION

315
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,916
THAT WOULD LITERALLY
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,625
JUST IMAGINE,
INSTANT COMMUNICATION

317
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,708
BETWEEN STAR SYSTEMS
LIGHT YEARS APART

318
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,666
WOULD BE MADE POSSIBLE!

319
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,375
- Army officer: IF WE CAN
MAKE THIS A REALITY,

320
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,166
IT WILL MEAN GREAT THINGS
FOR FLEET OPERATIONS.

321
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,375
- Guide: AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

322
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,583
IF INSTANT COMMUNICATION
BECOMES ACHIEVABLE,

323
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,625
THEN THE SUGGESTION THAT IT
WOULD ACTUALLY BE POSSIBLE

324
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,208
TO SURPASS THE SPEED OF LIGHT

325
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,250
WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHALLENGE
EVERYTHING WE THINK WE KNOW.

326
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,125
- ARE YOU SAYING WE COULD MOVE
OUR TROOPS FASTER THAN LIGHT?

327
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,666
- ACTUALLY, IT WOULD
MAKE DISTANCE ITSELF

328
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS.

329
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,375
INSTANT TRANSPORTATION WOULD
BECOME A POSSIBILITY, AND...

330
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,000
- IS IT USABLE?

331
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,166
- WELL, THIS IS ALL YOU NEED
FOR INSTANT COMMUNICATION.

332
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,166
ANYWAY, WE'RE LOW
ON SAMPLES NOW, SO.

333
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,041
- Doctor 3: YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SENT TO GRABERA NOW.

334
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,375
DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GO TO SLEEP
AND BE THERE IN A FLASH.

335
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,083
OH, YEAH.

336
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,750
I HEARD THEY'RE WORKING
ON A SPECIAL WEAPON

337
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,125
THAT USES YOUR
TECHNOLOGY AND ABILITIES.

338
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,833
WHAT'D THEY CALL IT? A STRAIN?

339
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,125
- Sara and Emily:
I'M BEING TAKEN TO THAT PLANET.

340
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,791
AND I CONTINUED TO FOLLOW ME,

341
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,208
SO THAT I COULD TAKE ME BACK.

342
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,791
BROTHER.

343
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,458
- WHAT WAS THAT THING?

344
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,958
MAYBE IT WAS THE NEW ENEMY
MODEL WE'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT.

345
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,833
- Sara and Emily:
HE CONTINUED...

346
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,500
TO...

347
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,375
KILL ME...

348
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,000
IN THE DISTANT FUTURE.

349
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,500
- ( gasps )

350
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,375
BUT, WHY? WHY A LITTLE GIRL?

351
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,625
- ( giggles )

352
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,333
- HOW COULD I...

353
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,583
WE DO SOMETHING SO UNFORGIVABLE?

354
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,958
- Sara: THAT'S HOW
MY BROTHER LEARNED.

355
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,208
- Emily: WHAT HE...
WHAT THE UNION PEOPLE...

356
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,208
- Sara and Emily:
WHAT THE UNION HAD DONE TO US.

357
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,750
- HOW CAN I EVER MAKE
ATONEMENT FOR DOING THIS?

358
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,208
- YOU CAN, BROTHER. YOU CAN.

359
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,416
- ( gasps )

360
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
- YOU CAN IF I OPEN
THE BAXTER GATE INSIDE OF ME.

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,958
- SHE NEEDS US!

362
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
HURRY!

363
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,541
PLEASE!

364
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
- ( alarm beeping )

365
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,958
- WE'VE TOTALLY
LOST CONTROL HERE!

366
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,916
HER MENTAL LOAD
IS GOING TO HIT THE RED ZONE

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,291
IF WE DON'T DO
SOMETHING QUICKLY!

368
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,750
- ( panting )

369
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,625
- ( beeps )

370
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,000
- ( panting )

371
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,416
SARA! ARE YOU OKAY?

372
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,666
- Sara: I SEE NOW.

373
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,375
SO THAT'S WHY MY BROTHER IS...

374
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,250
( sobs )

375
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,250
- ( beeping )

376
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,791
- ( machine thrumming )

377
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:09,375
- Barrow: THERE, SO HE IS A MAN
WHO BETRAYS HIS ALLIES.

378
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,125
I KNEW THIS WOULD
HAPPEN EVENTUALLY,

379
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,250
BUT IT ALL ENDS TODAY.

380
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,625
- I'M ASSUMING THE TUMORS
WILL ACCEPT MY ORDERS

381
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,458
IN THEIR CURRENT STATE?

382
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,875
- DAMN YOU! YOU PLANNED
THIS FROM THE START!

383
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,458
- ( gunshot )

384
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
- Girl: FINAL
DECELERATION COMPLETE.

385
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,291
- Female operator 1:
SYNCHRONIZATION WITH

386
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,833
OBJECTIVE TIME COMPLETE.

387
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,416
- Female operator 2:
HAILING THE STATIONED FLEET.

388
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,375
- Craven: MM.

389
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,250
IT'S FINALLY OVER NOW.

390
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,958
- Dufarge: YES.

391
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,958
- Male operator 1: COMMANDER,
I'VE GOT SOMETHING!

392
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,166
- WHAT IS IT?

393
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,791
- THE FORCES.
ALLIED FORCES AREN'T HERE!

394
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,541
- WHAT?
- ARE YOU CERTAIN? CHECK AGAIN.

395
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,375
- YES, SIR. I DON'T SHOW ANY...

396
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,916
SIR, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE CRAFT
IN THE PLANET'S VICINITY!

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
- Craven: WHAT? HOW CAN THAT BE?

398
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,375
- ( theme music playing )

399
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

400
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,750
- Sara: HE MADE A HEAVY PROMISE.

401
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,583
TO PAY THE PRICE OF ATONEMENT.

402
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,208
ON THE NEXT STRAIN,
THE BEGINNING OF REVELRY.

403
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,833
ALL OF MANKIND
IS MY BROTHER'S ENEMY.
