1
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,541
- ( beeping )

2
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,666
- HMM?

3
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,291
- Barrow: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,416
WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
WANDER AROUND THE
SHIP ON YOUR OWN?

6
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,375
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BOTH
ENJOYING YOUR LITTLE STROLL.

7
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,375
WHILE MY MEN AND I WORK
AROUND THE CLOCK

8
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,875
TO HAVE YOUR STRAIN OPERATIONAL
FOR THE NEXT BATTLE.

9
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,958
I'M SURE A LITTLE GRATITUDE
WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,166
- COME, EMILY.

11
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,291
- I'VE RUN INTO YOUR TYPE
BEFORE, YOU SMUG UNION TRAITOR.

12
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,291
IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL
YOU'VE OUTLIVED YOUR USEFULNESS.

13
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,791
UNTIL THEN YOU HAD BETTER
WATCH YOUR STEP.

14
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,416
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,375
- ARGH. THAT GIRL!

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,000
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO
BEAT HER OVER THE HEAD

18
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,541
BEFORE SHE FINALLY GETS IT?

19
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,291
- AND LOTTIE RUNS OFF AGAIN.

20
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,291
WHAT DOES THAT BRING
THE GRAND TOTAL UP TO NOW?

21
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,125
- SEVEN?
- THAT MAKES EIGHT.

22
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,833
- I DOUBT THOSE TWO WILL EVER
LEARN TO DEAL WITH EACH OTHER.

23
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,166
THEY'RE WAY TOO STUBBORN.

24
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,166
- I HOPE SHE'S CAREFUL.
OH, POOR SARA.

25
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,416
- ( grunting )

26
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,500
- GET OUT HERE!

27
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,791
- THAT WAS A PRETTY
GOOD RUN, EMILY.

28
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
YOU WERE GREAT.

29
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,083
- ( grunting )
- HMM?

30
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,083
- WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING?

31
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,541
A FORMATION ONLY WORKS
IF WE ALL STICK TOGETHER.

32
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,083
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.

33
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,083
- IF I HADN'T BROKEN AWAY
FROM THE GROUP WHEN I DID,

34
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,166
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
COMPLETED THAT SIMULATION.

35
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,958
- OH, REALLY? IF YOU'RE FLYING
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO,

36
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,500
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING A DECOY?

37
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,000
AND IF MY DECOY CAN'T ZOOM,

38
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,250
THEN HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
SNEAK UP BEHIND AND BANG BANG?

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,791
I CAN'T. I CAN'T BANG BANG.

40
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,750
THE BANG DOESN'T WORK
WITHOUT THE ZOOM.

41
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,250
NOW, IF THE ENEMY GOES BOOM BOOM

42
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,541
AND THEN WE NEED TO
COUNTER WITH THE ZAP.

43
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,333
HEY, COME BACK HERE.

44
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,083
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET.

45
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,375
( grunts ) THAT GIRL
IS SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,291
- THAT SARA CRUZ
IS SUCH A REBEL.

47
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,125
I'LL BET SHE COULD
USE A GIRL LIKE ME

48
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,958
TO SHOW HER HOW TO LOVE AGAIN.

49
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,708
IT'S SUCH A PRETTY SCENE.

51
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,875
AND I THINK I DID IT JUSTICE
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

52
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,458
- POOR GUY. DRAWING IS
JUST ABOUT THE ONLY THING

53
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,583
CARRIS IS ANY GOOD AT.

54
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,333
- WOULD YOU SHUT IT ALREADY?

55
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,500
- NOW, LET ME SEE WHAT
YOU'RE WORKING ON.

56
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,291
- HMM. A SPACE MONSTER, HUH?

57
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,000
- YOU IDIOT.
SHE ISN'T WASTING HER TIME

58
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,416
DRAWING A SPACE MONSTER.

59
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,125
YOU AREN'T, ARE YOU?

60
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,541
- I'M DESIGNING NEW
CLOTHES FOR EMILY.

61
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,791
- ( gasps )

62
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,833
- SO, IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE...

63
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,083
- ( grunts )

64
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,583
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST
CHANCE I COULD EVER HOPE TO GET,

65
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
AND YOU JUST HAD TO GO AND SAY
SHE'S DRAWING A SPACE MONSTER?

66
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,541
- HEY, I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE

67
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,375
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK IT WAS.

68
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,666
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
SHE'S PLAYING HARD TO GET.

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
BUT THE GIRL WAS TANGLED
WITH LOTTIE AND WALKED AWAY.

70
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,000
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

71
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,166
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

72
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,416
- ( watch device beeps )

73
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,833
- IT'S A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN.

74
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,125
- THE ACTUATOR WON'T
SEND A SIGNAL

75
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,291
UNLESS IT'S POSITION IS...

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,708
- IT WILL IF IT'S
SLIGHTLY RE-DESIGNED.

77
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,416
- Sara: HEY, EMILY.
I STILL CAN'T DECIDE

78
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,583
WHAT TO THINK ABOUT LOTTIE.

79
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,166
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF HER?

80
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,125
I MEAN, I KNOW SHE'S
QUICK-TEMPERED AND ALL,

81
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,291
BUT SHE REALLY LOSES
CONTROL SOMETIMES.

82
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,958
HER OUTBURST TODAY WASN'T EVEN
THE WORST I'VE SEEN FROM HER.

83
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,916
I DON'T KNOW HOW JESSIE CAN
EVEN STAND TO FOLLOW HER AROUND.

84
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,333
( sighs ) I GUESS THE STRANGE
ATTRACT STRANGE PEOPLE.

85
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,541
AND MARTHA KEEPS TRYING
TO FEED EVERYONE MEAT.

86
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,416
EVEN ERMY, WHO'S ALWAYS DIETING.

87
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,333
ALTHOUGH, I REALLY DON'T THINK
SHE NEEDS TO.

88
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,625
OH, YEAH.

89
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,625
CARRIS AND DICKON ARE FUNNY,
AREN'T THEY?

90
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,166
THEY EVEN THOUGHT MY DRAWING
WAS A SPACE MONSTER.

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,708
ISN'T THAT RUDE OF THEM?

92
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,375
AND AFTER ALL OF MY HARD WORK
DESIGNING YOUR NEW OUTFIT.

93
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,125
ALL DONE. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

94
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,041
HMM.

95
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,125
- Melchi: WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

96
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,666
YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED
TO BE IN HERE.

97
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,916
- Lottie: I'D FORGOTTEN HOW
MUCH OF A DUMP THIS PLACE IS.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,541
BUT IF WE CLEAR OUT
SOME OF THIS JUNK,

99
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,833
THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF ROOM
TO PULL OFF THIS EVENT.

100
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,583
- WE'D HAVE TO GET
STARTED RIGHT NOW.

101
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,458
- WHOA, WHOA.

102
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,333
- NO ONE INVADES MY SANCTUARY
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

103
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,166
- OF COURSE.

104
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,125
AND WE ALL APPRECIATE
YOUR APPROVAL

105
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,541
FOR A BLOWOUT CELEBRATION,

106
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,666
HONORING THE SPATIAL
ARMOR DIVISION.

107
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,375
- All: YEAH.
- Both: HUH?

108
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,250
- NO, NOT A PARTY.

109
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,875
- ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY
FOR EVERY CREW MEMBER.

110
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,625
ALL OF US WILL BE THERE,
THAT INCLUDES YOU, SARA.

111
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,041
UH-UH.

112
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,291
THIS PARTY IS FOR ALL OF US,

113
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,666
SO DON'T GO THINKING
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

114
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,208
YOU'LL JOIN US
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME,

115
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,541
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MEMBER
OF THE TEAM.

116
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,583
THERE'S NO ESCAPING US
THIS TIME.

117
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,833
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
AROUND ME.

118
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,041
IF YOU WANTED TO HONOR
ME FOR MY NEW STRAIN,

119
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,916
YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID SO.
( sobbing )

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,375
- THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
- BUT, THIS ISN'T FOR...

121
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,750
- OKAY! AND AS THE GENIUS
OF THE HOUR,

122
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,333
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO
START THE FESTIVITIES.

123
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,208
- ( firecrackers bursting )

124
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,458
- EAT, DRINK, HAVE A GREAT TIME,
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

125
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,083
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

126
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,833
- WITH LOTS OF MEAT
FOR EVERYBODY.

127
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,375
- ( all chatting )

128
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,083
- ( laughing )

129
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,083
- JUST GREAT.

130
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY MADE US COME TO THIS.

131
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,500
CAN YOU, EMILY?

132
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,083
I WISH YOU COULD TALK
SO WE COULD PLAN AN ESCAPE.

133
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,625
- ( clears throat )
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL

134
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,958
TO WHAT I HOPE WILL BE
THE FIRST OF MANY PARTIES

135
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,916
IN CELEBRATION OF
MY INTELLIGENCE.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,166
IT HAS BEEN MY PLEASURE

137
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,125
TO ENRICH YOUR LIVES
WITH MY SKILLS.

138
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,583
- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THIS SPEECH IS GOING TO TAKE?

139
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,375
- SHUT UP. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

140
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,541
- NOW, WHERE DID I LEAVE OFF

141
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,125
BEFORE I WAS SO
RUDELY INTERRUPTED?

142
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,500
OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THE
FIRST TIME I SAW A STRAIN...

143
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,750
DO YOU THINK WE'D GET IN TROUBLE
IF WE LOCKED HIM IN A CLOSET

144
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,125
FOR A FEW HOURS?

145
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,875
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE BLAME.
- Lavinia: SURPRISE,

146
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
- MY DARLING SARA.
- ( all gasp )

147
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,500
- GO ON. TELL ME YOU LOVE IT.

148
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
I'VE COME TO MAKE
EVERY LAST ONE

149
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,625
OF YOUR DREAMS
COME TRUE, MY LOVE.

150
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,416
EVEN IF IT TAKES ALL NIGHT.

151
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,916
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,916
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE HAVING
A PARTY WITHOUT ME.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,583
- Lottie: JESSIE,
YOU DIDN'T TELL LAVINIA?

154
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,000
- I WOULD'VE, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU HAD ALREADY TALKED TO HER.

155
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,375
- ( gasps ) OKAY, EVERYBODY
FORGOT TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS.

156
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,958
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

157
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,875
- ( screams )

158
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,583
- ( all laughing )

159
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,166
- WELL SAID, LAVINIA.

160
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,791
- All: CHEERS.

161
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,208
( laughing )

162
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,166
- Melchi: WHICH BRINGS
US TO THE PIVOTAL ROLE

163
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,875
I PLAYED IN THE
FIFTH HOMEROS WAR,

164
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,791
WHERE AN INVENTION OF MY DESIGN
SAVED SEVERAL THOUSAND LIVES.

165
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,750
- I RECOMMEND YOU GET YOURSELF
A PLATE OF THIS MEAT

166
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,416
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE A
FIGHTING CHANCE.

167
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,541
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT MEAT,
I CARE ABOUT SARA.

168
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,958
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW I'M ALIVE.

169
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,750
- NOTHING CHEERS ME UP
LIKE A HEAPING PLATE OF MEAT.

170
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,458
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

171
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,291
- OH, SHUT UP.

172
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,958
- LOOK OUT, ERMY.
- ( gasps )

173
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,291
- THE DICKON-MONSTER IS HERE

174
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,750
TO DRAG YOU AWAY
FROM ALL THESE GIRLS,

175
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,083
AND TAKE YOU HOME TO HIS LAIR.

176
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,666
- HAVE YOU EVER USED
A LINE LIKE THAT

177
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,000
AND ACTUALLY GOTTEN RESULTS?

178
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,416
- WITH A FACE LIKE THIS,
I CAN SAY WHATEVER I WANT.

179
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,208
- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU UNDERSTAND

180
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,041
HOW TRUE THAT
STATEMENT IS, DICKON.

181
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,458
- REALLY? ( groans )

182
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,041
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU SAY,

183
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,708
BECAUSE I'D NEVER DATE YOU
IN A THOUSAND YEARS. NICE TRY.

184
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,291
- HEY, YOU DON'T
REALLY MEAN THAT, BABY.

185
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,333
- HE WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER, HUH?

186
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,250
- POOR LITTLE GUY.

187
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,791
- MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

188
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,333
- RIGHT AWAY, LOTTIE. HERE.
- Melchi: ...THE HERO'S BURIAL

189
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,291
THAT HE DESERVED.

190
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,958
- ( people chatting )

191
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,250
- I WISH YOU'D QUIT
MOPING ALREADY.

192
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,375
CRUZ DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS THE TYPE WHO FINDS QUIET,

193
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,458
DEPRESSING GUYS
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

194
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,750
- GO TALK TO HER.
YOU'RE NOT SCARED, ARE YOU?

195
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,208
- NO, I'M NOT.

196
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,416
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HER SMILE
LIKE THAT. IT'S NICE.

197
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,625
- GO ON.

198
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,625
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE
TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION.

199
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,916
- I'M GOING, ALL RIGHT?

200
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,791
- THIS MUST BE EMILY.
- HUH?

201
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,583
- THAT DOLL MEANS QUITE
A LOT TO YOU, DOESN'T SHE?

202
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,791
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
SHE CONTAINS YOUR MIMIC.

203
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,625
SHE MUST BE SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL.

204
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
I'M PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, EMILY.

205
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,500
- I CAN'T TELL IF SHE LIKES ME.
DOES SHE?

206
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,875
- I DON'T KNOW.

207
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,833
- WOULD YOU MIND IF I JOINED
YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

208
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,708
- DO WHAT YOU WANT.

209
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,666
- HUH, THOSE TWO SURE MAKE A
CUTE COUPLE. WHO'D HAVE GUESSED?

210
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,500
- ONE QUESTION. IT'S BEEN
BOTHERING ME FOR A FEW DAYS.

211
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,666
- YEAH?

212
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,041
- WHY IS SARA'S MIMIC
INSIDE THAT DOLL?

213
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,583
THAT'S NOT NORMAL, IS IT?

214
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,166
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

215
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,375
- I DECIDED TO USE
THE INNOVATIVE DOLL DESIGN

216
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,791
TO CREATE A
COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE

217
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,208
IN THE COCKPIT FOR THE REASONER.

218
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,250
THEIR JOB IS TO FACE
DEATH EVERY DAY.

219
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,541
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

220
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,291
THAN MAKING MY
REASONER FEEL AT HOME.

221
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,166
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU LIKED
PLAYING WITH DOLLS.

222
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,583
- SHUT UP, CARMICHAEL!

223
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,625
- REALLY, MELCHI. IT ISN'T
ANYTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

224
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,958
- HOLD ON. IT WOULD
BE SO SIMPLE FOR ME

225
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,791
TO REBUILD BOTH OF
YOUR MIMICS FOR YOU.

226
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,375
WHICH ONE OF YOU WANTS
TO BE FIRST? COME ON.

227
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,458
- YEAH OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD, JESSIE?

228
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,958
- ( gasps )

229
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,166
- LUCKY GIRL. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR
VERY OWN MELCHI ORIGINAL.

230
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,000
NOW, RELAX AND
STAY VERY STILL

231
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,958
AND I PROMISE YOU
WON'T FEEL A THING.

232
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,041
- NO, THANK YOU.
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

233
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,041
- OR MAYBE RIGHT NOW.

234
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,250
- ( sighs ) WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

235
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,791
- ( laughing )

236
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,833
- ( screams )

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,250
- ( gasps )

238
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,458
- ( waltz music playing )

239
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,541
- HEY.
- THAT GUY.

240
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,416
- ( gasps )

241
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,666
- MAY I PLEASE HAVE THE HONOR
OF THIS DANCE?

242
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,750
IT'LL BE FUN.

243
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,416
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

244
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,791
- PLEASE, I'M A MUCH BETTER
DANCER THAN I AM AN ARTIST.

245
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,000
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW,
I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW POINTERS.

246
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,250
- WE'LL DO THE BOX STEP.
TRY TO FOLLOW MY LEAD.

247
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,291
- HUH?

248
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,125
- YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE DANCER.

249
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,791
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO MOVE
SO GRACEFULLY?

250
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,333
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

251
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,208
WAIT, SARA. WHAT DID I DO?

252
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,666
- ( siren blaring )

253
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
- THEY CAME BACK.

254
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,250
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

255
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,333
- SIR. WE'VE DETECTED
A GROUP OF ENTITIES

256
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,708
IN HULL BLOCK F-34
THAT COULD BE TUMORS.

257
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,041
BUT THERE APPEAR TO BE
NO ENEMY VESSELS IN THE AREA.

258
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,791
- WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'VE
BEEN HIDING ON THE SHIP

259
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,250
EVER SINCE THE LAST BATTLE.

260
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,666
THE SECURITY CREWS WE'VE HAD
CHECKING THE DAMAGED ZONES

261
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,291
MUST HAVE MISSED THEM UNTIL NOW.

262
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,958
COMBAT DEPLOYMENT NUMBER ONE.

263
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,958
EVACUATE STAFF
IN HULL-BLOCK F-34.

264
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,666
CALL THE GAMBEES IN
TO CLEAR THE ZONE.

265
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,500
- FORGIVE ME, SIR,
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

266
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,791
THE TRENCHES IN THAT AREA
HAVEN'T BEEN REPAIRED YET.

267
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,916
WE SIMPLY CAN'T ATTACK
FROM THE INSIDE.

268
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,541
- Operator: ALL REASONERS
ARE NOW LINKED TO THEIR MIMICS.

269
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,458
STRAINS REPORT
TO LAUNCH POSITIONS.

270
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,375
ALL REASONERS ARE NOW
LINKED TO THEIR MIMICS.

271
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,416
STRAINS REPORT
TO LAUNCH POSITIONS.

272
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,333
INCREASING CATAPULT
OUTPUT POWER.

273
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,708
- WE'RE NOT IN THE SIMULATION
ROOM SO STAY IN LINE,

274
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,666
UNDERSTAND ME? THIS IS FOR REAL.

275
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,666
- COME IN STRAIN ZERO-ONE
AND STRAIN E-X. COME IN.

276
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,416
SECURE THE SHIP
AND WATCH OUT FOR ENEMIES.

277
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,166
- Lottie: STRAIN ZERO-ONE,
REPORTING IN.

278
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,250
- Sara: STRAIN E-X,
REPORTING IN.

279
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,500
- Dufarge: ALL OTHER UNITS FIND

280
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,041
AND DESTROY THE TUMORS
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

281
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,375
WE MAY BE DECELERATING,

282
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,083
BUT WE ARE STILL TRAVELING
AT SUB-LIGHTSPEED,

283
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,416
SO, BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

284
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,416
- COME OUT IF YOU DARE.

285
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,833
- NO TUMORS DETECTED.
THIS HULL BLOCK IS ALL CLEAR.

286
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,958
- WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT

287
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,416
AND PLAY, YOU STINKING
TUMOR BASTARDS?

288
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,958
- THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

289
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,375
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DEALING
WITH A FALSE ALARM, YOU GUYS.

290
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,708
- Lavinia: I'M STILL
NOT SEEING ANYTHING.

291
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,333
IT'S WEIRD.

292
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,958
WHY DON'T WE GO BACK AND SAY
WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING?

293
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,833
OH, NO. SO MUCH FOR THAT IDEA.

294
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,250
OKAY, I'LL JUST TAKE
ONE QUICK LOOK AROUND

295
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,583
AND THEN I CAN GET OUT
OF HERE AND GO BACK INSIDE.

296
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,625
- ( beeping rapidly )

297
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,708
- ( gasps )

298
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,916
- Lottie: WHAT THE HELL?

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,875
SHE'S BREAKING
THE FORMATION AGAIN.

300
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,666
- ( screaming )

301
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,041
- LAVINIA!

302
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,875
- ( buzzing )

303
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,958
- WE'LL NEVER BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TIME.

304
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,625
- ( beeping )

305
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,375
- ( gasps )

306
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,500
I'M STUCK.

307
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
- ( loud explosion )

308
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,375
- YOU... YOU CAME BACK.

309
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,208
- ( loud explosion )

310
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,250
- WHOA. WAY TO GO, LADIES.

311
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,708
YOU SAVED THE DAY.

312
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,666
- I KNEW YOU COULD PULL IT OFF,
GUTSY GIRL.

313
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,041
THAT'S JUST THE "ZOOM, BANG"
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

314
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,375
- REASONERS, HULL BLOCKS ARE
NOW FREE OF FOREIGN ENTITIES.

315
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,041
- ALL UNITS ARE
CLEARED TO RETURN.

316
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,291
- ROGER.

317
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,916
- OKAY, YOU ALL
HEARD THE MAN.

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,750
WE'VE GOT A PARTY TO
GET BACK TO. LET'S GO.

319
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:04,000
- MY BROTHER. HE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE. BUT...

320
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,416
COME ON, EMILY. LET'S GO HOME.

321
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,166
- SO, AFTER THE LONG AND COMPLEX
NEGOTIATIONS I JUST DESCRIBED,

322
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,416
I FINALLY ACCEPTED THE
GENEROUS INVITATION

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
TO COME TO THIS SCHOOL.

324
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,833
AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT WOULD
HARDLY BE UNREASONABLE TO SAY...

325
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,333
- THAT WAS, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

326
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,666
SOME OF THE WILDEST FLYING
I'VE SEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

327
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,291
- Melchi: A PLACE WHERE MY
INCOMPARABLE KNOWLEDGE

328
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,625
AND UNPARALLELED
TECHNICAL SKILLS

329
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,125
CAN BE HONED AND RECOGNIZED

330
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,666
- Lottie: HMM?
- SARA.

331
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,500
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR WHAT YOU DID OUT THERE.

332
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,000
I OWE YOU MY LIFE, SARA CRUZ,

333
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,291
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET
EVEN IF I LIVE TO BE A MILLION,

334
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,041
I AM YOUR SLAVE FOR ETERNITY.

335
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,041
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU? ARE YOU HUNGRY?

336
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,625
OF COURSE, YOU ARE,
WHAT A SILLY QUESTION.

337
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,875
- YOU WAIT RIGHT THERE

338
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,000
AND I'LL BE BACK WITH
A PLATE FIT FOR A HERO.

339
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,958
GET AWAY FROM THE FOOD,
YOU LAZY JERKS.

340
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,166
- YOU TOLD ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING

341
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,500
TO LAVINIA BACK
THERE, DIDN'T YOU?

342
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,083
THANK YOU.

343
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,208
- ( footsteps approaching )

344
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,708
- I'M NOT ASKING FOR A DANCE,
JUST A HANDSHAKE.

345
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,333
YOU REALLY FLY LIKE A PRO.

346
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,000
- Carris: SARA.

347
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,750
GET OVER HERE AND HAVE SOME
FOOD BEFORE MARTHA INHALES IT.

348
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,708
- COME ON.

349
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,916
- ( closing theme playing )

350
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

351
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,708
- Sara: A CLINGING GAZE.

352
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,333
A STALKER'S SHADOW.

353
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,041
AND A STRANGE RUMOR SPREADS.

354
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,875
ON THE NEXT STRAIN,
"LAVINIA'S LOVELY PLOT."

355
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,333
HELP ME, EMILY.
