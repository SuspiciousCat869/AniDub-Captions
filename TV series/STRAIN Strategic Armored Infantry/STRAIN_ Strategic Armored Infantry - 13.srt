WHAT HUMANS DID
TO THOSE CHILDREN!

ATONES FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S SINS?

DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOU TOOK FROM ME?

- Sara: BUT I STILL HAVEN'T...
NOT YET!

75

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,166
- WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE
TYPE A BLOOD PACKS.

83
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,125
- ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE IF I CAN
FIND MORE DONORS.

84
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,166
- NOW!

85
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,500
- ( beeping )

86
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,500
- THIS IS NEW.
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

87
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,250
- GO AHEAD AND BRING
EMILY DOWN HERE,

88
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,291
- AND WE'LL HAVE YOU
FIXED UP IN NO TIME.

89
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,583

PARTS FROM DICKON'S UNIT

91

92
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,750
AND FAST! RALPH WEREC
COULD BE PREPARING

93
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,583
FOR THE NEXT ATTACK
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

94
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,250
ERMY, MARTHA, START
TRANSFERRING THE MERCURION

95

- Ermy: ROGER.
- Martha: ROGER.

97
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,833

IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.

98
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,500
- ( giggles )

99
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,625

102
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,166

THANK YOU.

108
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,000
USE AS MANY PARTS FROM
MY STRAIN AS YOU NEED.

109
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,125
- Ermy: SARA!

110
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,958
WE'LL HAVE ALL OF YOUR MERCURION
REFILLED IN A FLASH.

111
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,541
- YOUR STRAIN WILL FLY
BETTER THAN WHEN IT WAS NEW.

112
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,833
- Melchi: HEY! ARE YOU TWO
SLACKING OFF OVER THERE?

113
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,166
- Ermy: NO.
- Martha: NO.

114
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,791
- Dickon: SARA.

115
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,541
FIGHT EXTRA HARD
FOR ALL OF US, OKAY?

116
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,583
FIGHT FOR...

117
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,333
DO IT FOR CARRIS.

118
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,625
- LOTTIE?

119
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,500
- UH! YOU SURPRISED ME.

120
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,000
- WHAT'S UP?

121
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,083
- SORRY ABOUT DRAGGING YOU BACK.
I CAN BE PUSHY SOMETIMES.

122
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,791
- YEAH, I NOTICED.

123
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,833
BUT YOU PROBABLY MADE
THE RIGHT CALL.

124
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,125
- THANK YOU.

125
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,083
WE SHOULD USE
THIS TIME TO REST UP.

126
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
THERE'S NO TELLING WHEN
THE NEXT ATTACK MIGHT BE COMING.

127
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,166
BUT EVERY ONE OF US NEEDS TO BE
PREPARED FOR WHEN IT DOES.

128
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,333
- ( exclaims )

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,875
- I WAS IN A REAL
HURRY WHEN I MADE THEM,

130
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,166
SO I KNOW THEY DON'T
LOOK VERY GOOD.

131
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,500
BUT STILL, THEY CAN'T BE AS BAD
AS THEY LOOK, RIGHT?

132
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,625
I JUST KNOW THEY CAN'T!

133
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,333
- CAN I?
- SURE!

134
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,791
- IT'S GOOD.

135
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,333
- YOU SEE? EAT.

136
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,166
- THANKS, LOTTIE.

137
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,000
LIKE IT? IT'S A
NEW RECIPE I'M TRYING.

138
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,166
- YUMMY!

139
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,625
- ( both laugh sheepishly )

140
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,916
- TRY IT NOW.
- IT'S NOT DONE.

141
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,208
- Lottie: A LOT HAS CHANGED.

142
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,416
- Sara: I KNOW.

143
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,208
- BUT YOU...

144
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,583
YOU'RE AS DETERMINED
AS EVER, HUH?

145
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,625
- MORE.

146
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,791
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.

147
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,750
- DO YOU REMEMBER OUR RACE?
OUR FIRST COMPETITION?

148
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,000
- OUR RACE?

149
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,541
- YEAH. ON THE GRAVITY
TRAINING SIMULATORS.

150
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,458
- ( laughs ) OH.

151
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,041
- THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

152
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,166
THAT SOMEONE PUT UP
A FIGHT AGAINST ME.

153
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
IT'S SUCH A SHAME
THAT YOU LOST.

154
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,083
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
EVERYBODY THERE SAW ME WIN!

155
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,291
- SAW YOU WIN?
YOU LOST FAIR AND SQUARE!

156
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
YOU KNOW IT!
HOW CAN YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

157
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,083
- I COULD HAVE KEPT ON GOING,
BUT NO! YOU HAD PASSED OUT!

158
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,625
- ( Emily moans )

159
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,625
- ( whispering ) YOU MAY HAVE
KEPT UP BUT I WON.

160
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,166
- ( whispering )
NO, YOU KEPT UP WITH ME

161
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,000
AND I CLEARLY BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.

162
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,125
- DID NOT.
- DID, TOO.

163
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,708
- ( both giggling )

164
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,500
- WHEN ALL OF THIS IS DONE

165
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,708
LET'S TRY IT ONE MORE TIME,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

166
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
I SAID I'M OFFERING YOU
A REMATCH.

167
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,833
- REMATCH? WHY WOULD I DO THAT
WHEN I ALREADY WON?

168
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,750
- RIGHT, OF COURSE YOU DID.

169
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,250
- FINE, THEN. AND THIS TIME

170
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,416
I WON'T LEAVE ANY
ROOM FOR DOUBT.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
- SOUNDS GOOD.

172
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,041
ALL RIGHT, THEN IT'S A DATE.

173
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,250
THINK YOU CAN SWING THAT?

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,416
- OF COURSE, QUEEN.

175
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,333
- ( door humming )

176
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,416
- Carmichael: SARA?

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,958
YOU'RE ALL SET.

178
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,791
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
DONE MUCH SOONER

179
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,208
IF THE LIBERTAD HADN'T SUSTAINED

180
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,958
SUCH EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.
BUT IT LOOKS GOOD, RIGHT?

181
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,083
- IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS, CARMICHAEL.

182
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,416
- YOU'RE FLYING WAS RECKLESS
AND OUT OF CONTROL.

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,750
YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

184
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,750
IT'D BREAK MY HEART
IF I LOST THAT STRAIN.

185
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,250
- ONLY THE STRAIN?

186
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,708
- Melchi: SHUT UP, CARMICHAEL.

187
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,541
OF COURSE I WANT YOU
TO RETURN SAFELY, TOO, SARA.

188
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,875
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE
THE ONLY REASONER I OWN.

189
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,875
- Sara: RIGHT.

190
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,666
- SARA?

191
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,750
- MY MIMIC.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EMILY.

192
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,333
WHAT IS IT?

193
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
- SARA, I'M COMING WITH YOU.

194
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,791
- MAYBE NEXT TIME.

195
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,875
- NO! I'M COMING WITH YOU NOW!

196
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,708
- EMILY...

197
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,833
- PLEASE, SARA.

198
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,375
I JUST...

199
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,958
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU. PLEASE?

200
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,416
- OKAY.

201
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,333
YOU AND ME. LET'S GO.

202
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,166
- Dufarge: THANKS TO THE HARD
WORK OF EVERYONE INVOLVED,

203
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,000
WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY
WIPE OUT THE TUMORS.

204
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,083
AND THE LOCATION OF
RALPH WEREC'S STRAIN

205
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,708
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED.

206
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,875
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LIBERTAD
NO LONGER HAS THE ABILITY

207
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,458
TO DEFEND AGAINST AN ATTACK
FROM A GLOIRE TYPE.

208
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,625
SARA, OUR LAST HOPE FOR SURVIVAL
IS NOW IN YOUR CAPABLE HANDS.

209
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,375
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT
IN YOU, CADET.

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,041
GODSPEED.

211
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,000

214
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,583

- ( yelling )

221
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,083
- Emily: STOP IT, BROTHER!

222
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS TO SARA.

223
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,208
- EMILY.

224
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,708
COME HERE. NOW!

225
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,791
- EMILY!
- Emily: NO!

226
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,083

- ( yelling )

230
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,708
- RALPH.

231
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,583
- ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED WHAT
YOU WANT IN LIFE,

232
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,208
IT'S UP TO YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT.

233
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,833
IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

234
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,416
THERE'S NOTHING, NOTHING
YOU CAN'T DO.

235
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,375
- Sara: YOU WERE RIGHT, BROTHER.

236
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,625
AND I'VE DECIDED WHAT
I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.

237
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,958
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU FROM
KILLING ANYONE ELSE.

238
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,208
NO ONE ELSE WILL DIE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

239
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,791
I SWEAR IT.

240
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,833
- ( alarm beeping )

241
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,750
- SARA!

242
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,791
- OH, NO! SHE CAN'T!

243
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,583
- SHE'S IN SUB-LIGHT SPEED.

244
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,333
- TO AVOID CAUSING MORE DAMAGE
TO THE LIBERTAD.

245
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,791
- Craven: THIS DISPLAY EARNS
CADET SARA WEREC

246
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,833
THE HONOR OF BEING OUR FIRST

A REMATCH WHEN YOU GET BACK.

250

00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,166
SARA...

264
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,833
- BROTHER!

265

WE PURSUE OUR OWN DREAMS,

WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

281
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,458
- GOOD QUESTION.

282
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,625
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO, EMILY?

283

I AM NOT ALONE.
