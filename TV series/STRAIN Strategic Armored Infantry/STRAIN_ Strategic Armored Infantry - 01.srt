1
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,833
- Ralph: MOM. DAD. I'VE BEEN
PROMOTED TO SQUAD CAPTAIN

2
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,250
FOR THE NEXT MISSION.

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,208
IT'S A MAJOR RESCUE OPERATION
AND THE RISKS ARE HIGH,

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,500
BUT I WILL DO MY BEST NOT
TO SHAME THE WEREC NAME.

5
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,916
MY ONLY CONCERN LIES WITH SARA,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,708
WHO WILL BE ON HER
OWN WHILE I'M GONE.

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,375
- ( footsteps approaching )

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,666
- RALPH. THERE YOU ARE.

9
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,916
- SARA.

10
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,708
- HERE. IT'S A PICTURE OF YOU.

11
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,666
I DREW IT MYSELF SO
YOU CAN HAVE IT WITH YOU,

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,500
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,125
- THANK YOU, SARA.
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

14
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,791
- ( crying )

15
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,041
- TAKE THIS IN RETURN.
- HUH?

16
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,333
- SEE? SAME AS MINE.
NOW WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

17
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,416
HERE. LISTEN TO THIS.

18
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,500
- ( music box playing )

19
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,916
- COME ON, LET'S DANCE.

20
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,291
- YOU'VE GOTTEN MUCH BETTER.

21
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,750
- WELL, SURE,
BUT THE BOX STEP IS AN EASY ONE.

22
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,250
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW GOOD YOU ARE, WHEN I RETURN.

23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,083
- UH...

24
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,125
- BUT RALPH, YOU'RE GOING
A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

25
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,708
LIGHT YEARS AWAY.

26
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,750
I'LL BE DEAD BY THE
TIME YOU EVEN GET THERE.

27
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,375
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.
IT'S THE TRUTH!

28
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,166
- SARA.

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,208
- ( music box playing )

30
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,875
- ( crying )

31
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,291
- ( watch beeps )

32
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,166
- SARA. I HAVE TO GO.

33
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,541
I WILL RETURN.

34
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,083
- WAIT!

35
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,875
- I WANT TO...
I WANT TO FOLLOW YOU, BROTHER.

36
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,833
- SARA.

37
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,625
ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE,

38
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,083
IT'S UP TO YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT.

39
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,875
AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,

40
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,791
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO.

41
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:03,833
- HMM.

42
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,416
- I'LL SEE YOU.

43
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,208
- WE WILL BE TOGETHER AGAIN,
BUT IT WON'T BE HERE.

44
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,166
I'M ONE STEP
BEHIND YOU, BROTHER.

45
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,833
- HERE GOES NOTHING.

46
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,333
I SWEAR IT GETS EASIER
EVERY TIME.

47
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,375
- SARA. WHAT IS WITH YOU TODAY?
YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE!

48
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,708
- AREN'T I ALWAYS?

49
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,958
- OKAY, SARA,
I'M ALL FOR YOU BEING AN ACE,

50
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,000
BUT TRY LEAVING SOME FOR US.

51
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,041
I'LL TAKE THESE.

52
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,750
GOOD WORK GUYS.
WAY TO GROUP THEM.

53
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,583
- I BEAT YOU TO THE PUNCH.
- HEY, MAN, YOU STOLE MY KILL.

54
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,625
- CEDIE, NICE FLYING.

55
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,000
- I HAVE TO TAKE MATTERS INTO
MY OWN HANDS NOW AND THEN

56
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,625
IF I EVER EXPECT TO BE
THE NEXT RALPH WEREC, RIGHT?

57
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,958
- YEAH, SURE. LET'S CLEAN UP
THE REST OF THIS TRASH.

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,791
- Female operator: GROUP B'S
TRAINING EXERCISE IS COMPLETE.

59
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,458
THE TOP SCORE GOES TO STRAIN
ZERO ONE, REASONER SARA WEREC,

60
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,625
WITH FORTY SIX DUMMY
TUMORS DESTROYED.

61
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,041
- Dorincourt:
I EXPECT NOTHING LESS

62
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,791
FROM THE SISTER OF RALPH WEREC.

63
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,208
- INDEED.
- WITH MISS WEREC,

64
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,375
THE GRABERA SPATIAL ARMOR
INFANTRY RESEARCH INSTITUTE

65
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,916
WILL GRADUATE YET ANOTHER,
A LIST REASONER THIS SEMESTER.

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,458
- ( Sara exhales )

67
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,541
EXCELLENT WORK AS ALWAYS.

68
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,500
- Male cradle voice:
MIMIC STORAGE IS COMPLETE.

69
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,875
BEGIN MERCURION CIRCULATION.

70
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,625
- TOMORROW I SAY
WE TAKE DOWN FIFTY TUMORS.

71
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,000
HEY, CEDIE.

72
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,916
- HEY, UH, SARA?
- YEAH?

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,791
- SO WE HAVE A DAY OFF SOON.
WOULD YOU...

74
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,000
- Colin: LET'S GO, YOU GUYS.
- HUH?

75
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,000
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING
STANDING AROUND?

76
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,291
THE LECTURE'S ABOUT TO START
AND WE CAN'T BE LATE.

77
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,833
- JUST CATCH UP WITH US, OKAY?

78
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,250
- WAIT, WE'RE COMING
WITH YOU GUYS. LET'S GO.

79
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,208
- OH, MAN. I BLEW IT.

80
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,291
- COME ON, CEDIE!
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE!

81
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,666
- COMING!

82
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,083
- I'LL SEE YOU SOON, BROTHER.

83
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,083
- WITH THE DISCOVERY
OF MERCURION,

84
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,791
MANKIND HAS GAINED THE
MEANS TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.

85
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,541
APPROACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

86
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,083
THE WARS THAT HAVE OCCURRED
DUE TO TERRITORIAL EXPANSION

87
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,583
HAVE CAUSED A RIFT
WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE.

88
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,000
MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED

89
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,500
SINCE THE FIRST SPARKS OF
WAR WERE SEEN BETWEEN US,

90
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
THE UNION AND THE DEAGUE.

91
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,208
SINCE THEN,
WAR HAS UNFORTUNATELY

92
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,875
BECOME AN INTEGRAL
PART OF HUMAN HISTORY.

93
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,541
MAINTAINING OUR EXTENDED
BATTLE LINES

94
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,666
REQUIRES CEASELESS
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

95
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,541
AND THE PINNACLE OF MANPOWER.

96
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,291
THE FIRST BEING THE STRAINS,

97
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,208
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY
YOU, THE REASONERS.

98
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,458
HOWEVER WE ARE NOT SCIENTISTS,
SO WE CANNOT WIN THIS WAR

99
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,375
WITH TECHNOLOGICAL FEATS ALONE.

100
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,833
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO
IS HONE OUR SKILLS.

101
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,000
AS YOU ARE SOME OF THE
MOST TALENTED REASONERS

102
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,125
TO EVER WALK THESE FABLED HALLS.

103
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,791
- HEY, MARY.
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT, COLIN?

104
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,875
- SO, WITH THOSE TWO, ARE THEY
STILL AVOIDING THE INEVITABLE?

105
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,958
- I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE MUCH IS HAPPENING.

106
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,666
- WHAT IS WITH CEDIE? HE JUST
NEEDS TO ASK HER ALREADY.

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,083
- YEAH, BUT THE THING IS,

108
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,500
ALL SARA THINKS
ABOUT IS HER BROTHER,

109
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,083
SO IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY FOR HIM.

110
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,375
- TAKE RALPH WEREC FOR EXAMPLE.

111
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,916
HE IS THE FINEST REASONER EVER
TO GRADUATE FROM THIS ACADEMY.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,833
IN THE BATTLE FOR ALABOMERIS,

113
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,666
HE SHOT DOWN TEN
DEAGUE WARSHIPS,

114
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,333
AND WAS THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER

115
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,500
TO BE GIVEN A GLOIRE
STRAIN FOR USE IN COMBAT.

116
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,083
WHAT WE NEED MOST
ARE REASONERS LIKE HIM,

117
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,875
WHO HAVE BOTH THE GUTS AND
THE SKILL TO WIN THIS WAR.

118
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,958
WITH THEM WE WILL BE ABLE
TO TURN THE TIDE OF THE WAR

119
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,333
AND ACHIEVE VICTORY
FOR OUR PEOPLE.

120
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,958
- ( grunts ) OKAY, HERE WE GO.

121
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,166
- HEY, WAIT UP!

122
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,250
( exhales )

123
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,166
- WOW! BARELY MADE IT.

124
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,208
- SORRY.

125
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,083
- Colin: I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL
I'M JUST LIKE SARA'S BROTHER.

126
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,750
- IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

127
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,916
THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY FLIGHT
HOURS LEFT UNTIL WE GRADUATE.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,916
- AND THEN IT'S ON
TO SUB-LIGHT SPEED.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,833
- YEAH. I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO SEE MY BIG BROTHER AGAIN.

130
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,500
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT
SHE JUST SAID, CEDIE?

131
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,250
IT'S GOING TO BE AN UPHILL
BATTLE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

132
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,791
- COLIN, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

133
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,166
- SARA WOULDN'T...
- EXCUSE ME?

134
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,208
- IT'S NOTHING.

135
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,208
- HEY, LOOK. IT'S HIGGINS.

136
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,416
- Colin: I HEARD HE
ACCIDENTALLY DAMAGED HIS MIMIC

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
IN A TRAINING EXERCISE.

138
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,583
I WONDER WHAT HE'S
GOING TO DO NOW.

139
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
- Havisham: LISTEN UP!

140
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,750
YOUR MIMIC CONTAINS CULTURED
BRAIN CELLS THAT WERE HARVESTED

141
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,291
FROM EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

142
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,750
WHILE YOU WERE STILL FLOATING
INSIDE YOUR MOTHER'S BELLY!

143
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,166
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
YOUR MIMIC IS YOUR TWIN.

144
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,125
ONCE IT DIES,
IT WILL NEVER COME BACK!

145
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,166
IF YOU EVER LOSE OR
DAMAGE YOUR MIMIC,

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,708
YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE
THE ABILITY TO BE A REASONER.

147
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,583
THEN YOU'D BE USELESS TO ME!

148
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,958
THAT'S WHY YOU MUST TAKE
BETTER CARE OF YOUR MIMIC

149
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,041
THAN YOU DO OF YOURSELF!

150
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,041
WE CAN REPLACE A LIMB EASILY,

151
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,583
BUT WE CANNOT
REPLACE YOUR MIMIC!

152
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,916
TOO SLOW! I'LL BE SEEING YOU IN
THE WORK FIELDS FOR DETENTION!

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,250
WHO'S NEXT! SHOW ME SOME EFFORT!

154
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,750
- PRETTY SOON WE WON'T HAVE TO

155
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,458
LISTEN TO DICTATOR HAVISHAM'S
PEARLS OF WISDOM ANYMORE.

156
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,958
- THE BEST WAY TO DEAL
WITH HIM IS TO IGNORE HIM.

157
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,375
- I HEARD YOU!

158
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,500
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT I
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

159
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,541
- SIR, "SLACKERS IN TRAINING
MAKE MISTAKES IN WAR".

160
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,541
IS THAT RIGHT,
INSTRUCTOR HAVISHAM?

161
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,791
- ( grunts ) YES.
THAT'S CORRECT.

162
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,625
- ( all giggle )

163
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,416
- YOU KNOW, YOU KIDS ARE
SOME OF THE BEST PROSPECTS

164
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,416
I'VE SEEN IN YEARS.

165
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,000
IF YOU KEEP GOING AT THIS RATE,

166
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,250
YOU'LL SURPASS THE ABILITIES
OF RALPH WEREC IN NO TIME.

167
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,250
THAT'S ESPECIALLY
TRUE FOR YOU, SARA.

168
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,500
SO KEEP WORKING HARD,

169
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,416
SO YOUR BROTHER DOESN'T
LEAVE YOU IN HIS DUST.

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,458
- ( gasps )

171
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,000
YES, SIR.

172
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,208
- ( exhales )

173
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,083
- I'M GUESSING YOU NEVER
MANAGED TO ASK SARA OUT.

174
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,083
- THE TIMING NEVER
SEEMED TO WORK OUT.

175
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,916
- IT'S HARD TO DO WHEN
ALL SHE EVER THINKS ABOUT

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,125
IS HER BROTHER, YOU KNOW?

177
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
REMEMBER, ONCE WE GRADUATE,

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,916
WE'LL ALL BE ASSIGNED TO
DIFFERENT SQUADRONS.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,208
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

180
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,250
- YEAH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.
THANKS, MARY.

181
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,166
- HEY.
- HUH?

182
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,708
WHAT'RE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

183
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,958
- SARA! WE WEREN'T
TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING!

184
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,958
- THE TRUTH IS,
CEDIE WANTS TO...

185
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,666
- AH, NO, DON'T!

186
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,333
- WELL? YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING
TO LEAVE ME HANGING ARE YOU?

187
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,833
- OH. WELL, UH...

188
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,875
( exhales )

189
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,625
- COME ON, TELL ME.

190
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,041
- ( both ) WELL, WE'D LIKE TO.
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

191
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,291
- ( music box playing )

192
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,416
- IT WON'T BE LONG NOW, BROTHER.

193
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,583
I'LL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO

194
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,125
WHEREVER IN THE GALAXY
YOU ARE STATIONED,

195
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,208
AND THEN...

196
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,250
- ( footsteps approaching )

197
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,791
- I SEE YOU'VE SNUCK
OUT OF THE DORMS

198
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,041
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT AGAIN.

199
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,083
DON'T BLAME ME
IF THEY YELL AT YOU.

200
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,291
- I'M NOT CONCERNED
WITH BEING YELLED AT.

201
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,791
BESIDES, A LITTLE FRESH AIR IS

202
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,416
WORTH WHATEVER
PUNISHMENT I MAY GET.

203
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,083
PLUS, WHENEVER I'M UP HERE
I GET TO GAZE AT THE STARS,

204
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
WHICH HELPS ME FEEL
CLOSER TO MY BROTHER.

205
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,000
- AGAIN WITH YOUR BROTHER?

206
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
YOU MUST HAVE
A LOT OF LOVE FOR HIM.

207
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,000
MAKES ME JEALOUS.

208
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,208
- WELL, OF COURSE I LOVE HIM.
HE'S THE ONLY BROTHER I HAVE.

209
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,541
- TRUE.

210
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,166
- CEDIE, DANCE WITH ME.
- UH...

211
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,875
- LET'S SEE IF YOU'VE GOTTEN
ANY BETTER AT THE BOX STEP.

212
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,208
- JUST BE GENTLE, I'M NO EXPERT.

213
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,458
- EASY CEDIE, NOT SO FAST!

214
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,291
- I GUESS I'VE GOTTEN
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

215
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,250
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS COMPLIMENT ME.

216
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,625
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT

217
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,291
BECAUSE THEN I'D
BE PAMPERING YOU.

218
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,333
- I CAN ONLY DO THE BEST I CAN,

219
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,958
IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT
IT WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD

220
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,375
AS SOMEONE'S PERFECT BROTHER.

221
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,125
- THAT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?

222
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,500
( gasps ) SORRY.

223
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,541
( giggles )

224
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,791
- Mary: HOW ARE THEY DOING?

225
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,958
- Colin: THEY'RE DANCING AGAIN.

226
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,875
- UH, KEEPING TRACK OF THEM
IS LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY.

227
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,791
HONESTLY, HE COULD AT LEAST
HOLD ONTO HER SHOULDER.

228
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,375
- HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING
TO BET IF WE ASK CEDIE,

229
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,000
HE'LL SAY JUST BEING CLOSE
TO HER IS ENOUGH FOR HIM?

230
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,208
- HE JUST NEEDS TO WORK UP
SOME COURAGE ALREADY.

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,666
- ( clock chiming )

232
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,041
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?

233
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,250
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING
SOME NIGHT TIME EXERCISES.

234
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,041
- ( siren wailing )
- Dorincourt: THE DEAGUE

235
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,166
ARE ATTACKING GRABERA?
HOW CAN THAT BE?

236
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,083
WHY WOULD THEY STRIKE SO
FAR BEHIND THE FRONT LINES?

237
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,125
THIS IS A TRAINING FACILITY!

238
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,291
- WE CAN'T CONTACT CENTRAL
COMMAND! EVERY LINK IS DOWN!

239
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,500
- LOOKS LIKE THE FEEDS ARE GONE

240
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,916
FROM THE GEODETIC
SATELLITES TOO.

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,208
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE
ORBITAL FORCES ARE DOING?

242
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,708
- WE'RE GETTING REPORTS
OF TUMORS ATTACKING CIVILIANS!

243
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,833
- ( loud explosion )

244
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,708
- THE DORMS WERE JUST HIT!
- QUICKLY! EVACUATE THE CADETS!

245
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,416
WE CAN'T ALLOW
ANYMORE TO PERISH!

246
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,541
HOBBS, LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO TAKE COMMAND!

247
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,125
- RIGHT. ALL FREE
HANDS FOLLOW ME!

248
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,416
- YES, SIR!
- HAVISHAM!

249
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,333
- I'M GOING TO PILOT A STRAIN!

250
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,875
- WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?

251
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,416
- ( screaming )

252
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,291
- ( gasps )

253
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,875
- ( gasps ) CEDIE! LOOK!

254
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,625
- TUMORS.
- NO WAY.

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,375
HOW DID THEY SLIP THROUGH
THE SECURITY DEFENSES?

256
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,833
SARA! WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

257
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,291
- WHERE DO YOU THINK?
I'M GOING TO GO GET MY STRAIN!

258
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,458
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

259
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,875
- Sara: THANK GOODNESS!
THE GARDEN HASN'T BEEN HIT YET!

260
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,916
- ( siren wailing )

261
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,250
- HEY, GUYS. ARE YOU OKAY?
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

262
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,083
- HURRY UP! LET'S GET OUT THERE!

263
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,458
- COMMAND'S DOWN,
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ON OUR OWN.

264
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE TUMORS WERE ABLE TO

265
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,333
GET SO CLOSE TO US WITHOUT
SETTING OFF ANY ALARMS.

266
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,958
THAT MEANS SOMEONE
MUST HAVE BETRAYED US

267
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,583
AND GAVE AWAY OUR
POSITION TO THE DEAGUE!

268
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,916
- WELL THERE'S NO POINT
IN DISCUSSING IT RIGHT NOW.

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,291
WE NEED ALL OUR ATTENTION
ON REPELLING THE ATTACK.

270
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,458
( gasps )

271
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,500
- Mary: HERE THEY COME.

272
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM.

273
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,000
- HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS?
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.

274
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,541
- SARA.

275
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,750
- DON'T WORRY, CEDIE.

276
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,916
THIS'LL BE JUST LIKE THE
TRAINING EXERCISES.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,375
BESIDES, THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN LET THESE BASTARDS,

278
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,791
KILL US ON OUR OWN TURF!

279
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,958
- LET'S DO IT!
- All: ROGER!

280
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,791
- ( Sara yells )

281
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,000
- ( Cedie gasps ) WHAT IS THAT?

282
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,791
NO WAY, IT CAN'T BE.
A GLOIRE STRAIN?

283
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,583
- Colin: IT'S ABOUT TIME
ONE OF THEM SHOWED UP.

284
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,750
WE'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THE
HELP WE CAN GET WITH THIS.

285
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,750
- NO. IT'S BAD.

286
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,208
- Colin: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

287
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,291
- ( all gasping )

288
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:02,875
- ( Mary screams )

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,208
- WHAT IS SHE... SARA! DON'T!

290
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,875
- ( yelling )

291
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,583
DAMN YOU!

292
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,458
( gasps )

293
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,083
- Cedie: RUN!

294
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,583
SARA!

295
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,375
- CEDIE!

296
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,041
I THINK I REMEMBER THERE
BEING AN OLD ARMY LAB

297
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,208
IN THAT DIRECTION.

298
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,541
( gasps ) IS THAT WHAT
THEY'RE HERE FOR?

299
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,666
- ( siren wailing )

300
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,791
- ( panting )

301
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,291
THE REASONER'S INSIDE!

302
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,916
- ( heavy breathing )

303
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,541
- ( panting )

304
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,333
( gasps )

305
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,083
( crying )

306
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,916
COLIN.

307
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,458
MARY.

308
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,166
CEDIE.

309
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,125
( crying )

310
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,041
- ( footsteps approaching )

311
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,375
- IT'S HIM!

312
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,500
( panting )

313
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,125
THERE!
