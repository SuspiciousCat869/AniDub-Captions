1
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,375
- Lottie:
ENEMY UNITS APPROACHING

2
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,125
FROM POINT TWO-ONE-ONE.

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,833
ASSUME A T-FORMATION
AND WAIT FOR MY CALL!

4
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,625
( gasps )

5
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,333
( screams )

6
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,625
( screams )

7
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,458
- ( buzzing )

8
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,500
- ( grunts )

9
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,500
- Dufarge: WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

10
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,625
THAT'S YOUR TENTH
STRAIGHT FAILED MISSION.

11
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,708
HOW IN THE HELL YOU CALL
YOURSELVES REASONERS

12
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,250
IS BEYOND ME.

13
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,791
- Martha: IT'S NOT LIKE ANY
OF US HAVE EVER FOUGHT AGAINST

14
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,125
ANOTHER STRAIN BEFORE.
WE'RE TRYING.

15
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,458
- TRYING ISN'T GOING TO BE
ENOUGH TO SAVE YOUR LIVES!

16
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,541
AND EXCUSES WILL
GET YOU KILLED.

17
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,000
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE TRAINING,

18
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,375
THEN GIVE UP YOUR STRAIN.

19
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,500
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.
CLASS DISMISSED!

20
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,708
- Ermy: WHAT DID HE MEAN,
"CAN'T HANDLE THE TRAINING"?

21
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,833
- Dickon: I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
GET IN ONE OF THESE THINGS

22
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,416
AND TRY THE SIMULATION.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
- Carris: WELL, IT IS TRUE
THAT OUR USUAL METHODS

24
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,833
AREN'T WORKING VERY WELL.

25
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,041
- Lavinia:
AND BESIDES THE QUEEN,

26
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,541
THAT NEW GIRL WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO

27
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,750
CAME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE
LEVEL OF RALPH WEREC'S STRAIN.

28
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,916
- Jessie: EVEN SO.
HER STRAIN'S MOBILITY

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,125
WON'T HELP US VERY MUCH

30
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,833
IF SHE DOESN'T LEARN
TO STAY IN FORMATION.

31
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,583
- Lottie: SO THAT MEANS
WE'LL NEED A NEW FORMATION,

32
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,458
IF WE INTEND TO SUCCEED
IN THE NEXT BATTLE.

33
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,375
WE WERE THE ONLY REASONERS
CAPABLE OF SURVIVING THAT.

34
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,625
WITH THAT IN MIND, IT MAKES
SENSE THAT THE MOST SKILLED

35
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,625
SHOULD MAKE UP THE CENTER
OF THE FORMATION.

36
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,875
IT'S THE BEST CHANCE WE'LL
HAVE AT MAKING IT OUT ALIVE.

37
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,083
SO THAT'S THE NEW PLAN.

38
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,083
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
LITTLE MISS GUTSY?

39
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,375
HEY! DO YOU HEAR ME, SARA?

40
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,375
COME ON! ANSWER ME!

41
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,041
- CAN YOU HEAR ME OR NOT?
- ( device beeps )

42
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,083
- GOOD WORK AGAIN TODAY, EMILY.

43
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,958
- ( theme song playing )

44
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

45
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,333
- Female Operator: THREE
MINUTES UNTIL THE COMPLETION

46
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,333
OF DECELERATION
SEQUENCE NUMBER FOUR.

47
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,875
- Male Operator: ENGINES ARE
GREEN. ALL SHIPS NORMAL.

48
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,583
- SENSORS SHOW NO
ENEMIES WITHIN RANGE.

49
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,041
- IT APPEARS THAT WE'VE
ESCAPED THE ENEMY

50
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,500
AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.

51
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,250
- WE CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT IS INDEED

52
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,916
THE CURRENT SITUATION, SIR.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,208
OUR FOCUS NOW MUST BE

54
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,250
TO REACH THE GALL
SPACE SUPPLY DEPOT.

55
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,666
- TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE UNCOVERED
ABOUT THIS TRAINEE, SARA CRUZ.

56
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,083
- A DETAILED INVESTIGATION
IS STILL UNDER WAY.

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,708
WE'VE GONE OVER HER
PERSONAL RECORDS.

58
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,708
THEY'RE ALL CLEAN,
AT LEAST SO FAR.

59
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,875
IT SEEMS THAT CRUZ
IS AN ORDINARY CADET.

60
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,958
ACCORDING TO ALL THE RECORDS
AVAILABLE, AT LEAST.

61
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,041
- HMM. I THINK IT WOULD
BE UNWISE

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,125
TO OVERLOOK WHAT SHE HAS
BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH,

63
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,583
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
HER LIMITED EXPERIENCE.

64
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,583
BETWEEN THIS EXTRAORDINARY
YOUNG TRAINEE

65
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,791
AND THE INEXPLICABLE ATTACK
BY THE DEAGUE,

66
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,916
THIS EXERCISE VOYAGE IS

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,541
BECOMING QUITE
INTERESTING INDEED.

68
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,166
- Female Operator:
DECELERATION SEQUENCE

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,208
COMPLETE IN SIXTY SECONDS.

70
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,791
- YOU HAVE THE SMOOTHEST
SKIN I'VE EVER FELT!

71
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,916
I MEAN ASIDE FROM MY OWN
LUXURIOUS SKIN, OF COURSE.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,458
IT'S SO SMOOTH!

73
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,750
HEY. WHY DON'T YOU
FEEL IT FOR YOURSELF?

74
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,000
SARA?

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,916
- Ermy: WELL, THAT'S NO GOOD,
IS IT?

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,041
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
EAT THE C LUNCH.

77
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,416
JUST SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE,
BUT B LUNCH IS THE WAY TO GO!

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,750
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
IT'S A LUNCH ALL THE WAY.

79
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,541
IF YOU'RE TRAINING,
YOU GOTTA HAVE MEAT!

80
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,583
- MARTHA, MARTHA. B LUNCH
IS A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.

81
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,208
IT HAS THE FEWEST CALORIES
AND ALMOST NO FAT,

82
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,708
SO, IT'S PERFECT FOR DIETING.

83
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,083
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

84
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,208
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
FIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!

85
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,125
- I FIGHT JUST FINE.

86
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,333
BUT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO GIVE UP

87
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,875
MY GIRLISH FIGURE NOW, DOES IT?

88
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
- Martha: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
IS GOOD FOR A GIRLISH FIGURE.

89
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,166
MEAT! HERE, HAVE SOME OF MINE.

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,458
- Ermy: GET THAT FORK OUT
OF MY FACE. YOU'RE SO GROSS!

91
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,083
- Martha: COME ON, JUST TRY IT!
- EXCUSE ME.

92
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,875
- FINISHED SO SOON?

93
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,666
OKAY, MORE FOR US.

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,666
DIG IN, ERMY. YOU COULD
USE THE EXTRA PORTIONS.

95
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,333
- Ermy: RIGHT,
LIKE I'D EAT A C LUNCH.

96
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,583
JUST GIVE ME HER DESSERT!

97
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,041
- OH, HI.

98
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,458
HOW ARE YOU, SARA?
ARE YOU DOING OKAY?

99
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,583
UH, HEY, YOU KNOW IF
ANYTHING IS BOTHERING YOU,

100
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,250
I'D BE HAPPY TO LISTEN,
IF YOU WANT.

101
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,333
- WHY?

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,916
WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
ACTING SO FRIENDLY?

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
- GEE. I THOUGHT IT WAS OBVIOUS.

104
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,833
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE IN
THE SPATIAL ARMOR DIVISION.

105
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,958
YOU'RE ONE OF OUR OWN NOW.

106
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,166
- WHAT WAS THAT?

107
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,750
BEST OF LUCK WITH
THIS ONE, BUDDY.

108
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,500
- ( grunts ) IT ISN'T LIKE THAT.

109
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,500
- Lottie: HEY! GUTSY GIRL.

110
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,583
EXERCISING ALONE
AGAIN, I SEE.

111
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,708
YOU PUT UP A PRETTY
SOLID WALL, YOU KNOW THAT?

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,500
- ( treadmill beeping )

113
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,166
- YOU CAN ACT HOWEVER YOU LIKE,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING

114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,833
I WANT YOU TO HEAR
FROM ME, ALL RIGHT?

115
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,083
HERE'S WHAT.
YOU DO HAVE FRIENDS HERE.

116
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,083
OUR LIVES ARE IN EACH
OTHER'S HANDS NOW,

117
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,416
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

118
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,416
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

119
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,083
WE'VE STILL GOT TWENTY
KILOMETERS TO GO!

120
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,416
- FRIENDS? SINCE WHEN?

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,250
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
GOT A NEW GROUP OF PALS.

122
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,125
- Melchi: CADET SARA CRUZ,
YOU'RE LATE!

123
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,083
START UP TESTS WILL BEGIN
IMMEDIATELY! SO LET'S MOVE!

124
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,541
HEY! HEY, GET BACK HERE!

125
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,041
OH, GREAT. JUST WHAT I NEED.

126
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,916
A REASONER WHO'S
HARD OF HEARING.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,958
- DON'T WORRY,
I BET HER HEARING IS FINE.

128
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,166
YOU'RE JUST SO DUMB
AND UNPLEASANT

129
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,375
THAT SHE IS PROBABLY
IGNORING YOU.

130
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,791
- DO YOU WANT ME TO
SHOW YOU "UNPLEASANT"?

131
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,541
- I CAME BACK, EMILY.

132
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,541
THERE, NOW. YOU'RE
LOOKING SO PRETTY AGAIN.

133
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,375
YOU'RE THE ONLY FRIEND
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

134
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,333
I'M NOT SURE WHY.

135
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,375
BUT I FEEL LIKE I CAN BE
MY OLD SELF AROUND YOU.

136
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,166
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'VE BEEN
SARA WEREC THIS WHOLE TIME.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,666
THEN, I HAVE TO GO BACK TO
BEING SARA CRUZ ALL OVER AGAIN.

138
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,333
I'M SO TIRED OF HIDING.

139
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,541
SOMEDAY, EMILY.

140
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,125
I WON'T HAVE
TO HIDE WHO I AM,

141
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,833
AND I CAN HAVE FRIENDS
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

142
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,541
- ( loud thudding )

143
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,500
- ( yells ) WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

144
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,333
HANDLE THIS TREASURE WITH
THE RESPECT IT DESERVES!

145
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,500
- YEAH, SURE.

146
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,500
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

147
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,708
- IT'S A LOAD OF SCRAP
METAL THAT WE SALVAGED

148
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,958
FROM THE BATTLE THE OTHER DAY.

149
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,625
- IT IS NOT!
THIS IS A LOAD OF TREASURE!

150
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,708
WITH THIS, I WILL CREATE
A BRAND NEW STRAIN.

151
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,333
AS A TRUE GENIUS
IT'S MY DUTY TO RECYCLE!

152
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
- ARE YOU TELLING ME WE STILL
CAN'T USE THE STRAIN?

153
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,833
- UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

154
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,958
BUT IT WON'T PREVENT US FROM
PURSUING OUR TARGET, STILL.

155
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,500
IT WILL TAKE NO SMALL
AMOUNT OF TIME TO FILTER

156
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,125
THE MERCURION
USING OUR EQUIPMENT.

157
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,458
OUR TECHNICIANS ARE
CURRENTLY PRODUCING

158
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,166
AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF
FORTY EIGHT PER CENT.

159
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,500
OF COURSE, IT HELPS TO KEEP
IN MIND THAT THE UNION'S IDEA

160
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,875
OF EFFICIENT MERCURION USE
DIFFERS GREATLY FROM OUR OWN.

161
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,083
- I'M TIRED OF HEARING EXCUSES
WHEN I ASK YOU FOR RESULTS.

162
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,875
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? LEAVE!

163
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,541
- I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.

164
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,166
- Medlock: SO, THEY'RE MAKING A
DETOUR IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOSE US?

165
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,875
THAT WILL ONLY SERVE
TO DELAY THE INEVITABLE.

166
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,041
EXCELLENT.

167
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,291
IT SEEMS WE'VE RUN
INTO A BIT OF GOOD LUCK.

168
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,291
PLUS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEND
THE STRAIN OUT AGAIN IN NO TIME.

169
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,500
SOON, RALPH.

170
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,083
IT WILL ALL BE READY FOR YOU.

171
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,791
PLEASE. FOR THE TWO OF US.

172
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,375
- I'VE STUDIED THESE CLOSELY

173
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,125
AND I CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING UNUSUAL.

174
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,458
EVERYTHING IS WITHIN
THE NORMAL PARAMETERS.

175
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
WHY ARE HER RECORDS

176
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,916
THE ONLY ONES WE'RE
LOOKING AT SO CLOSELY?

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,458
- WHY DON'T YOU GET ON
WITH YOUR WORK

178
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,208
AND STOP ASKING A LOT
OF SILLY QUESTIONS.

179
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,291
- FINE.

180
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,250
- I GUESS OUR MORE
IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS

181
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,291
WILL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL WE REACH GALL.

182
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,500
BUT I HAVE A HARD
TIME BELIEVING THAT

183
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,500
THIS GIRL IS A SECRET WEAPON.

184
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,083
- ( gasps ) WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY "SECRET WEAPON"?

185
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,500
- BECKY, WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM
DOING THE REST OF YOUR WORK?

186
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,625
DON'T MAKE ME FLUNK YOU.

187
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,125
- ( beeping )

188
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,958
- EMAIL? WHO COULD THIS BE FROM?

189
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,875
- Dickon: CAN YOU IMAGINE?

190
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,083
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
GIVE ME A SECOND LOOK.

191
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,208
LIKE SHE DOESN'T WORK DOWN
IN THE COMMS DIVISION.

192
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,625
- I SERIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

193
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,916
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

194
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,208
- OH, HEY SARA!

195
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,416
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE HEARD YET,

196
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,625
BUT LOTTIE WANTS ALL OF US

197
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,041
TO MEET IN THE
SIMULATION ROOM RIGHT AWAY.

198
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,041
AND WE'RE HEADED
THERE RIGHT NOW, SO...

199
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,125
UH...

200
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,791
- YOU REALIZE THAT GIRL
DOESN'T KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE?

201
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,375
- ACTUALLY, I THINK SHE LOOKED
AT ME THAT TIME, SO SHUT IT.

202
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,958
- ( footsteps echoing )

203
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,791
- YOU'RE TOO SLOW!

204
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,333
IF I CALL A MEETING,
DROP EVERYTHING AND GET HERE!

205
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,625
- Dickon: LOTTIE!
YOU SCARE ME SO BAD!

206
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,708
- DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU!

207
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,250
- SO, WHAT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL

208
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,208
THAT YOU HAD TO CALL THIS
MEETING ALL THE SUDDEN?

209
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,208
- I'VE BEEN GOING OVER A
FEW OF MY FLIGHT NOTES

210
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,125
SINCE THE LAST
BATTLE SIMULATION.

211
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,375
- THIS IS THE FORMATION
WE'VE BEEN USING

212
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,958
IN TRAINING SESSIONS, ISN'T IT?

213
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,541
- MM-HMM. AND THAT'S MY STRAIN
THERE IN THE LEAD POSITION.

214
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,125
BUT IF WE INTEND
TO BEAT WEREC,

215
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,333
WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME
CHANGES IN STRATEGY.

216
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,416
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I'VE
CALLED YOU ALL TOGETHER

217
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,375
FOR A MEETING IN
THE SIMULATION ROOM.

218
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,333
FROM NOW ON,
OUR REARGUARD, SARA CRUZ,

219
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,416
WILL BE JOINING ME
IN THE LEAD POSITION.

220
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,708
BY FULLY UTILIZING
THE MOBILITY OF HER UNIT,

221
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,333
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
DOUBLE OUR OFFENSIVE POWER.

222
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,916
- Lavinia: WAIT, SARA?
- Ermy: AND LOTTIE?

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,416
- A TWO-TOP FORMATION?

224
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,666
- BUT I'M STILL IN THE LEAD!

225
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
I'M JUST LETTING SARA
FLY NEXT TO ME.

226
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,000
I'M STILL THE ONE IN CHARGE!

227
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,458
- ARE YOU SURE A
TWO-TOP FORMATION

228
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,000
IS REALLY THE BEST IDEA?

229
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,291
- INSTRUCTOR DUFARGE THINKS

230
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,208
THIS IS A CREATIVE
PLAN WORTH TRYING.

231
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,625
THE CREW HAS ALREADY STARTED
TO COLLECT SIMULATION DATA

232
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,583
USING THIS SAME STRUCTURE.

233
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,416
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT, DO YOU?

234
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,541
- NO MA'AM.

235
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,708
- I THINK HER PROBLEM IS

236
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,708
MORE WITH THE
REASONER YOU'VE CHOSEN.

237
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,583
- IT'S NOT THAT SHE
DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILL,

238
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,041
IT'S JUST THAT SHE
DOESN'T STRIKE ME

239
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,500
AS MUCH OF A TEAM PLAYER.

240
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,250
- I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT.

241
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,625
- I'M AWARE THAT SARA'S TALENTS
AREN'T AS DEVELOPED AS MINE,

242
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,625
BUT SHE'S THE NEXT BEST
REASONER WE'VE GOT.

243
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,916
I PUT MY TRUST
IN HER COMPLETELY.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,208
IS THAT CLEAR?

245
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,375
BESIDES THERE'S JUST
SOMETHING ABOUT HER SMELL

246
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
THAT REMINDS ME OF ME.

247
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,416
- WHAT'S UP WITH
YOU AND SMELLS?

248
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,833
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

249
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,625
- LOTTIE IS MAKING
ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE

250
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,333
AS OUR NEW FORMATION. RIGHT?

251
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,791
- UH, YEAH, SURE.

252
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,166
- COME TO THINK OF IT HAS
ANYONE SEEN GUTSY GIRL?

253
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,833
- UM, NO.

254
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,125
- ACTUALLY NO, I HAVEN'T.

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,458
- ( footsteps approaching )

256
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,333
- Mariette: YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL
GUTS TO ACTUALLY SHOW UP HERE.

257
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,625
- WHERE'S ISABELLA?

258
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,666
SHE CALLED ME HERE
SO WE COULD TALK.

259
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,958
- I'M SO SORRY.

260
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,166
BUT ISABELLA HAD TO
CANCEL AT THE LAST MINUTE.

261
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
- CANCEL?

262
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,791
- SHE DIED IN BATTLE.

263
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,333
NOT THAT YOU EVEN
GIVE A DAMN!

264
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,666
IF YOU HAD STARTED THE BATTLE
IN THAT STRAIN OF YOURS,

265
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,416
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!

266
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,833
BUT NOW, ISABELLA IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU!

267
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,958
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING,
YOU BITCH?

268
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,833
- SO YOU'VE BEEN A REASONER
ALL ALONG, THEN?

269
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,875
IS THAT WHY YOU THINK YOU
ARE BETTER THAN US? HUH?

270
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,708
- I BET YOU'VE REALLY
BEEN ENJOYING YOURSELF!

271
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,375
HAVEN'T YOU? GETTING TO LOOK
DOWN ON US THIS WHOLE TIME.

272
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,333
- GET OFF OF ME!

273
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,750
COCKY LITTLE SLUT!

274
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,708
- WHERE'S YOUR PRECIOUS
STRAIN NOW?

275
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,500
- Girl 2: TAKE THAT!

276
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,541
- SO, I HOPE WE'VE BEEN
ABLE TO IMPRESS UPON YOU

277
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,250
HOW UPSET WE ARE.

278
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,541
WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP
AND DEFEND YOURSELF, DAMMIT?

279
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,500
- ( gasps )

280
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
- ( girls giggling softly )

281
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,375
- WHAT'S THAT LOOK
YOU'RE GIVING ME?

282
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,333
YOU KNOW YOU BROUGHT
THIS ON YOURSELF.

283
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,083
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU,
THEY WOULD...

284
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,708
( yells ) THEY'D
STILL BE ALIVE!

285
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,000
WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

286
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,291
WHY ARE YOU ALIVE
AND THEY'RE DEAD?

287
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,958
SAY SOMETHING,
YOU LITTLE BITCH!

288
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,958
WHY DID ISABELLA HAVE TO DIE
WHILE YOU GET TO LIVE!

289
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,083
SAY SOMETHING!

290
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,000
QUIT JUST SITTING THERE
AND LOOK AT ME.

291
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,708
( yells ) WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

292
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,333
I SAID LOOK AT ME!

293
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,250
- HAVE YOU HAD
ENOUGH REVENGE YET?

294
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,125
- NO, NOT UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

295
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,833
- COME ON.
THIS HAS GONE WAY TOO FAR.

296
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,166
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS!

297
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,833
- Girl 3: I THINK SHE'S HAD
ENOUGH, MARIETTE.

298
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,750
- YOU BITCH!

299
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,875
- I KNEW WE'D FIND
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN HERE.

300
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,125
- ( gasps )

301
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,500
- BUT WE WERE ONLY...

302
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,750
- IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

303
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,333
- YOU SEE,
IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU.

304
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,500
RATS LIKE THESE ALWAYS
GATHER IN DARK, WET PLACES.

305
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,083
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THEY ARE PLAYING FAIR

306
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,291
GANGING UP ON SARA, DOES IT?

307
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,833
- I HOPE THIS ISN'T
FOR LADIES ONLY,

308
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,500
BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO JOIN IN.

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,625
- I'LL ASSUME THAT YOU
ARE DONE WITH THIS.

310
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,958
IF YOU WANT TO MESS
WITH SARA CRUZ,

311
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,125
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGHT

312
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,291
THE ENTIRE SPATIAL
ARMOR DIVISION AT ONCE.

313
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,166
AND IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFTER,
WE'RE ALWAYS READY TO GO.

314
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
- WE DIDN'T REALIZE
SARA WAS WITH YOU.

315
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,625
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

316
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,250
- IT'S ALL HER FAULT.

317
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,750
IF IT WASN'T FOR HER,
THEY WOULD ALL STILL BE ALIVE.

318
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,708
ISABELLA IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF HER.

319
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,958
- YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

320
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,958
WHO LOST SOMEONE CLOSE
TO THEM IN THAT BATTLE.

321
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,750
- ( sobbing )

322
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,958
- WHY DID YOU HELP ME?

323
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,333
YOU SAVED ME.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

324
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,041
- WELL, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

325
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,416
IF WE LET THEM KILL YOU,
THERE'D BE A GAP TO FILL

326
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,291
IN MY NEW FORMATION AND WE'D
HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

327
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,625
WE WERE BEING PRACTICAL.

328
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,458
YOU'RE STILL A MEMBER
OF OUR TEAM, SARA.

329
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,833
- Dickon: SO, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

330
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,333
- WHERE DID THEY GO?

331
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,541
I'M NOT TOO LATE, AM I?

332
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,583
- MAYBE JUST A LITTLE.

333
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,125
- YOU'RE HOPELESS, LAVINIA.

334
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,458
- ( all laugh )

335
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,375
- I THINK SARA'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.

336
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,250
- ( closing theme playing )

337
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,541
- Sara: SHE SUGGESTED I
THROW A LITTLE WELCOME PARTY.

339
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,250
WHAT DO YOU THINK, EMILY?

340
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO.

341
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,625
ON THE NEXT STRAIN,
"BACK TURNED TO PEACE."

342
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,583
THIS IS WHAT I RETURN TO.
