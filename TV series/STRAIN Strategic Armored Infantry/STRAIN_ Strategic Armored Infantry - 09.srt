1
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,708
- ( knocking on door )
- Craven: YOU MAY ENTER.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,625
- YOU CALLED ME, SIR?

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,000
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, SIR?

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,291
- I'M TOLD YOU HAVE
AN OLDER BROTHER

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,791
WHO'S ALSO A REASONER?

6
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,416
- YES. WITH THE FOURTEENTH
MOBILE FLEET.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,375
HE'S CURRENTLY STATIONED ON A
CARRIER CALLED THE BLANC ROUGE.

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,583
WHY DO YOU ASK, SIR?

9
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,791
- WE'VE JUST LEARNED
THAT THE BLANC ROUGE

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,791
AND THE REST OF
THE FOURTEENTH FLEET

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,875
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,250
- ( gasps )
- THE ENTIRE FLEET WAS

13
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,666
AT PLANET GRABERA,

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,875
WHEN THE DEAGUE SUDDENLY
ATTACKED THE TRAINING FACILITY.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,875
EACH SHIP FOUGHT BACK,
BUT IT WAS IN VAIN.

16
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,291
GRABERA ITSELF SUFFERED
TERRIBLE DESTRUCTION,

17
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,583
AND DURING THE FIGHTING,
YOUR BROTHER...

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,958
- THAT CAN'T BE. MY BROTHER
WOULD NEVER BE BEATEN BY TUMORS.

19
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,583
- NO, THE ENEMY WAS A STRAIN.

20
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,666
- A STRAIN? HOW DO THE
DEAGUE HAVE STRAINS?

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,000
- BECAUSE A UNION REASONER

22
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,958
BY THE NAME OF RALPH WEREC
HAS BETRAYED US ALL.

23
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,000
- ( gasps )

24
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,166
- ( sniffling )

25
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,208
MY ONE AND ONLY BROTHER
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

26
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,458
HE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME.

27
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,000
I BELIEVED WE WOULD
ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

28
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,666
AND THAT I WOULD BE
JUST LIKE HIM. AND THEN...

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,375
AND THEN...

30
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,250
( crying )

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,333
( grunting ) SARA.

32
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,875
( screaming )

33
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,291
- ( theme song playing )

34
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,458
- WE HAVE LEARNED

36
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:01,458
THAT YOU'RE RALPH WEREC'S
YOUNGER SISTER, SARA WEREC.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,625
IS THAT CORRECT?

38
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,083
- ( machinery whirring )

39
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,041
- I'M GOING TO GO WORK OUT.
I CAN'T STAND THIS.

40
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,000
- WE'D LIKE YOU TO BEGIN
BY TELLING US MORE

41
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,666
ABOUT YOURSELF AND
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

42
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,708
IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO COOPERATE,

43
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,083
WE'LL BE FORCED TO ASSUME THAT

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,875
YOU'VE COME TO THE LIBERTOD
AS A SPY FOR THE DEAGUE.

45
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,708
- YES, I UNDERSTAND.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,375
- ( crying )

47
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,250
- Ben: HE'S FINALLY
SETTLED DOWN.

48
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:06,250
- YES, SO MANY THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED TODAY. JUST AWFUL.

49
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,541
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, BECKY.

50
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,000
- ( crying continues )

51
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,625
IT'S MY FAULT.
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

52
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:18,875
I'M SO SORRY, CARRIS. I'M SORRY.

53
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,291
I'M SO SORRY. I'M SORRY.

54
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,625
- Craven: SARA, WHY DID YOU
CREATE A FALSE IDENTITY

55
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,500
TO ENROLL AT THIS SCHOOL?

56
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,416
- HMM. OKAY, THEN,
LET ME REPHRASE THE QUESTION.

57
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,708
WHY DID YOU TRANSFER
TO OUR TRAINING SHIP

58
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,000
AND PRETEND TO BE
A GAMBEE PILOT?

59
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
- BECAUSE HE DESTROYED IT.
- HMM.

60
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:49,125
- MY MIMIC, SIR.
HE DESTROYED IT.

61
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,750
- DO YOU HAVE ANY
REASON TO BELIEVE

62
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,875
THAT RALPH WEREC'S
ATTACKS ON THE LIBERTAD

63
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,083
HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR PRESENCE HERE?

64
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,166
COULD HE BE TRYING
TO SEEK YOU OUT?

65
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,416
- I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

66
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,500
BUT I'M DOING ALL I CAN
TO FIND OUT.

67
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,375
I HAVE TO KNOW, SIR. I HAVE TO
KNOW WHAT RALPH IS TRYING TO DO.

68
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,458
- ( gun cocking )

69
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
- SUCH RECKLESSNESS.

70
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,708
THIS IS A DIRECT ORDER, WEREC,

71
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,208
YOU ARE TO LEAVE
THE SAMPLE WITH ME,

72
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,291
AND REMAIN IN YOUR QUARTERS.

73
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,416
YOUR IMPULSIVE ACTIONS
HAVE PREVENTED US

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
FROM LAUNCHING A SURPRISE
ATTACK AFTER THEY LEAVE PORT.

75
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,583
I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT THE SAMPLE IS RESTRAINED

76
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,750
SO, THAT IT NEVER CAUSES
THIS SORT OF HEADACHE AGAIN.

77
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,375
IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE

78
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,208
TAKEN CARE OF THIS
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

79
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,375
- COME HERE.
- ( screams )

80
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,333
- DAMN YOU.
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

81
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,708
- DON'T TOUCH HER.

82
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,250
- Dufarge: WELL, DO YOU BELIEVE
HER? IS SHE TELLING THE TRUTH?

83
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,625
- YEAH, IT'S TOO UNBELIEVABLE
TO BE MADE UP.

84
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,458
- Craven: WE WILL NEED TO KEEP
HER UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE.

85
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,583
- Melchi: YOU'RE RIGHT.

86
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,291
- ( loud crashing )
- ( Lottie screaming )

87
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,750
- ( panting )

88
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,333
- Craven: IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE?

89
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:49,125
BUT SIR, WE'VE ONLY JUST
BEGUN OUR REPAIRS.

90
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,291
- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND
YOUR DILEMMA.

91
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
HOWEVER, THE FACT REMAINS

92
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,375
THAT YOUR SHIP HAS ALREADY BEEN
ATTACKED ONCE BY RALPH WEREC

93
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,041
DURING SUB-LIGHTSPEED TRAVEL,

94
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,458
WHICH IS A UNIQUE
OCCURRENCE IN AND OF ITSELF.

95
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,166
WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
ASSUME THIS LATEST ATTACK

96
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,833
WAS MEANT FOR YOU AS WELL.

97
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
- I SEE YOUR CONCERN.

98
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,333
BUT, IF I MAY, SIR,
I'D LIKE TO REQUEST THAT

99
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,916
OUR INJURED REMAIN HERE.

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,375
OUR SHIP LACKS THE PROPER
FACILITIES TO TREAT THEM.

101
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,541
- THAT WOULD BE FINE.

102
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,166
- Dufarge:
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING, SIR.

103
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,458
- WE REQUEST PERMISSION TO

104
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,791
LEAVE REASONER SARA
WEREC IN YOUR CUSTODY.

105
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,333
WE BELIEVE,
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY

106
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,041
SHE IS SECRETLY COMMUNICATING
WITH THE DEAGUE.

107
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,833
HANDING HER OVER
TO THE UNION OUTPOST

108
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,708
SEEMS THE MOST LOGICAL
COURSE OF ACTION.

109
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,500
- I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
- HUH.

110
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,708
- YOU SEE I'VE RECEIVED
ORDERS AS WELL.

111
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,958
I'VE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT

112
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,208
A DEAGUE SHIP IS RAPIDLY
APPROACHING GALL.

113
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,416
- A DEAGUE SHIP?

114
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,000
- IF THEIR OBJECTIVE IS
TO RECOVER SARA WEREC,

115
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,625
AND SHE IS LEFT HERE...

116
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,583
- I SEE, SIR, YOU WOULD SOON
HAVE A BATTLE ON YOUR HANDS.

117
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,500
- THANK YOU FOR
YOUR UNDERSTANDING.

118
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,041
- SO, YOU'RE GOING
TO FORCE US TO...

119
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,166
- I'M NOT CONCERNED
WITH WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

120
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,541
I SIMPLY WANT YOU TO LEAVE
THIS PORT AT ONCE.

121
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,250
- ( grunts )

122
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,666
- Barrow: I REALIZE, I'VE
EXPRESSED THIS MANY TIMES OVER,

123
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
BUT WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF OPTIONS.

124
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,291
AFTER RECALCULATION,

125
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,000
IF WE DON'T CHANGE COURSE
IN FIFTEEN SUBJECTIVE HOURS,

126
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,083
THE SCHEDULE WILL BE COMPROMISED
AND OUR MISSION JEOPARDIZED.

127
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,875
WE WILL MISS OUR RENDEZVOUS.

128
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,666
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

129
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,916
I'M ALSO AWARE THAT
THERE IS ANOTHER SAMPLE

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,208
ON BOARD THAT SHIP.

131
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,458
IF MEMORY SERVES,
YOU THREW FULL SUPPORT

132
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,291
BEHIND RALPH'S PROPOSITION
AT THE START.

133
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,041
YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND.

134
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,666
- INDEED, CAPTAIN.
IF WHAT WEREC SAYS IS TRUE,

135
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,000
IT VERY WELL MAY TURN
THE TIDE OF THE WAR.

136
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,208
HOWEVER, WE HAVE A
DIFFERENT MILITARY OPERATION

137
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,791
BEFORE US THAT NEEDS RECKONING.

138
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,250
FORGIVE ME, CAPTAIN, BUT,
IF WE MISS THIS APPOINTMENT,

139
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,875
IT IS CERTAIN WE WILL ALL
BE BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES.

140
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,791
- REGARDLESS OF WHAT
GIFTS WE OFFER UP.

141
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,625
- BARROW.

142
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,791
- I HAVE NO INTENTION OF

143
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,958
COMMITTING SUICIDE
WITH YOU, CAPTAIN.

144
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,875
MARK MY WORDS,

145
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,166
THESE ACTIONS WILL BE THE
UNDOING OF EVERYONE ABOARD,

146
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,500
SO, WE MUST FOCUS
AND THINK VERY CLEARLY.

147
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,500
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I CANNOT
TRUST THAT MAN.

148
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,541
THANK YOU. I WILL PREPARE
TO CHANGE COURSE.

149
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,125
- ( laughing )

150
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,541
- HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO LIKE THAT, RALPH WEREC?

151
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,875
YOU, BASTARD. THIS IS WHAT
YOU GET FOR RIDICULING PEOPLE.

152
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,625
I CAN'T WAIT TO TEACH YOU THAT
THE DEAGUE DOESN'T HAVE A PLACE

153
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,041
FOR DISRESPECTFUL TRAITORS

154
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,708
WHO ACT LIKE THEY'RE
GOD'S GIFT, MY FRIEND.

155
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,416
- ( coughing )

156
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,541
- Girl: SO, SHE WAS ACTUALLY
A SPY FOR THE DEAGUE?

157
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,708
ARE YOU SURE?

158
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,333
- YEAH, EVERYONE'S
TALKING ABOUT IT.

159
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,583
AND THEY WERE SAYING THAT

160
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,666
SHE WAS THE REASON
THEY ATTACKED US ON GALL.

161
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
- AND THAT MUST BE WHY
THEY'RE KICKING US OUT

162
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,708
BEFORE WE'VE EVEN
FINISHED OUR REPAIRS.

163
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,416
- DAMN IT. IT'S ALL HER FAULT
THAT EVERYONE'S BEING KILLED,

164
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,750
THINK ABOUT IT.

165
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,458
WELL, I'M NOT READY TO DIE YET.

166
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,583
- ( all gasp )

167
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,541
- GIVE A STATUS REPORT
ON THE SHIP'S REPAIRS.

168
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,125
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WHY ARE
YOU JUST STANDING THERE?

169
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,000
- SIR, IS IT TRUE THAT THE
DEAGUE SHIP IS COMING AFTER HER?

170
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,416
- HER?

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,541
- IF WE JUST HANDED
OVER SARA WEREC,

172
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,750
THEN THERE'D BE NO NEED FOR

173
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,916
THE LIBERTAD TO ESCAPE,
SIR, WOULD THERE?

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,916
- HMM. EVEN IF THAT
IS THE SITUATION,

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,041
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT

176
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,166
WE'D BE ALLOWED TO
LEAVE GALL UNHARMED.

177
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,458
FURTHERMORE, WE DON'T KNOW YET
IF SARA WEREC IS A SPY.

178
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,750
SO, UNTIL WE KNOW MORE,

179
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,541
I SUGGEST WE REFRAIN FROM
MAKING SUCH REMARKS.

180
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,916
- LET ME ENCOURAGE YOU
TO HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE.

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
THERE IS A REGULAR MILITARY
FORCE AT PLANET BREGMA

182
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,583
THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY
HELPFUL TO US.

183
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,125
ONCE WE ARRIVE THERE, A DEAGUE
SHIP WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR.

184
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,458
- THAT IS CORRECT, SO,
PREPARE TO LEAVE AT ONCE.

185
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,375
- ( engine revving )

186
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,083
- Jessie: LOTTIE, IT'S ME.

187
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,875
LISTEN, I BROUGHT
YOU A LITTLE FOOD.

188
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,416
YOU REALLY NEED
TO EAT SOMETHING.

189
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,875
HEY, LOTTIE?

190
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,625
( gasps )

191
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,791
OH, NO, LOTTIE.

192
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,333
- Operator 1: COURSE SET
TO COORDINATES NS 107 WEST.

193
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,583
DESTINATION, PLANET BREGMA.

194
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,125
- Operator 2:
INCREASING ENGINE OUTPUT.

195
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,833
MERCURION LEVEL
IS AT SIXTY PERCENT.

196
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,541
- ( beeps )
- HMM?

197
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,833
- Dufarge: LOTTIE GELH?

198
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,833
WHAT... WHAT IS...

199
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,333
- WAIT. LET US OBSERVE A BIT.
- WHAT?

200
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,291
- LET'S SEE WHAT SHE DOES.
LOTTIE DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES.

201
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:53,083
- YES, SIR, BUT I DON'T.
YES, UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

202
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,666
- WHY, BROTHER?

203
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,708
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE DECIDED TO DO.

204
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,250
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

205
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,708
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

206
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,208
I'LL SHOW NO MERCY
TO ANYONE IN MY WAY.

207
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,250
NOT EVEN TO YOU, MY OWN SISTER.

208
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,208
- ( sobbing )

209
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,333
( gasps )

210
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,041
THAT WAS...

211
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,750
FROM CARRIS.

212
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.
CARRIS FORD GAVE YOU THAT.

213
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,875
A GIFT HE THOUGHT TO GET YOU

214
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,083
RIGHT BEFORE YOUR TRAITOROUS
BROTHER, RALPH WEREC KILLED HIM.

215
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,500
- ( gasps )

216
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,125
- ( sobbing )

217
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,041
- AND IT'S NOT JUST CARRIS.

218
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,833
BETWEEN THE EVENTS AT GRABERA
AND ON THIS TRAINING VOYAGE,

219
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,583
YOUR BROTHER HAS
KILLED SO MANY OTHERS.

220
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,083
BUT WHY IS IT YOU ARE
STILL ALIVE, SARA?

221
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,875
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS SISTER?

222
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,375
- ( gun cocking )

223
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
- HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
DOES HE HAVE TO KILL, HUH?

224
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,791
HOW MANY MORE
UNTIL HE'S SATISFIED?

225
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,458
WHEREVER THAT BASTARD GOES

226
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,791
HE LEAVES A BLOODY TRAIL
OF CORPSES BEHIND.

227
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY LIVES HE'S TAKEN?

228
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,666
HE'S A DEATH MONGER, SARA,

229
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,458
WHOSE ONLY PURPOSE SEEMS
TO BE KILLING PEOPLE.

230
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,416
I'M NEVER GOING TO SEE
MY BROTHER AGAIN.

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,000
CAN YOU POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME?

232
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,791
I'LL NEVER SEE HIS FACE OR
TOUCH HIM OR HEAR HIS VOICE

233
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,708
OR TELL HIM THAT I
LOVE HIM EVER AGAIN.

234
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,875
BUT YOUR BROTHER, OH,
HE'S ALIVE AND WELL.

235
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,083
I WANT TO KNOW WHY. YOU TELL ME
HOW THIS IS FAIR, SARA WEREC.

236
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,791
- MARTHA, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
LOTTIE AROUND, HAVE YOU?

237
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,458
- SHE'S NOT IN HER ROOM.
- NOPE.

238
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,666
- OH. WELL, IF YOU SEE HER
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW?

239
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,333
- ( grunts )
- COME ON, DAMN IT,

240
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,208
I WANT YOU TO SAY SOMETHING.

241
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:41,083
- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER.

242
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,166
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO.

243
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,625
BELIEVE ME, LOTTIE,
I WANT TO KNOW, TOO.

244
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
- YOU'RE LYING. I DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD YOU SAY.

245
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,166
- I'M NOT LYING.
- SHUT UP.

246
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,666
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?

247
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,291
YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR NAME,
YOUR PAST AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

248
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,416
- I KNOW, BUT THE ONLY WAY
I COULD SEE MY BROTHER AGAIN

249
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
WAS TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES.

250
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,416
I WANTED TO SEE HIM,

251
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,041
AND FIND OUT WHAT
COULD HAVE HAPPENED

252
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,250
THAT MADE HIM TURN OUT THIS WAY.

253
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,625
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

254
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
I'M ALIVE BECAUSE AT ONE TIME

255
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,541
I HAD A KIND,
GENTLE, OLDER BROTHER.

256
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,125
( sobbing ) WITHOUT HIM,
I WOULD HAVE NEVER SURVIVED.

257
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,625
WITHOUT HIM...

258
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,000
WITHOUT MY BROTHER, RALPH.

259
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,666
I... I WOULD HAVE BEEN
LEFT ALL ALONE.

260
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,166
- ( church bell dinging )

261
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,916
- AFTER OUR PARENTS DIED,
IT WAS JUST RALPH AND I.

262
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,833
I THINK I CRIED ALL THE
TIME, BUT HE ALWAYS...

263
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,458
HE ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF ME.

264
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
HE WAS THE ONLY
PERSON I HAD LEFT.

265
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:22,166
SOME NIGHTS I FELT SO LONELY
I'D STAY UP FOR HOURS.

266
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,625
BUT HE WOULD ALWAYS STAY
WITH ME UNTIL I FELL ASLEEP.

267
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,500
BEFORE HE LEFT FOR THE ARMY,

268
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,291
I CRIED AND ASKED HIM OVER AND
OVER AGAIN TO STAY, NOT TO GO.

269
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,916
YOU SEE, AT THAT TIME,

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,833
I HONESTLY COULDN'T IMAGINE
BEING AWAY FROM HIM.

271
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,500
HE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME.
AND THEN...

272
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,666
- ( laughing ) RALPH.
- HI, SARA.

273
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,000
- ( chuckling )
WELCOME HOME, BROTHER.

274
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,916
- IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HOME.

275
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,208
- BEING WITH MY BROTHER
WAS ALL THE HAPPINESS I KNEW.

276
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,083
SO, I THOUGHT,
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL

277
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,208
TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS,
AND BE JUST LIKE HIM.

278
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,083
- Lottie: DON'T GO!

279
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,375
( sobbing )

280
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,708
- DON'T BE SILLY, LOTTIE.

281
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,083
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE TO SAY
GOODBYE FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

282
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,625
AND IF YOU BECOME
A GREAT REASONER,

283
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,625
WE'LL GET TO SEE
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

284
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,333
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
SO, THERE.

285
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,708
- I'LL DO IT. WAIT FOR ME.
- I WANT TO...

286
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,916
- I WANT TO BE WHERE YOU ARE.
- I WANT TO FOLLOW YOU, BROTHER.

287
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,416
- OKAY.
- I'LL SEE YOU.

288
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,541
AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF,

289
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,416
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO.

290
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,541
ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE,

291
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,541
IT'S UP TO YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT.

292
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,166
- I MISS HIM.

293
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,500
- I CAN'T DIE.

294
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,000
I'VE DECIDED THAT I WON'T...

295
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,875
I WON'T LET MY BROTHER
KILL ANY MORE PEOPLE.

296
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,250
I HAVE DECIDED.
AND THAT'S WHY...

297
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,208
THAT'S THE REASON.
IF IT'S GOING TO STOP,

298
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,041
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO KILL
MY BROTHER MYSELF.

299
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,291
- ( gasps )

300
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,708
- IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.
OH, I LOVE HIM.

301
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,541
AND THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO KILL HIM.

302
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,000
HE IS THE ONLY BROTHER I'VE GOT.

303
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,750
THE PERSON I LOVE MOST
IN THIS WORLD.

304
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,833
BUT I WON'T LET HIM
KILL ANYMORE.

305
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,041
- ( theme song playing )

306
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

307
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,041
- Sara: THE MYSTERY
SURROUNDING EMILY.

308
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,291
THE 600 YEAR OLD TRUTH.

309
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,333
AND THE TRAGEDY THAT
