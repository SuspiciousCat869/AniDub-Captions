00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,875
- THANKS, SARA. WE'LL GET YOU
PATCHED UP RIGHT AWAY.

166
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,833
- GREAT.

167
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,708
- ( grunts in frustration )

168
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,958
( screams )

169
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,708
( grunts )

170
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,791
( screams )

171
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,500
I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

172
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,916
HELLO.

173
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,583
( giggles )

174
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,083
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

175
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,875
BUT TO SHOW YOU HOW CHARMING
I AM UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL!

176
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,500
( giggles )

177
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,625
( grunts )

178
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,875
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

179
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,916
I'LL TAKE REALLY
GOOD CARE OF YOU.

180
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:16,166
YES! SHE LIKES IT! SARA'S MINE!

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,875
- Lottie: I LOVE THAT SHAMPOO!
BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS!

182
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,333
YOU SHOULD TRY SOME, SARA.
YOUR HAIR WILL THANK YOU.

183
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,500
- Sara: IT'S OKAY,
I'M FINE WITH WHAT I USE.

184
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,000
- Lavinia: OH, NO.

185
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
( screams )

186
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,166
JESSIE?

187
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,833
- YOU SHOULD AT
LEAST GIVE IT A TRY.

188
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,583
IT'S GOOD TO MIX
THINGS UP NOW AND THEN.

189
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,958
- STOP IT, JESSIE! ENOUGH!

190
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,750
THIS IS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

191
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,791
- LAVINIA.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,791
- LAVINIA. JESSIE. WHAT'S THIS?

193
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,500
- NO! THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK!

194
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,750
IT'S JUST A BIG
MISUNDERSTANDING.

195
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,416
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH!

196
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,416
SARA!

197
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,833
( screams )

198
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,958
( cries )

199
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,041
- LAVINIA, WAIT!
I DON'T WANT TO STOP!

200
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,208
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
NOTHING EVER WORKS OUT!

201
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
( crying )

202
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,791
WHY ME?

203
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,875
( cries )

204
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,041
- Carris: LAVINIA?

205
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,083
- ( gasps )

206
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,416
( screams )

207
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
- I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

208
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,250
IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE NO OTHER
CHOICE BUT TO SHOW YOU

209
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,541
HOW MUCH OF A CHARMING STUD
I AM UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL!

210
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,083
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

211
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,125
COME AND GET IT!

212
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,208
- NO!

213
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,583
( crying )

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
- I HAVE RECEIVED WORD
OF A CERTAIN STUDENT

215
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,583
RUNNING AROUND THE HALLS
ACTING STRANGE RECENTLY.

216
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ACTING STRANGE?

217
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,708
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

218
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,375
- YOU MEAN THAT.
- WHAT'S THAT?

219
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,958
- I THINK HE'S REFERRING TO

220
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,666
LAVINIA RUNNING
AROUND THE SHIP NAKED.

221
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,958
- HMM? YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

222
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,833
- NO, IT'S TRUE,
I SAW IT MYSELF.

223
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,125
- WHAT A DISGRACE!
SHE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT!

224
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,250
- COMMANDER. I BELIEVE LAVINIA
MAY NOT BE THE ONLY ISSUE.

225
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,625
THE LEVEL OF STRESS IN ALL
THE CADETS IS GROWING RAPIDLY.

226
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,000
- HE MAY HAVE A VALID
POINT HERE, SIR.

227
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,208
THIS ROUTINE MISSION
BECAME A BATTLE.

228
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,166
THEY LOST OVER HALF
OF THEIR FRIENDS,

229
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,333
AND THEY'RE AWARE
OF THE LIKELIHOOD

230
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,958
OF US BEING FOLLOWED
BY THE DEAGUE.

231
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,083
STRESS IS AN ISSUE.

232
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,666
- ON THE FRONT LINES OF WAR,

233
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,500
SURPRISE ATTACKS LIKE THEY WENT
THROUGH HAPPEN ALL OF THE TIME.

234
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,125
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR
RELIEVING THEIR OWN STRESS.

235
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,791
IT'S PART OF BEING A SOLDIER.

236
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,875
- THEY'RE CADETS,
NOT BATTLE-HARDENED SOLDIERS.

237
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,333
- IN MY OPINION
THIS SHOULDN'T BE OVERLOOKED.

238
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,583
IF THEY'RE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO
LET OFF A LITTLE BIT OF STEAM,

239
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,166
I THINK THIS WILL
ALL WORK ITSELF OUT.

240
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,791
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

241
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,208
- Dufarge:
THE SHIP WILL BE DOCKING

242
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,250
AT THE GALL SPACE
SUPPLY DEPOT SHORTLY.

243
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,500
THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO

244
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,666
CONDUCT A TRAINING
EXERCISE ON BOARD THE SHIP

245
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,583
WHILE WE RE-SUPPLIED
AND MADE REPAIRS

246
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,791
BUT WE'VE NOW DECIDED TO CANCEL
ALL TRAINING FOR THE FIRST DAY.

247
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,291
THE TIME IS YOURS.

248
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,250
SHORE LEAVE ON GALL BEGINS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE DOCK.

249
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,083
- ( all cheering )

250
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,291
- Martha: THIS IS GONNA RULE!

251
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,541
- ( slurping )

252
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,791
- WE MADE IT!

253
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,291
- Male cadet operator:
THIS IS THE LIBERTAD,

254
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,916
REQUESTING IMMEDIATE
DOCKING FOR RESUPPLY, OVER.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,416
- Male controller: THIS IS
GALL CONTROL, WE CONFIRM THAT.

256
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,250
ENTER PORT THROUGH GATE THREE
AND THEN PROCEED TO DOCK.

257
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
- Male cadet operator:
ROGER THAT.

258
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,250
- DIRECTOR RADOFRICS!

259
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,166
THE CONSTRUCTION BUREAU
HAS SENT A COMPLAINT.

260
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,166
THEY'RE SAYING WE CAN'T
USE GATE THREE RIGHT NOW

261
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,041
BECAUSE IT WILL DELAY
THE SENSOR INSTALLATION.

262
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,625
- TELL THEM TO WAIT.

263
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,958
THIS IS A PRIORITY INBOUND AND
IT WAS THE ONLY GATE AVAILABLE.

264
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,000
- Chief controller: THEIR MAIN
BRIDGE IS TOTALLY DESTROYED!

265
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,250
IT'S AMAZING THEY'RE
STILL OPERATIONAL.

266
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,041
- Male controller: IT MUST BE
BEGINNER'S LUCK.

267
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,875
IT'S A TRAINING SHIP
FULL OF CADETS!

268
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,666
- NOW DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID
WHILE YOU'RE ON LEAVE, CADETS.

269
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,791
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE,

270
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,625
SO DON'T LET THE
OPPORTUNITY GO TO WASTE.

271
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,333
- RIGHT. OH, HEY, LOOK!
IT'S THE QUEEN AND HER SUBJECTS!

272
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,375
- WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US, GUYS?

273
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,166
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT FORTUNATELY FOR ME,

274
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,500
THE LADIES OF GALL
ARE WAITING, SO...

275
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,000
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

276
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,916
- IS SARA...

277
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,833
- SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS
GONNA STAY ON THE SHIP.

278
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,666
YOU KNOW I'M MAKING AN ATTEMPT
TO INCLUDE YOU IN THE GROUP.

279
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,875
FINE, SUIT YOURSELF.

280
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,083
- BYE, SARA.

281
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,125
- SHE SAID SHE NEEDED SOME ALONE
TIME TO FOCUS ON HER TRAINING.

282
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,166
- SHE WORKS HARD.

283
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,708
- LET'S GO.

284
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,125
- Dickon: THAT SUCKS, CARRIS.

285
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,166
- Carris: ENOUGH ALREADY!

286
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,416
- YAY FOR ME!

287
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,500
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALL READY TO GO.

288
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,333
JUST GET BACK HERE
ON TIME, ALRIGHT?

289
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,083
- WAIT, LAVINIA'S NOT HERE.

290
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,375
- WHERE'D SHE GO?

291
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,041
- I WOULDN'T BE THE
LEAST BIT SURPRISED

292
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,750
IF SHE WANTED SOME
TIME TO HERSELF.

293
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,625
IT SEEMS HER THREE NAKED
LAPS AROUND THE SHIP

294
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,083
HAVE TAKEN HER CONFIDENCE AND
THROWN IT OUT OF THE AIRLOCK.

295
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,625
- YEAH, SHE WAS
PRETTY EMBARRASSED.

296
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,333
- I GUESS ONLY ONE LAP WASN'T
ENOUGH TO SATISFY HER LIBIDO.

297
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,250
- SHE'S PROBABLY
ITCHING FOR MORE!

298
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,375
( chuckles )

299
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,833
- THREE LAPS?
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE.

300
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,750
I GUESS THE CADETS ARE
MORE STRESSED THAN I THOUGHT.

301
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,708
- I'VE SET IT UP SO
EVERY SIMULATION MODE

302
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,291
CAN BE CONTROLLED
FROM INSIDE THE COCKPIT.

303
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,250
YOU DO HAVE CONTINUAL OPERATION,

304
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,333
BUT I RECOMMEND A FIFTEEN
MINUTE REST EVERY HOUR.

305
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,583
- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO SHAME IN

306
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,125
TAKING A BREAK EVERY
NOW AND THEN, 'KAY?

307
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,125
- HURRY UP, CARMICHAEL.

308
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,750
OLD BEN IS NOTORIOUS
FOR CLOSING UP SHOP

309
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,541
WITH NO NOTICE
WHILE WE'RE DOCKED.

310
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,750
- GOOD LUCK, SARA!

311
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,791
( giggles )

312
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,750
- ( gasps )

313
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,375
- ( footsteps approaching )

314
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,916
- ( water flowing )

315
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,583
- Barrow: WHO JUST LEFT?

316
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,000
- Male enemy operator:
RALPH WEREC, SIR.

317
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,958
- SO HE'S GOING ROGUE AGAIN?

318
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,208
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
CAPTAIN MEDLOCK WAS THINKING

319
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,083
WHEN SHE AUTHORIZED
HIS LEVEL E ID.

320
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,041
- Medlock: IS THERE
A PROBLEM HERE?

321
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,708
- NO, I WASN'T REFERRING
TO YOU, CAPTAIN.

322
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,000
( gasps )

323
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHO'S IN THE TRANSPORT?

324
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,875
- OKAY. WE'LL BE
TOGETHER SOON, SARA!

325
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,333
- ( exhales )

326
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,583
I'M GOING TO TAKE A
QUICK BREAK, EMILY.

327
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,791
- SO YOU MUST BE
THE BEST FRIEND OF SARA'S

328
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,500
THAT'S BEEN MONOPOLIZING
ALL OF HER SPARE TIME!

329
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,500
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
IF YOU SUDDENLY WENT MISSING!

330
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,708
( giggles )

331
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,416
- ( crying ) WHERE ARE YOU,
POOR EMILY?

332
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,791
I MISS YOU SO MUCH!

333
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,875
- I AM SO SORRY!

334
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,333
DON'T YOU CRY, DARLING.

335
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,250
I'LL HELP YOU FIND HER,
OKAY BABY?

336
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,041
GREAT!

337
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,083
HEY, LOOK WHO I FOUND, SARA!
HERE YOU GO!

338
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,541
- THANKS, LAVINIA.

339
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,208
YOU ARE SO AMAZING.

340
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,458
- AFTER THIS THERE'S NO WAY
SHE CAN RESIST ME!

341
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,291
( giggles )

342
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,250
SIT TIGHT, OKAY?

343
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,833
I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU ONCE
I WIN OVER MY TRUE LOVE, SARA!

344
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,333
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

345
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,250
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

346
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,791
- EMILY?

347
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,416
EMILY!

348
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,166
- SHE'S WORRIED AND VULNERABLE.

349
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,541
LIKE I PLANNED.

350
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,250
TIME TO SAVE SARA. HERE GOES.

351
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,875
- EMILY, WHERE ARE YOU?

352
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,125
- SARA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

353
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,291
YOU OKAY?

354
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,416
- LAVINIA.

355
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,541
HAVE YOU SEEN EMILY?

356
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,500
THE GIRL I...
THE MIMIC THAT I USE.

357
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,916
SHE'S MISSING!

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,333
- THAT'S TERRIBLE, SARA.
LET ME HELP YOU FIND HER.

359
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,083
- SHE'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE LEFT.

360
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,041
I CAN'T LOSE HER,
NO MATTER WHAT.

361
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,250
WHERE IS SHE?

362
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,000
THAT GIRL IS MY ONLY HOPE!

363
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,333
- SARA.

364
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,750
YOU'RE IN LUCK.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE SHE MAY BE!

365
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,666
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS, SARA.

366
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,708
I NEVER MEANT TO MAKE YOU
WORRY LIKE THIS.

367
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,208
- ( both panting )

368
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,041
- YOU SEE? THERE!

369
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,625
( gasps )

370
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,375
WHAT THE CRAP?

371
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,083
I'M POSITIVE I PUT HER RIGHT
UP THERE JUST A MINUTE AGO!

372
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,041
- EMILY WAS HERE?

373
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,666
WHAT WOULD YOU
BRING HER IN HERE FOR?

374
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,083
( gasps )

375
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,083
- I'M SORRY.

376
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,208
- MAYBE SHE COULD HAVE...

377
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,125
OH, NO!

378
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
- WHAT IS IT?

379
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,958
- ( grunts )

380
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,000
WHERE'S THE TRASH?

381
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
- THEY JUST HAULED IT
OUT OF HERE A FEW MINUTES AGO.

382
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,083
- SARA! I ACTED
ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE!

383
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,791
I FIGURED YOU'D
BE BORED TRAINING

384
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,666
WHILE EVERYONE'S ON LEAVE!

385
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,500
- ( closing theme playing )

386
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

387
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,666
- Sara: WHERE COULD EMILY BE?

388
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,833
DURING MY SEARCH, A STRANGE
LITTLE GIRL APPEARS BEFORE ME.

389
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,708
ON THE NEXT STRAIN,
"GALL SPACE SUPPLY DEPOT."

390
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,750
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
