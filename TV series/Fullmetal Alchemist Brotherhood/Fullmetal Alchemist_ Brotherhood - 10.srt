a couple of reasons.

about our fighting...

[AL] Exactly... We feel like

as we can get.

tell us about the

the truth within the truth...

We haven't gotten any
closer to figuring it out...

226
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:32,568
There's a chance our teacher
knows something about it.

Let's hope she at least gives
us the chance to ask her...

Of course he does...

He just walked

He didn't even

up on something big...

him and he
used an outside line.

We're confident that we

That doesn't make sense,

I'm afraid I cannot.

I cannot tell you.

neglected to mention.

435

The Elric brothers
were recently here.

00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:45,502
They only departed
a couple of days ago.

437

They were here in Central?

438
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:50,236
[ARMSTRONG] Yes sir...
For a number of days.

439
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,602
And did they manage
to find whatever

440
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:54,369
they were looking for?

441
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,736
No sir... That would be rather

442
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,736
difficult as they
are pursuing a legend.

443
00:20:58,769 --> 00:20:59,836
Is that so...?

444
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:02,336
Well thanks for your help.

445
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,669
So, I guess he wasn't

446
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:06,536
as helpful to us as
we had hoped.

447
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,369
But not a waste
of our time...

448
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:10,902
He was more helpful
than he meant to be.

449
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,669
He said that they
had a strong lead,

450
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,936
singular tense,
on a few suspects...

451
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,802
Multiple suspects...

452
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:17,936
Which leads me to believe

453
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:21,436
they suspect
a group is responsible.

454
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:23,402
And his obstinate
refusal to talk,

455
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:26,736
even though I ordered
him to... can only mean...

456
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,002
There's gotta be an officer
above me that's ordered

457
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,902
him to keep quiet...

458
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:34,002
Most likely someone
of senior ranking.

459
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:35,136
The last clue...

460
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,802
was that he happened to
mention the Elric brothers...

461
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,836
They were researching...
the Philosopher's Stone.

462
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:42,736
[HAWKEYE]
I hate to say it,

463
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,336
but it sounds like
there might be some

464
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,936
kind of conspiracy
going on here...

465
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,402
But how does
it all tie together?

466
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,536
[ROY] That's
the big question.

467
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,602
But Hughes... I'd say he
deserves an answer...

468
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,302
Once I'm transferred
to Central...

469
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:59,269
I'm gonna start shaking
things up until I find one.

470
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:00,169
Doesn't sound
like you to

471
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,369
mix your public and
personal concerns.

472
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,369
There's no difference
between the two...

00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,669
I will become the
Fuhrer of this country...

And I will take
vengeance for Hughes...

475
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:11,869
I'll do these things because
I have to do them.

Are you with me, Lieutenant?

478
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,636
Do you even have to ask?

00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,936
<i>[NARRATOR] A young girl by</i>

00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:10,802
greets the Elrics to Rush Valley

<i>Episode Eleven.</i>
<i>Miracle at Rush Valley.</i>

486
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,936
<i>Were the words the boy</i>

00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,769
<i>Or something else?</i>
