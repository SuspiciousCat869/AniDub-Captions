1
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,029
[Roy] The Freezing Alchemist?
Really. He's here?

2
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:15,762
[Bradley] We have information
that he managed to slip

3
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:17,762
into Central a few days ago.

4
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:19,795
That's why I've
summoned you here, Colonel.

5
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,795
I need you and
your men to smoke him out,

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,762
and bring him in.

7
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:24,562
Consider it done, sir.

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:27,662
I'm glad you're with us in
Central for a while, Mustang.

9
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,995
It's good to know I have
people here I can count on.

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:30,662
Sir.

11
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:31,495
[Bradley] Ah, one last thing.

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,929
Our rising young star
is here as well.

13
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:35,729
I'm placing him at
your disposal.

14
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:37,562
Forgive me, Fuhrer
Bradley, but..

15
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:39,562
just to be clear, are
you referring to--?

16
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:43,729
I am... The Fullmetal Alchemist.
Edward Elric.

17
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:45,829
Ah, dammit...

18
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:48,395
The colonel's never gonna let
us get outta here, is he?

19
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:49,462
[Alfonse] We already
bought our tickets for

20
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,629
Liore, too. Does this
mean we're not going?

21
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:54,462
I don't know, Al...

22
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:57,362
For now, let's just get
this over with... OK?

23
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,995
[AL]
Lead the way, brother.

24
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,614
[Military Police 1]
There he goes! That way!

25
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,514
You, halt! Halt
or I'll shoot!

26
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,814
[electric shocks]

27
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,047
[screams]

28
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,047
[running footsteps]

29
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:46,814
[gun shot]

30
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,981
[grunt]

31
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,714
[Military Police 2] Ahh!

32
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:51,914
[electric shock]

33
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,081
[muffled grunt]

34
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,881
Water freezes. Water boils...

35
00:02:56,914 --> 00:03:00,014
Either way, you're
just as dead.

36
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,081
[whoosh]
[kerchank]

37
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,414
That's alchemy...

38
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:05,247
That's alchemy... [gasp]

39
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,647
[Edward] What a nasty
thing to do.

40
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:08,947
You of all people should know:

41
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,947
Great deeds require
great sacrifice!

42
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,581
Isn't that the law of
equivalent exchange?!

43
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:14,547
Save your breath.

44
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,814
The laws of alchemy
don't justify murder!

45
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,414
[magical electric shocks]

46
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:21,814
[epic morphing sounds]

47
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,814
No transmutation circle...?!

48
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:28,647
Don't be too impressed...

49
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:29,447
Now!

50
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,447
[surprised grunt]

51
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,647
[Al] Huh!

52
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:33,481
[metal impact]

53
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,647
[groan]

54
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,014
[Isaac] Ugh!

55
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,447
[Ed] Yah!

56
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,447
Ugh!

57
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,396
What?!

58
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:40,814
[whamp]

59
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:41,547
[Al] Ahh!

60
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:42,747
No! I had you!

61
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:43,714
Any water in there
should've boiled!

62
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,414
If it's any consolation,
you did ruin my coat.

63
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,981
An Automail arm...

64
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,147
[cloak swoosh]

65
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,047
A young, gifted alchemist...

66
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,147
One who doesn't use
transmutation circles...

67
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,581
and who has an
automail right arm...!

68
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,681
I know you...

69
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:07,747
You are the Fullmetal
Alchemist! Edward Elric!

70
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,747
[Isaac] So..it's not you?

71
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:16,614
Oh, um. No. I'm his
younger brother, Alphonse.

72
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,081
But he's a runt...!

73
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:21,014
Oh yeah?!
Can a runt do this?!

74
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,747
[electric shocks]
zszzerk

75
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,914
Ooh!

76
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,881
I'd heard the stories, but
still, I never imagined this...

77
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:30,714
The Fullmetal Alchemist
is just a little kid...!

78
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:32,481
Don't call me little!

79
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:33,547
Ooh!

80
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,747
[Al] You know, Brother,
I don't think he was really

81
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:38,181
talking about your
height just now.

82
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:41,414
Well, even if he wasn't
he still pissed me off!

83
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,614
So you're the one
we've been hearing

84
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,514
all the stories about lately...
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

85
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,947
You're as good as they
say. Thanks for the help.

86
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,581
[Al] Um, You're
welcome, but...

87
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,447
I'm really not the one you
should be thanking...

88
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,614
There!

89
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,814
C'mon, let's get goin' Al...
We've got a train to catch.

90
00:04:56,847 --> 00:05:00,147
[Al] Oh, okay, if you think
it's alright to leave...

91
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,581
[footsteps]

92
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:03,647
Ha!

93
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:06,714
Huh?

94
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,047
[laughter]

95
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:09,847
[typhoon-force water]

96
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,481
[cough]
What is that? Steam?

97
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:13,747
[Al]
Brother! He's gone!

98
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,714
Huh!

99
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,914
[Ed] Dammit, now he
really pissed me off!

100
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,947
[Roy] Looks like
you underestimated

101
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,081
your opponent,
Fullmetal.

102
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,147
Who is this guy, anyway?

103
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,814
[Roy] You'd know that if you
listened to the briefing

104
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,047
like I told you to...

105
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,814
But no, you had to go
charging right after him--

106
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,414
Yeah, yeah!
I get it, all right?

107
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,481
I'm sorry, 'kay?
Whatever.

108
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,947
Next time a superior tells
you to pay attention,

109
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,581
you might just try it.

110
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:39,047
[ED]
Fine.

111
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,814
Now then... His
name is Isaac McDougal.

112
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:45,547
Or, as he was known back in
the day, "Isaac the Freezer."

113
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,714
He's a former
State Alchemist.

114
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,947
[ED]
Former?

115
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,081
[Roy]
That's right...

116
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:52,414
He served in the
Ishvalan War...

117
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:54,847
During that time,
he gave us no signs

118
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,547
that he'd turned traitor...

119
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,147
But after.. he immediately
resigned his commission

120
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,414
and went into hiding...
He's been working with

121
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,914
the antiestablishment
movement ever since.

122
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,181
Taking him into custody
is a matter of top priority.

123
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:11,181
[Roy] Whether it's dead or
alive--that's up to him.

124
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,681
No way. I'm not
killing anyone for you.

125
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:15,081
[Roy]
And that's your choice...

126
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,781
Your orders are simply
to help us contain him.

127
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:18,814
That's all.

128
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,614
Hmph... Off topic...

129
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,814
Have you turned up any leads

130
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,014
for getting your bodies
back to normal?

131
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,647
Maybe if you ever
gave us time to look!

132
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,514
Roy! How goes?
Heard you let 'em

133
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,514
put you in charge of
catching the Freezer, huh?

134
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,181
One hell of a nasty
assignment...

135
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:39,781
But hey, could be your chance to
earn that promotion to Central?

136
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:42,047
Oh, say!.. Looks like my
timing was perfect!

137
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,914
You two are the Elric
brothers, right?

138
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:44,747
[Ed and Al] Uh-

139
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,447
Wow, it's an honor
to finally meet

140
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,747
the youngest State
Alchemist ever.

141
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,147
You're a real legend
around here...

142
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,581
I'm Lieutenant Colonel
Maes Hughes. A pleasure.

143
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:52,914
Um, you want Edward.

144
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,181
I'm actually his younger
brother, Alphonse.

145
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,481
What?!.. You're the
Fullmetal Alchemist?

146
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,081
Sorry, I had no
idea you'd be so--

147
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,181
[thinking] Go on,
say "little." I dare you--

148
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:02,147
[Roy] Hughes.

149
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,081
Yeah?

150
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,147
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,414
Go home.

152
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:06,147
Actually...

153
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,414
I'm here on official business.

154
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:10,047
You. Elrics...
I understand that

155
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,781
you two don't have
a place to stay,

156
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:13,581
which means you'll
have to come with me.

157
00:07:13,614 --> 00:07:14,747
[Al] Huh?

158
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,514
Ahh!

159
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,847
My wife Gracia and
my daughter Elicia.

160
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:24,781
We'd love to have you!

161
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,147
Hi, princess...!

162
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:27,981
[laughter]

163

My name is Edward Elric...

If we work together,

00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:58,781
we can bring down Bradley

207

and his god-forsaken military!

took place in Ishval...

You were there, dammit!

Bradley ordered us to do,

the kind of man
he really is!...

212
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,814
That's why you killed all
those officers, isn't it?

me all wrong.

My motives
aren't so sophisticated

as "revenge" or "honor"
or any of that...

218
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,547
The reason I killed
all of those men...

219
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,014
...was because I could.

220
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,047
It's that simple.

221
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,914
[Isaac] That's too
bad, Kimblee...

222

From what I'm told, you're

[Roy] Nah, I just destroyed

The Fuhrer is the one who
actually brought down McDougal.

00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,485
[Hughes] Sure. But the Fuhrer's
telling everyone it was you.

So congratulations!

huh? Suit yourself.

to take credit for
something you didn't do,

[Al] You know, we never

Philosopher's Stone...

No, but...

When I heard you were

to inspire your
recovery! You see?

You're looking

[Ed] Will you get out?!

Ah... I see,
so Isaac's dead, is he?

516
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:09,085
That's a shame. I had such
high hopes for him, too...
