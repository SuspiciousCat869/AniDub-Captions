1
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,957
[AIDE] So you think
that General Armstrong

2
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:39,028
had something to do

3
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:40,582
with General Raven's
disappearance?

4
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:41,716
[GARTNER]
It seems so...

5
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:45,449
However, she's too smart to
leave any evidence behind.

6
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,716
Yes, that's true.

7
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,182
Well, anyway...

8
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,682
The only thing we
have to worry about

9
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,982
is holding down this fort...

10
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,149
As for the general...

11
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,682
Well, I'm sure the
tigers in Central

12
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,216
will make sure
she's taken care of.

13
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,716
General Armstrong...

14
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:08,016
How nice to see you.

15
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:11,016
They posted you in
Central, Mustang?

16
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,216
You're well connected.

17
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,216
No, it's solely
based on merit.

18
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,516
That's rich coming from you.

19
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,049
[ROY] What brings you
here today, General?

20
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,116
Fuhrer Bradley summoned me

21
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,416
for an extended
stay, I imagine.

22
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,449
Is that so...?

23
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:33,316
Well, sometime, we
should grab some dinner.

24
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,116
Your treat...?

25
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:38,216
I hope you know I could
eat you into bankruptcy.

26
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,316
Maybe we should
skip dinner, then.

27
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:41,282
I see...

28
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:44,316
you're short on both
money and nerve, huh?

29
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,949
Maybe I could offer
some flowers, instead...

30
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:52,182
There are many fine
florists here in Central.

31
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,049
[OLIVIER]
Are there?

32
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,249
[knocking]

33
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,149
[BRADLEY]
You may enter.

34
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:01,582
[OLIVIER]
Sir!

35
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:14,182
[BRADLEY] Now then...
General Armstrong...

36
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,316
We need to talk about

37
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,716
General Raven's
recent disappearance.

38
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,082
Just what have you done?

39
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,682
<i>[OLIVIER]</i>
I won't be able to hide it all.

40
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,049
Pardon me, Your Excellency,

41
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:26,449
but I simply don't understand

42
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,316
how you could employ
someone as careless

43
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,349
and incompetent
as General Raven.

44
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:35,182
Is that the reason you
saw fit to dispose of him?

45
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,182
Surely you don't need him...

46
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,582
It can't be good
to have someone

47
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,982
so talkative on
you senior staff.

48
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,416
You have me intrigued, General.

49
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,349
What did Raven say?

50
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,182
Immortality...

51
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,182
the history of this country...

52
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,282
Your Excellency's identity...

53
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,349
He told me all sorts of things
without any prompting.

54
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:58,182
[BRADLEY] Hmmm... And
after learning all of this,

55
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,449
you still responded
to my summons?

56
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,249
Yes, sir....

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,582
I assume you'll
be needing someone

58
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,316
to fill that fool's vacant seat?

59
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,382
[BRADLEY]
Interesting...

60
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,716
I like the way you play.

61
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,049
Very well...

62
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:15,182
You can have General
Raven's seat...

63
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,316
but, as I expect
you'll understand,

64
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:20,516
my men will take over
Ft. Briggs... Agreed?

65
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,949
Of course... as you wish.

66
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,949
My soldiers are extremely
strong and well-trained, sir...

67
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:29,282
I guarantee they will serve
you well, Your Excellency.

68
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,182
I'm sure they will...

69
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:34,616
I appreciate the
sacrifice, General...

70
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,682
[HENSCHEL]
To steal a tiger's cubs,

71
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,316
you have to enter her den.

72
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,416
And it seems like the
General's landed herself

73
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,649
right in the middle of it...

74
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:49,049
Yeah. And now this
place is theirs, too.

75
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:49,916
But still...

76
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,282
there's one thing
they don't know...

77
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:54,449
Although our leader
might be gone...

78
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,682
we still stand as one...

79
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:59,282
We act with one will.

80
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,449
That's the Fort Briggs way.

81
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,182
From here on...

82
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,349
the bears will fight the tigers.

83
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,846
[ROY]
Is this spot taken?

84
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,853
[HAWKEYE]
No.

85
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,001
[HAWKEYE]
So how is work treating you?

86
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,268
[ROY]
See for yourself.

87
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,468
I have to work
through every meal,

88
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,234
or I can't keep up...

89
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:31,334
And how bout you?

90
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:33,001
I've been staying busy too,

91
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,368
especially with everything
I've had to learn...

92
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,301
Fuhrer Bradley works
very efficiently though,

93
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,134
so that helps...

94
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,068
He isn't a slacker,
that's for sure.

95
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,201
Sounds like this is gonna
be a dull conversation.

96
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:52,434
Well, apparently...

97
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:53,934
[tap tap]

98
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,568
[HAWKEYE]
Scar is up in the north...

99
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:02,234
The Elric brothers
are up there, as well.

100
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,968
I see.

101
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,268
[tap tap]

102
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,568
My former classmates,

103
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,401
Lucy and Ian are
stationed up there.

104
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,334
They like to
keep me informed.

105
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:11,534
Hmm...

106
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,234
aren't the north
and east conducting

107
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,268
joint exercises
this spring?

108
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,968
Yes, I think you're
right about that.

109
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,968
I hope Major Miles

110
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,401
and Buccaneer
don't show us up

111
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,968
like they have
in the past

00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,534
Oh, no!

00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,568
[HOMUNCULUS]
It's all right.

124

Look. Over here.

125
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,134
Um, yeah?

126
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:31,534
[HOMUNCULUS]
Hey, now...

127
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,301
Can't you at least
bring yourself to act

128
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:36,001
a little surprised or something?

129
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,534
[HOHENHEIM] What do I
get for acting surprised?

130

[HOMUNCULUS]
Hmm... You show no fear...

131
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:44,134
I like that.
What's your name?

132
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,001
I'm Number 23.

133
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,534
[HOMUNCULUS]
Not your number...

134
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,634
I want you to tell
me your real name.

135
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:50,901
I'm a slave...

136
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,168
I don't have one...

137
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,234
[HOMUNCULUS]
A slave...?

138
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,968
You mean a person without
any rights or freedoms,

139
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,034
someone trafficked and
deeded as a possession?

140
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:00,601
Deeded? What's that?

141
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,168
[HOMUNCULUS] It's when
a piece of property

142
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:06,001
is transferred
to another person.

143

Seems you're not all
that bright, are you?

Hey, get outta here!

[HOMUNCULUS] How could
I possibly have been born

146
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,968
from someone as
stupid as you...?

147
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:21,034
You are the one who
gave me blood, right?

148
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,101
I guess so.

use it for an experiment.

a name of your own.

00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:55,101
Maybe we shouldn't put
too many syllables in it.

164
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,601
Hey you, I'm
plenty smart!

165
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,901
[HOMUNCULUS]
Well, how about Van...

166
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,934
Van Hohenheim,
how does that sound?

167
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,168
So Van Hohenheim, huh?

168
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,534
I think I can remember that.

169
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:07,601
[HOMUNCULUS]
It's spelled...

170
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:11,168
Oh... you don't know how
to read and write, do you?

171
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:14,168
I don't need to read
and write to do my work.

172
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:17,934
[HOMUNCULUS]
Your slave work.

173
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:20,601
Don't you even want freedom?

174
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:23,968
Are you going to live out the
rest of your life as a slave,

175
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:27,668
without the rights
of a real man?

176
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,334
In that case,

177
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,168
you're no different from me,

178
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,268
trapped inside
this stuffy flask.

179
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:36,134
Let me teach you...

180
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:39,268
Van Hohenheim.

181
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,001
[HOHENHEIM]
Hey...

182
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,534
What are you...?
Who are you...?

183
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,368
What do I call you?

184
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,534
[HOMUNCULUS] I'll tell
you what, Van Hohenheim,

185
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:53,168
you can call me the Dwarf
in the Flask, Homunculus.

186
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:07,601
[MASTER]
All things are made from one...

187
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,401
and in the end, all
things return to one.

188
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,001
[HOHENHEIM]
In other words, one is all...

189
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,468
[MASTER] Indeed, and
all is one as well.

190
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,568
All is ultimately
of the one...

191
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,268
So if all is not
included in the one...

192
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,634
then all is nothing.

193
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,134
You have passed...

194
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,668
You are now an
alchemist, Hohenheim...

195
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,668
Well done, child.

196
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:33,501
I'm still only fit
to be an assistant...

197
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:36,434
My skill is nothing
near yours, Master.

198
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:41,368
[HOHENHEIM]
I'm grateful to you.

199
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:43,101
[HOMUNCULUS]
Oh? For what?

200
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,401
[HOHENHEIM]
I live as well as I do now

201
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:47,234
because of the
knowledge you gave me.

202
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:50,301
And I have also earned
the master's respect...

203
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,168
Thanks to you, maybe someday...

204
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,934
I'll even be able to get
married and have a family.

205
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,034
[HOMUNCULUS]
A family, huh?

206
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,201
How inconvenient
for you humans.

207
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:01,434
Unless you form
communities and breed,

208
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:04,134
your species can't
continue to exist.

209
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,634
Don't call it breeding...

210
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,301
And whether or
not it's a concept

211
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,134
that you're able
to understand...

212
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,601
That's where humans...
find happiness.

213
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,401
We live for the
bonds that we form

214
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:15,268
with friends and
family members...

215
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,001
That's who we humans are.

216
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,068
[HOMUNCULUS]
Sure, whatever you say.

217
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:22,134
Okay then, what is it
that makes you happy?

218
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:23,334
[HOMUNCULUS]
Well...

219
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,268
I'd hate to be guilty
of asking too much,

220
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:30,568
but I think I'd be happy if
I could just leave this flask...

221

<i>[NARRATOR]</i>

<i>[NARRATOR]</i>
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

223
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:43,931
[HOMUNCULUS]
Immortality...

224
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,697
Why would someone who
already has so much power

225
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,197
and prosperity
need such a thing?

226
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:50,897
[MASTER]
Watch your tongue.

227
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,031
You're in the royal presence.

228
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:54,931
If you continue
with this insolence,

229
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,231
I will smash your flask!

230
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:57,797
[HOMUNCULUS] You wouldn't
dare to destroy such

231
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:01,164
an important
source of knowledge.

232
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:03,231
[KING OF XERXES]
That's enough chatter.

233
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,464
Immortality... tell me,
is it possible, or isn't it?

234
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:10,064
[HOMUNCULUS] Growing
impatient in your old age?

235
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:15,497
How lamentable, King of Xerxes.

236
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,497
Okay...

237
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:19,731
I'll tell you how you
can achieve immortality.

238
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:26,564
[VILLAGER 1]
What are you digging here for?

239
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:27,997
[MAN]
Irrigation canals...

240
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,864
The king's ordered them

241
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,831
to be dug all
throughout the country.

242
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,697
[VILLAGER 1]
That's the King for you.

243
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,931
He even cares about the
well being of us commoners.

244
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,731
Yes, he does.

245
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,731
Remember, there
must be no survivors.

246
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,831
[KING OF XERXES]
Hurry...! Quickly!

247
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:06,764
Carve out the crests of blood
while there's still time.

248
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,531
[CITY MAN 1]
The north village was attacked?

249
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:15,931
[CITY WOMAN]
I heard they all died!

250
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:17,997
[CITY MAN 2]
Before, it was the west village.

251
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,664
[CITY MAN 1]
Who could be doing this?

252
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,731
What an awful tragedy.

253
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:24,897
[HOMUNCULUS]
Yeah... real tragic.

254
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,731
Majesty... at long last,

255
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:48,864
your transmutation
circle is complete.

256
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:52,131
Hmmmm...
Took long enough...

257
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,631
Finally, it's done...

258
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:58,597
This is it? Everything's ready?

259
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,597
[HOMUNCULUS] Yes.
You may now become immortal.

260
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,731
Incredible...

261
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:24,697
The king will
achieve immortality.

262
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:31,797
[HOMUNCULUS] Yes, this is
an amazing moment, indeed.

263
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,197
This is immortality?

264
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,097
No, no, you must be wrong!

265
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:59,131
I don't understand it!

266
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,197
[KING OF XERXES]
You said if we were in

267
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:03,431
the center of the circle,
we wouldn't be harmed!

268
00:15:09,164 --> 00:15:10,197
What the--?!

Wha-What's going on here...?!

Hey...! Homunculus!

you're standing.

It is?

Surely you remember

that your blood is within me...

276
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:27,064
I used it to open the doorway.

290
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:38,642
There must be someone left!

00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,376
[FATHER]
It's no use.

292
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,876
All of their souls have
been taken from them.

[HOHENHEIM]
Majesty! Are you all right?

294
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,109
[FATHER]
Tell me...

295
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:55,509
Your body...
how is it feeling?

296
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,542
It's me...! Impossible...

297
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,676
[FATHER]
Using your blood,

298
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,342
I created a
receptacle for myself...

299
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,909
Nice... Finally...

300
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,909
I can walk on
my own two legs.

301
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:14,042
Are you... the
Homunculus in the flask?

302
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,142
What's going on here?

303
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:16,576
What is this?
What have you done?

304
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,276
To thank you for your blood...

305
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,676
I've given you a name...

306
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,642
And I've given you knowledge...

307
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:22,642
And now...

308
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:26,576
I've given you a body
that will live forever.

309
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,676
I'm immortal?!

310
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,242
[FATHER] Focus your attention
within yourself, Hohenheim.

311
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,109
You hear them, don't you...?

312
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,676
The voices of all the
people in this country

313
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:46,442
who were offered in exchange
for your immortality?

314
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:51,476
Well, half of their lives
were for me, actually.

315
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,976
I appreciate your
cooperation, Hohenheim.

316

[IZUMI]
Van Hohenheim?

317
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,109
I knew it!

318
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,009
[IZUMI]
Finally...

319
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,909
I get the chance to
meet Ed and Al's father.

320
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,676
[HOHENHEIM] And I finally get to
meet the one who taught my sons.

321
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,076
I'm sure they must
have been a handful.

322
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,576
Oh, no... They were fine boys.

323
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:31,442
What is it?

324
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:33,642
Izumi...! Are you all right?

325
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,009
Let me get your medicine.

326
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,676
[HOHENHEIM]
May I have a look at her...?

327
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,142
I know a bit about
the medical field.

328
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,909
Sure...

329
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:49,642
[IZUMI] I'm all right...
This happens.

330
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,642
No, you are not all right...

331
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:55,242
Mr. Sig, find us a car, quickly!

332
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,142
Hurry!

333
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:58,042
Right...! I'm on it.

334
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:05,142
Ms. Izumi...

335
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:08,676
You have... seen the truth?

336
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,442
What did you sacrifice?

337
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,542
Please be honest with me.

338
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,276
[IZUMI]
My insides... were taken.

339
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,242
I was trying to bring
my child back to life.

340
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,476
I see.

341
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,509
Yes...

342
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:35,276
I see.

343
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,042
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,242
Izumi! Hang on! Izumi!

345
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:00,976
[IZUMI] Calm down, dear...
Please... I'm all right.

346
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,042
He shoved his hand into you!

347
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:06,509
But my breathing...
It's easier.

348
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,442
How can that be?

349
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,509
[IZUMI]
There's... no wound.

350
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,576
[SIG]
That's impossible.

351
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:16,942
[HOHENHEIM]
Your organs were taken away

352
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,409
as a testament to your sin;

353
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,276
they cannot be brought back...

354
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,542
but I did rearrange
your entrails somewhat

355
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:25,142
to improve the flow of blood.

356
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:26,442
Ms. Izumi...

357
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:31,009
You cannot give into
your fate just yet.

358
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:34,542
You're the boys'
father... But who...

359
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,309
Who <i>are</i> you?

360
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,276
Who am I?

361
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,542
I am a Philosopher's Stone...

362
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:44,576
in the form of a man.

363
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:47,309
That's <i>what</i> I am.

[ED] The Sorcerer's Stone...
The Celestial Stone...

The Grand Elixir...

366
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,851
The Philosopher's Stone
is known by many names...

367
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:28,384
it's not necessarily a stone.

368
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:32,751
The one Dr. Marcoh had
was a semi-liquid form.

369
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:35,484
The one that Kimblee has
is similar to a crystal...

370
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:36,951
And it's about this big.

371
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,984
You say it has
incredible power...

372
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,684
I would have expected it to
be a little bigger than that.

373
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,351
It's not. I've never seen one

374
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:46,651
that's much bigger
than a small pebble.

375
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:49,984
Besides... to create a
Philosopher's Stone that big...

376
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:53,584
you'd have to kill
thousands of people.

377
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,284
Maybe it's possible...

378
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,384
but I wouldn't
ever want to see it.
