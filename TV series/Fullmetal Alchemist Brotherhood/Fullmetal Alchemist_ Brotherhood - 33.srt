00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:39,745
<i>a young girl from Xing</i>
<i>who practices alkahestry.</i>

3
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,511
<i>After receiving a tip</i>
<i>from Colonel Mustang,</i>

4
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,311
<i>the brothers head</i>
<i>north in pursuit.</i>

5
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,345
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Scar leaves Central</i>

6
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,711
<i>and blazes a</i>
<i>trail heading west...</i>

7
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,345
<i>His every movement is tracked</i>

8
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,411
<i>by the Crimson</i>
<i>Alchemist Kimblee.</i>

9
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:57,378

<i>deep cover of night...</i>

10
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:00,811
<i>Scar's trail</i>
<i>inexplicably disappears.</i>

11
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:06,678
[KIMBLEE] If he was going
to jump from the train

12
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,645
this is where he would do it.

13
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:12,278
The engine's speed
would decrease here.

14
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,745
So what we need to know...

15
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,511
is which way he headed
after reaching this point.

16
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,678
Any Scar sightings to report?

17
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,845
[OFFICER A]
No... Nothing definite.

18
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:24,211
[KIMBLEE]
That's odd... Up until now,

19
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,211
he's been deliberately
conspicuous.

20
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,778
I have a report, sir...!

21
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,545
There was a small
boat that was stolen

22
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:33,278
near the river about two
hundred meters south of here.

23
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,411
Was it Scar?

24
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,211
There aren't any eyewitnesses
to confirm that, sir.

25
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,111
[OFFICER A]
Look into it!

26
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,245
Yes, Sir!

27
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:40,178
Reporting, sir...!

28
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,245
We've talked to an
old man who lives nearby

29
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,278
that claims to have seen

30
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:45,678
a suspicious pair of
men who were heading west.

31
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,678
[OFFICER B]
Hmm... Could be our targets...

32
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,778
Take a search
party to investigate.

33
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,178
[SOLDIER B]
Sir!

34
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,211
Is there something wrong?

35
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:57,511
[KIMBLEE] I'm not sure
yet... On the map...

36
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:00,545
looks like there's a road
near here that leads north...

37
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,245
There--what is that?

38
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,145
[OFFICER A] It was an old
logging road that passed

39
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:05,645
through the mountains
to the North Area,

40
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:07,145
but there were
too many rockslides,

41
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:09,545
so they had to
close it down...

42
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:11,311
Why do you ask?

43
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,611
[OFFICER B] There are
several other places

44
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,445
further on where rockslides
have closed the road.

45
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,645
[KIMBLEE] The water's
flow here has been altered.

46
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,478
[OFFICER B] Yes, sir...
Does that mean something?

47
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,711
[KIMBLEE] For an alchemist
skilled in destruction...

48
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,545
clearing even
this big an obstacle

49
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:59,378
would be a simple task.

50
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,745
[OFFICER A]
Sir?

51
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,311
And it would be equally simple

52
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,811
for him to destroy
the face of a mountain

53
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,445
to once again block this
road with a rockslide.

54
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:12,545
[OFFICER A]
Transmutation marks?

55
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:14,578
Send the soldiers north.

56
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,859
Look! There's snow!

57
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:46,792
[AL]
Brother!

58
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,759
[AL]
Ed, you are so uncoordinated.

59
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,825
Oh, shut up...! It was
just a little slip! Jeez...

60
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,625
[AL]
All this snow is amazing, huh?

61
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,359
Yeah... you don't get much snow

62
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:05,392
like this back home,
that's for sure.

63
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:06,359
Oh yeah, Hey Al...!

64
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,292
Do you remember that
one really heavy snow

65
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,625
we had back when
we were little?

66
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,392
[AL]
Maybe...

67
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,559
[AL]
Oh yeah, I remember!

68
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,725
We had a snowball fight!

69
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,559
[ED]
And we made a snowman!

70
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:23,325
[AL]
Yea!

71
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,625
Back then I never imagined

72
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,725
we would come this far north...

73
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,759
It seemed impossible.

74
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,492
Yeah... but here we are now.

75
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,892
So, now what do we do...?

76
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,359
We still have a
little bit of time

77
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,892
before our train
to Briggs takes off.

78
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,525
[AL] Why don't you
grab something to eat?

79
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,025
[ED]
Eh, I don't know...

80
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,759
I'm really not
all that hungry...

81
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,625
But... I guess
we could look.

82
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,792
[AL] Careful! You're
gonna fall again!

83
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,559
[ED]
Shut up!

84
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,059
[SOLDIER D]
As of three hours ago,

85
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,592
the express still
hadn't arrived.

86
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,759
That accident last night
is really holding things up.

87
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,392
Any new information?

88
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:11,692
[OFFICER A]
Unfortunately, no.

89
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:15,025
But we're doing
everything we can.

90
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,759
There was a man
fitting Scar's description

91
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,459
seen at the station
one stop ahead, sir.

92
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,892
Are you sure
about that, soldier?

93
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,359
Absolutely, sir...

94
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,525
Eyewitnesses saw
him getting aboard

95
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,959
a military train bound
for the Briggs station.

96
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:28,592
Was anyone with him?

97
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,459
[SOLDIER C] A middle-aged
man with black hair,

98
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,892
just like the report says.

99
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,525
I'll have the train
stopped at once!

100
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,892
[KIMBLEE]
That won't be necessary...

101
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,892
We don't want him
jumping off the train again,

102

after all.

103
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,792
All right. From now on

104
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,592
this job is mine and mine alone.

105
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,792
I don't want you
people getting in my way,

As soon as we hit
the northern cold,

110
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,759
you won't be able to sleep,

even if you want to.

112

I'm jumping over
to that train now,

00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,792
so match it's speed.

I'm here to apprehend you...

You can't run anymore.

I can't!

Oh... I remember
you very well indeed...

137
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,680
You were in the
Kanda district of Ishval,

they were members

except he had glasses...

Of course, it's hard to see

a family resemblance
when someone

We'll settle this
next time, Ishvalan!

Kimblee!!

Dammit, I can't see...

164
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:01,580
What do you think
that sound was?

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,213
We lost the rear cars!

166
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:15,246
Well what do we do...?

167
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,813
The military told us
not to stop for anything!

168
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:18,946
We have to...!

169
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,546
If we let this train derail,

170
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,380
we're gonna be the ones
who are blamed for it.

What're you doing...?

173
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,646
Who said you were
allowed to stop?

174
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,213
Huh?

175
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,780
[KIMBLEE]
Keep the train going...

176
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,846
We're heading north!

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,946
Ah, yes... death...
it's closing in.

178
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,913
One who spreads
death and destruction...

179
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,946
must accept their pursuit....

180
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,380
He will never be
far from either...

181
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,846
But what could
be more beautiful

182
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,313
than doing work that
puts your soul at risk...?

183
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:16,246
Because that's what
it means to be alive...

184
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,413
At least on this battlefield!

185
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,613
[MAY] I hope Mr. Scar and
Mr. Yoki are doing all right.

186
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,980
[MARCOH] Since no one
has come after us so far...

187
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,513
they must be
doing a good job

188
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,946
of drawing the
military's attention...

189
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,813
I hope they're safe, too.

190
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,680
Hey, what's wrong?

191
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:41,813
Nothing.

192
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,313
My skin's still healing.

193
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:45,413
It stings to have the
wind blowing against it,

194
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,813
that's all.

195

[MAY]
I'm sorry...

196
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,213
I wish I could've healed
your face completely

197
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,946
so it wouldn't hurt so much.

[MARCOH]
No...

199

This is the face a man
like me deserves to wear...

200
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,680
I am content with it.

201
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,513
Stop for a second.
Look over there!

202
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,613
[MARCOH]
The Briggs Mountain Range.

203
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,280
Those peaks mark our
border with Drachma,

204
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,646
the large country to the north.

205
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Judging by those,

206
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:12,980
we should be getting close

207
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,946
to the place Scar showed us.

208
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,713

No... they left yesterday.

Do you have any idea
where they might have gone?

215
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:55,921
[FRONT DESK] I believe they
said they were going north.

Is something wrong

I'm not sure. Apparently,
they're heading north.

All right, this is
where I let you go, boys.

If you follow

00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:08,081
sent us here to meet with the
general in charge of this post.

321
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:11,181
[ED] Can you call
off your guard dogs?

322
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:13,348
[OLIVIER]
Search them.

323
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,481
[ED]
But I'm with the military!

324
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,548
[OLIVIER]
Sure.

325
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:18,248
But how do I verify that?

326
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,081
Anyone can claim to
be somebody famous.

327
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:22,614
[PATROLMAN A]
Hey, he's hollow!

328
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,614
Oh, you noticed...

329
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:28,081
[PATROLMAN B]
What's this?

330
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:29,381
General!

331
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:30,581
[ED]
That's a letter of introduction

332
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:33,548
from Major Alex Louis Armstrong.

333
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,948
Just read that...

334
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,048
Then you'll know
you can trust us.

335
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:41,514
It's from Alex, all right.

336
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:46,481
[ED] Aren't you even
going to read it?!

337
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,548
[OLIVIER]
A letter of introduction

338
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,281
means nothing to me.

339
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,481
I don't put much stock

340
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,148
in anyone else's
opinions of a person...

341
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:56,614
I prefer to judge the people
I meet with my own eyes.

342
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,514
Th-Th-That's amazing!

343
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:17,181
It's huge...!
What is this place?

344
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,948
[OLIVIER]
Enter... Fullmetal Alchemist.

345
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:21,881
[ED]
This is incredible!

346
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,214
That wall is really,
really, really tall!

347
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:27,048
Quit gaping like an
idiot and start walking...

348
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:30,448
before I tear your little
body apart limb from limb.

349
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:38,214
Be warned: I won't coddle
you because you're children.

350
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:41,514
This is the mountain
fortress... Briggs.

351
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:44,381
Here, only the strong survive.

352
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,448
[MAY]
There it is!

353
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,448
[MARCOH] That's it. Scar's
brother's research notebook.

354
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,281
[MAY] He studied different
ways of combining

355
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,648
Xingese Alkahestry
with Amestrian Alchemy,

356
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:42,781
didn't he...?

357
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:45,448
Do you think that could be
the secret to immortality?

358
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,914
[MARCOH]
I'm not sure, but maybe so.

359
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:50,248
Will the information

360
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,081
in this book bring us hope...?

361
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:55,414
Or do its pages contain
nothing but despair?

362
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:02,181
Well...there's only
one way to find out.

363
