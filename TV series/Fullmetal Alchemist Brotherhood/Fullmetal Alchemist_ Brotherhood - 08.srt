[48] Hmm... Perhaps I should
introduce myself again...

This laboratory...

83
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,082
Are they using condemned
prisoners like you

84
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,448
to make Philosopher's
Stones here?

85
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,582
[48] That I
can't tell you.

It isn't my area...

87
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:16,048
They simply
recognized my skills...

88
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,148
gave me this body,

89
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,448
and made me their
trusty guard dog.

90
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,748
[ED]
Interesting...

91

you a seal too--

92

To serve as a medium
between soul and armor?

93
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:28,582
[48] Yes...
I have a bloodseal.

Nice try, kid...

104
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:53,048
but what kind
of mass murderer

105
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:56,082
lets his prey
get away so easily?

106
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,848

and on a military line, too!

119
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,115
[HUGHES] Not just
my daughter, colonel...

120
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,648
I'll gush over
my wife, too!

Go ahead, Colonel...

gush over your very own...

Scar-faced Ishvalan.

125
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:35,882
[ROY] We've
found many bodies

126
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,815
on the site
where he vanished...

127
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,115
But all of them
are so decomposed

128
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,415
that it's been difficult
to identify them.

129
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:45,582
[ROY] He hasn't been
sighted anywhere in the east.

130
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,782
[ROY]
So at the present,

131
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,482
many people here think it's
most likely that he's dead.

132
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:50,382
[HUGHES] If that's the case,

133
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,948
I should be able to
lift the bodyguard

134

never beaten him!

still for a second

and let me cut you up,
you big bucket of bolts!

184
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:11,686
Rrgggh! Augggh!

185
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:21,986
You're empty!

[66]
Hahaha!

187
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,386
[66] There's a bit of
a story behind that.

188
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,886
[66] Would ya
like to hear...?

189
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,553
It's a pretty good yarn...

190
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,620
You probably already
know it, though.

191
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:36,353
It all starts with a
man by the name of Barry.

192
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:39,686
[66] Once upon a time,

193
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,053
right here in Central,

194
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,686
there was a
butcher named Barry

195
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,386
who loved his work...

196
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,720
His favorite part
was cutting up

197
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,520
the meat into little,
tiny pieces...

198
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,486
But one day, Barry
found that cutting up

199
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,620
beef and pork wasn't
enough anymore...

200
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,353
So he took to the
streets and began

201
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,486
cutting up people
instead, night after night.

202
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,020
[66] In time, of course,
Barry was caught...

203
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,886
but not before
twenty-three victims

204
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,886
had fallen prey to
him and his knife.

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,486
[66] Naturally, after
terrorizing Central for so long,

206
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,486
Barry was sent to the
gallows for his wicked deeds...

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,953
and the world was happily
rid of yet another evil man.

208
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,353
[66] At least, that's what
everyone out there believes...

209
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,120
But our story
isn't over yet.

210
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,053
We haven't even
reached the good part.

211
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,353
Barry isn't actually
dead, you see...

212
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,086
He's very much alive and

213
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,786
charged with guarding
a certain place--

214
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,620
only, without his body...

215
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:34,886
[66]
Yes, that's right...!

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,420
He's standing in front
of your very eyes...!

217
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:40,820
I am the infamous serial
killer, Barry the Chopper!

218
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,053
[AL] Sorry, I've
never heard of you.

219
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,586
[AL] I'm from a little
town in the east, so--

220
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,486
[66] Fine, but even if
you don't know who I am,

221
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,586
shouldn't you at least
be a little scared...?!

222
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,120
Shouldn't you
be going, "AHHH!"

223
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,986
or "What happened
to your body?!"

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,486
Or Something!?

225
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,253
AHHH...!

226
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,386
What happened to
your body, freak?!

227
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,620
[AL] Hey... now
that's impolite.

228
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:06,420
[66] Oh! I see! You
were on death row too.

229
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:07,753
You had me
startled there.

230
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,853
[AL] No way!
I'm not a criminal!

231
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,420
[66] Huh? Then what
happened to you?

232
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,420
[AL]
It's kind of a long story.

233
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:15,486
When I lost my body,

234
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,886
my brother
transmuted my soul

235
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,020
and bonded it to this armor.

236
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,053
[66 laughing]
Your brother?

237
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:23,653
Of course! Your brother!

238
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,353
[AL] What's so
funny about it?

239
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:26,120
[66]
Hahaha!

240
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,520
Are you sure you
and your brother

241
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,453
are really related?

242
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,353
[AL] Well,
I guess we don't look

243
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:31,920
that much
alike anymore...

244
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:34,486
[66] No, no, no...
That's not what I mean.

245
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,120
[66] Are you sure
that you're not a puppet

246
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:40,386
created and controlled
by your so-called brother?

247
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,086
[66] Were you ever even a
real person to begin with?

248
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,520
[AL] How can you ask
something like that...?!

249
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:46,620
I was a real boy,

250
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,620
and my name was
Alphonse Elric!

251
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,620
[66]
Hahahah!

252
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,086
How can you be
so sure of that?

253
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,620
[AL]
I have memories!

254
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,820
I remember who
I was before.

255
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:55,553
[66]
And who's to say

256
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,386
those memories
aren't made up?

257
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:01,020
[AL] But Winry and
Granny--they know me!

258
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,353
[66] That's easy...
They're in on it too.

You were never
alive to begin with...

262
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,786
It's as simple as that.

263
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,453
[AL]
Then how do you know

264
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:11,820
that you were really alive?

265
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:13,820

463
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:49,785
[disgruntled racket]

464
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:52,151
[GUARD 1] All of you!
Quiet...! Calm down now!

465
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,418
[KIMBLEE]
What a lovely sound.

466
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:58,851
[KIMBLEE]
I know it well...

467
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:02,751
That's the sound of
a building exploding.

468
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:03,585
Close as it is,

469
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,185
I'd say it's coming
from next door,

470
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:07,051
the Fifth Laboratory.

471
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,885
Ah... It's such a
comforting sound...

472
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:14,451
The way it reverberates
through your entire body!

473
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,785
[GUARD] You keep it
down in there, Kimblee!

474
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,185
[KIMBLEE]
Oh, do excuse me...

475
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,018
I was just recalling
the Ishvalan War

476
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,018
of Extermination,
and it put me

477
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,951
in such a good mood!

478
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:36,018
[66] Are you sure
you're not a puppet

479
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,751
created by your
so-called brother?

480
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,085
[HUGHES] So things here at
Central are pretty hectic...

481
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:19,818
The senior staff in
charge of State Alchemists

482
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,718
is shorthanded, thanks
to Scar's killing spree.

483
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:23,485
[ROY]
Oh?

484
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:24,485
[HUGHES]
Rumor has it;

485
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:26,351
a promotion to Central
for one Colonel Mustang

486
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:27,885
isn't far off.

487
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:31,151
[ROY] Central, huh...?
Not bad at all.

488
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,918
[HUGHES]
Watch yourself, though.

489
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:33,651
[HUGHES]
You can't move up

490
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,118
the ladder as
young as you are

491
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,185
without making enemies.

492
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:40,318
[ROY] I've been prepared
for that from the start.

493
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,285
[HUGHES] Just a
word of warning

494
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,485
from someone who
knows the game.

495
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:44,718
[HUGHES]
You need as many people

496
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,351
on your side as you can get
your hands on now, Colonel...

497
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,918
which means...

498
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:51,951
[HUGHES]
Get yourself a wife!

499
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:53,951
[ROY]
Seriously?!

500
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:54,751
[HUGHES]
I don't get it...

501
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:56,351
He hung up on
me just like that.

502
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:57,418
[RECEPTIONIST]
Lieutenant Colonel...!

503
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:59,985
Stop making so many
personal phone calls, okay?

504
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:01,118
[HUGHES]
Oh...! So sorry!

505
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:06,385
