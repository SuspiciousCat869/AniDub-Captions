1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,286
[explosion]

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,174
[COMANCHE] So you dare to
challenge Giolo Comanche,

3
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,774
the Silver Alchemist,
to battle, do you...?

4
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:15,107
You've got guts,
I'll give you that...

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,207
However...

6
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:32,641
[crash]

7
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,674
[COMANCHE] Not bad,
not bad at all...

8
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,807
You got off with
just a scratch.

9
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,474
[SCAR]
You can't say the same.

10
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,456
[SCAR]
What's going on?

11
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,423
Who is this?

12
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:52,890
[YOKI] Oh, sir,
you've returned!

13
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,456
Welcome back.

14
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,990
[SCAR] I said,
who is this?!

15
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:57,723
[MAY]
Pleased to meet you.

16
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,823
[MAY] My name
is May Chang, sir.

17
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,123
[MAY] I was collapsed
by the side of the road...

18
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,723
Your master,
Mr. Yoki, revived me

19
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,523
and brought me back here.

20
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:15,623
[SCAR]
Master?

21
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:16,356
[SCAR]
If you've recovered,

22
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,623
there's no need
for you to stay.

23
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,423
Be on your way at once.

24
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,023
[SCAR]
What, girl?

25
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,656
[MAY] Allow me to
close your wound.

26
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:49,790
[YOKI]
It's healed?!

27
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:51,523
[MAY] It's a skill
called alkahestry,

28
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,123
from the land of Xing.

29
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:54,723
[SCAR]
She's from Xing?

30
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,123
[YOKI]
That's right sir...

31
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,490
This girl...
crossed the desert...

32
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,090
from the east...
by herself...

33
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,956
to come here... Ha!

34
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,990
Clearly ridiculous.

35
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,956
[MAY]
No, I wasn't alone.

36
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,890
[MAY] I had her
with me, too!

37
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,123
[YOKI] Her? You mean
this little creature here?

38
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:14,723
[MAY] That's right.
Her name's Shao May.

39
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,423
[MAY]
Oh, your arm...!

40
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,923
That's alkahestry, right?

41
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,456
[MAY] The art of reading
the dragon's pulse,

42
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,923
of knowing the power that
flows through the ground

43
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:27,923
and how to use it...?

44
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,123
That tattoo
matches the flow

45
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:31,823
of alkahestry
used in my homeland.

46
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,090
[SCAR] My brother was
a student of alchemy

47
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,690
and alkahestry and he conducted
a great deal of research

48
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:39,856
into both fields...

49
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,123
The tattoo that I bear is
a result of that research.

50
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,090
[MAY]
That's incredible!

51
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,623
Your brother must've
really been something!

52
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,423
[YOKI]
I'm not really sure

53
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,723
what you two are
talking about...

54
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:54,990
but your wound is
healed now, sir...

55
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:56,423
We can be on our
way to Central

56
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:57,990
without any further delay.

57
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:58,956
[MAY]
Oh, that sounds great!

58
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,023
I'll go get my things.

59
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:01,956
[YOKI] What do you
think you're doing?

60
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,190
Didn't he tell you
to shove off, kid...?

61
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:05,723
We're not exactly
going to Central

62
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,190
for a picnic,
you know?!

63
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,556
[MAY] I know, but
I meant what I told you.

64
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,923
[YOKI] You mean all
that immortality stuff

65
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,723
you were blabbering
about earlier...?

66
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:13,956
There's no such thing.

67
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,956
[MAY]
Yes, there is...!

68
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,690
And I came
here to find it!

69
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:17,623
[YOKI]
Oh, shut up...

70
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:19,456
Kids don't know anything!

71
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,723
<i>[MAY] I already</i>
<i>know that immortality</i>

72
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:26,856
<i>can't be accomplished</i>
<i>by alkahestry...</i>

73
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,790
<i>but it is possible through</i>
<i>the use of alchemy...</i>

74
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:31,923
<i>That's why I have</i>
<i>to find him...</i>

75
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,390
<i>the incredible man</i>
<i>I've heard so much about.</i>

76
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,690
<i>[MAY] They say his</i>
<i>hair and his eyes</i>

77
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,723
<i>are golden like the sun...</i>

78
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,023
<i>He wears a dashing red</i>
<i>coat as he strides forth</i>

79
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:42,723
<i>to save people in need...</i>

80
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,556
<i>The brilliant State</i>
<i>Alchemist... Edward Elric!</i>

81
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,090
[YOKI] What do
we do about her?

82
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,590
[SCAR]
Suit yourself, girl.

83
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,923
[barks and growls]

84
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:08,656
[HAWKEYE]
Black Hayate...

85
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,656
What's gotten
into you, boy?

86
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,490
[mysterious laughter]

87
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,690
[66] It's dangerous
to be out walking

88
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:17,390
the streets alone
at this hour.

89
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:21,123
[66] You never know
when you might meet...

90
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,956
The terrible serial
killer, feared by all...

91
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,456
Barry the Chopper!

92
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,556
[gunshots]

93
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,690
[66] No fair!

94
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,556
What'd you have
to pull a gun for!?

95
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,590
[66] All right,
that's it, lady...

96
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:38,990
Now I'm gonna
hear you scream!

97
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,623
[66]
Hey...!

98
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,156
How come you're not
paralyzed with fear?

99
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,723
[HAWKEYE]
You actually remind me

100
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,856
of someone else I know.

101
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,990
[66]
Lemme guess...

102
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:54,023
Alphonse
Something-or-Other?

103
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,190
[HAWKEYE] You've
met Alphonse before?

104
00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:01,790
[66] Oh, so the guy's a
friend of yours, is he?

105
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:04,090
[66] I'm gonna tell ya
something, sweetheart...

106
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,490
You are one strong woman!

107
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,690
[ROY]
The Philosopher's Stone.

108
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,490
[FALMAN] I can't believe
the fifth laboratory

109
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,723
was being used to make
something like that.

110
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:18,723
[HAWKEYE]
It gets worse.

111
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:20,723
There's a chance that
military senior staff

112
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,790
was involved as well.

113
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:23,856
[ROY] Plus, there
were those other two,

114
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,656
Lust and Envy...

115
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:28,190
[ROY] Are they the
ones who made you

116
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:29,256
into what you are now?

117
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,523
[66] Nah, it was the
researchers who did that...

118
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:32,990
Ripped my soul
right outta my body

119
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:35,890
and slapped it into this
suit of armor you see here.

120
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,423
[FALMAN] We can
try to track down

121
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,123
these so-called
'researchers'...

122
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,223
If we find them,

123
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,723
maybe they can tell us
who ordered the experiments.

124
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,656
[66]
Fat chance of that...

125
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,990
They were all used to
create Philosopher's Stones...

126
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,890
There's not a single
one of 'em left alive.

127
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,956
[ROY] Silenced and then
used as ingredients...

128
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,590
How efficiently planned.

129
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,790
[HAWKEYE] Do you
think this means

130
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:56,790
they have
what they need,

131
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,723
or will they try to
make additional stones?

132
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:02,456
[ROY] I have one
more question for you.

133
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:04,723
[ROY] A little
over a month ago,

134
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:06,056
a military
officer was killed

135
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,423
in a telephone
booth in Central...

136
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,023
Were you the
one who did it?

137
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:14,556
[66] Phone booth--
doesn't sound familiar...

138
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,156
Was he all chopped up?

139
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:21,656
[ROY]
Never mind.

140
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,723
[ED]
Hello there, Winry!

141
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:29,490
[ED]
You look like you're

142
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,456
in a very
generous mood today!

143
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,856
[WINRY]
Hi, Ed! Hi, Al!

144
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,423
What're you doing
showing up like this?

145
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,756
[WINRY] Even Paninya
is holding down

146
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,723
an honest job now,

147
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,556
and you two still can't
stay out of trouble!

148
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,156
[AL]
Really, she is?

149
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,190
[WINRY]
Yeah...

150
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,490
She's given up her former
life as a pickpocket

151
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:55,523
and now she earns her
money by fixing roofs

152
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,623
and doing other
odd jobs around town.

153
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,856
[WINRY] And what about
the two of you, huh...?

154
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,490
Made any progress yet?

155
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,123
[AL]
Yeah, we have...

156
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:06,890
It's slow going, though.

157
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,456
[ED] We're still moving
ahead, little by little.

158

[WINRY] I'll go

00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,856
[LING] That's right...
I came from Xing.

188
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,056
[ED]
Oh, Xing...? That's...

189
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,456
[ED] The country to
the east of the desert?

190
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,323
[LING]
Yeah...

191
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:22,990
And crossing that
desert was rough,

192
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,056
let me tell you.

193
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,523
[AL] Why in the world
would you take that route?

194
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,456
[LING] I wanted to visit
the ruins of Xerxes.

195
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,456
That route goes by them.

196
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,456
[ED]
The Xerxes Ruins?

197
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,623
[ED] I'd heard there's
next to nothing there.

198
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,623
[LING] I wanted to
see for myself...

199
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:38,990
Anyway, I was
headed here

200
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,723
to do some
alkahestry research.

201
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,090
[ED]
Alkahestry?

202
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:43,323
[LING]
Yes...

203
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,890
I believe it's what you here
in this country call alchemy.

204
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,523
[LING] In Xing, it's
known as alkahestry...

205
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:51,856
It's mainly used in
the medical professions.

206
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,190
[ED] Huh...
Different countries,

207
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:55,790
different customs, I guess.

208
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,823
Here, alchemy's use
is mainly military.

209
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,023
[ED] It's not
hard to see why.

210
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:02,156
Even now, we still
have skirmishes

211
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,523
at the borders of Aerugo

212
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:06,123
to the south and
Creta to the west...

213
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,690
North of us is the
huge country, Drachma...

214
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,823
We have a tentative
nonaggression pact with them,

215
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,956
and Briggs Mountain
stands between us,

216
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,723
making invasion difficult...

217
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,123
But our relationship
is still dicey at best.

218
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:17,990
[LING]
Sounds like you guys

220

Things began to move

221
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:22,856

militaristic...

222
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,523
when the current
Fuhrer, King Bradley,

223
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,023
first came into power.

224
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:30,090
[AL] I have to say, I'm
curious about alkahestry.

225
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,756
A branch of alchemy that's
medically specialized?

226
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,090
[ED]
I'm curious, too.

227
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:36,190
[LING]
By any chance...

228
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,456
are the two of
you guys alchemists?

229
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,123
[ED] Oh, yeah,
we are, actually...

230

So, Ling...

what else can you tell
us about alkahestry?

Yeah, Sorry, but I'm not
actually an alkahestrist.

240
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,990

practice alkahestry,

here to research it?

00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,114
<i>[FU] She has a cannon</i>
<i>in her prosthetic?</i>

313
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,280
<i>This country is a place</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

314
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,514
[FU]
What?!

315
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,014
[AL] Hmm, not too bad

316
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,714
considering it
was my first time.

317
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,080
[FU]
It's Alkahestry...

318
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,314
but without an array?!

319
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:28,314
[AL] Now...

320
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:30,814
I wonder how things are
going on Brother's end.

321
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,580
[LAN FAN]
I overdid it.

322
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:39,847
[LAN FAN]
Look at this place.

323
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Master Ling will be furious.

324
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:49,914
[ED]
Hey, girly!

325
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:51,680
[ED] You should
be more careful

326
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,814
about where you
use that thing...

327
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,714
It would have
killed anybody else.

328
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,847
[LAN FAN]
But how...?

329
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,547
You removed your own arm?!

330
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,514
[ED] I spent a
fair amount of time

331
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,847
hunting rabbits when
I was a little kid...

332
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,114
Setting a trap
for you was easy.

333
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:05,280
[AL]
Brother!

334
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,814
[ED]
Oh, hey Al!

335
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,880
[LING] Okay...!
Good work, guys!

336
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:10,614
[ED]
Why you--

337
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:11,814
what are you so
chipper about?!

338
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,247
[LING] You guys've got some
pretty impressive skills...

339
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,214
I know, come work for me

340
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:17,147
and together we can
take over this country.

341
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,247
What do ya say?

342
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,114
[ED] I've had enough of
your idiotic chattering...!

343
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:21,647
Just go back to Xing!

344
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,147
[TOWNSPERSON A]
Look...! There they are!

345
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,380
[TOWNSPERSON A] Look at
the mess you've made!

346
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,047
You practically
destroyed our town!

347
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,547
[TOWNSPERSON B]
You're covering the damages.

348
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,647
[POPS] And your
restaurant bill, too.

349
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,247
[ED] Hey wait.
J-Just hold on a second...

350
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,780
This guy and his
little entourage

351
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:35,814
should be paying
for everything!

352
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,880
[LING]
So sorry.

353
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:38,547
I no understand much
language of this country...

354
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,314
Okay, Bye-bye now!

355
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,714
[ED] Hey, you get
the hell back here!

356
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:43,847
[AL]
Huh?

357
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,647
[AL]
Ah! He ran away!

358
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
[ED]
The other one did, too!

359
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,180
You gotta be kidding...

360
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,814
How am I supposed
to fix this place up

361
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,114
with only one arm?

362
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,547
[AL]
It's okay, Brother...

363
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,114
I'll take care of it.

364
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:58,280
[ED]
What...?

365
00:17:58,314 --> 00:17:59,147
You mean you
can do alchemy

366
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,914
without a
transmutation circle now?

367
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,547
[AL]
Yeah...

368
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,880
I think it's because of
the memories I recovered.

369
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,647
[ED]
And that means...!

370
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:15,614
[AL]
Don't worry.

371
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:18,147
You can leave
all this to me.

372
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,714
What's the
matter, Brother?

373
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:25,922
[AL and ED]
We're back!

374
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:29,889
[LING] Hello...!
We meet again!

375
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:32,322
[ED] What's your
sorry butt doing here?!

376
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,089
[LING]
Now, now...

377
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,955
we're all
friends here, right?

378
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,355
[ED] That's how you
treat your friends?

379
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:37,989
By sicking your
dogs on them?

380
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:39,855
Those two didn't go easy!

381
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:40,789
[LING]
Let it go.

382
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,555
I promise I'll give
them a talking to later.

383
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,055
[LING] The girl's
name is Lan Fan...

384
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,989
The old man is called Fu.

385
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,589
Their family has served
mine for generations...

386
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:51,455
They're quite good
at what they do.

387
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:52,355
[ED]
Oh...

388
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:54,189
So, you shake down
strangers for food,

389
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,389
and yet you can
somehow afford

390
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,222
two personal
attendants?

391
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,522
[LING] Well, I am the
emperor's son, after all.

392
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:01,455
[AL and ED]
Huh?

393
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:03,855
[AL and ED]
Emperor's son?

394
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:07,989
[ED]
That makes you...

395
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,422
[AL and ED]
A prince!

396
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:12,389
[laughter]

397
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,989
[LING] Not the
reaction I anticipated.

398
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:15,989
[AL]
Sorry!

399
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,455
We just didn't
see that coming!

400
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,955
[ED] Yeah, the guy who
collapsed on the road

401
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,222
and then mooched
food off us

402
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,255
is the son of an Emperor!

403
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,122
[ED]
Ahhh!!

404
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:29,155
[LAN FAN] You will not speak
badly about Master Ling.

405
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:30,289
[ED]
Great to see you.

406
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:31,489
[LING] No, you're
probably right.

407
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:33,955
It's not actually
that big a deal.

408
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:37,122
[LING] The emperor
has a lot of sons.

409
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,122
[LING]
It's like this...

410
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,422
My country,
Xing, is broken up

411
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,822
between fifty different clans...

412
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:44,589
with an emperor at the top,
reigning over all of them.

413
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:46,122
[LING] The daughter
of each clan's chief

414
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,489
becomes one of the
emperor's wives...

415
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:50,389
and bears his children.

416
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,855
[LING] The current emperor...
has nineteen daughters...

417
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,989
and twenty-four sons...

418
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:58,422
I come in at number
twelve in that line-up.

419
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,155
[ED] Forty-three kids...
that's incredible!

420
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,422
[AL] The issue of succession
must be a tricky one.

421
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,355
[LING]
Indeed it is.

422
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,522
That's the problem
we're facing right now.

423
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:07,889
[LING] The emperor's
health has begun

424
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,255
to deteriorate recently...

425
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,122
Each clan is doing
everything they can

426
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,989
to curry favor...
and I'm no exception.

427
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:16,922
[ED] You want to
up your chances

428
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:19,522
by discovering the
secret of immortality.

429
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:20,455
[LING]
Exactly!

430
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,189
[LING] Okay...!
The Philosopher's Stone...

431
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,922
What information
can you offer?

432
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,189
[ED]
Not happening...!

433
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:28,955
The Stone isn't a tool
for some political game.

434
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:30,055
[LING]
Aw!

435
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,955
Then I'll have to stay
with you until you tell me!

436
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:32,889
[ED]
Oh no you don't!

437
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,055
Get off of me, freak!

438
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:34,755
[WINRY]
I'm back!

439
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:35,755
[WINRY]
Did you see that...?

440
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,855
There was some kind of
fight on main street...

441
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:39,489
So it took a while to...

442
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,989
[WINRY] What happened
to your arm?!

443
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:49,389
[WINRY] Edward Elric,
you careless little jerk!

444
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:52,555
[FU]
Young Lord!

445
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,255
[FU] Why do you put
up with this boy?

446
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,389
There's no need to bow to
someone so far beneath you.

447
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,089
[LING] If all it takes
is a little bowing,

448
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:02,455
I'll consider it a
small price to pay...

449
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:03,855
The fate of five
hundred thousand

450
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,122
Yao Clansmen rides on this.

451
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:10,255
[LING] We can't worry so
much about appearances.

452
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,989
[WINRY] So, where are
you headed to break

453
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,955
your automail this time?

454
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,855
[ED] You just assume
I'll break it?

455
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:16,855
[AL] We were
thinking about

456
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,255
doing some
digging in Central.

457
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,422
[WINRY] You guys are
going to Central...?

458
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,489
I want to come too!
Take me with you!

459
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,889
[ED] What do you
want to go there for?

460
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,322
[WINRY] I'd like to go see
the Hughes family again.

461
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:30,389
[AL] But... don't you have
a lot of work to do here?

462
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,389
[GARFIEL] It's okay if
you want to go, Winry...

463
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,522
You should take a break
every once in awhile.

464
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,189
[WINRY]
Oh, really...?!

465
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:37,822
Thanks so much, Mr. Garfiel!

466
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,089
[ED] Okay,
we'll all go!

467
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,055
[AL] Central,
here we come!

468
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,389
[LING] Oh, we're
going to Central?

469
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:46,055
How exciting!

470
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,822
[ED] I told you, you're
not coming with us!

471
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,822
[YOKI] So, the
little girl is coming

472
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,089
with us after all, huh?

473
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:57,889
[YOKI]
Sir, there's something

474
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:58,855
I've been meaning
to ask you...

475
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,155
You never have told
me what your name is...

476
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:02,955
If you don't mind,

477
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,355
I would very much
like to know it.

478
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:07,189
[SCAR] Ishvalan
names are sacred...

479
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,922
The Ishvalan people
take great pride

480
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:10,355
in speaking their names aloud...

481
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,489
as they are gifts from god.

482
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:14,255
[YOKI]
Well then, sir...

483
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,989
your name must be a
special one indeed.

484
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,289
[SCAR] I have renounced
my Ishvalan name.

485
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:21,089
[SCAR]
Now go!

486
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,255
Keep moving!

487
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,255
[YOKI]
Right!

488
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,922
[SCAR] I'm walking down
a path of no return.

489
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:27,789
So I will
leave behind me

490
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:30,822
every gift I have
received from God.

491
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:06,055
<i>[NARRATOR] Ed, Al, and</i>
<i>Winry return to Central,</i>

492

493
