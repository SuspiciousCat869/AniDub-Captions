1
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,153
[whispering]

2
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,020
[SOLDIER 1] I think
that's Roy Mustang.

3
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:44,553
[Soldier 2] The big, bad
Flame Alchemist himself, huh?

4
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,787
[SOLDIER 3] He must have
some serious connections

5
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,853
to have made it
this far at his age.

6
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:49,820
[SOLDIER 4] Yeah, well
you can't climb to the top

7
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:52,487
that quickly without
falling just as fast.

8
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:58,687
[knock knock]

9
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,987
[SECRETARY]
Come in.

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,787
[ROY]
Good morning...

11
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,620
[ROY]
Colonel Roy Mustang.

12
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:10,553
[SECRETARY] Oh, yes,
Colonel Mustang...

13
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm terribly sorry, but your
transfer was poorly timed.

14
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:15,853
His Excellency
the Fuhrer is away.

15
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:17,687
[ROY]
Where is he?

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,420
[SECRETARY] Conducting an
inspection at Southern HQ.

17
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,853
[ROY]
He's in the South?

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,753
[sniff sniff]

19
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,787
[DOLCETTO] Something
doesn't smell right to me.

20
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,887
[ROA] Y'know what it
feels like to me...?

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
Old times.

22
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,520
[BRADLEY] What an
interesting discovery

23
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,753
for such a routine inspection.

24
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,453
[BRADLEY]
Move in!

25
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:56,653
[GREED]
Hahaha!

26
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,820
A housewife and
a hotheaded brat.

27
00:02:58,853 --> 00:02:59,687
What a team...!

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,820
Though to be honest,

29
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,587
it's not one I'm particularly
interested in fighting...

30
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:06,487
[GREED] I'll just
be on my way now.

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,220
[ED]
What?

32
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,687
[IZUMI]
You coward-- Blerggh...

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,187
[ED]
Aaahh!

34
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,420
[ED] Teacher!
What's wrong?!

35
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,753
[IZUMI] He ran away...
how pathetic.

36
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,553
[ED]
You okay now?

37
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:19,553
[IZUMI]
Blergh.

38
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:20,687
[ED]
Ahh!

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,487
[ED] Teacher!
Just hang on!

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,953
[MARTEL]
Will you staay put...

41
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,520
Quit struggling, you oaf!

42
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,553
[AL]
I... don't... wanna!

43
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,520
[MARTEL]
Greed!

44
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:45,087
[GREED] Ah, Martel. I'm glad
to see that you're safe.

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,620
[MARTEL] What's
going on up there...?

46
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,820
No one else has
made it back yet.

47
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,753
[GREED]
Yeeahh.

48
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,620
Things have gotten
a little out of hand,

49
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,553
so we need to figure
a way outta here.

50
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:55,853
[BRADLEY] I can't
let you do that.

51
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,987
[GREED] Just what
do you want, old man?

52
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,620
[AL] It's the Fuhrer...!
Why is he here?

53
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,620
[MARTEL]
King Bradley?!

54
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:09,953
[GREED] What's the most
powerful man in the land

55
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,687
doing down here?

56
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,687
[BRADLEY]
Not that you'd know,

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,787
but growing
old isn't easy.

58
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,853
[GREED]
Huh?

59
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:19,487
[BRADLEY] This year marks
my sixtieth birthday.

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,753
[BRADLEY] It's frustrating
how your body stops moving

61
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,820
the way you want it to...

62
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:26,553
So I'd like to finish this
job as quickly as possible

63
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:28,987
and return home...

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,853
[GREED] I've got
an idea... Retire.

65
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:35,453
[splash]

66
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,553
[GREED]
Well look at this!

67
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,853
The old man's
got some moves!

68
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,087
[MARTEL]
Greed!

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
[AL]
Shhh!

70
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:00,687
[ARMSTRONG]
Behold...!

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,820
You have just had
the rare pleasure

72
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:05,887
of witnessing the famous
Armstrong statuary technique!

73
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,920
[ROA]
Well then.

74
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:13,820
I guess my ordinary
methods aren't gonna work.

75
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,920
[ARMSTRONG] Now that's
certainly peculiar.

76
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:40,120
[gunshots]

77
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:41,953
[SOLDIER 6] We've secured
the boy and the woman...

78
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:45,153
Now eliminate every
last one of these freaks...

79
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:47,420
Those are the
Fuhrer's direct orders!

80
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:09,987
[ARMSTRONG] You are a most
commendable adversary, sir.

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,853
[ROA] And you're just as
tough as ever, Major Armstrong.

82
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,553
[ROA] The last time
I saw you in action

83
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:19,520
was the Ishvalan Civil War.

84
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,520
[ARMSTRONG]
A former ally, eh...?

85
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:23,453
Even more reason
to end this...

86
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,053
No need for such
bloodshed... Surrender.

87
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,453
[ROA] And just let
myself be killed?

88
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:30,887
[SOLDIER 7]
Major!

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,387
[DOLCETTO]
Roa!

90
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:53,453
[GREED]
Urggh!! Hhhhggghh...

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,753
[BRADLEY] I understand
why you'd think

92
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,687
you have an advantage
over a man like me

93
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,453
since I possess neither your
impenetrable Ultimate Shield,

94
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,787
nor an Ultimate Spear that
can pierce any substance...

95
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,553
[BRADLEY]
But I'll tell you a secret.

96
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:08,020
Do you know how I managed
to distinguish myself

97
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,787
amongst the
storms of bullets

98
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,553
on the battlefield
time after time...

99
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,953
to rise to my
current position?

100
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,887
[GREED]
Y-You're...

101
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:24,787
[BRADLEY] I may not
have the protection

102
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,520
of your Ultimate Shield...

103
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,720
but I clearly see your
weakness with my Ultimate Eye.

104
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,553
[BRADLEY]
Now then, Greed...

105
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,720
How many times am
I going to have to kill you

106
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:42,587
before you stay dead?

107
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,653
[MARTEL]
Where the hell is Greed?

108
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,453
[AL] I don't know...
It's too dark to see anything.

109
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,020
[MARTEL]
No, Greed!

110
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,553
[AL]
Quiet!

111
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,920
[MARTEL] Let me out...!
C'mon, dammit!

112
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:10,753
[AL]
No way!

113
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:11,987
[MARTEL]
I said open up!

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,787
[AL] I can't!
He'll kill you!

115
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,587
[BRADELY] That makes fifteen
times you've died now...

116
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,553
How many lives have
you got left? Hmm?

117
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,087
[GREED]
Ahh, damn you...

118
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,953
[DOLCETTO]
Ahhh, crap.

119
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:26,120
[DOLCETTO] I kinda wish
we'd died back there.

120
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,153
[ROA] There's still plenty
of time to tuck your tail

121
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:29,687
and run away.

122
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
[DOLCETTO]
Trust me, I'd love to...

123
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:37,453
But I've got this obnoxious
canine sense of loyalty.

124
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:41,587
[DOLCETTO] Do us a favor
kid and get her out of here.

125
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,720
[ROA]
Protect her.

126
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,787
[MARTEL]
Roa...! Dolcetto!

127
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,787
[MARTEL] Hey...!
Quit trying to stop me!

128
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,720
Let me out!

129
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,853
[AL]
I can't!

130
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,653
[MARTEL] I don't have time
to argue, now open up...!

131
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,420
They need my
help, dammit...!

132
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,820
[AL] I said no!
I can't let you out!

133
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:04,187
[MARTEL] Just shut up!
I need out of here!

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,153
[MARTEL] You're not
gonna make me sit here

135
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,720
and watch my friends
get killed, are you?!

136
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:09,820
[AL] They asked me
to protect you...!

137
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:13,020
So quit struggling
and be quiet!

138
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,720
[MARTEL]
Dolcetto! No!

139
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:22,987
[MARTEL]
Rooooaaa!

140
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:28,053
[MARTEL] Please.
I'm begging you.

141
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:31,087
[AL]
I'm sorry... I can't.

142
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,687
[GREED] Whoa, that was
a little excessive...

143
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,053
Killing me is one thing,
but they're not coming back.

144
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:42,820
[BRADLEY] Pitying the lost lives
of your pawns...? Pathetic.

145
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:45,553
[GREED] Excuse me...?
Are you senile...?

146
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,587
Did you forget who
I am, old man...?

147
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm the living
incarnation of greed...

148
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,553
Those weren't my
friends, Bradley,

149
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:52,887
they were my
possessions...

150
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,653
Money! Women! Henchmen!
They're all possessions!

151
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,420
[GREED]
So killing my henchmen

152
00:09:58,453 --> 00:09:59,820
is the same as
stealing from me...!

153
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,720
And I don't let people
take what's mine!

154
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:04,587
[BRADLEY]
Greed...

155
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,553
You grow more
pathetic by the second.

156
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,387
[BRADLEY] Now you stay put.
I'll be right back.

157
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:26,987
[AL]
We've gotta run.

158
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,687
[BRADLEY]
Not so fast.

159
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,887
[BRADLEY] Aren't you
the younger brother

160
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,753
of Edward Elric...?

161
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,720
They didn't hurt
you, did they...?

162
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,153
Can I help you at all?

163
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,653
[AL] Uh, sure...
I mean no, no, I'm fine...!

164
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,120
Thanks, but I'm alright.

165
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:45,653

166
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,120

Don't do this!

Wait, Mom! Wait...!

Wake up...! Al...!

Say something...! Al!

177
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:10,182
[AL]
Brother?

178
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,182
[ED]
You okay?

179
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,782
[AL]
Are you okay?

180
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:15,782
You're covered in blood.

181
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:24,882
[ARMSTRONG] We thought
it best to open you

182
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:27,848
and remove her
before you awoke.

183
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,615
[AL sobbing]
I couldn't save her.

184
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,648
[ED] You can't blame
yourself, Al...

185
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:40,715
Come on.
Let's go home, 'kay.

186
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,082
[ED]
Al?

187
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:49,115
[BRADLEY]
Hold it, you two.

188
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:50,182
[BRADLEY] There are
a few questions

189
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:53,748
I need to ask both of
you before you can leave.

190
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:56,048
[BRADLEY] Have either of
you had any previous dealings

191
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,915
with the man who referred
to himself as Greed?

192
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,315
[ED]
'Course not.

193
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,248
[BRADLEY] Did you happen
to trade any manner

194
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,115
of information with him?

195
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:05,615
[ED]
None at all...

196
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,982
And the military wasn't
even mentioned, not once.

197
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,715
[BRADLEY]
That isn't my concern...

198
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,615
Let me be more specific...

199
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,848
If you arranged a deal or
shared any knowledge with him...

200
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:20,682
Then I'll execute
both of you right now.

201
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,815
[BRADLEY] I'll ask again,
did you share any knowledge

202
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:25,182
that might affect
the military?

203
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:30,182
[ED] No...
Can we go now?

204
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:32,115
[BRADLEY] I am curious
about your steel arm

205
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:34,848
and leg and your
brother's armor body...

206
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:42,715
Is there any connection
between the two?

207
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,982
[BRADLEY] You really
are an honest kid.

208
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,748
[BRADLEY]
Alright, men, pull out.

209
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:50,848
[BRADLEY] And you make
sure to take good care

210
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,915
of your younger
brother, Edward.

211
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:59,282
[IZUMI] I appreciate
everything you've done

212
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,382
for the Elric brothers.

213
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:02,482
[BRADLEY] Oh no,
it's nothing at all.

214
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:05,082
It's simply one of the
many duties of the military

215
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:08,115
to protect our
State Alchemists...

216
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,115
But what about you?

217
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,748
I'm sure you could use a
little extra protection.

218
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:16,315
[IZUMI] You mean as
a State Alchemist?

219
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:20,082
[BRADLEY]
Why yes, exactly.

220
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:21,915
[IZUMI] You're asking
a bedridden housewife

221
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,615
to join the military...?

222
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:25,815
You can't be serious.

223
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,848
Is the country really
in so much trouble

224
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:31,915
that you'd need the
help of someone like me?

225
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:34,015
[BRADLEY] There's
no need to be harsh.

226
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,082
[BRADLEY]
Well. I will be back.

227
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,715
[BRADLEY] I'll keep
my fingers crossed

228
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:44,682
that when I do return,

229
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:47,215
perhaps you'll have
had a change of heart.

230
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,078
[ED] There's something
I forgot to mention...

231
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:01,445
Greed had an
Uroboros tattoo.

232
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:03,278
[ARMSTRONG]
I'm not sure I follow.

233
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:05,445
[ED] Think back...
The fifth laboratory?

234
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,245
The Philosopher's Stone?

235
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,478
Remember the guys I told
you and Colonel Hughes about?

236
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:18,045
[ARMSTRONG]
Colonel Hughes? I...

237
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,645
[ARMSTRONG]
Listen, Edward Elric.

238
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:24,278
[ARMSTRONG] Do not...
do anything rash.

239
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:28,478
[ED]
Sure.

240
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,012
[ARMSTRONG]
Well then... Goodnight.

241
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:40,278
[AL]
Brother?

242
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:41,345
[AL]
They're back...

243
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,478
All the memories of when
my body was taken away...?

244
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,212
I remember.

245
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,478
[ED]
What'd you see?

246
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,978
[AL] Well it was
definitely weird.

247
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,512
[AL] But unfortunately,
I didn't find out anything

248
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,412
about how to get
our bodies back.

249
00:15:58,445 --> 00:15:59,978
[ED]
That's okay.

250
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:04,378
[AL] So I guess we
haven't made any progress.

251
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:07,412
[ED] No. That's
not entirely true.

252
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:08,578
[ED] You remember
what the Fuhrer told us

253
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:10,178
back in Central?

254
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:14,012
About the unrest amongst
the ranks of the military?

255
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:14,712
[AL] And it all
had something to do

256
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,245
with the
Philosopher's Stone

257
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,145
and those Uroboros guys...

258
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,145
He said he was trying
to gather info on them.

259
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:25,045
[ED] Well Greed was
obviously connected

260
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,612
to them somehow...

261
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:31,278
But if so... why'd the
Fuhrer slaughter everyone?

262
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,978
[ED] If he was trying to
figure out what they're up to,

263
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,278
why didn't he catch
them and make them talk?

264
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,412
[AL] Yeah,
good point...

265
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,045
It also seems a little
weird that the Fuhrer himself

266
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,112
would lead an attack
against such a small group.

267
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:44,512
[ED]
Sure does...

268
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,145
No matter how you look at it,
none of this adds up.

269
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:52,512
[ED] We've been warned...
but we need to get closer.

270
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,677
[LUST]
Welcome back, Fuhrer...

271
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:07,910
How was your
inspection of the South?

272
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,744
[BRADLEY]
To say the least,

273
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,110
it was a very
productive visit...

274
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:13,010
It seems both
Fullmetal's younger brother

275
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:17,110
and their teacher are worthy
candidates for human sacrifice.

276
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,277
[BRADLEY] Oh and
one other thing...

277
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,644
I made an
unexpected catch.

278
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,477
[LUST] Talk about a
blast from the past...

279
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,444
It's been a century
since I've seen that face.

280
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:28,977
[LUST]
Rise and shine, Greed,

281
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,210
you can't
sleep all day.

282
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:35,310
[GREED] Well, well.
The gang's all here.

283
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:36,910
[LUST] Looks like
your Ultimate Shield

284
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:38,510
let you down after all.

285
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,244
[GREED] Maybe,
but you never do,

286
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,077
Lust the Lascivious...

287
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,010
Feel free to pierce me

288
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:46,210
with your Ultimate Spear
anytime you want.

289
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,010
[GREED] Hello,
Gluttony the Voracious.

290
00:17:48,044 --> 00:17:50,977
Still haven't found the
right diet for you yet, huh?

291
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,877
[GREED] And little
Envy the Jealous.

292
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,277
Please! For the last
time, get a new outfit.

293
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,644
[GREED] And where is Sloth
the Indolent these days?

294
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,644
[LUST] I'm sure he'd love
to be here slacking off...

295
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:05,910
but we have to
keep him working.

296
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,310
[GREED] Sorry to say it,
but it's kind of depressing

297
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:11,177
that none of
you have changed

298
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,210
in the past one
hundred years... So...

299
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,410
[GREED]
Who's the new addition?

300
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,544
[BRADLEY] I am
Wrath the Furious.

301
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:21,377
[GREED] Fuhrer King
Bradley and Wrath,

302
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,444
one and the same.

303
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,510
[LUST]
Indeed...

304
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:27,244
The humans know him as
the leader of Amestris...

305
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,544
But the truth is that
he was created by Father

306
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:32,377
for the final
stage of the plan.

307
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,877
[GREED] A Homunculus
that can grow older...?

308
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,444
That's impossible.

309
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,044
[ENVY]
Oh really?

310
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,510
I thought nothing
was impossible...

311
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:43,110
You used to toss
that one around

312
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:44,977
like it was your
catch phrase...

313
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,977
you change your
mind or something?

314
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,444
[GREED] Shut your
worthless trap, ugly.

315
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:53,110
[GREED] Uh-oh.
That's a scary face.

316
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:54,177
Go on and let it out...

317
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,644
Why don't you show us what
you really look like...?

318
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,377
You hideous freak.

319
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,277
[ENVY] You scum...

320
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,644
call me that again
and I will destroy you.

321
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,010
[FATHER] Stop your
nonsense. Both of you.

322
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:12,444
[FATHER] It's time you
resolve this sibling rivalry.

323
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:16,510
Your father does not wish
to see such ugly behavior.

324
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,210
[GREED]
Hey, Pops, long time...

325
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,977
I know it's been a
hundred years and all,

326
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,977
but you sure
do look decrepit.

327
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,544
[FATHER]
Greed...

328
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:28,377
You are both my son and
you are a piece of my soul...

329
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,910
So why would you
betray your loving father?

330
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:33,577
[GREED]
I'm surprised you ask...

331
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,344
I mean, you know the answer
to that better than anyone, Dad.

332
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,577
I'm Greed the Avaricious...

333
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,010
You were the one that
made me this way, after all.

334
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:44,477
I'm just being myself.

335
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,444
[GREED] I simply
had larger ambitions

336
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,910
than spending my
life working for you.

337
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,644
[FATHER] And if I were
to ask you to return

338
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:55,377
and work for me again?

339
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,510
[GREED]
Never!

340
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,144
[FATHER]
As you wish.

341
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:03,244
[gears turning]

342
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:16,610
Geez, talk about cheesy.

343
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:17,577
[splash]

344
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,644
Ahhhhh!!

345
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:22,910
Hahaha!

346
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:24,610
Why don'tcha
come on in, kids,

347
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,344
the water's fine!

348
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,277
[GREED]
Nice and hot!

349
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,510
Just like the
flames in hell...!

350
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:31,977
I'll send you a postcard,

351
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,510
let you know what
they're like...!

352
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:35,310
And when the rest
of you get there--

353
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:38,510
I'll be waiting for you!

354
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:41,044
[FATHER] Now return from
whence you were born...

355
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:44,277
Return to my depths
and rejoin my soul...

356
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,077
Return, Greed!

357
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,277
[GREED] If that's
what you want, Dad...!

358
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,544
Just don't blame me when
I give you a stomach-ache!

359
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:53,044
You did it to yourself!

360
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,144
[FATHER] I propose a
toast, my children...

361
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,244
I shall drink to
the promised day.

362
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:16,410
And to your
undying loyalty.

363
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,977
[SELIM]
Father!

364
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,310
[SELIM] Welcome
home, Father!

365
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,877
I'm so glad you're back!

366
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,977
[BRADLEY] And it's
good to be back, Selim.

367
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,344
[SELIM] Did you
have a good trip?

368
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:44,344
[BRADLEY]
Why yes,

369
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:47,010
I'd say it was productive
at the very least.

370
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:47,810
[BRADLEY'S WIFE]
I do wish

371
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,144
you would act
your age, darling.

372
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,244
Why couldn't
you just retire

373
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,610
and try to enjoy some peace
and quiet for a change.

374
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,877
[BRADLEY] Hey... now,
I'm not quite that old yet...

375
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,110
Oh Selim, you'll never guess

376
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,077
who I ran into down south.

377
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,477
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

378
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,477
[SELIM] You saw the
little alchemist...?

379
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,977
Can I meet him
sometime Father?

380
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,910
[BRADLEY'S WIFE]
You sure do like

381
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:09,110
to hear about Edward,
don't you, Selim?

382
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,577
[SELIM] Well, he is the youngest
State Alchemist ever, right?

383
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,410
That's so cool!

384
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,277
I mean, he's not
much older than me!

385
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:18,110
[SELIM] And If he can
learn alchemy at his age,

386
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:19,644
then maybe I can to!

387
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,444
[BRADLEY'S WIFE] Why
would you want to learn

388
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:21,510
something like that?

389
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:24,110
[SELIM] So I can get my
state license, of course!

390
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:26,510
And then I could
help Father!

391
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,477
[BRADLEY]
You never know, Selim...

392
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,410
Maybe you will help
me out someday.
