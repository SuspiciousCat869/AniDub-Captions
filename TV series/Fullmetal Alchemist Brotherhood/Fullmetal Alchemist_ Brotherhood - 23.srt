[glass and metal falling]

4
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,834
[Bradley] A smoke bomb
and a grenade in one.

5
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,801
[Bradley] That reckless fool
is beginning to annoy me..

6
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,601
Do you think you can
follow their scent?

7
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,934
[Gluttony] Uh-huh.

8
00:01:56,967 --> 00:02:03,867
[Winry sobbing]

9
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,934
Here officer...

10
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:10,001
Take her someplace
she'll be safe...

11
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:15,934
Winry... Al is still fighting,
so I have to go... Okay?

12
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:19,967
[Ed] I'm sorry... When this is
over, I'll explain everything.

13
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:37,734
<i>[Winry] Why...why is waiting</i>
<i>the only thing I can do?</i>

14
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,934
[radio] We have a girl in
custody in Sector Eight

15
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,801
who appears to be a friend
of the Fullmetal Alchemist...

16
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,301
Escort her to
Central Command...

17
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:47,734
Repeat. Sector Eight... We
have a girl in custody

18
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,167
who appears to be a friend
of the Fullmetal Alchemist...

19
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,634
[Roy] It's just about time.

20
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,767
Go and back them up.

21
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,734
Right.

22
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,067
[Roy] There's a vacant
house outside of town...

23
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:04,134
That's where we'll meet
up. Don't be followed.

24
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,001
[Hawkeye] 'Kay.

25
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,667
If something goes wrong..
I'll let you know.

26
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,234
Alright.

27
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,001
[door closing]

28
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,001
And sir, please stay
out of the field.

29
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:18,134
I know, Lieutenant. Now go.

30
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:24,601
[running, heavy breathing]

31
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,034
He won't give up.

32
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,501
[Ling] This area looks deserted.

33
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,234
A dead end. We're trapped.

34
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,001
[footsteps]

35
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,134
[explosion from far away]

36
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,734
Hm?

37
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,867
Scar again?

38
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,267
Gluttony- Go see what
he's up to this time...

39
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,267
And I'll take care of our
two little friends here.

40
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:56,734
[running, blood dripping]

41
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:57,867
What happened to me?...

42
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:58,567
[Ling] What's wrong?

43
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,401
To my arm?...

44
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:04,134
My lord... I'm useless
to you now.

45
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,067
What're you talking about?

46
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,701
[Lan Fan] You cannot
burden yourself with me...

47
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,101
If you do, they'll
only get you too...

48
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,234
A king is no king
without his people,

49
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,667
but a people without their
king would be lost as well.

50
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,601
You can't do that to them...

51
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:22,701
My lord, think of our clan...
You must live for their sake.

52
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,567
I won't leave you!

53
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:31,834
Sometimes someone must be left
behind. For the greater good.

54
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:36,867
Lan Fan! What are you
planning? No! Don't do it!

55
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,667
[explosion]

56
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,101

[stone crashing]

59
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,934
There's nothing
inside that armor.

60
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,001
You're hollow aren't you?

61
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,267
[Scar] You poor boy...

62
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:57,567
Alchemy trapped you
in that metal prison

63
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,067
and yet you still
have faith in it?

64
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,234
[clap, transmutation sounds]

65
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:06,034
[water gushing]

66
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,767
[Al] True, there are plenty of
things about this body

67
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:12,167
that are inconvenient.. but it's
nothing I can't live with...

68
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:15,901
[Al] I don't need pity from
anyone... least of all from you.

69
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:19,167
My brother used alchemy
to save my life...

70
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:22,567
To regret the form I have now
would mean not only rejecting

71
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,634
alchemy but also turning
my back on him...

72
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,267
I believe in my brother,
and I believe in alchemy.

73
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,034
I will not lose faith...
I want to believe!

74
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,767
Oh, do you?

75
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,567
[gasp]

76
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,534

[Ed yelling]

79
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:45,267
[Al] Brother!...
Where's Winry?

80
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:51,601
She's safe. No thanks to me,
though...I made her cry again.

81
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:56,867
[Al] You really should be
more careful, Brother.

82
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,267
[Al] She doesn't like to
see you fight like that.

83
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,967
Yeah...

84
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,034
[Ed] But she's gone
now... Let's end this.

85
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,601
[Gluttony] Oooh! I found you!

86
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,201
[crash]

87
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,734
[slobbering] Ishvalan!

88
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,234
You again!

89
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,301
[Al] Look at his tattoo!

90
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,867
A Homunculus!

00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:20,734

It's Ling!

99
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:56,734
Go! Move it!

100
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:03,267
[explosion, blood splattering]

00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:13,967
[transmutation sounds]

102
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,267
Get me some strong cable!

103
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,967
[Ed] Right!... On it.

104
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:20,101
[transmutation sounds]

105
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:23,934
Your own regenerative ability's
working against you...

106
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,934
Your flesh won't
stop expanding,..

107
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:29,201
It'll keep you tied
up nice and tight.

108
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,701
You're mine now... Homunculus!

109
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:42,934
[dog whimpering]

110
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,167
That was well played, girl.

111
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:56,601
I.. beat you..

112
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,634
How does it feel
to be tricked?...

113
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,934
You lose this round.

114
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,901
<i>[Scar] What?...</i>
<i>That thing is a Homunculus?</i>

[brakes squealing]

119
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:17,601
Put him in. We're
getting out of here.

[yelling with effort]

122
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,667
Hold on a sec, Lieute--

123
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,867
Shh!

124
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,734
[engine revving]

125
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:34,801
[Al] Wait! What's going on--

126
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,734
[Ed] Al!

127
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,134
The MPs are watching... Just
pretend we don't know her.

128
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,234
[Soldier] They're getting
away!... After them!

129
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,067
[MPs] Right!

130
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:45,201
The colonel may be a
creep and a jerk,

131
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:49,501
but at least we can trust him...
We have something to do.

132
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,867
[crash, transmutation sounds]

133
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,267
[Ed] We have to get him Al!

134
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:01,934
[Al affirmative grunt]

135

[clap, transmutation sounds]

136
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,267
You killed the Rockbells and
Nina, among many others.

137
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,601
[Al] You're going to answer
for your crimes!

138
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:18,267
[crashing, grunting]

139
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,167
Are these two giving you
trouble, servant?

140
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,601
This is the servant of the
man who saved my life.

141
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:26,001
You better leave him
alone, puny little boy!

142
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,567
Wait a sec!.. Who
you calling puny?!

143
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,767
[MPs] Where'd that
kid come from?

144
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,867
[MPs] Get away, girl..
It's dangerous!

145
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,967
They've got us outnumbered...
It's time for us to retreat.

[yelling, coughing]

149
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,834
[coughing] What kind
of alchemy was that?

150
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,001
[Al] She did it from
that far away?

151
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:05,601
Here, follow me.

152
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:09,934
I can't see! Scar!

[honking]

154
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,134
I know who you are,
Ling Yao...

155
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,801
Don't worry... We're on our
way to a secure safe house.

156
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,667
My friend... I left her
behind!... Go get her!

157
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,601
What?... No, we can't.
We don't have time.

158
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,134
Make time!... She
could be dying now...

159
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:31,001
She's still waiting
there for me!

160
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:32,634
You had better make it quick.

161
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,701
[honking]

162
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,067
[Bradley] That woman driving...

163
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,534

00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:33,361
Thank you.

Sir!... The MPs are all

We need to get going!

[Soldier] He took
a shot to the leg.

174
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,461
In his condition, he
couldn't have gotten far.

175
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,361
Comb the area for him!

176
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:44,294
Sir!

[Yoki whispering]
Quickly, sir, quickly!

178
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:50,328
Shao May, where are you?

179
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,761
Oh no!

180
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,628
[Al] Look what I found, Ed.

181
00:11:57,894 --> 00:12:00,761
We're a little busy right now to
be adopting panda bears, Al!

182
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,894
[Al] I couldn't
leave her alone

183
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:04,228
in the middle of all
that mess back there!

184

First stray cats, and now
this?!.. Just how many animals

185
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,761
can you stuff into that armor of
yours, huh?!.. Get rid of it!

186
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,628
[Al] What a heartless
thing to say!

187
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:14,828
[Al] Look how sweet
and gentle she is!

188

[chomp]

189

00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:37,161
[Ed] Thanks.

194
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:40,194
[Al] You can stay
in here, okay?

195
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:46,828
[excited gasp]

196
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:51,328
Hey! Winry!

197
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:55,228
Oh... hello there,
Fullmetal Alchemist.

198
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,194
Fuhrer Bradley.
This is a surprise.

199
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,828
[Al] What brings you here?...

200
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,928
I heard that a childhood
friend of yours was under

201
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:04,294
our protection here at
the Command Center...

202
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,561
As a friend of such an
important alchemist...

203
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:10,894
[Bradley] she deserves
our every courtesy.

204
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:14,828
I should be on my way now... If
you'll please excuse me, miss.

205
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,661
Oh.. of course... sir.

206
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,328
That's a nice, honest
friend you've got there...

207
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:26,628
Make sure you both take
good care of her.

208
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,794
[Winry] Ed...

209
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:41,394
You promised... Tell me
everything about my parents...

210
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,128
What happened to them?

211
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,261
<i>[Winry] I see...</i>

212
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,394
<i>They did everything they</i>
<i>could to help others..</i>

213
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,928
<i>Right up until the end.</i>

214
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:04,861
But I... I just wish they could
have come back to me alive.

215
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:08,894
Is that selfish?

216

<i>More waiting... That's</i>
<i>all I can ever do.</i>

Perfect timing!...

218

Miss Rockbell,..there's a
telephone call for you.

219

For me?

220
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,728
Yes, hello?... Oh, Mr. Garfiel!

221
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,461
[Garfiel] I'm sorry
about this, Winry.

222
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,228
I know you've got
a lot going on

223
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,494
and I tried to handle
it myself, really.

224
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,628
[crowd] Where is she?
Isn't Winry back yet?

225
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,728
Look at this! Winry's the
only one who can fix it!

226
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,461
[Garfiel] ...but I can't
take this anymore.

227
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,494
Your customers are so needy!

228
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,194
[crowd] Please hurry back,
Winry! We miss you!

229
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,661
[Tetsu] You there, Miss Winry?

230
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:00,928
Tetsu?

231
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,761
[Tetsu] Please come back
to the shop soon...

232
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:06,528
You do a much better job working
on my leg than Mr. Garfiel can!

233
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,428
We need you here!

234
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,228
Another thing, Winry.. We
still need an outer covering

235
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,294
for that model leg
you made for me.

236
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,261
My arm needs work too!

237
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:15,894
Hey, hold on a sec.
I was first!

238
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:16,894
[crowd] I miss you, Winry!

239
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:20,328
You idiot, of course you
miss her!... We all do.

240
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,328
Isn't that the truth!

241
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:26,328
I'm sorry... I'll be
back home soon.

242
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:30,194
[Winry] Just hold on...
I won't be much longer...

243
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:33,694
I'll help everyone...
Thank you all.

[Winry] Thank you both...
for stopping me back there.

246
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:51,561
I forgot there were still
people who depended on me...

247
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,594
If I had done it...

248
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:56,528
I wouldn't have been able
to face them again.

249
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,694
[Al] Of course.

250
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:02,428
I expect you to take good
care of your automail!

251
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,761
Yep.

252
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,661
Oh, and I'll send you some
good polishing oil soon, Al.

253
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:10,261
[Al] Great!

254
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,694
And no dying, okay?

255
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,161
Right.

256
00:16:15,194 --> 00:16:16,061
Oh, and...

257
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:18,294
the next time I make
you cry, I hope...

258

[bell ringing loudly]

259
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:23,761
Wha?...What?... I
can't hear you!

260
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,228
[Al] Brother?...Wait
up!... See ya, Winry!

261
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:35,628
Oh..kay. Geez... Come back,
Edward! What were you saying?!

262
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,928
The next time I make you cry, I
hope they'll be tears of joy!

263
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,428
And Al and I will be back in
our normal bodies,

264
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,928
[Ed] and I'll make you cry
out of sheer happiness!

265
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,661
That's a promise!

Give me a new arm and a leg.
I need one year!

269
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:12,461
Well... there's no turning
back for us now, brother.

00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:53,818
Get in the car.

275
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:03,721
[Roy] Someone's
badly injured.

276
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:06,454
I came to you because
we need a doctor.

277
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,821
[Knox] Got yourself
in trouble again...

278
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,687
Just can't help yourself.

279
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:11,721
I know you have a family.

280
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,687
I wouldn't want to
endanger them...

281
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:17,287
If you'd rather not get
involved, I'll understand.

282
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:20,021
[Knox] Wait here..
I'll get my instruments.

283
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,921
Are you sure about this?

284
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,587
My wife and I split up

285
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:27,654
not long after I came back
from duty in Ishval.

286
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,521
[Knox] You let her
wander around the sewers

287
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:35,721
with her arm cut off?!... Don't
blame me if she gets lockjaw!

[Lan Fan groaning in pain]

I'm afraid, the only
patients I've had lately

290
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:43,821
have been corpses... so this
might be a little rough.

No, Don't apologize.

I'm the one who
suggested it, remember?

296
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,821
We both had something to gain
out of it, so it made sense...

297
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:02,387
When I went in search
of immortality...

298
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:08,254
I knew I must be ready to
make certain sacrifices.

299

[Ling] But I... I wasn't
ready for this...

Lan Fan was though.

301
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,221
She made the decision that
I was too weak to make.

302
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:25,887
[Al] She's awake!

303
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:29,887
You okay?...is there
anything we can do?

304
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:33,754
That old trap of yours..
worked pretty well.

305
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,887
But I'm useless
without my arm...

306
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:43,854
I'm going to need to
find a replacement.

307

You know... I can introduce
you to a great engineer.

It was no problem.

Thank you for helping us
with the Ross incident...

315

And also...

316
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,254
[Roy] for bringing
this thing in.

do we have here?

318

He's a Homunculus.

00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:28,954
He and his friends appear
to be have connections

320
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:32,321
among some of the
military's senior staff.

321
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:36,321
Just some, you say?.. It
goes far deeper than that.

322
00:20:36,354 --> 00:20:37,887
Your Fuhrer, King Bradley..

323
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,721
I believe it's possible
that he's a Homunculus too.

324
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,321
[gasps]

325
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,854
I saw his eye.. The
one under the patch.

326
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,721
It had an Uroboros tattoo..

327
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:49,854
He and Gluttony came after us,
and they were working together!

328
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:50,887
No way!

329
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,887
[Al] Our ruler.. a Homunculus?!

330
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,587
Although... Bradley doesn't
have the same sort

331
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,554
of inhuman presence that
you get from Gluttony...

332
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,354
At his core, he still feels
like a regular person.

333
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,254
[Al] Another thing... If the
Fuhrer is a Homunculus,

334
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,454
how can he possibly have a
son?... It said in that book

335
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:12,321
that the Homunculi have no
reproductive capabilities.

336
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,787
[Knox] No... The Fuhrer's
son, Selim, is adopted...

337
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:19,487
There's no direct blood relation
between him and his father.

338
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:25,687
Whether he's monster
or human...

339
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,587
either way, these new
developments will make it

340
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,921
easier to remove him
from the seat of power.

341
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:33,321
First, we get information
out of this one...

342
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:35,321
and I'll take his stone...

343
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,921
It may prove useful
in treating my man.

344
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:41,487
Hey, you! Lan Fan lost
her arm to get him.

345
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:43,954
[Ling] He's our captive! We're
taking him back to Xing!

346
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:46,721
[Ed] Hold it! He could help
us get our bodies back!

347
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,921
We've been working on
that for a long time.

348
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,721
I'm not going to let you
just waltz off with him!

349
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:51,721
[Roy] That's right!

350
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:54,987
Think about it, Ling!
You're an illegal alien.

351
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,721
[Knox] I'm too old
for this kinda thing..

352
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:59,921
Good luck, Mustang..
I'm going home.

353
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,354
Colonel Mustang.

354
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,721
Mustang was one
who killed Lust!...

355
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,754
Mustang must pay for
what he did to her!

356
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:15,454
[cables straining,
Gluttony grunting]

357
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:19,521
[Gluttony] Roy Mustang!

358
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:24,421
[Shao May whimpering]

359
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,854
[explosion]

360
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:31,587
What was that?!

361
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:07,787
<i>[Narrator] What lies safely</i>
<i>hidden behind lying eyes...</i>

362

363
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:13,821
