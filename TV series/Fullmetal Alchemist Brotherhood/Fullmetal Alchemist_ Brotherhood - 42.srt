[sneezes]

3
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:53,347
Look at this, he mentions
that phrase again here.

4
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,847
Yet another term for gold,

5
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,947
it's gotta be some
kind of pattern.

6
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,981
[WINRY]
What are you trying to do?

7
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,714
We believe there's
a chance these notes

8
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,347
were written in code.

9
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,781
You think so?

10
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,814
Alchemists are
typically very protective

11
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,481
of their research and methods...

12
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:10,181
They bury the
meaning of their notes

13
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,981
beneath a layer of
metaphor and allegory...

14
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,014
But these are almost
straightforward...

15
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,081
There's something
else going on.

16
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:19,147
[MAY CHANG] We noticed that
he uses several different terms

17
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,281
for gold and immortality
across various passages...

18
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,881
So we're checking to
see if they're connected.

19
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,081
[WINRY] And you think...
that could be the code?

20
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,247
[MAY CHANG]
We're hoping so.

21
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,481
[AL]
Where am I?

22
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,381

[WINRY]
Thank goodness you're okay...!

25
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,214
I was so scared you
might not wake up--

26
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:38,814
I didn't know what to do.

27
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,481
[AL]
Oh... Sorry...

28
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:43,081
I didn't mean to
freak you out like that.

29
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,481
So where are we...?

30
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:47,047
And why am I in pieces?

31
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:50,851
[WINRY]
And that's basically it.

32
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,185
[SCAR]
As for why you're in pieces,

33
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:54,185
you were too heavy
to carry whole...

34
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:56,185
So we had to dismantle you.

35
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,985
[AL]
Ah. That makes sense...

36
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:01,218
Sorry to put you
guys out like that...

37
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,451
[WINRY] Has this ever
happened to you before?

38
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:04,918
[AL]
Just once...

39
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,285
When I was trying
to find you guys.

40
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,051
Well then...

41
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,551
I can't imagine
it's very comfortable

42
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:13,318
being scattered
about like that...

43
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:15,885
Why don't we start
putting you back together?

44
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:18,085
[AL]
Please... If you don't mind.

45
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,551
Can you hold onto
this while we fix him?

46
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:26,851
Now let's see.... This goes...

47
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:28,885
Isn't that a part of
his right shoulder?

48
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,551
Oh, yes seems to be...

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,418
I guess we should
reassemble him correctly.

50
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:38,318
[MAY CHANG]
Reassemble...

51
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,285
The pieces...

52
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,285
What are you doing, May?!

53
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,418
What have you done?

54
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:59,151
How could you be
so careless, May?!

55
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:04,218
[MAY CHANG] We need to
rearrange the pieces.

56
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,285
What if we try
connecting each occurrence

57
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,251
of the words for
gold and immortality

58
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,709
by physically overlapping them?

59
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,985
"An immortal being"...

60
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:21,851
This phrase appears
earlier in the notes.

61
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:25,185
[MAY CHANG] "A true being"...
That overlaps here.

[MARCOH]
Now where did I see this...

63
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,651
Here!

64
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,051
[SCAR] Let me take a look at
those other pages, Marcoh.

65
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,285
[MAY CHANG] "Golden"!
That connects over here.

00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,051
[SCAR]
And what about "aurelian"?

67
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:37,218
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, yeah... Right here.

68
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,785

That's the last one.

69

Oh...! I wonder if we...

70
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:00,318
It can't be!

71
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:06,551
[AL] It's the countrywide
transmutation circle.

72
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,085
It's too late for
this to help us now.

73
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,851
Wait, are you saying
what I think...

74
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:12,185
You mean these
damned research notes

75
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,918
are completely
useless to us?!

No way, you
can't be serious...

77
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:16,685
But what about the--

78

What's gonna happen to
our families, our country?!

I'm sorry...

I should've known
this was nothing

but an act of futility...

It was naiÃ¯ve to think someone
else's research could save us.

Good job, moron...

You were right, Al.

This is it... It's a new
Amestrian transmutation circle.

And what do we have here?

00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,918
They must've been
using this place

115
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:58,585
to dispose of the excess rubble

116
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:01,485
from the tunnel that
Sloth has been digging.

Go ahead and carve the

[KIMBLEE]
With all due respect, Pride...

127
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,885
The soldiers of Briggs
are much stronger

128
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,451
and more resourceful
than you might realize...

129
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,085
It's not exactly a simple task.

130
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:38,287
[PRIDE] Then use their
strength to your favor.

00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:44,051
Sloth is nearing
completion of the tunnel...

So there's little time left.

133
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,518
[KIMBLEE]
So it's an urgent matter...?

134
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:53,451
Well if you insist that I carve
the crest of blood at Briggs...

135
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,851
I'd be happy to oblige you.

136
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,218
Welcome back to
the fort, Major.

137
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,118
[MILES]
Any changes to report?

138
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:14,318
None since we spoke...

139
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:16,185
The situation is
still normal here,

140
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:19,318
but we've heard that
Kimblee has gone missing.

141
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,451
[KIMBLEE]
You heard right...

142
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,418
There was an explosion in
one of the mine shafts...

143
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:24,451
No one's heard from Kimblee

144
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,551
or a few others since then...

145
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,585
We did a thorough
search through the rubble

146
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,785
but no bodies turned up.

147
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:38,218
Are the other men that
are missing Briggs soldiers?

148
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,118
[MILES] No... They were
two of Kimblee's men...

149
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,551
And the Fullmetal Alchemist.

150
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:53,218
[BREDA] Is that so...?
Fullmetal's missing.

151
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,485
I hope he's alright.

152
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:59,185
Me too... So are
things any better there?

153

[BREDA]
Afraid not.

154
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:04,385
The border war at
Pendleton was a massacre.

155

If the military was
hoping for casualties,

they sure as hell got them.

It's just like you said...

158
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,185
They're sending men
in to be slaughtered

159
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:16,585
for this transmutation circle.

00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,551
[FALMAN] What's going
on in the south...?

161
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,185
Have you spoken with Fuery?

162
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,118
We talked on the phone...

163
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:23,985
A while back.

164
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,585
It's just as bad down there...

165
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,285
They're locked in
combat with Aerugo.

166
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,051
Keep moving, Thomas...!

167
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,518
Just don't stop...! Thomas!

168
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,285
Damn ittt!

169
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:59,185
I'm gonna survive this...!

170
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,451
I'm gonna live!

171
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,418
I won't die for this!

172
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,285
That's terrible.

173
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,285
[BREDA]
I guess it's to be expected...

174
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:13,485
The higher-ups aren't
our biggest fans...

175
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:15,185
Have you been in
touch with the Colonel?

176
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,818
Yeah...

177
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:18,051
We've been using a messenger

178
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:21,918
connected to the
Armstrong family.

179
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,018
Good to hear...

180
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,918
Just be careful with
everything going on up there.

181
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,085
I am... well,
I'm trying to be.

182
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:33,118
Bradley's got his soldiers
everywhere up here...

183
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,018
Working around the clock
to create hell on earth...

184
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,885
And the worst part is
there's nothing we can do.

185
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,851
The tunnel's... connected.

186
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,818
I'm all done working...

187
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:59,051
Does this mean I can rest...

188
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,218
Can I, Pride?

189
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,318
[FATHER]
The time draws near.

190
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,551
The day of reckoning is
almost within our grasp.

[ROSE]
Hey, everyone!

194
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,929
Go ahead and line up...!

195
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,829
It's time to take a lunch break!

196
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,595
[CROWD]
Yeah!

197
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,695
[RESIDENT 1]
Y'know, Rose...

198
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,095
I'd love to try your
three-meat pie sometime.

199
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,095
Well I promise to make it
as soon as we get some meat.

200
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,662
[RESIDENT 1]
I'll try to be patient.

201
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:50,962
Uh, pardon me...

202
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,229
I confess I haven't
been able to do any work,

203
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:54,195
but would you please give

204
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:57,095
just a little bit of
food to these children?

205
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,695
Well, of course
I'll feed them...

206
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:01,095
But you have to
eat too, okay?

207
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:06,795
[LITTLE GIRL]
It looks delicious!

208
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,995
[RESIDENT 2] Hey ya,
Rose... Pile it high.

209
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,695
You know I can't...

210
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,962
Everyone gets
the same amount.

211
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:16,229
[HOHENHEIM]
Ummm... Excuse me, Miss.

212
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,829
May... May I
have some food...?

213
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,895
If you don't mind.

214
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,829
Thank you...!
You saved me...

215
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:30,729
Literally... Thanks so much.

216
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:31,695
Where are you from?

217
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,129
If you don't
mind me asking.

218
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,095
I'm not really
from anywhere...

219
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,129
I tend to travel mostly.

220
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:41,062
And what brings you
all the way out to Liore?

221
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,662
We don't mean to pry...

222
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,829
We're just surprised
to have a tourist.

223
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,495
Most people tend
to avoid Liore...

224
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,995
There isn't much left
here after the riots.

225
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:55,129
Your cooking is a good
enough reason to visit.

226
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,162
That's sweet of you to say

227
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,929
but I don't know about that...

228
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,895
I just wish there
was more I could do

229
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,029
to help out around here.

230
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,662
Don't underestimate yourself.

231
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:09,162
A delicious meal and the smile

232
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,495
of a lovely young
lady are more help

233
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,462
than you can imagine.

234
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,329
[HOHENHEIM]
By the way...

235
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:22,962
I hate to impose any
further than I already have...

236
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,862
but can you point me
towards the church?

237
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,162
Which church?

238
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,129
Well...

239
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,529
I'm actually looking
for the church of Leto,

240
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,729
where the riots started.

[OLDER MAN]
This is what's left of it...

There's nothin'
left inside either.

243
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:46,762
[HOHENHEIM]
Do you know if there's

244
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,962
a passage that
leads underground?

245
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,695
[ROSE]
Uh... Yeah...

246
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,862
I can show you where it is.

247
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,695
[HOHENHEIM]
And what's this?

248
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,662
[ROSE]
The water turned toxic...

249
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,962
No one's really
sure how it happened.

250
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,229
I get the feeling
that this was put here

251
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:13,529
to keep people from
going any further...

252
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:14,195
Sooo.

253
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:15,195
Wait!

254
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,129
Hey! What are you doing,
that stuff'll kill you!

255
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:26,929
It's some kind of miracle.

256
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,495
That's no miracle...

257
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,462
But I know what it is...

258
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,995
That's alchemy.

259
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,129
[HOHENHEIM] I'm gonna
go a little farther in...

260
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,562
Would you mind waiting for me?

261
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,829
It's enormous.

262
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:59,095
I'm impressed...

263
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:01,995
They certainly went
all out making this.

264
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:09,695
Found it right off
the bat, didn't I...

265
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:31,229
Well... That didn't
even slow it down.

266
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,195
Okay then...

267
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,462
Let's see if I can trap it.

268
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:42,829
Oh, dear...

269
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:50,429

00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:14,695
[PRIDE]
You look just like...

275
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:17,695
You must be Van Hohenheim.

276
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:18,829
So I'm assuming that this

277
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:21,662
must be the edge
of your container.

278
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,462
You'll die if you pass it...

279
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,029
Correct?

280
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:31,929
You can't survive outside of
your container, can you...?

281
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:34,762
It's not much different
than your flask, is it?

282
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,962
I'm guessing that you
can only move freely

283
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,695
within these tunnels
and Central City...

284
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,595
Am I right?

285
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:47,129
I'll take that as a yes.

286
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:49,962
What's wrong...?

287
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,762
Why the silent treatment...?

288
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:56,995
Did I hit a nerve?

289
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,695
Are you angry?

290
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,695
[PRIDE]
I'm never angry...

291
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:04,795
Anger does not exist within me.

292
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,029
I have no need of such things.

293
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:10,729
I left all unnecessary
emotions within Father...

All but one...
My name is Pride.

Pride The Arrogant...

296
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,929
That makes sense,
I can see your conceit...

00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:24,862
[HOHENHEIM] There are seven
deadly sins within man.

298
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,129

299
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,229
Greed.

300

And of course... Pride.

305
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:44,229
You're obviously the first
one that he separated...

306
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:47,695
Pride was his
strongest trait...

307
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,695
And the mere fact
that he took the time

308
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,962
and energy to give you
his original appearance...

309
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:57,662
That act alone shows how
egotistical he truly is...

310
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:01,862
You are the pure
essence of your father.

311
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:05,129
[PRIDE] I insist that you
come with me to see Father.

312
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:07,129
Don't try to rush me, Pride...

313
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:11,162
I don't need an
invitation to call on him.

314
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,962
But you can give
him a message...

315
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:14,229
Tell him Slave Twenty Three

316
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,729
will be dropping in quite soon.

317
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,062
Just tell him to be patient

318
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,462
and relax in his
chair beneath Central...

319
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,962
I'm coming.

00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:50,859
Oh... Here he comes.

323
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,559
Did you find anything?

324
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,893
Yes... Dangerous
and disturbing things

325
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,193
not meant for ordinary people...

326
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,387
Please tell everyone to
stay far away from here.

327
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,626
What exactly were
you doing in there?

328
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,259
Sending a declaration of war.

329
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,259
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 10]
You're relieved.

330
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,759
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 11]
What took you so long...?

331
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:24,493
We've been miserable
in this storm.

332
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:25,559
Well, anyway...

333
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:28,659
I think some terrible
coffee should warm us up.

334
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,426
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 10]
Enjoy it.

335
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:38,559
No... way...

336
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:41,359
What the hell...?
It couldn't be...

337
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,526
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 10]
It's Drachma!

338
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:49,759
[ANNOUNCERR]
Drachma is launching

339
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:51,126
an attack from the north...!

340
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,159
All men...!
Prepare for combat...!

341
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:54,126
I repeat...

342
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,359
Drachma has declared
war and is approaching!

343
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:57,359
All men!

344
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:59,259
Prepare for combat!

345
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:15,193
We are rather fortunate the

346
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:18,393
"Northern Wall of Briggs"
has been called away...

347
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,559
Good timing, Mr. Kimblee.

348
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,226
And, on top of that...

349
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,759
I've got a number of my top men

350
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,293
already stationed
inside the fort...

351
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,759
They'll spring their treachery
when the fighting starts...

352
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:31,793
The ensuing chaos should
weaken them from within.

353
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,793
My country has long dreamed

354
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,593
of the day when we
could breach the walls

355
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,126
of that abomination...

356
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,393
Fort Briggs will belong
to Drachma by nightfall.

357
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:45,226
Well... Let's send
a declaration of war.

358
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,459
What do you say we give them

359
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,759
a nice fireworks
show for starters?

360
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,593
All cannons...!
Prepare to fire!

361
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,293
Fiiirrrre!

362
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:38,826
Yeah... Yeah, hello...?

363
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,659
This is Zampano
reporting in...

364
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,659
I'm one of Kimblee's soldiers.

365
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,659
Dr. Marcoh and
Scar are hiding out

366
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:46,826
in the slums of
Asbeck Village...

367
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,159
[ENVY] You made the right move
by telling me this, Zampano.

368
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,693
And I promise that
you'll be protected.

369
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:56,226
[ENVY LAUGHS]

370
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,226
Dr. Marcoh...

371
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,459
Things are starting to look up!
