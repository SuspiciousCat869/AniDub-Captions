1
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,079
Hey... Where are you taking us?

2
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,112
Just get in.

3
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:07,246
This looks like...

4
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,446
[AL] It's Central Command...
We were right below it.

5
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,146
[ENVY] Hey.

6
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:17,179
You guys are
plastered with filth.

7
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:21,646
[AL] So they've been there this
whole time... I never would've

8
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,212
guessed they were beneath
the command center.

9
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,479
[ED] So maybe it's
not just the Fuhrer...

10
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:30,112
The entire military
might be involved...

11
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:37,046
But hey... there is some
good news in all of this...

12
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,646
[AL] You saw it...?!
My body's still in there?!

13
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,412
It is... I tried to reach out
for it, but it said that

14
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:45,612
it couldn't go with me
since I wasn't its soul.

15
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:50,546
[AL] My body...
It still exists...! Yes... Yes!

16
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,179
[ED]
Yes.

17
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,079
And now that we
know it's there,

18
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:59,146
we're one step closer
to gettin' it back.

19
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,212
[ED] Al...? What's that weird
little cat doing in here?

20
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:05,212
[AL] Uh... Well...
Y'know that little girl?

21
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:07,979
[ED] Are you serious?!
She's inside your armor?!

22
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,212
[AL] Brother...! Stop yelling!
And while you're at it,

23
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:13,046
will you put on some pants?

24
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,079
Hey, what's the hold up...?!
Get a move on!

25
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:19,446
[AL and ED]
Agghhhh!!!

26
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,912
Jeez, Al... Did you really
have to bring her along with us?

27
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,912
[AL] What else was I supposed
to do...? She's hurt pretty bad.

28
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,112
[ENVY]
Hey!

29
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:38,112
Wrath'll take over babysitting
you now... Right this way.

30
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:39,546
Wrath?

31
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:51,146
[ED'S INNER THOUGHT]
Wrath... Is Fuhrer King Bradley?

32
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,112
Colonel?

33
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:57,279
What's going on?

34
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,212
Where should I begin...?
Fuery's been shipped south...

35
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,079
Falman's been sent up north...

36
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,612
and Breda's been
reassigned to the west.

37
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,046
[ROY]
Lieutenant Hawkeye is now a

38
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,279
personal assistant
to the Fuhrer.

39
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:14,179
[ED'S INNER THOUGHTS]
Huh--What the hell is this?

40
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,612
They're practically
holding them hostage.

41
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:20,412
[BRADLEY]
Go ahead and take a seat.

42
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,079
[ED THINKS]
The guard's left us alone...

43
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:27,912
There are three of us
and only one of him.

44
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,146
[AL] He's only got one
sword with him.

45
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:34,179
[ROY] So, he's that confident he
could take us all at once...

46
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:40,379
[MAY CHANG COUGHS INSIDE AL]
[AL COVERS UP BY COUGHING]

47
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,346
Um... Fuhrer?

48
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,079
So what was that in the hospital
that day... when you came

49
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:48,646
to visit me...? You really
had us goin', didn't you.

50
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:51,212
I don't recall lying...
I instructed you to

51
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:56,012
suspect everyone...
And not to meddle any further...

52
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,079
The only thing that you
need to know is that you're

53
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:00,479
important to us...
And there's no need for you

54
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,646
to dig any deeper...
Accept the importance of

55
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,246
your role and keep
your heads down...

56
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,879
You do that and no harm
will come to you.

57
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:11,079
Well that's great for us...
But what happens to all of

58
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,346
the people who
aren't lucky enough

59
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,146
to be considered "sacrifices"?

60
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,212
There's nothing you need to
know that I haven't already

61
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:21,646
told you... Is that clear,
Fullmetal Alchemist?

62
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:26,146
[ED] You chose that as my title.
I only joined the military

63
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:29,112
because I thought it might
help us get our bodies back...

64
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:32,479
But now? Now I know what's
the State Alchemist program

65
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:35,112
really is... You're using it
as a way to recruit your

66
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,346
sacrifices... Well I'm
not gonna let you

67
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,846
use me to accomplish
your sick goals.

68
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:46,012
I resign my title
as a State Alchemist!

69
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:50,046
The symbol of a dog...
Fittingly crusted with blood.

70
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,046
Your plans are gonna fail...
I swear on my own grave

71
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,912
that I'm gonna stop you...

72
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,346
I'll warn the other State
Alchemists... I'll tell them--

73
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,479
[BRADLEY] What was that lovely
young girl's name again?

74
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:04,179
Ah, yes... It's Winry Rockbell.

75
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:08,612
Your automail engineer...
And you grew up in Resembool

76
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:10,546
as well, if I'm not mistaken...

77
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,979
She's practically a
family member, isn't she?

78
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,179
[BRADLEY] I've heard that she's
made quite a name for herself

79
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,346
with her customers
in Rush Valley...

80
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,512
Such a sweet and trusting girl.

81
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:26,446
You stay away from her!
Just leave her out of this!

82
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,212
[BRADLEY]
Well. That's up to you.

83
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,646
If you'd rather not take it,

84
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,146
then I will simply
have to cut her down.

85
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,079
How thoughtful.

86
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,646
[AL] Uh, Sir. You don't
have to worry about us...

87
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:50,512
But I have to ask... If we're
going to continue to serve

88
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:53,246
under your watch... Will you
please allow us to keep

89
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,379
searching for a way to get
our original bodies back?

90
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,446
[AL]
Please, Sir.

91
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,212
I don't see why not... As long
as you don't interfere with

92
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:04,546
our plans... And what do
you have in mind, Colonel...?

93
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,112
You wouldn't do something so
petty as to quit the military?

94
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:11,112
Good question...
I'm on a short leash here...

95
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,612
but I still find that
preferable to giving up.

96
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:18,246
And I still have my ambitions...
Your plans don't change that...

97
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,546
So I'll hang onto this...
And I'll retain my rank, too.

98
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:26,579
That's fine with me...
We have nothing more to discuss.

99
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:32,079
[ROY] I would like to ask
you one question... Sir.

100
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,946
Would you now...? Go ahead.

101
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,979
Are you the one who
murdered General Hughes?

102
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,046
No... That was not me.

103
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,179
Then who did?

104
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,212
Colonel...
I agreed to one question.

105
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,546
We'll be leaving now.

106
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,246
[BRADLEY]
Oh, just one moment, Alphonse.

107
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,512
[AL]
Is that all?

108
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:07,212
That's all...
You are now dismissed.

109
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,612
[AL]
That was too close!

110
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,112
I almost got stabbed
in the head!

111
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,079
[ED]
Oh, hey, Colonel.

112
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,346
Help us out...
Have you got any change?

113
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,246
You want my money now?

114
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,912
Just give it...! Jeez...
that all you got? Really?

115
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:29,879
It's apparently more
than you've got!

116
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:32,046
Sure, whatever... See ya.

117
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,179
Heyy!

118
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,346
[AL] Sorry, Colonel...!
We'll explain everything later!

119
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,079
What the hell's with them?

120
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,112
No...! The Lieutenant!

121
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,379
Lieuten--

122
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,346
Is there something
troubling you Colonel...?

123
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,312
You appear slightly
discomposed.

124
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,946
Well just how do you expect
me to appear... I had hoped

125
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,412
a young woman would
be standing there,

126
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,912
not a mustachioed muscleman.

127
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,479
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel?

128
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,812
Lieutenant.

129
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:08,612
I was getting worried... Uh...!
Sorry... uh, Lieutenant Hawkeye.

130
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:11,179
Reporting back to post
from latrine break, Sir.

131
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,346
[HAWKEYE] Major Armstrong
happened to be passing by...

132
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,946
He was nice enough to
watch my post for me...

133
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,346
Thanks for everything,
Major... I appreciate it.

134
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,212
[ARMSTRONG]
No trouble at all.

135
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:21,646
So you didn't run off.

136
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,512
Someone once told me to never
give up, no matter what...

137
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:27,479
And once was all I needed.

138
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,246
Just don't ever tell
me you wished you'd

139
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,146
run when you had the
chance... Alright?

140
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,179
It's too late for regrets.

141
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,579
[WINRY]
Hello...? Ed?

142
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,312
Well this is a surprise...

143
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,379
You didn't break your
automail again, did you?

144
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,512
[ED OVER PHONE]
What, no!

145
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:49,079
[ED] I'm calling... because...
Is everything alright?

146
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:51,112
[ED OVER PHONE]
Have you noticed anything weird?

147
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,879
Like any suspicious
people following you?

148
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:54,912
Well, Ed...

149
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,079
What is it?

150
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:59,046
[WINRY OVER PHONE]
You're creeping me out.

151
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,312
What's creepy?!

152
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:03,312
[WINRY] It's just... Well, it's
actually pretty rare to get a

153
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,579
call from you... And I've never
heard you worry about me...

154
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,346
This is weirder than a
snowstorm during the summer.

155
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,512
Well, fine!
Maybe I won't worry--

156

[WINRY OVER PHONE]
Thank you, Ed.

157
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,212
Really... Thank you...
It means a lot.

158
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:22,912
Uh... Sure... You're certain
everything's okay, right...?

159
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,146
Yeah... 'kay... Bye.

160
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:29,112
I think she's
still safe for now.

[GREED] You know, it's that kind
of desperate worry they're

gonna manipulate you with.

00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,546
Nooo, it's Greed... Still.

165
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,212
What do you want?

166
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:42,346
Your pal asked me
to bring this to you?

167
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,446
[ED]
Ling did?

168
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,579
What does it say...?
It's in some other language.

169
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:50,312
Yea... It is... But
he just wants you

170
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,246
to deliver it to some girl.

171
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,246
Lan Fan...? Is this
some kind of trick...?

172
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,412
'Cuz if you follow us
and try to kill her...

173
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,379
I've got more class
than that, alright...?

174
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:03,346
And as a rule of thumb,
I don't fight women.

175
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,946
And another rule of mine
is to never tell a lie,

176
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,279
but hey... It's your call...

[SCAR THINKS] Who is
that godless monster?

00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,470
What cause would bring
him to initiate a civil war

Is someone there?

Who is that...?
Did you come from outside?

I can help you if you're
injured... Why don't you

come down here...? Is
everything alright outside?

It's safe to come down...

a while... Let me help

Tell me who you are first... And
what are you doing down here?

My god!

This must be fate.

Just a mild concussion.

not! You seem to think this is a

found a Philosopher's Stone.

happened to the Young Lord?

Please, talk to me, Alphonse...!
Where is the Prince?

222
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:55,303
[BRADLEY] So what do you
think of that body, Greed?

223
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,437
Decent enough?

224
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,637
Ah, so you must be Wrath...
Yeah, the body's great...

Listen to this...
It's royalty...!

The kid was a prince of Xing.
The funny thing is he let me

227
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:07,570
take control... He thought
I could make him emperor

228
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:11,070
or something... What an
ambitious little brat.

229
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,203
I spoke to him once about
politics... His naiÃ¯ve theories

230
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:18,570
on leadership were amusing...
He said a king's duty is to

231
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:21,037
his people...
As if the people actually

232
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,437
mattered when ruling a country.

233
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,503
[BRADLEY] The fool. Just
look where his allegiance

to the people has gotten
him now... Typical human.

Don't underestimate humans.

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,203
I know, I know... He's
patient... Just waiting for

238
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:41,703
any chance he can get...
I've gotta stay on my toes.

239
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:45,603
He must be starting to
reconsider his ambitions.

240
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:49,637
[BRADLEY] Now that he's taken a
monster like you into his flesh.

Fuhrer Bradley is a Homunculus?!

[ARMSTRONG]
It can't be.

243
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:02,237
[ARMSTRONG] The only thing
I ever wanted to do was

244
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,703
protect my fellow countrymen.

245
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,237
And I'm not the only one...
So many soldiers have put

246
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,203
their trust in the military...
And this...? This is the truth?

247
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,437
[ROY]
You could resign, Major.

248
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,937
With your disposition... I'm
afraid you'll suffer otherwise.

249
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,703
How can we fight a war
like this...?! It's wrong!

00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,337
[FASSLER] Major...!
You're disobeying an order...!

251
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,270
You're dismissed...!

[ARMSTRONG]
I collapsed in Ishval...

254
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,703
I couldn't bring myself
to stay and fight...

255
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,670
The military's methods
were ghastly...

256
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:46,970
I could see their malignance...
but still... I chose to turn

257
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,403
away and run when I should have

258
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:50,670
fought to protest their actions.

259
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:55,037
That decision... It's haunted
me every day since then...

260
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,570
It makes me sick that
I abandoned my beliefs.

261
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:02,303
And now that I face the military
again... I have to fight...

262
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,470
I couldn't live with
myself if I ran away now.

263
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:08,570
[HAWKEYE]
And how do you plan on

264
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,503
handling all of this, Colonel?

265
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,437
The Fuhrer asked me
that... I told him

266
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,703
I wasn't gonna quit or
give up my ambitions.

267
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:18,303
The Fuhrer seemed like he was
downright eager to reveal his

268
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:21,437
true nature as a Homunculus
to me... It appears he wants

269
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,037
me to know there's someone
even more powerful giving

270
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,103
him orders... Seems
they're testing me...

271
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,203
I have to admit I'm honored.

272
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,303
You seem surprisingly calm.

273
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:36,170
I don't know... It's
just...Well, it's similar

274
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,970
to how I felt during
the battle with Lust.

275
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:41,403
[ROY] I've been called a
human weapon and a monster...

276
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:44,537
Maybe I deserve it, but
I can tell you this much...

277
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,303
I never feel more human than

278
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,603
when I'm fighting real monsters.

279
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:54,886
[LAN FAN]
I see.

280
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:59,753
He accepted the stone...
And let the beast take control.

281
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,853
[AL] I'm sorry... I wish we
could've stopped him.

282
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:06,253
[LAN FAN] Don't apologize...
I'm only upset with myself for

283
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:11,686
being unable to protect
him... But the Prince...

284
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,886
He's not gone...
He's just trapped inside

285
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,653
of this Greed creature, right?

286
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,753
I need your help... I want a new
arm... As soon as possible.

287
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,986
[AL] Are you sure...?
You haven't healed yet--

288
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:28,186
I need an automail engineer
now... Please help me!

289
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,086
[AL] Yeah, okay...
I'll introduce you soon...

290
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:40,153
But you need to get your
strength back first...

291
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:43,186
I'll ask Doctor Knocs to
make you some food--

292
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,753
[AL] I don't think you
should be up yet...

293
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,886
It's uh... May Chang, right?

294
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,186
May?

295
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,153
[AL]
What's going on?

296
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:59,153
You're a watchdog
for the Yao Clan.

297
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:02,053
I know you too...
You're the Chang heiress.

298
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:05,953
Very good... I'm the 17th
daughter... Princess May Chang.

299
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,453
I also know why
you're in this country...

300
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,719
To obtain immortality.

301
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:13,286
Too bad you won't
live to see me get it.

302
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:16,986
You won't even
leave this room, Princess.

303
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,419
[AL]
Hey, just hold on a minute!

304
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,753
I don't know what this is about.

305
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:21,886
But you can't fight like this!

306
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,419
[MAY CHANG AND LAN FAN]
Quit trying to interfere with

307
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:25,753
the affairs of our country!

308
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:27,919
My wounds aren't
going to slow me down.

309
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,686
Is that so...?
Well neither will mine.

310
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,219
[KNOCS] What the hell do
you two think you're doing?!

311
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,753
You're supposed to
be resting in bed!

312
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,019
[MAY CHANG]
Quit trying to interfere with

313
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,219
the affairs of our--

314
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:45,753
I don't care about the affairs
of your country, dumb ass!

315
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:48,419
Jeez... It doesn't matter
where you're from,

316
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,653
you're both my patients.

317
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,419
You're not planning on making an
even larger mess around here,

318
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:58,153
are you...?! HUH...?! Because
if you do, you might release an

319
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:00,753
unknown pathogen
from the floorboards...

320
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:03,253
and kill everyone in the house.

321
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,753
[AL] How could it get
messier in here...?

322
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:12,786
I wonder how long it's been
since he's bothered cleaning.

323
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,053
[AL]
I found this on the floor.

324
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:21,753
So that's where
it's been all this time.

325
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,353
[AL] Hey...! You can't
throw away a family picture!

326
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:27,386
I don't speak to
my wife and son.

327
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,086
What's the big deal...?
And who are you to decide

328
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,853
what I do with my own stuff?

329
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,819
[KNOCS] Why don't you go get
some coffee or something?

330
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:44,319
[WOMAN] Thanks for
taking the time to come by.

331
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,219
I'm actually
surprised you came...

332
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,953
I was honestly starting
to get a little worried.

333
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,919
It worked... I'm able
use my alchemy again.

334
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,886
[SOLDIER 1] Hey, very
nicely done up there...

335
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,753
That takes care of all of
our repairs for the day.

336
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,919
Yeah, you can always rely
on a State Alchemist...

337
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,186
These other alchemists around
here just can't compare.

338
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:15,686
You should've seen those guys...
We had a couple of local

339
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,886
alchemists helping us with
repairs this morning...

340
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,686
All they really ended up doing
was looking foolish, though.

341
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,219
They came strolling in like
they were the very best...

342
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:27,153
And next thing ya know, their
alchemy wouldn't work!

343
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,019
[ED THINKS]
He said this morning...

344
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,853
That was when we
were underground.

345
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,886
[WOMAN]
Mr. Alchemist!

346
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,653
Thanks again!

347
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:38,786
[EDFACE A]
Thank you.

348
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,453
[ED THINKS] I know Envy
told me that they're just

349
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:48,819
mindless energy...
but I don't know...

350
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,986
It just doesn't feel
right to me...

351
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,386
Which means I'm
not fully convinced.

352
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,719
Snap out of it...! I've got
bigger things to be concerned

353
00:20:57,753 --> 00:21:01,386
with... The alchemy...
If those guys were right,

354
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:02,886
then we weren't
the only ones who

355
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,086
couldn't transmute
this morning.

356
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,119
If so... How come Scar
and that little girl were

357
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:12,786
able to use theirs...?
What does that mean?

358
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:16,453
[ED THINKS]
Could their alchemy be

359
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,353
different from ours...?

360
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:21,853
That's the only thing that makes
sense... I'm gonna have to make

361
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:24,986
them teach it to me somehow.
And maybe I can use it

362
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,786
to get Al's body back and take
down that bearded bastard.

363
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,853
[ED THINKS]
Oh, yeah... I've gotta get

364
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:36,886
this to the Lieutenant.

365
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,086
[MARCOH] They forced me to
follow through with their plans.

366
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,086
I made a Stone for them.
And I used the lives of

367
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,419
countless Ishvalans to do it.

368
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:25,386
And now... They're forcing
me to cooperate on an

369
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:29,419
experiment that's likely to
result in another genocide.

370
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:33,219
I beg you... Please stop it!
You have to kill me, please...!

371
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:34,353
Please take my life!

372
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:39,419
My own death is the only form
of revenge that I have!

373
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,319
Your appearance here... Right
now... You're like a god to me.

374
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,753
[SCAR] Tell me everything
about Ishval... I want to hear

375
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:55,753
the entire story... What
did you use my people for?

376
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,353
You'll tell me... all of
it... Give me the truth

377
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,053
before my right
hand destroys you!

378
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:07,086
[NARRATOR] The violence of war.
It manages to terrorize long

379
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,353
after it's ceased. The soil
is left with a thirst for

380
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:14,419
the spilt blood and the
burning flesh stains the air.

381
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,953
This was Ishval...

382
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:19,086
And all that's left is
a loathsome memory.

383
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,419
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood

384
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:24,019
Episode Thirty...

385
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:27,419
The Ishvalan War
of Extermination.

386
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:31,886
I shall tell you the truth,
even if no one else will.
