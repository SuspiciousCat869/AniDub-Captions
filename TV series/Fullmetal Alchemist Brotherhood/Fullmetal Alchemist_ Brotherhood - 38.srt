[Hawkeye gasps]

00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:16,218
[Hawkeye sighs]

3
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,651
[Hawkeye sighs]

4
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:28,184
[Selim] No matter
where you are...

5
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:32,418
I will be watching you...
from the shadows.

6
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:42,220
[phone rings]

7
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:47,551
[Hawkeye] Hello?

8
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,818
[Mustang] Hello there, Madam.

9
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:50,751
This is your
neighborhood florist.

10
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,384
Ah... What are you
talking about, Colonel?

11
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,751
[Mustang] Uh. Sorry.
I kinda got drunk

12
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:59,151
and somehow bought a
car-full of flowers.

13
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,418
[Mustang]
You wanna do me a favor

14
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,784
and take some off my hands?

15
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:03,651
[Hawkeye sighs]

16
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:06,351
[Mustang] What's wrong?

17
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,384
[Hawkeye gasps]

18
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:10,351
[Mustang] Did something happen?

19
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:13,784
[Hawkeye] No, sir...
It's nothing.

20
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,651
Are you sure?

21
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:19,351
Yes, sir... Everything's fine.

22
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,584
[Hawkeye] And sorry
to let you down...

23
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:23,251
but I don't even
own a flower vase...

24
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,651
Thanks for thinking
of me, though...

25
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:28,451
Have a good night... Okay, bye.

26
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,284
[dog whines]

27
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:43,218
It's amazing how
uncanny his timing is.

28
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,390
[Miles] We got a
report on someone

29
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,957
matching Scar's description.
We believe he was headed here.

30
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,057
[Kimblee]
An abandoned mining town?

31
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,157
[Miles] That's right...
Baschool's pretty much

32
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,123
a ghost town since the
mines were closed...

33
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:35,457
Plenty of buildings to hide in.

34
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,990
This could be tricky.

35
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:39,990
We'll need to split
into search parties.

36
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:42,823
All squads are to contact
us here immediately

37
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:44,390
if you spot Scar.

38
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:45,890
[Squad Captains] Yes, sir!

39
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:52,923
[Heinkel] We've got orders to
keep the two of you company.

40
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,957
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,857
[Al] You think they're
Kimblee's men?

42
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,690
No doubt about it.

43
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,046
[Ed] <i>Now let's see...</i>

44
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,079
[Al] <i>What's it gonna take</i>
<i>to ditch these guys?</i>

45
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,446
[Ed and Al] Aah! There was
someone right over there!

46
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,346
There was?

47
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,712
[Al] He went this way!

48
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:16,179
[Soldier 1] Hey, hold on!

49
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,579
[Heinkel grunts]

50
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,346
[Heinkel] Wait for us!

51
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:25,579
[Darius] What the...?

52
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:26,412
[Heinkel] Where are they?!

53
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:27,446
[Darius] They turned
down this hall.

54
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,346
[Heinkel] Dammit...
They're trying to lose us.

55
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,646
[Ed] And that's that.

56
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:38,079
I'm pretty sure... we lost them.

57
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,079
But you know what?

58
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,612
This place is...

59
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:46,979
...too damn biiiiiiggg!

60
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:51,079
[Al] It's gonna
take weeks to search

61
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:53,012
every one of these buildings.

62
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,746
It would make things
a hell of a lot easier

63
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,279
if Scar and that girl
just came to us.

64
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,012
[May] Alphonse!

65
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,579
[Ed and Al gasp]

66
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,346
[May] Alphonse!

67
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,346
[Al] It can't be...

68
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,212
[Ed] No way...

69
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:06,712
[May] I can't
believe it's yooouuu!

70
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,646
She did come to us.

71
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,646
What in the world are
you doing here, Alphonse?

72
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,612
[Al] May! I didn't think
we'd ever find you!

73
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,579
Ah... You came
this whole way...

74
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,479
just so you could find me?

75
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:22,046
[Al] Yeah... I really
needed to see you.

76
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,412
Ahhhhhh!

77
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:27,646
My sweet Alphonse...

78
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,112
[Al] I need you to
tell me all you can

79
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:32,679
about alkahestry. Can you--

80
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,312
[May] He followed me
for hundreds of miles!

81
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:38,346
--[May] He said he needs me!
--[Ed] Al's not the only one!

82
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,679
[Ed] I need to see
you too, little girl!

83
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,479
Tell us everything you know!

84
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:44,479
You're not leaving until
we've got what we want!

85
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,046
Oh, no! Both brothers have

86
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,246
fallen desperately
in love with me!

87
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,412
I'm sorry, Edward, but
you're just not my type!

88
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:51,712
Don't play games with us!

89
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:52,712
[knocking on armor]

90
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,346
[Winry] Let me out, Al!

91
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,412
[Al] Oh! Sorry, sorry!

92
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:57,612
Ah...!

93
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,712
Mmmh... I kept
bumping my head.

94
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,712
Excuse me?! Who is
this woman, Al?!

95
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,079
[May] How could
you do this to me?!

96
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,446
Am I not enough
for you, Alphonse?

97
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,446
[Al] No! It's not like that,
she's just a friend!

98
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,446
Wait... why am
I explaining this

99
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,979
like I was cheating
on her or something?

100
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,346
[Marcoh] Hey, May!
You shouldn't

101
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,379
go running off like that--

102
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,179
Ah! The Elric
brothers are here?!

103
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,079
[Al] Huh?

104
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,379
Who's that?

105
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:25,712
Right, my face. I'm Dr. Marcoh.

106
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,612
[Al] What? Dr. Marcoh?

107
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,712
But you look... What happened?

108
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:32,446
[Marcoh] Why don't you tell me
what you're doing here first?

109
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,612
[Yoki] Huh?

110
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,479
Ahhh! The Elric
brothers are here?!

111
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:38,346
--[Al] Huh?
--[Ed] And who are you?

112
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,246
Don't act like
you don't know me!

113
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,746
How could you
have forgotten Yoki,

114
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,012
the great proprietor
of Youswell?!

115
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,246
[Ed] Rather easily.

116
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,046
Are you sure
we've actually met?

117
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,012
[Yoki] Ahh!

118
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:51,312
How cruel! And after
you destroyed my life?!

119
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:52,946
Huh?

120
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,046
[Yoki] The glorious
mining town of Youswell.

121
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,312
I brought prosperity
to the town as both

122
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:04,479
governor and foreman
of the coal mine.

123
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:07,046
The people loved me...
For I was more devoted

124
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,346
to their happiness
than anything.

125
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:25,679
[Yoki] But alas... we
were cursed by the arrival

126
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,112
of the greatest
criminal of all time...

127
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:31,179
The State Alchemist,
Edward Elric!

128
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,579
[Yoki] Little did I know it
was an ingenious deception!

129
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:11,412
[Yoki] These heartless
creatures of avarice

130
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,579
schemed to overthrow me!

131
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,612
[Yoki] And thus... The
mine was stolen from me.

132
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:26,079
Even worse, I was banished by
the ungrateful townspeople.

133
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:29,612
The military even fell
for their wretched lies!

134
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:36,346
[Yoki] I set out to renew my
life in every trade imaginable.

135
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,946
But I failed at each one.

136
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,712
[Yoki] I then tried
to invest my savings.

137
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:49,046
[Yoki] Only to yet
again be swindled.

138
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:54,579
[Yoki] Left with no other
options, I called upon

139
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:58,312
a wealthy family to
request a charitable loan.

140
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,712
[Yoki]
Ahhahah! Ahhah!

141
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,279
Uahh?!

142
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,712
Ah-- Ahh...?

143
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:15,146
[Yoki laughs bashfully]

144
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,079
[Catherine screams]

145
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:22,112
[Yoki] Aaaoooww!

146
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,446
[Yoki] None of it
would've happened...

147
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:36,479
if it weren't for
the Elric brothers.

148
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:38,712
And that's when...
I swore to myself...

149
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,712
nothing... nothing would stop
me from taking my revenge

150
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,012
upon the ones who
had done this to me!

151
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:49,179
And it will be a vengeance...
far worse than death!

152
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,712
[May] It's not right!
I'll never let

153
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:54,712
a thieving hussy like
you take him from me!

154
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:57,679
Did you, uh... just
call me a hussy?

155
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:00,312
[Al] I already told you!
She's just a childhood friend!

156
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,312
[Ed] You should think about

157
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,046
something else,
like alkahestry.

158
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:05,046
You better listen to me, dammit!

159
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,512
Yeahhh, how sad...
Life is hard...

160
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,446
Trust me... I know
just how you feel.

161
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:12,079
Are you patronizing me?!

162
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,679
So you're telling me
that you lost the girl?

163
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,346
[Kimblee] You're not the most
competent soldier, are you?

164
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,046
[Liam] I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,579
I'll lead a search team.

166
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,046
I need two men
from Charlie Squad.

167
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,446
[Liam] Yes, sir.

168
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,446
[Kimblee] Don't
forget, Major...

169
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,612
I know Scar is our
main objective...

170
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:34,946
You'll be the first to
know if we locate him.

171
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,312
[Scar] <i>Nothing here, either...</i>

172
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,512
<i>Nothing edible, that is.</i>

173
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,579
You must be Scar.

174
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,546
We'll need you
to come with us...

175
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,346
Mr. Kimblee is waiting for you.

176
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,579
[Scar] I'm impressed with
your tracking skills...

177
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,612
But do you honestly
think that the two of you

178
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:08,112
are gonna be enough to
take me against my will?

179
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:11,946
We'll see... But we do
have a slight advantage.

180
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:18,246
[Gerso] Grrrraaahh!

181
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,646
[Zampano] Rrraahhh!

182
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,212
[Scar] Hmm.

183
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:31,146
Let's just see
how this plays out.

184
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:35,512
Chimeras, huh? Let's go.

185
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,612
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

186
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,884
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

187
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:48,088
I've learned a lot since we met.

188
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:51,355
Like what it takes to
create a Philosopher's Stone.

189
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:55,721
I know there's something
wrong with this country...

190
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:58,121
And there's something
rotten with its alchemy...

191
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:00,121
We've decided to look
into the possibilities

192
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:04,521
of Xingese alkahestry and we
figured that she could help.

193
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,755
[Marcoh]
You're on the right path.

194
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:08,588
But you aren't the
first person to put

195
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,521
all of these pieces together...

196
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:14,488
This book is a collection
of his research and theories.

197
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:15,488
[Ed and Al gasp]

198
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,455
It's written in code,
but we believe this book

199
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:20,155
contains all of the
answers that we need.

200
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:23,455
If we can decipher what's
in there, then Al and I can...

201
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,855
Perhaps... I believe so...
But they'll be impossible

202
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:30,788
to translate without
the assistance of Scar.

203
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:33,355
What do we need him for?!

204
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,055
[several gasps]

205
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,488
What do you think that was?

206
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,455
[Marcoh] That's the
building Scar was in!

207
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:43,021
You think it's the military?

208
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,621
Look, all of you
just need to stay put

209
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:45,988
and hide out in here...

210
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,488
Al and I will find
out what's going on.

211
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,855
So Scar's here...

212
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,655
[Gerso] Mm, mm... Aaahh!

213
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,021
[Scar] Hyaah!

214
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,955
[Scar] <i>He's fast for his size.</i>

215
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:04,621
[Zampano grunts]

216
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:08,821
[Gerso] Blaaaahhh!

217
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,721
[Zampano] Tired yet?
Y'see, we know

218
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:14,721
you've gotta touch us
to use your alchemy.

219
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,988
So we'll just keep a nice
comfortable distance

220
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,488
while we attack you.

221
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,521
[Scar grunts]

222
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,855
[Gerso] Blaaaahhh!

223
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,788
[Zampano] Rrraaahhhh!

224
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,021
[Scar] Gyaaahh!

225
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,588
[Scar grunts]

226
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,821
We studied your file
carefully enough to know

227
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,488
that you destroy the ground
when things start to look bad.

228
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:38,755
[Gerso] We're gonna
beat you to a pulp

229
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,555
before turning you over.

230
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,621
[Scar grunts]

231
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,055
[Ed] Well, look at this.

232
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,121
[Gerso and Zampano] Hm?

233
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:47,421
I guess we got here just
in the nick of time, huh?

234
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,988
Ah...? Didn't they
just run off somewhere?

235
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,588
[Al] His voice!

236
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,455
Brother... I think these
are Kimblee's goons...

237
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:56,088
the ones he
brought from Central.

238
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:59,688
They are? Yeah, I
think you're right.

239
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,855
We've already got
this under control...

240
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:04,121
You just sit tight while
we take care of Scar--

241
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:05,455
Rrrrahh!

242
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:07,621
[Ed and Al] Aaahh!
Talking monsters!

243
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:08,888
What's wrong with
the two of you?!

244
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,621
We're all on the same side!

245
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,655
[Al] I've never teamed up with
any freaky looking monsters!

246
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,121
Help us! They're pretending

247
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,721
to be our friends
so they can eat us!

248
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,921
[Al] The chubby one
has an enormous mouth!

249
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,721
He could eat you
in a single bite!

250
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,155
[Gerso] You obnoxious
brats... Settle down!

251
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:25,155
Blaaaaahhh!

252
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,721
Whoa!

253
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,055
[Gerso grunts]

254
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,488
[Ed] Hyaahh!

255
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:32,688
[Gerso grunts]

256
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,788
[Gerso] <i>Whoa... this kid</i>
<i>is even faster than Scar!</i>

257
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,588
[Ed chuckles]

258
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:40,888
[Al] Uh... Brother?

259
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,888
[Gerso] What are
you laughing at?!

260
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:43,655
Blaaaahhh!

261
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:46,588
[Ed laughs]

262
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,455
[Gerso] Rrrahhh!

263
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,721
Heh... Haha! It's so
light! It's incredible!

264
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:55,088
Amazing! It's like
they're not even there!

265
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,588
This cold weather
automail is magnificent!

266
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,388
[Gerso] You're gonna
regret messin' with me, kid.

267
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:04,988
Huh? So my punches
are lighter too?

268
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:05,988
[Gerso laughs]

269
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,121
Let's see how fast you
move covered in my spit!

270
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:11,688
Your special power is saliva?

271
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,121
Blaaaahhh!

272
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:15,421
[Ed] Well, if that's the case...

273
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:17,755
Huh?

274
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:21,355
Let's break it down...
And revert it to water!

275
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,088
It's f-freezing!

276
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,421
And now...

277
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,588
--[Al] Wahh!
--[Gerso] Uhh! Bwahh!

278
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:29,555
[Al] What do you think
you're doing, Brother?!

279
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:32,455
Don't move, don't move,
my skin is peeling!

280
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,088
I think from now on
I'm gonna call that one

281
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,355
the Wet Tongue on a
Freezing Flagpole Attack!

282
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,388
For the last time,
quit attacking us!

283
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,755
We're s'posed to be
on the same damn side!

284
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,455
You shut your snout, pig!

285
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,488
I've never seen you
before in my whole life!

286
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:49,121
And you must be the enemy
if I don't know you!

287
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:52,455
I bet you can't even prove
to me that you're on our side.

288
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:55,155
Fine, I'll transform
back to prove it to you.

289
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,721
Rrrrraaaaahhh...!

290
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:01,455
Thanks for the
opportunity, sucker!

291
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:02,988
Zampano!

292
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,721
Heh. It's kinda stupid to drop
your defense during combat.

293
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,721
Dammit! Let me go!

294
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:09,988
[Al] Alright, big guy.

295
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,421
Why don't you
take a little nap?

296
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,988
[Ed] He just had to
go and free himself...

297
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,621
Do you really think
you're gonna get away?

298
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:23,788
[Al] Give up, Scar...

299
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,421
It's time to pay
for what you've done.

300
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:29,021
I will kill you if
you try to stop me.

301
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,021
[Ed] Hmm...

302
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:39,119
[Ed charges]

303
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:44,270
[Scar] <i>He's a heedless fool</i>
<i>to charge me without thinking.</i>

304
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,603
You offer your arm to
me? Then I'll take it!

305
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,579
[Ed] I hate to tell you...
but my arm isn't steel anymore!

306
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:57,913
[Scar gasps]

307
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:58,579

00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,079
Don't make this difficult!

[Ed and Al yell]

311
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,913
[Winry] Don't hurt them!

317
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:26,979
What are you doing
here, you idiot?!

318
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,579
[Miles] That's close enough.

319
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,913
[Ed] You brought
her here, Major?

320
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:38,113
What are these creatures?

321
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,379
[Miles] I'd guess they're
the result of some ungodly

322
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:45,579
experiment by our superiors.
Tie them both to that column.

323
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,513
Right away, sir.

324
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,413
And as for you, Scar.
I regret having to

325
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,879
treat one of my own
people so harshly,

326
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,613
but I can't just
let you walk away.

327
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,579
Not after what you've done.

328
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,579
Your own people, huh?

329
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,879
You two can leave...
We've got it from here.

330
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,046
[Ed and Al gasp]

331
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,046
[Al] Winry!

332
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,579
[Ed] Stop, Winry! Stay back!

333
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:10,046
Let me go... it's alright.

334
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,446
It couldn't be any less alright.

335
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:14,079
[Miles] Miss, you
need to stay back.

336
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:17,513
Just let me...
Please understand.

337
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:21,179
You have to let me talk
to him... I need to, Ed.

338
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:24,813
[Ed] Ah--!

339
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,413
[Winry] Why... Why did you
kill my mother and father?

340
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,313
[Scar] There's nothing
I can say that won't

341
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:45,446
sound like an excuse...
And nothing can change

342
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:49,213
the fact that I am
responsible for their deaths.

343
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:59,113
[Scar sighs]

344
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:04,846
[Soldier 1] What happened?

345
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,213
[Soldier 2] That's
where Major Miles was!

346
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,726
Hmm... This isn't good...
Looks like we've gone

347
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:20,360
over the twenty-four
hour timeframe.

348
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:23,548
[Buccaneer] And you
know our ice queen.

349
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:26,548
Patience and compassion
aren't really her strong suits.

350
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,315
We did the best we could...

351
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:29,948
We didn't know we'd have
to grope our way around

352
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,548
back in the dark...

353
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,882
Maybe if these guys hadn't
made us douse the lights

354
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,682
so their "monster" wouldn't
see us, we'da made it.

355
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:38,515
[knocking]

356
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:47,548
[Buccaneer sighs]

357
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,815
A-Ah...!

358
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,382
[Soldiers] Ahh...!

359
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,415
Welcome back, sir.

360
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,215
[Soldier 8] They made it back!

361
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:57,982
[Soldier 9] Take these
men to sick bay.

362
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,482
[Advance Party 1] I'm sorry.

363
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,282
[Soldier 9] There's
no reason to be.

364
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:02,782
I thought you were
ordered to seal up

365
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,915
this hole after
twenty-four hours.

366
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:08,815
Uh... Yes, sir...
But as you can see,

367
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,415
it hasn't been
twenty-four hours yet.

368
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:12,315
[Soldiers] Hmm?

369
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,848
[clock ticking]

370
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,682
[Soldier 3] It's a
nice watch, isn't it?

371
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,882
General Armstrong gave it to
me whenever you guys left.

372
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,448
Ahh...

373
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:31,282
[Buccaneer] General!

374
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:35,282
Did you find the Advance Party?

375
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:37,715
There were only two survivors.

376
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,815
Is that so...?

377
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:45,448
[Buccaneer] May I ask
what you're doing?

378
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,448
[Olivier] I'm looking
at the mountains.

379
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,915
[Olivier] I like the
winters up here.

380
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,682
Everything's black and white...

381
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,815
I appreciate the
pure simplicity of it.

382
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,448
That's not true, sir.

383
00:20:58,482 --> 00:20:59,915
[Olivier] Hmm?

384
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,582
[Buccaneer] You can
see blue if you look up.

385
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:10,848
There's nothing that's
entirely black and white.

386
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:13,515
And thanks for showing your
soldiers a little mercy.

387
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,915
It means a lot, sir.

388
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,215
That's nice...
But I don't know

389
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,248
what you're talking about.

390
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,948
It appears we have guests.

391
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,915
Long time no see,
General Armstrong...

392
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:46,448
Sorry to drop in like this.
But it's somewhat urgent...

393
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,882
Central Command
has a few questions

394
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,782
that they would very much
like to have answered.

395
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:04,182
[Soldier 4] Fall back!
Everyone back!

396
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,548
Ah--!

397
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:10,248
[scattered cries]

398
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:12,482
[Ed coughs]

399
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:13,315
Damn it!

400
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,848
What's going on
in there, Fullmetal?

401
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,348
You bastard! This is
all your fault, Kimblee!

402
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:20,648
You were supposed
to be watching Winry!

403
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:24,548
Ah! Mr. Kimblee, look
up there! On the roof!

404
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:05,582
[Narrator]
