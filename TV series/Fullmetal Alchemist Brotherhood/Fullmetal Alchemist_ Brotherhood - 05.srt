Destruction and creation

statement...

But we understand,
don't we, Scar?

00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:38,048

This guy just must stop
at the deconstruction phase.

But if Scar is
an alchemist as well...

360
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:51,415
doesn't that mean
he's strayed from

almost superhuman...

with his alchemy...

at us with full force...

478
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,321
We can't let ourselves
be killed for his cause.

479
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,187
Next time there
will be no more talk.

480
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:54,887
Got it?

481
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,887
Yes sir!

482
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,587
Well Ed, Alphonse...

483
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,687
what are you two
going to do now...?

484
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,521
What's the plan?

485
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:06,221
We're going to
keep moving...

486
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:07,621
We can't just sit around,

487
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,854
not as long
as we're still alive.

488
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,221
Brother...

489
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:12,954
Before we can make
any headway on getting

490
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,887
your body back, we have
to get my arm back to normal

491
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,154
[ED] After all, I'm the only
one who knows how to

492
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:20,087
bond your soul to the armor.

493
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,987
[AL] Uh-huh.

494
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,987
We've got no choice.

495
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:25,787
[ED]
It's been a long time...

496
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:28,287
But we need to pay a
visit to our mechanic.

497
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,654
<i>[NARRATOR] In order to repair</i>
<i>their injured bodies,</i>

498
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:07,521
<i>Ed and Al set off</i>

499
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,587
<i>for their former</i>
<i>home in Resembool,</i>

500
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,554
<i>where they are met</i>

501
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,687
<i>by their mechanics,</i>
<i>Winry and Pinako.</i>

502
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,154
<i>On the way there,</i>
<i>they happen across</i>

503
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,687
<i>a doctor with a troubled past</i>
<i>who may have clues</i>

504
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,187
<i>to offer in the</i>
<i>brothers' search</i>

505
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:20,554
<i>for the Philosopher's Stone.</i>

506
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:23,687
<i>Next time, on Fullmetal</i>
<i>Alchemist: Brotherhood--</i>

507
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:27,221
<i>Episode Six. Road of Hope</i>

508
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:29,121
<i>What would young Ed discover,</i>

509
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:32,687
<i>and how many questions will</i>
<i>still remain to be answered?</i>
