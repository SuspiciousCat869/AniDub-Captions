00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:07,051
[Hohenheim]
Donatus... Poswell...

2
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:10,151
Reinmeir... Gianni...

3
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:14,317
Collins... Toni... Willard...

4
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:18,051
Ripley... Mechthild... Mayo...

5
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:22,051
Forgive me...
but I have to use you.

6
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:46,784
[Trisha] You can
hug them, you know.

7
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,651
They are your sons.

8
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:50,784
[Hohenheim] I don't want
the monster to spread.

9
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,784
Please... If it could
spread that way...

10
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:57,317
don't you think I would've
caught it a long time ago?

11
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:59,184
[Hohenheim grunts]

12
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,284
[Hohenheim]
Since I got this body,

13
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:03,617
I've seen a lot of death.

14
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,184
But I always tried
to think about it

15
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:08,184
as part of the flow
of the larger world...

16
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:11,051
That made it easier somehow.

17
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:14,251
And each time I encountered
something new and wondrous,

18
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,884
it seemed right that
I'd accepted this body

19
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,917
and kept on living...

20
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,051
For a long time,
that was enough.

21
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:27,051
But then... I met you, and
together we created two sons.

22
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:31,184
Now it's different...
I don't get any older...

23
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:34,984
but my sons age and
grow before my eyes.

24
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:38,017
And suddenly I'm terrified.

25
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:42,217
I'm realizing that I
really am a monster.

26
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:49,184
[Trisha] Dear! Dear,
come here a minute.

27
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,017
What is it?

28
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,984
Hello, sir... Good afternoon.

29
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,784
A photographer?

30
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,317
[Trisha] Yes...
Let's fix you up.

31
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,717
You know we don't have
a single family picture.

32
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:05,851
That's pretty short notice.

33
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,784
[Al laughs]

34
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,151
[Hohenheim sighs]

35
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,784
Here, you hold Ed, all right?

36
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:17,684
[Hohenheim]
U-Uh... Uh, sure...

37
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,984
Okay, we're ready...
You can go ahead.

38
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,084
This isn't good.

39
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,817
[Ed laughs]

40
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,817
[Hohenheim exhales]

41
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:32,184
Okay, look right here...
And hold still, please.

42
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:34,917
What you don't see,
dear, is that someday

43
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,217
I'm going to be a wrinkled
old monster myself.

44
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:42,017
So today, we're going
to take this picture,

45
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:45,317
and I'll be able to remember
us all together, smiling...

46
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:48,651
No matter what,
we're always a family.

47
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,151
So even if you're scared...

48
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:52,784
don't try distancing
yourself from us.

49
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,651
And one other thing, too...

50
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:57,551
Stop calling yourself a
monster. It's not true.

51
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:01,117
Say cheese, everyone!

52
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,917
He's taking it... Smile, dear.

53
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:21,017
[Hohenheim] <i>My plan</i>

[Hohenheim yells, groans]

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,580
What were you doing?

63
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,214
[Hohenheim]
Fixing the swing.

64
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,480
When did you get so handy?

65
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:06,147
I haven't ever been able
to do much for the boys...

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,414
but I can at least do this.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,514
Trisha. I'm going away.
Wait here for me.

68
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,114
Okay.

69
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
Don't tell the children...

70
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,880
I don't want them
to know about my body.

71
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:28,480
Right... Sure you don't
want me to wake them?

72
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:32,247
I can't bear to
look at their faces.

73
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,314
Silly man... it's
okay for you to cry.

74
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,380
Uhh--

75
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,314
Oh! You two boys
are up early...

76
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,547
What're you doing out of bed?

77
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,680
Al said he had to go potty.

78
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:52,347
[Trisha] And of course his
big brother took care of him.

79
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,447

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,738
[Officer] Well?

84
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:14,881
It's no good... There's
still nothing coming through.

85
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,915
That's just great... So we're
cut off from all contact.

86
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:22,281
Your orders, sir...
What should we do now?

87
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:23,981
[Officer] There has to
be an exit somewhere

88
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,515
to dump out the rubble.

89
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:28,015
We'll keep going
a little farther...

90

Smith, go back and report.

91

[Raven] Would
you be interested

102
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,848
in a legion of
immortal soldiers?

103
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,848
He took the bait!

104
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:30,581
Never dying... or getting old.
You want it too, don't you?

[Raven] Hm?

107
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,181
Oh... it's just such
an incredible question,

I don't know what to say.

109
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:41,615
Well, are you
interested or not?

110
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,148
There're only two answers.

111
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:48,881
It is intriguing...
Can you tell me, General,

112
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,448
on the day when this
"dream" comes true...

113
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,615
will my men share in
this gift as well...

114
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,315
or is it only for me?

115
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,048
I can tell you
when the time comes.

116
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,081
[Olivier]
<i>Does that mean there are</i>

117
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,915
<i>no guarantees until then?</i>

<i>And if I refuse, I'll</i>

Excuse me.

Yes, what is it?

126
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,148
[Soldier 10]
I'm sorry to disturb you,

127
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,481
but the underground
tunnel advance team--

128
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,015
[Raven] What's this about
an underground tunnel?

129
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,481
Speak, soldier.

130
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:36,881
Yes, sir. Something's
happened to the advance team.

131
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:38,915
[Olivier] Very well,
I'll be right there.

132
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,015
[Raven] I'm coming, too.

133
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:42,481
Right... let's move.

134
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,515
Hold on a sec!

[Buccaneer] Hm?

137
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,448
It has to look convincing.

138
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,381
[Miles] Buccaneer,
what're you doing?

139
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,981
[Buccaneer]
Prisoner transfer, sir.

140
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,248
I'm moving the Elric brothers

141
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,315
from the east cells
to the west...

142
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:05,481
May I ask who this is?

143
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,415
This is Mr. Solf J. Kimblee.

144
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:10,015
He's General Raven's
honored guest.

145
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:13,915
[Ed] <i>Kimblee...</i>
<i>The Crimson Alchemist.</i>

146
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,215
Wait, did you say
the Elric Brothers?

147
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,615
You mean the
Fullmetal Alchemist?

148
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:23,281
I see. Now I understand
your nickname.

149
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:24,915
Oh... it's this one?

150
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:27,915
[Ed] <i>If one more person</i>
<i>makes that mistake...!</i>

151
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:29,215
Nice to meet you...

152
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:31,848
I've heard much about
the Fullmetal Alchemist.

153
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,248
Hello.

154
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:39,548
General...

155
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:40,515
[Olivier] What happened?

156
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,615
We lost all contact
with the advance team

157
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:44,615
that was sent down
to search the tunnel.

158
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:47,215
Shortly after,
Smith's horse returned.

159
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,081
It came back with what
we assume was his arm.

160
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,848
Just his arm?
Where's the rest?

161
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,248
It's still missing, sir.

162
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,281
And his horse
can't lead us back.

163
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:59,548
It's too terrified
to be of any use.

164
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,581
Henschel... get
a rescue party--

165
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:04,548
[Raven] I'm afraid you can't
do that, General Armstrong.

166
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:08,348
That tunnel is too dangerous.

167
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:10,148
What have you done with
the "immortal monster"

168
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,115
you were telling
me about earlier?

169
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,281
[Olivier sighs]

170
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,615
Put him back and seal the
tunnel's entrance... General.

171
00:11:18,648 --> 00:11:19,315
But there are still men--

172
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:22,548
I am speaking to the general.

173
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,448
See, I know northern law...

174
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,581
Obey strength...
and obey the power.

175
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,448
Isn't that the way it works?

176
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,115
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

177
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,724
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

178
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:44,806
I am General Raven,
from Central. I've heard

179
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:47,006
a great deal about you
from His Excellency.

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,940
Hello.

181
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,706
[Raven] It appears
you've been good boys

182
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,040
and kept your mouths shut.

183
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,006
[Ed] That was the agreement.

184
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,206
[Raven] You don't seem happy.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,206
[Ed] Oh no, I'm
absolutely thrilled.

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,006
Who wouldn't love to have
their friends taken hostage?

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,006
[Al] Um... Do you
think you could

188
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,240
release us from this cell soon?

189
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,573
The deal was, if we
didn't mess with you,

190
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:07,640
you would let us
continue our journey.

191
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:11,073
There's no need to worry.
I'll let you out of here soon.

192
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,573
[Ed] That tunnel...
is it part of whatever

193
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:17,206
you're planning, too?
If they find out...

194
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,273
Again, you don't need to worry.

195
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,606
I've already spoken
with the General.

196
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,106
She's going to put the
Homunculus back underground,

197
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,006
and seal up the
tunnel's opening.

198
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,006
[Ed and Al gasp]

199
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,273
General Armstrong's on
our side now, Fullmetal.

200
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,106
[Ed and Al breathe anxiously]

201
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:36,273
General! Aren't
we going to go in

202
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,640
and search for
the missing team?

203
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,873
[Olivier] Quiet, Henschel.

204
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,740
We can't just abandon
them down there!

205
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:41,973
They still may need our help!

206
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,140
[Olivier] I said, be quiet!

207
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,606
[Henschel grunts]

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,606
Be quiet and obey.

209
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,106
[Henschel sighs]

210
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,640
[Kimblee] Obey the one
who holds the power.

211
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:55,840
They call her "the impregnable
northern wall of Briggs"...

212
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:58,173
but even she
yields to authority...

213
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:01,006
Well, that certainly is
the wisest approach.

214
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,806
[Miles] Hmm.

215
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh... so that's the monster.

216
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,740
Ngghhh...

217
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,006
[worried chatter]

218
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,740
Well, Good morning, Sloth.
Did you have a good rest?

219
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:23,940
Who're you? I'm still sleepy.

220
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,240
You'd best wake up...

221
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,606
There's still a lot of
work to be done here...

222
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,006
Pride explained it to
you, now didn't he?

223
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,140
Eh? I guess...

224
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:40,306
What a pain... oh, well...
I have no choice. Mmm...

225
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:48,040
Such a pain... but I forget,
why is it a pain, again?

226
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:51,140
Too much of a
pain to remember.

227
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,806
[Sloth sighs]

228
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:57,906
[Raven] Not to worry.

229
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,673
He's a chimera doing some
work for the Central forces.

230
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,340
He's helping to
make this country

231
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,873
even greater
than it already is.

232
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:10,006
Of course, it's still a
top-secret operation.

233
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,573
So, close this hole
and guard our secret...

234
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,106
I'm counting on
you, soldiers...

235
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,640
It's people like you who
make this country what it is.

236
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:27,606
[fire crackles]

237
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,006
Hmm...

238
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,073
[Marcoh] All the
important parts

239
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,306
are written in
ancient Ishvalan...

240
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,740
There's no way I can read it.

241
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,873
Does that mean we give up?

242
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,606
[Marcoh] If Scar
were here, he might

243
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,673
be able to read it.
He was an Ishvalan monk,

244
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:45,573
so he might know
their ancient writing.

245
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,273
[May sighs]

246
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:51,973
Where is he? Could something
bad have happened to him?

247
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,006
[Soldier 11]
We found her!

248
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,006
The girl with the
black-and-white cat.

249
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,906
[Soldier 12]
Right... let's go!

250
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
[Soldier 11] Uhh!

251
00:15:00,973 --> 00:15:02,840
[Soldier 12] Huh? Gah!

252
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:09,906
[Marcoh and May
exhale happily]

253
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,906
[May] Mr. Scar! Mr. Yoki!

254
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,673
Did you find the
research notes?

255
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,573
Mm, yeah! They're right here!

256
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:18,340
[Scar] We need to relocate...

257
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:21,906
The Briggs soldiers
know where we are. Move.

258
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,240
You see, General?
We are the chosen ones,

259
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:33,140
and we will receive immortal,
near-godly bodies...

260
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,940
We'll rule the entire world.

261
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,906
The name was Smith, wasn't it?

262
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,106
There was nothing we could
have done to save them.

263
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,006
Those who aren't chosen...

264
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,240
will they be sacrificed
for those who are?

265
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:48,073
Yes... The survival
of the fittest...

266
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:50,840
The weak will become the
foundation of the country...

267
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:54,006
and the strong will take
their rightful place on top.

268
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,006
Is that what happened in Ishval?

269
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,973
Indeed...they were
part of the plan...

270
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,806
They were weak and
deserved to perish

271
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,173
for the good of their betters.

272
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,273
[Kimblee] Is that right?

273
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:11,273
No, I'll take care
of it... Okay.

274
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,906
Sorry to keep you waiting.

275
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,906
[Miles] You seem to be making
rather frequent phone calls.

276
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,740
[Kimblee] Can you tell me
where General Raven is?

277
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:25,640
I need to speak with him.

278
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,106
[Kimblee] Hmm?

279
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,773
You were seriously
injured and near death...

280
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:33,640
and then the same
day you show up here,

281
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:37,240
totally recovered... What
sort of magic can do that?

282
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:40,006
That information is
none of your business.

283
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,906
Another thing:
you were imprisoned

284
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,873
for killing officers...
Why would they release you?

285
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:49,006
Do I have to say it again?
It's none of your business.

286
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,714
[Olivier] When did
all of this begin?

287
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,781
From what I hear, when the
country was first founded...

288
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:01,747
And now, my generation shall
preside over its completion...

289
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:03,747
I'm grateful for
your assistance...

290
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,981
You're a true servant
to your country.

291
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:10,014
I'll speak with my superiors
about preparing a seat for you.

292
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,014
Hm. There's no need.

293
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,647
What's that?

294
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,981
[Raven screams]

295
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:18,347
[several gasps]

296
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,614
[Olivier] Which arm
did Smith lose

297
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,414
in the tunnel?
The left or right?

298
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,347
Wait! What are you--?!

299
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,014
Growing old is truly
terrifying, isn't it?

300
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,981
You would know, General...
Before you became so afraid

301
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,681
of your own mortality,
I'm sure long ago

302
00:17:32,714 --> 00:17:34,647
you had an earnest
love for your country.

303
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,381
You... You can't!

304
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:39,481
You were going to be
one of the chosen ones!

305
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:40,881
You would have been one of us!

306
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,814
I don't need a
new seat from you.

307
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:45,014
You're going to lose
the one your moldy ass

308
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,914
has clung to for too long...
right about now, Raven!

309
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:52,014
You old traitor!

310
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:56,881
[Raven screams]

311
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:04,347
But, immortality... was
right before... our eyes.

312
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,881
General... You are among
the weak who will become

313
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:10,447
the foundation for this
country... Literally.

314
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:13,847
I was going to...
to be immort--

315
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:16,947
Now that that's done...

316
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,681
get in touch with Major Miles.

317
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:19,514
Sir!

318
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:21,681
The rest of you,
we have work to do!

319
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:22,881
General...

320
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:25,014
[Olivier] Hmph.

321
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,547
I want that concrete
nice and level.

322
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,914
[Workers] Right!

323
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:32,647
[Kimblee] You're not a
fan of me, are you Major?

324
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:34,714
Is it because I was
a State Alchemist,

325
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,614
one of the ones who served

326
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,647
in the Ishvalan War
of Extermination?

327
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,881
What information can I give
you to make you happier?

328
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,481
Do you want to
know about the war?

329
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,347
About how your
countrymen died in it?

330
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,414
Shut your mouth, Kimblee.

331
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,381
What, you don't
want me to tell you?

332
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:51,747
I said to shut up!

333
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:54,447
Major, may I have
a moment with you?

334
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,647
[Soldier 13] I have a message
for you from the general.

335
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,747
She says, "Operation complete.
No need to buy more time."

336
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:06,747
Roger that.

337
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,014
[Miles] I'm just
glad I'm not stuck

338
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,881
talking to that guy anymore.

339
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:13,947
I don't know how much
longer I could've lasted.

340
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,714
Kimblee.

341
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,614
Apparently nobody
can find General Raven.

342
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,814
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone off to?

343
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,614
The general's missing?

344
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,747
Seems like it...
This is a fort,

345
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,014
but that doesn't mean
it's safe enough

346
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,514
for an outsider to
be wandering around.

347
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:32,514
If anything happens
to the general--

348
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,581
[Kimblee] I, for one,
would welcome it.

349
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:35,947
If anything bad should happen

350
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,081
to General Raven,
then I have permission

351
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:40,747
to act in whatever
way that I see fit...

352
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,681
That decision came down
from the Fuhrer himself.

353
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:44,681
[Miles grunts]

354
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,814
Now, perhaps you could
provide me with a car

355
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,014
to drive me down the mountain.

356
00:19:50,114 --> 00:19:51,947
You should act quickly...

357
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:54,581
It's in your best
interest, I promise...

358
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:55,514
Right now, orders from me

359
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,781
are tantamount to
orders from the Fuhrer.

360
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,947
[Miles grunts]

361
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,547
[Henschel] Please wait,
General Armstrong!

362
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:06,681
We have to search for Smith and
the others before we seal it!

363
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:10,547
Fullmetal saw this coming...

364
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,647
So he made us this secret
passage into the tunnel.

365
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,514
Ah!

366
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:18,814
She killed him?!

367
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,481
[Al] General Raven?!

368
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,347
Yep, and that was all I
was ordered to tell you.

369
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,947
[Ed] Hey, wait a minute!
When're you guys

370
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,047
gonna let us out of
this damn place?

371
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,947
[Neil] Who knows? Take
it up with the general.

372
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,747
Dammit!

373
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:34,347
[Al] Getting angry
won't do any good, Ed...

374
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,881
We should just rest for now.

375
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:38,947
I can't just sit around
while all this is going on...

376
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,614
I need to do something!

377
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:42,947
[Al] Uh?

378
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:48,414
Hi. Afternoon, boys...
I was hoping that I might

379
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,714
have a word with the
Fullmetal Alchemist?

380
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,381
[Ed sighs]

381
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,514
Oh, don't tell me that
you have some reason

382
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:57,614
to dislike me, too.
You should be grateful.

383
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,747
I brought a visitor
with me to see you.

384
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,514
A visitor?

385
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,814
[Ed and Al gasp]

386
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,047
Winry?!

387
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,914
Why did you come here?!

388
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:10,614
Why?! Why do you think?!

389
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:13,781
You have to adjust your automail
for the north, don't you?!

390
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,081
And just what are you
doing in that cell?

391
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:17,881
We didn't ask you to come here!

392
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:20,881
What's with you?! I was
worried about you, idiot!

393
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,347
Someone from the military
contacted me, so I came--

394
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,747
The military?

395
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:27,014
Don't be so hard
on her, you two...

396
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:29,047
The Fuhrer was
concerned about you...

397
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,647
He wanted to make sure
you were taken care of.

398
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,514
[Ed and Al grunt]

399
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,481
[Mustang] Kimblee?

400
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,414
Yes. I heard about it
from a friend of mine

401
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,781
who's working as
a nurse at the base

402
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,914
of the mountain. She
said he was admitted

403
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,647
with serious injuries,
but after General Raven

404
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:18,414
came to visit, he
recovered right away.

405
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,614
[Mustang] Raven and Kimblee.

406
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:25,081
That's all the
information I have for now.

407
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:29,547
Thanks a lot. Tell me
if you hear anything else.

408
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:32,047
It was really nice seeing you!

409
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,714
[Older woman] Nice?
That's not much to go on.

410
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:40,947
A bouquet of flowers
might help you next time.

411
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:45,047
Eh, I'm better off without
her... But thanks anyway.

412
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,414
[Older woman]
When one woman leaves you,

413
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:49,047
another may find you.

414
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,781
I have a message for you
from Olivier Mira Armstrong.

415
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:55,281
Colonel Roy Mustang, right?

416
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:00,847
Hm. I'll take every flower
you have in that cart.

417
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:06,514
