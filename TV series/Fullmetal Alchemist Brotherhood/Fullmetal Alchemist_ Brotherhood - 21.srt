1
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:02,895
You're an idiot!

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:07,023
It's bad enough you believed
her, but then you gave up?

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,990
Please forgive me, Colonel.

4
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:10,418
You've gotta stay strong..

5
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:12,551
And don't you ever
give up on living..

6
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:17,418
I need to know you can keep your
cool no matter what happens.

7
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,418
Sir.

8
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,385
I'm gonna continue to rely
on you to watch my back.

9
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:23,618
Don't let me down...

10
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,385
[Havoc] Ya oughta think about
takin' your own advice, Colonel.

11
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:28,851
Since You were the one
who abandoned his post.

12
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,018
Hey, shut up, Havoc!

13
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,885
[groans]

14
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:34,385
And what the hell?..

15
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:36,385
Why are we even in
the same room?..

16
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:39,551
At my rank.. I should have my
own room with a hot nurse.

17
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:41,651
Try to understand, sir..

18
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,951
It's easier to guard the two
of you in the same place.

19
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,585
Which reminds me..

20
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:48,618
Why haven't they tried
to kill us yet?

21
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,951
[Envy] What's wrong with you?!

22
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,851
How could you let that bastard
go after what he did?!..

23
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,885
You should've yanked his
spine out of his mouth!

24
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,851
Lust.. he killed Lust.

25
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,918
It's not too late to kill him..
So get to it!

26
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,485
We can use Mustang..

27
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,618
He's worthless if we
kill him however.

28
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,651
[Envy] Use him?.. Hold on..

29
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,951
You mean the portal?

30
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,018
[Bradley chuckles] You don't
need to worry about it..

31
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:15,618
And forget Mustang.

32
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,651
Father wants me to handle him.

33
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,164
[Al] What if I've
started to rot?

34
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,397
[Winry] Huh?
[Ed] Huh?

35
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,131
I doubt that my body's
getting any nutrients..

36
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,997
Or any sleep either..

37
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,164
So even if we get it
back from over there..

38
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,997
[Al] Brother!.. Winry!

39
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,764
[horrified screams]

40
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,831
[gasp] Is he right, Ed?

41
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:12,997
[sigh]

42
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,964
Now this is just a hypothesis..

43
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,864
But I was thinking about
the transmutation

44
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,864
and trying to retrace
our processs..

45
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:20,864
You remember how we mixed
our blood to create

46
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:22,997
a blueprint for Mom's soul?

47
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:24,197
[Al] Yeah.

48
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,931
[Ed] Well.. Right after that we
passed through the portal..

49
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:29,231
Where we were both
deconstructed.

50
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:31,997
It's a slim chance..

51
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:34,131
but I think it's possible our
spirits might have gotten

52
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,631
tangled up in the process.

53
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,297
[Al] What are you saying?

54
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:40,731
I'm trying to explain
that our bodies might

55
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,731
be connected somehow
even though I'm here

56
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,397
and your body's over there.

57
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:50,264
See.. that might actually
explain why I'm so sho..

58
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,997
sho..

59
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,131
Short.

60
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:54,431
He admitted it!

61
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,397
[Al] He's starting to face
reality!

62
00:03:56,431 --> 00:04:00,097
So.. You think you've been
supplying all the nutrients

63
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,397
for Al's body too?

64
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:03,931
That seems a little
far-fetched.

65
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,964
Well what's your explanation?

66
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,731
You don't grow because you
refuse to drink your milk.

67
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,697
Don't start with that again!

68
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:11,964
[Winry] Well it's true.

69
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,964
[Al] It seems like Brother
is always sleeping..

70
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,964
I wonder if his body could be
resting for mine as well?

71
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,231
[Winry] Not until you start
drinking it! You have to!

72
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,731
[Ed] It's not gonna happen!..
[Winry] Drink it, Ed!

73
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,231
[Ed] No!
[Winry] Fine, stay a runt!

74
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,064
[Ed] I'm not a runt!

75
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,397
[Al giggling] I hope so, at
least.

76
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,264
[Ed] Never!

77
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,264
[Winry] I'll make you!
[Ed] Just try!

78
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,697
[birds chirping]

79
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:30,564
[Fuery] Are you here to
visit the Colonel?

80
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:33,231
[Al] Mr. Havoc is
recovering, too..

81
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,197
We figured we should
pay our respects.

82
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,931
I definitely owe it
to the Colonel..

83
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:39,097
He saved me right at
the last second.

84
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,897
Are you also dropping
by for a visit?

85
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,931
And bringing a little present.

86
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,764
[Hawkeye] I counted the number
of steps it took to get

87
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,931
to the basement under
the third laboratory..

88
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:54,264
And I was able to calculate
the approximate location

89
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,331
of that doorway.

90
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,864
It's not exact since
the hallway curved..

91
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,864
but I was able to
deduce a radius

92
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:02,897
with the lab at the center.

93
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,897
That's Central Command.. But
this is even more alarming.

94
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,897
[Al] It's the presidential
estate..

95
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,831
Right above where we
found the Homunculi.

96
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:15,897
[Roy] Which means that there's
a very real possibility

97
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:19,764
the Fuhrer is connected
to them.

98
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,397
[Al] But that doesn't
make sense..

99
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,897
Why did he kill Greed
and his group

100
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,164
if he's connected to them?

101
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:27,297
It's strange he killed
them anyway..

102
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:30,764
Why would he slaughter them
before interrogating them?

103
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,764
It's strange alright..
Damn inscrutable.

104
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:36,864
One thing's for sure,

105
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,397
the enemy's infiltrated
high up the command..

106
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,864
So extreme caution is
necessary at all times.

107
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,164
And Fullmetal?..
Watch yourself.

108
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,031
[Roy] The Fuhrer working
with the Homunculi.

109
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,897
This could be bigger than
I ever dreamed.

110
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,864
I'm starting to worry
that it's too big.

111
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:02,731
[Roy] All the more reason
to pursue it.

112
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:05,797
So.. I hope you're ready to work
yourselves ragged.

113
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:08,131
Uhhhh, yeah, about
that, Colonel?..

114
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,331
I think you're gonna haveta'
count me out.

115
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,131
[sighs]

116
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,797
Your work requires legs..
and I can't feel mine.

117
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,864
[shocked breath]

118
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:22,031
[Havoc] I hate to say
it.. but I'm retired.

119
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,397
Hello.

120
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,864
Hey.. What brings you down here?

121
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:35,197
Back problems..

122
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,731
My spine can't stand all
the standing that comes

123
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,764
with being coroner.

124
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,864
I got a sinking feeling
when I heard

125
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,831
you were the person that
scorched that thing..

126
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,831
Are you plotting something?

127
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:51,864
You suspect a plot but you
still ID'ed the "thing" as

128
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:55,097
Maria Ross. Three cheers for
old war buddies, huh?

129
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:59,831
Old war buddies my butt..
More like accomplices.

130
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,831
You'd incinerate 'em and
I'd dissect what's left..

131
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:05,297
We treated them like rats
and Ishval was the lab.

132
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,097
I know you like to
play with fire,

133
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,731
but someone'll get burnt if
you push this too far.

134
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:17,764
You should've warned me earlier.

135
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:21,831
Did somebody get injured?

136
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:25,097
One of my men.

137
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,364
He was paralyzed. From
the waist down.

138
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:38,831
Damn. They only let me smoke
one of these a day,

139
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,864
and I go and waste it.

140
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,664
Jeez.. Ya know, I thought I'd
retire because of a woman,

141
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,697
but not like this.

142
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,264
So what happens next?

143
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:56,164
My family owns a grocery store..
And I can at least take calls.

144
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,197
Isn't automail an option?

145
00:07:58,797 --> 00:07:59,864
[Havoc sighs]

146
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,264
The nerves in my lower spine
are completely severed

147
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,764
and they can't make
those out of steel.

148
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:06,764
[Breda] Tsk.

149
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,797
The retired life doesn't
suit you.

150
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:15,297
[Breda] Colonel.

151
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,797
Hmm.

152
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,764
There's still hope for Havoc.

153
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:20,797
Fullmetal passed this onto me,

154
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,731
[Roy] Doctor Marcoh, huh?..

155
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:26,997
A medical alchemist
in possession of a..

156
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:29,697
Philosopher's Stone?

157
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,731
Well, sir?.. Should I find him?

158
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:34,164
Permission granted.

159
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,197

Easy.. I told them I was
a State Alchemist

no questions asked.

[Al] Did you find the basement?

There wasn't one.

Uh?!

But I did find a trace of
some hasty alchemy.

181
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,164
It was stupid of us to think
that they wouldn't

seal up the entrance.

183

[Al] I guess so.. Where else
are we gonna find

get down there?

I'm not sure.. Remember
how they told me

I was their sacrifice and
they needed me alive?

[Al] They told me
the same thing.

188

Lust told me that when she found
out I opened the portal.

189
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,964
Well there's one piece
of the puzzle..

190
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,797
They're looking for alchemists
that managed to open the portal

191
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,131
and make it back out alive.

192
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:56,231
But the real question is why
they wanna sacrifice us..

193
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,264
So.. We'll haveta beat
an answer out of 'em.

All confirmed as State
Alchemists.

According to eyewitness reports,
he is described as an Ishvalan

on his forehead.

include a tattoo on
his right arm.

I don't know for certain but
that's the way it looks.

Of course not, Al.

216

I couldn't stand to be the one
to make her cry again.

[Al] Neither could I.

218
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:10,151
It's the last thing I wanna do,
but we have to confront Scar.

219

To find out if he did it?

220

Well that is one reason.. But
there's another.

We're gonna lure out

Uh!

223
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:22,051
They need us alive for their
sacrifice, don't they?

224
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,051
So I doubt they're willing
to just stand by

225

while Scar kills us.

us apart the last time.
