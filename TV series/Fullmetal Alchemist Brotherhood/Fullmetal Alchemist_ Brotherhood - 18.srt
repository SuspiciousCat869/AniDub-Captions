1
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,174
[Attendant] Resembool! This
stop, Resembool Station!

2
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:44,462
[Ed] Are you ever gonna
tell me what's going on?

3
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,095
This is starting to
feel a little too much

4
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:47,828
like a kidnapping.

5
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:50,795
I haven't been fully
informed on the details..

6
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:55,362
My only orders were to retrieve
you and to rendezvous here.

7
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:58,195
Rendezvous?
With who?

8
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:03,228
I'm glad you made it alright,
Major Armstrong, sir!

9
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:05,562
Heyyy. S'up, big guy?

10
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:08,028
Lieutenant Breda?!

11
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:13,528
[Al] This is weird...

12
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:17,362
Brother should have arrived
in Resembool by now.

13
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,228
So why hasn't he called?

14
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:22,562
Not to mention that he's got
me here to do his repairs.

15
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,962
And this stuff with
Lieutenant Ross,

16
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,128
I have no idea
what's going on.

17
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:29,195
[Ling] Good thing
I can explain it all.

18
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:30,495
Hmm?

19
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:32,428
Huh?

20
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,295
[Al and Winry scream]

21
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,228
Uh.. When'd you get here?

22
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,862
And how'd you even get in?!

23
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,928
The window.

24
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,995
I mean.. It seemed
appropriate for a criminal.

25
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:49,495
First.. There's no need for you
to worry about Ed's well being.

26
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:50,395
Huh?

27
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:52,262
I'm sure he's
just fine.

28
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,395
Hot.

29
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:02,862
Colonel never said we'd
be crossing the border..

30
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,962
Tight-lipped bastard.

31
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:08,362
Mr. Han.. How much
further do we have left?

32
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:13,228
We've almost made it. Look...
You can see the ruins ahead.

33
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:30,562
My automail almost
seared through my skin.

34
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:33,162
Who's idea was it
to bring the kid?

35
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:35,428
It was a direct order.

36
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:41,128
So this is Xerxes, huh?

37
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:43,228
Looks just like
the fable described it.

38
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,928
Did you say a fable?

39
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,062
Yeah, the Eastern Sage.

40
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,528
It's a story about the origin
of alchemy in Amestris.

41
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,962
It claims the entire
kingdom of Xerxes

42
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,428
was destroyed in a single
night.. And that the only

43
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:59,028
survivor wandered into
Amestris shortly afterwards..

44
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:02,895
He was the one who went on to
spread the science of Alchemy.

45
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:05,995
How interesting.. We have
a similar legend in Xing

46
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:08,095
about a drifter from the west..

47
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,795
It's said that his teachings
were combined with our

48
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:14,495
ancient techniques to form the
alkahestry we practice today.

49
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:18,062
And alkahestry's primarily used
for medical needs.. isn't it?

50
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:24,195
Yes. He guided this process..
And we greatly revere him.

51
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,462
We know him as
the Western Sage.

52
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:29,295
[Lt. Breda] So the
'west' in his title

53
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:31,062
is supposed to refer to here?

54
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,095
[Fu] It is believed so, yes.

55
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,862
[Lt. Breda] Hmm...

56
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:38,162
I wanted to visit the ruins of
Xerxes. That route goes by them.

57
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,395
<i>Sure ya did, Ling.</i>
<i>And now I know why.</i>

58
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:45,928
[Lt. Breda] But if Xerxes was
such a highly advanced society,

59
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,262
how were they wiped out
in a single night?

60
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:51,128
[Fu] It could very well
just be a legend.

61
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:04,462
[Fu] What are you
gawking at?! C'mon!

62
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,828
[bird crows]

63
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:24,795
We're goin' in pretty
deep now, aren't we?

64
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,228
[Lt. Ross] Edward!

65
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,762
Hmm?

66
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:35,428
<i>[Mustang] Back east, where</i>
<i>I was... It's a nice place.</i>

67
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:40,295
<i>None of the big city noise...</i>
<i>and lots of beautiful women.</i>

68
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,028
That damn colonel!

69
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:49,562
Ho-ho-ho! Lieutenant Ross!

70
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,295
Thank the heavens! My heart's
been congested with grief!

71
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,528
No hugs, Major!

72
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,495
There really wasn't anyplace
in Amestris we could safely hide

73
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,528
a dead girl.. Especially one
that's still alive, you know?

74
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:02,928
So the Colonel knew
that Lieutenant Ross

75
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,528
was innocent all along?

76
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,762
[Armstrong] Oh, come here!

77
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,962
[Lt. Breda] This seems
a little too showy, sir.

78
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,428
[Mustang] Is that
what you think?

79
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:16,995
Yeah... They make a point
of arresting her in public,

80
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,995
and now they announce her
guilt to the newspapers,

81
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:22,362
before she's even had a
trial? Somethin's not right.

82
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:28,795
I'm here.

83
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,262
Warrant Officer
Falman is calling

84
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:31,562
on a public line for you.

85
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,362
I'll take it.

86
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,095
[Falmon] Colonel, we
need to speak to you

87
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,395
about General Hughes murder.

88
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,528
[66] Hey, Falman! Gimme
the phone for a sec.

89
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:40,262
<i>Barry?!</i>

90
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,995
Yo, Mustang! You seen
today's paper?

91
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,395
'Cuz there's an
interesting article on--

92
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:48,028
Heyyy, Bunny! You know better
than to call me at work!

93
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,995
Let me call you right back!
Just hang on, okay?

94
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,995
[Mustang] Really?
You sure about this?

95
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,528
[66] Oh, yeah... The lieutenant
fired a bullet alright..

96
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:01,028
but it was at me, not
Hughes. I've still got

97
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:04,395
a hole in my right hand
where it passed right through.

98
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:07,228
Well that changes things.

99
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:11,162
Barry.. I've got a proposition
that you might like.

100
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:17,362
[66 laughs] Gotcha.
I promise not to kill anyone...

101
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,995
How 'bout second street
in the warehouse district?

102
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,262
Huh?

103
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,928
I need you to gather
everything on this list...

104
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:29,295
On the double, okay?

105
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:34,228
Sixty pounds of pork, carbon,
some ammonia... What is this?

106
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,528
The ingredients for
a well-cooked corpse.

107
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,528
Human transmutation!

108
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:41,262
Of course not.. I'm just
gonna whip up something

109
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,362
that looks like a human corpse.

110
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:46,328
But wait, what about
when they do the autopsy?

111
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:49,328
Trust me, it'll be too
charred for them to ID it.

112
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:52,562
That won't stop 'em from
checking the dental records.

113
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:55,562
I've got it
under control.

114
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:58,162
Think you can
pull it off?

115
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:05,262
I'm not claiming to be an
expert on human anatomy...

116
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:09,395
...but I've got plenty of
experience burning corpses.

117
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:11,362
[Mustang] Let's go.

118
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:19,762
You're Maria Ross, correct?

119
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:26,395
[Mustang] It's a dummy.

120
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,962
From this point
on, you're dead.

121
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,528
Snap out of it.

122
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,062
Huh?

123
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,495
[Havoc] Shhhh.

124
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:54,895
Huh?

125
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,195
Hey there... Fullmetal.

126
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:07,395
[Ed] What happened here,
Colonel? Tell me!

127
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:10,428
What? Is that
the Fullmetal kid?

128
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:14,028
Oh, man... we didn't
plan on this one.

129
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,395
Edward's here?

130
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,128
Yeah, but I'm
sure the Colonel

131
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:21,195
will come up with
something... Come on.

132
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,962
[Lt. Ross] Right.

133
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,895
[Fu] After Madam Ross
was prematurely freed,

134
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:30,962
the young lord made a deal
with Barry the Chopper.

135
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:33,328
The orders I've been given
are to personally escort

136
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:36,295
this woman to the
east to take refuge.

137
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,428
[Lt. Breda] So we all
agreed to rendezvous here,

138
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,328
in one big effort to aid
the lieutenant's escape.

139
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,462
I see.

140
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,028
You've gotta be joking.

141
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,428
I can't believe the Colonel

142
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:49,295
was able to pull one
over on us like this.

143
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,195
He knew it'd be easier
to convince you

144
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:54,828
if you actually saw
Lieutenant Ross.

145
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,062
Fine, I'll admit it, alright?

146
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,528
He actually knew what
he was doing this time.

147
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:02,095
He mentioned
something else.

148
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:05,095
He said he didn't want to take a
chance on some hot-tempered kid

149
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:08,062
endangering the operation...
so he sent you out here.

150
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,828
Hot-tempered kiiiiiddd?!

151
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,562
You said operation...

152
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,462
Is there a phase beyond
liberating Lieutenant Ross?

153
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:18,528
Indeed. He's got a plan
to reel in the puppeteer...

154
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,128
the one that's behind
the conspiracy.

155
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,795
No one calls me a--
Wait, what'd you say?

156
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:27,528
You remember Barry from
the Fifth Lab, right?

157
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:30,062
He went on one
hell of a rampage.

158
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,028
They're bound to send
someone to reclaim him.

159
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,262
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

160
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:44,744
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

161
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,411
[Al] So Lieutenant
Ross is innocent!

162
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:51,119
[Winry] But why take Ed?
The Colonel was just

163
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,553
trying to keep him out
of his hair, wasn't he?

164
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,086
Ha, you got it.

165
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,986
So, I struck up a deal with
Barry to help him out

166
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,019
with the jailbreak in
exchange for the secret

167
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:04,653
to his immortality..
But of course...

168
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,819
The science guys that put me
in this body are all dead

169
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,519
and it's not like I
know how they did it.

170
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,886
[Ling] Whhaat?
That's not fair!

171
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,053
Y'know what? You should
ask that Alphonse kid.

172
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,119
He's also just a soul
glued to metal.

173
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:21,219
So here I am.. You're supposed
to tell me your secret..

174
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:24,053
And I was promised
you'd tell me.

175
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,553
Yeah, but.. I
don't exactly see

176
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,019
how I have anything
to do with it.

177
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:32,019
I've got nothing to do
with this.. zilch..

178
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:34,953
And yet here I am,
stuck in the middle of it..

179
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,786
And framed by Homunculi.

180
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,953
[Lt. Breda] We've collected
a fair amount of intelligence.

181
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,219
And once we properly
piece it together

182
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,219
we'll have the
general's killer.

183
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,586
I promise you this,
Lieutenant..

184
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,153
we will absolve
you of this crime!

185
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:58,819
Lieutenant Col--
I mean General Hughes...

186
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,753
It's just hard to accept
that he's dead.

187
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:05,986
And what shall you do
now, Edward Elric?

188
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:11,553
You boys just have to
keep moving forward...

189
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,686
In any way you can.

190
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,686
Al and I committed a taboo..

191
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:21,086
but we still have
people that help us.

192
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:26,119
Some people get angry at us..
And others support us silently.

193
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,053
Each one of them
has tried to help me

194
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:30,819
keep my promise
to my brother.

195
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:35,586
So I have no choice..
I can't turn back.

196
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:39,486
Which means, all I <i>can</i> do
is move forward, right?

197
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,786
And I'll protect everyone
I can along the way.

198
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,953
I refuse to let another
person become a victim..

199
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:49,019
Not while I'm alive.

200
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,519
I know that's a hard
promise to keep..

201
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:56,853
It's hard enough just trying
to take care of myself.

202
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:59,553
And to think that I'm
even capable of it..

203
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,686
Maybe I'm just arrogant.

204
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:05,119
But.. It's the only
thing I can think of..

205
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:09,086
So I have to do
it... I have to.

206
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,886
And you Lieutenant? Where
do you intend to seek asylum?

207
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,186
Well.. I think that I'm
gonna give Xing a shot.

208
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:34,119
Any parting wishes?
Shall I tell your parents?

209
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,686
No, sir.. As much as I want
them to know I'm okay,

210
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,686
I'm scared it would be
too much of a risk...

211
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:44,686
I just don't want to put
them in that kind of danger.

212
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,586
Very well.

213
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,719
[Lt. Ross] Major Armstrong..
Lieutenant Breda.

214
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:53,186
Please deliver a message
to the Colonel..

215
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,986
I need him to know how grateful
I am for what he's done.

216
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,853
If there's any way
I can help him,

217
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:00,819
tell him to send for me...
I owe him a great debt,

218
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:03,719
and I am willing to put my
life on the line to repay it.

219
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,686
Right.

220
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:14,219
Goodbye, Edward..
Take care of yourself, okay?

221
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,553
I still owe you..
for slapping me, that is.

222
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,886
You can get me next time.

223
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:31,186
Alright.. next time then.

224
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:36,019
[Fu] You're blessed
to have such good allies.

225
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:39,719
Mr. Fu..? Tell me,
what's Xing like?

226
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,019
It's a country steeped
in a rich culture

227
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,519
and the people are
hardworking and honest..

228
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:47,119
I'm certain you'll
feel at home there.

229
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,219
So I can expect
to find a paradise

230
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:52,019
on the other side
of this desert?

231
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:56,653
Yes.. Although, I can assure
you the trek across this desert

232
00:14:56,686 --> 00:15:00,619
is severe.. You'll
need to be careful.

233
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:04,753
I recommend preserving your
fluids from this point on.

234
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:08,686
[Mustang laughs] How 'bout
I swing by the shop...

235
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,786
Sometime tomorrow?
And if you ask me nicely,

236
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:12,986
I'll bring a gift...

237
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,686
[Hawkeye] Huh? I'm
sorry, hold on, Roy..

238
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,253
Hey, Kate? We have a customer.

239
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,253
Could you please
let Jacqueline know?

240
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,219
[Fuery] Jacqueline?
We have a customer.

241
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,119
[Havoc] Copy that.

242
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,586
Hold on!

243
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,819
Barry?!

244
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:41,219
Try and relax, Falman..

245
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:44,219
We want this one alive,
so don't kill him!

246
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,853
Smells like an
ashtray.. Jean Havoc?!

247
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,886
Falman! Don't you think
I'm wearing this mask

248
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,686
for a reason?! Man, I can't
stand working with amateurs.

249
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,553
Sorry about that!

250
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,653
[Havoc] Yeah, and I'm sorry
that you got dragged into this.

251
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,086
Just don't do anything
that would give away

252
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,986
your involvement. They could
be watching us from anywhere.

253
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,753
[growls]

254
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,219
Heyyy...

255
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,219
Take it outside!

256
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,886
Uh, yeah.

257
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:34,753
But isn't there a good chance
the enemy's waiting outside?

258
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,486
We'll be safer there.

259
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,819
[growls]

260
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,786
Aw, dammit!

261
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:49,986
Lieutenant!

262
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,119
Ahh!

263
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,686
Told you it was safer..

264
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,853
We've got the hawk's eyes
watching over us out here.

265
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,953
[Mustang] I heard a loud
noise. What happened?

266
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,219
[Hawkeye] It was nothing.

267
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,819
A customer was getting
fresh with Jacqueline..

268
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,519
So I slapped him
around a little bit.

269
00:17:14,553 --> 00:17:15,953
Oh, yeah?

270
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:18,519
[Mustang] You don't
mess around, Elizabeth.

271
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,561
Alright, don't even
think of moving.

272
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:27,494
I've got a few questions
for ya. Wait a minute..

273
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,594
I don't think he knows
what I'm saying.

274
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:33,594
No way.. I thought
this guy looked familiar.

275
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:36,094
That's my old human body!

276
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,461
What?! Are you sure?

277
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:40,694
Those sick bastards
must've dumped the soul

278
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,061
of some feral lab
animal into my body..

279
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:47,594
And it came to find me because
it wants its real soul back.

280
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:50,528
[66 laughs] Talk
about memories!

281
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,194
I haven't even
seen this guy

282
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,528
since the day my soul
got yanked out of him.

283
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,965
[Ed] I thought so.

284
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,932
It's like that transmutation
circle from the Fifth Lab.

285
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:10,465
A two-headed dragon...
And the sun.

286
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:14,765
Ah, dammit! Why does the top
part have to be missing?!

287
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,732
Whadda ya want? I don't
have any money, so you've--

288
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:27,299
You're an Ishvalan?!

289
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,399
'Scuse me, young man..

290
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:36,599
I'm afraid that we're gonna
have to take you hostage

291
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,565
until your military returns
our holy land to us.

292
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,799
They're not gonna return
squat.. Not over a single kid.

293
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,032
It was the death of a single
child that triggered

294
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,365
the entire Ishvalan civil
war.. So you really shouldn't

295
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:52,465
doubt your significance
in the eyes of history.

296
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,999
[Shan] That's enough
of your shameful behavior.

297
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,465
[Leader] Madam Shan!

298
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,465
Look at you fools..

299
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:05,665
Are you all trying to
dishonor the name of Ishvala?

300
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,999
Look, he won't try
to attack you again..

301
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:10,832
Can you please just
let him go now?

302
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:16,699
You stood up for me..
I don't get it.

303
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,565
I always heard that you
guys hated Amestrians.

304
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,865
Despite the atrocities your
country has committed,

305
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,032
I know that not all
Amestrians are bad.

306
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,565
Madam Shan and I were both
injured during the civil war..

307
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,999
But then we were saved by
these two Amestrian doctors..

308
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:39,432
To be honest.. I do hate you..
But the two of them saved me..

309
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,632
And you deserve
the same treatment.

310
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,399
Wait a minute..

311
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,565
You're not talking about
the Rockbells, are you?

312
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,332
Are you saying you were
a friend of Dr. Rockbell?

313
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,932
Uh.. yeah.

314
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,565
They saved the lives
of countless Ishvalans..

315
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,399
All throughout the course
of the entire war.

316
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,799
No kidding.

317
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:04,532
They were like an
aunt and uncle to me.

318
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,465
They refused to
abandon their post..

319
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,932
It didn't matter how much
the fighting escalated.

320
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,832
How did.. how did they die?

321
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:23,332
They were killed.. They were
both murdered in cold blood.

322
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:27,732
And it was by the hand
of an Ishvalan they'd saved.

323
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,765
But that's so...

324
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,699
[Shan] I'm so sorry.

325
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:38,865
There was nothing
we could do to stop him.

326
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,065
[Ed] Tell me who did it!

327
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,399
His face was wrapped
in bandages...

328
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:48,599
but he was an Ishvalan monk
and his right arm was tattooed.

329
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:58,799
[Shan] If you should
have the chance...

330
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,332
Would you deliver a message

331
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,065
to the resting place
of the Rockbells for us?

332
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:07,032
Give them our thanks..
and our apologies.

333
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:26,065
[66 laughs] You know
how amazing this is?

334
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,465
I mean, how often does
a guy get the chance

335
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:31,665
to chop up his <i>own</i> body
into tiny little pieces?

336
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,365
I'm pretty sure
that would kill him

337
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,099
and you told <i>me</i>
not to do that.

338
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:37,865
Well this changes
things, dammit!

339
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,399
[66] I'm getting' chills
up and down my soul!

340
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,499
I've gotta get my
knives into it!

341
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,799
Back off, Barry! I thought you
were supposed to have the urge

342
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,799
to return to your body,
not chop it up into pieces.

343
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,832
[66 scoffs] That body's way
past its expiration date.

344
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,399
Oh, man..
<i>that's</i> what stinks?

345
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:56,932
This is just cruel,
I have to do it!

346
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,799
It's my body,
so it's up to me.

347
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,832
And I'm puttin' it on
the choppin' block!

348
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,365
Dammit! I said <i>no!</i>

349
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:04,532
[Mustang] What's wrong?

350
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:08,965
Just a squabble.. One of the
customers is mouthing off.

351
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:12,399
Oh, no.. I'm gonna have
to call you right back..

352
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,032
I've got a customer
of my own to deal with.

353
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:29,565
