[SIG GRUNTS]

327
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,683
For awhile it seemed
we were barren...

328
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:10,283
We wanted a child
but couldn't conceive.

329
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:13,383
When we were finally
able to conceive...

330
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,716
I ended up falling gravely ill.

331
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,316
And our child as well...

332
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:22,983
He was not able to take a
living breath in this world...

333
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,449
and so...

334
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,549
I committed the taboo.

335
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:32,516
As a result, I lost
parts of my inner organs.

336
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,749
What an idiot I was.

337
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:42,683
Now I realize I should
have told you sooner.

338
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,616
It must have been awful.

339
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,649
Nah...! I did it to
myself, after all.

340
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,983
It hasn't been that
big a deal, actually.

341
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:57,716
[AL] Besides, now I've got
this long list of things

342
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,049
I get to look forward to eating
when I have my body back.

343
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:03,516
[AL]
Right... Brother?

344
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:04,383
Yeah!

345
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,649
It's nothing!

346
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,416
[IZUMI]
You darling little idiots.

347
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:14,616
It's okay to hurt.

348
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,549
[ED] Forgive us...

349
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:33,316
[AL]
We're so sorry, Teacher.

350
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:34,316
[ED] Please forgive us.

351
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,316
[AL] We're so sorry.

352
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:38,983
--[ED] Please forgive us.
--[AL] We're so sorry.

353
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:49,621
[ED] The flow of this universe
follows laws of such magnitude,

354
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,121
that you and I can't
even imagine them.

355
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:53,721
You have to
understand that flow...

356
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:56,588
deconstruct it,
and then reconstruct it.

357
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:58,755
[AL] That's what
alchemy is, Brother.

358
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:02,655
[ED] You're right...
but it's also what living is.

359
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,388
So the basis
of alchemy...

360
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,588
deconstruction and
then reconstruction...

361
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:09,388
is just like the food
chain then, isn't it?

362
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:10,288
Like when you
eat a rabbit

363
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,088
and your body breaks
down its flesh...

364
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,755
then it's restructured
as a part of yourself...

365
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:15,921
And even before that...

366
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,855
the rabbit restructured
the grass it ate

367
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:20,388
into a part of its own body.

368
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,688
Alchemy is part of that flow...

369
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,655
and the flow is life itself.

370

[NARRATOR]
His name is Greed,

371
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,888
and he revels in his
own sinister desires,

372
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,955
running everything in his
path with cruel cunning.

373
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,988
Now he stands before Ed and Al,

374
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,855
an intimidating figure
in all his grotesque glory,

375
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:22,021
as if he were made for battle.

376
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:26,121

to be to looked upon

by the faint of heart.
