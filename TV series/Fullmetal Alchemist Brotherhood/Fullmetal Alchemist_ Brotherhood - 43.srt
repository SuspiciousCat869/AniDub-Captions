You aren't listening!

I told you...

[BRADLEY] So I hear
that you've discovered

Selim's true identity.

Yes, sir.

as a loyal citizen
of this country...

How do you feel about your
leader being a Homunculus?

47
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,596
I think it's sad the

You're just putting on an act...

00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:28,763
Pretending to be the
humans you secretly despise.

52
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,763
[BRADLEY] It is true
that Selim was appointed

53
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:33,463
to be my son by my superior.

54
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:35,830
Everything from my
power down to my rank

was appointed to me...

56

Most of my life is just an act.

But my wife, at least,
was of my own choosing.

about that one, Doctor...

got me here...

They're like landmines
loaded with alchemy.

00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:29,130
But I know how to
destroy them as well!

It hurts so much...!

173
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:22,260
So much pain!

174
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:26,393
No, this can't happen!

175

It can't!

176

This can't be... No...

177
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,927
How can this...
How can this happen?

178
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
I could never be defeated

by pathetic
creatures like you...

Don't... Quit looking at me...

How dare you look at me.

Don't look down
on me you worms!

Don't look... down
on... me... worms.

185

How pathetic...

186
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,627
This is the thing that
caused so much damage?

Are you okay,
what happened?!

192
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:35,860
What's that?

193
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,660

[YOKI]
I can't believe you guys

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,427
would keep me in
the dark about this.

That's what you get

for picking a fight
with us humans...

198
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,060
Grotesque tadpole.

199
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:50,927
Look at you...

200
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,693
Why would you do
something so dangerous?

201
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,127
Because I had to...

202
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,960
I've always done
what I was told to do.

203
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:01,427
I had to take a risk and
think for myself this time...

204
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,193
I put my fear aside...

205
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:05,727
and did what was right...

206
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I wanted to be
like your parents.

207

You were... But try
not to be so reckless.

208
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,993
Sure.

Yowww!

Mr. Yoki?

211
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:27,127
Help... Get it off me.

212
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,860
I've hijacked this idiot's body!

213
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,260
[YOKI]
Stop it! Let go...!

214
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,393
Somebody help me...!

215
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,060
I can't control my body!

00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:37,827
That's right, you can't.

217

[ENVY]
Now if you want him to live,

218
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,260
you'll do as I tell you.

00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,660
[GERSO]
Nah, he's all yours.

220
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:42,760
Do what you want.

221
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:46,027
[ZAMPANO] It's not like
he's our friend or anything.

Poor Yoki...

223

I'm sorry I didn't
know you better.

forget your sacrifice.

Ahhhhh!!!
Please, Mr. Scar...

You won't stand back

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,993
and let this thing kill me...!

Right?

229
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,727
How can you turn
your back on me?!

230
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,460
After all that I've done...

231
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,927
[ENVY]
Wh... What is this...?

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,093
Doesn't anyone
care about this guy?

233
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:09,293
[MARCOH]
You're wasting your time, Envy.

234
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,827
We've accepted the
measures we'll have to take

235
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,993
to defeat you...

236
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,360
We'll destroy both you

237
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:16,927
and this man if
you don't surrender.

238
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,693
[ENVY]
Dammit.

239
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:20,427
[AL]
Got him.

240
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm free?

241
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,827
[GERSO]
Nice acting, Doctor.

242
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,993
I'm afraid I'm not used
to bluffing like that.

243
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,260
Damn all of you...!

244
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,227
None of you guys
are my friends...!

245
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,860
How could you?
You're dead to me!

246
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,193
[ENVY]
This sucks.

247
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,160
[GERSO] So... This seems
like a good opportunity

248
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:43,127
to interrogate you.

249
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,793
I'm not talking.

250
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:47,327
Spit it out! You slug...!

251
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,127
You're either gonna talk or die!

252
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,093
That's it...!
Let him have it, Zampano!

253
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,127
Even if I do talk, you're
still gonna kill me...

254
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,393
So what's the point...? Fool.

255
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,260
What?

256
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:03,227
So what's the deal...?

257
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,793
Why isn't the Fullmetal
pipsqueak with you?

258
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:06,660
[AL]
Brother...?

259
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:11,827
I'm pretty sure
he's at Briggs by now.

260
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,727
Last thing that I heard,
he had gone missing.

261
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,827
[AL]
What'd you say...?!

262
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,993
He's missing?

263
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:17,793
Tell me!

264
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,260
He disappeared
after a mine shaft

265
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,093
in Baschool collapsed...

266
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,760
I wonder if he's still alive?

267
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:27,537
[WINRY] He's lying...
He has to be.

268
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:37,665
[GERSO]
So what now?

269
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,532
Should we head back
to Baschool to check?

270
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,698
[AL] No... That's not
what Brother would want.

271
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:46,398
He would trust
that I was alright

272
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:49,132
and wouldn't let a
rumor stop him...

273
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:53,132
So we're gonna do the
same thing and keep moving.

274
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:56,732
We can't give up hope yet.

275
00:15:56,765 --> 00:16:00,132
[SCAR]
I'll go my separate way for now.

276
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,198
I've realized something
about the actions I've taken...

277
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,798
I don't intend to
simply punish this country

278
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,432
for what it did to Ishval.

279
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,465
I want to change it.

280
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:12,432
And I'll need
your help, Marcoh...

281
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:15,565
The two of us need
to set things right.

282
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:20,632
Alright then...
We'll travel together.

283
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:23,332
In order to change
this country....

284
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,398
[AL]
Actually...

285
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,665
I've got someplace I've
been meaning to check out.

286
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:28,232
[GERSO]
Oh...? Where's that?

287
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:31,632
[AL] It's a town called
Liore... I'm not sure...

288
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,598
But I've got a feeling
the tunnel runs under it.

289
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:35,565
[SCAR]
Here, May...

290
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:38,832
Take this thing and
return to your country.

291
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,032
Hold on!

292
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,532
It's the remnants of a seemingly
indestructible creature...

293
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,665
It might appease your emperor
enough to save your clan.

294
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:47,765
I can't...!

295
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,632
Who's gonna teach you
about alkahestry if I leave?

296
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:52,398
[SCAR] You need to think
about your own country.

297
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:55,265
Have you forgotten why you
came here in the first place...?

298
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:57,598
Your clan could lose
its power struggle...

299
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,132
And what explanation
will you have

300
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,698
for them when you return home?

301
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,232
Will you apologize and tell them

302
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:06,632
you were too busy
saving another country?

303
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,532
Now go home...

304
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:09,832
Forget this place...

305
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,398
Leave this country's
problems to its people.

306
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:28,498
Thank you, for everything!

307
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:36,365
[AL]
You take care, May...

308
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,532
Once I learn the
basics of Alkahestry...

309
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,732
I'll be sure to find
you to learn more.

310
00:17:40,765 --> 00:17:43,032
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, Alphonse.

311
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,565
Alphonse... I'll...
I'll miss you.

312
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,732
Good luck...!

313
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,298
I'll never forget
any of you...!

314
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,332
Thank you...! Goodbye.

315
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:02,765
[WINRY]
Have a safe journey, May!

316
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:08,365
[AL]
There she goes.

317
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:10,132
[MARCOH]
We should start moving as well.

318
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,698
[SCAR]
Let's go.

319
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,032
[sniffles]
Poor Mr. Greed...

320
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,398
[SOLDIER 1]
No luck...

321
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,532
Izumi Curtis and her husband

322
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:40,065
are apparently on vacation

323
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:42,065
and didn't say when
they're returning.

324
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,565
[SOLDIER 2]
Hmm... Is that so?

325
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,698
We should report back
to Fuhrer Bradley...

326
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:49,565
There's not much
else we can do.

327
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>[BIDO]</i>
<i>Bradley!</i>

328
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:01,232
[BRADLEY] Now you stay
put, I'll be right back.

329
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,798
[SOLDIER 2] He might
have replacements for us.

330
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:05,298
Let's hope so.

331
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:08,498
<i>[BIDO] I might find</i>
<i>Mr. Greed if I follow them...</i>

332
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,132
<i>But...</i>

333
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:31,532
Uh, Sis?

334
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,432
Would you be so kind

335
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:35,198
as to possibly move
your foot, please?

336
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,398
[OLIVIER] You are to
address me as General!

337
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:40,665
Yes, ma'am, General!

338
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,665
You're just as gutless
as I remember you being.

339
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:44,398
So...

340
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,365
I heard your men

341
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,465
completely annihilated
the Drachma forces.

342
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,232
Of course they did!

343
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,665
But won't that hasten

344
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,532
the enemy's
transmutation circle?

345
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:54,832
I don't give a damn.

346
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:57,632
It was their duty to
defend the border...

347
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,565
And that's what they did...

348
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,198
And Drachma won't
even think twice

349
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,732
about attacking again.

350
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,332
Now they know that Our country

351
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,798
is not one to be meddled with.

352
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,332
Oh, my, you've only
grown more ferocious...

353
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:13,698
How will you ever find a
husband if you continue to--

354
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:16,198
That's enough of your
sniveling, you pansy!

355
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,532
I need to get
away from you

356
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,698
before I start to
catch your cowardice.

357
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:22,598
[GARDNER]
Ah...

358
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:24,265
I've been looking
for you, General...

359
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,332
Is this man your brother?

360
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,065
I don't consider
him my brother...

361
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:34,232
Not after he deserted
his country in Ishval.

362
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:35,532
Follow me, please...

363
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:38,032
There's something I'd
like for you to see.

364
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,565
[GARDNER]
Are you familiar

365
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:45,365
with the three state-appointed
tenets of alchemy?

366
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:46,665
Of course...

367
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:48,165
"Obey the military"...

368
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:49,532
"Do not create gold"...

369
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,132
"Do not create people"...

370
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,132
And that's it.

371
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,365
You know them well.

372
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:56,198
[GARDNER] Obeying the military
should go without saying...

373
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,698
The creation of
gold is restricted

374
00:20:57,732 --> 00:21:00,265
to avoid financial disorder.

375
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,398
So then...

376
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,265
What about creating people...?

377
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:04,565
Why do you suppose the state

378
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,532
would so firmly
enforce this regulation?

379
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,532
[OLIVIER]
It's simply unethical, sir...

380
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,098
It's even taboo
amongst alchemists...

381
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,198
From what I understand,

382
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:16,365
they regard it as an
implicit sacrilege against God.

383
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:18,432
[GARDNER]
But that isn't why.

384
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,665
The state has no
interest in ethics...

385
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:27,632
They're too much of a
variable to use as a guideline.

386
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:31,698
The true reason is
far less abstract.

387
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:33,665
The third tenet is
to prevent someone

388
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:37,298
from creating their
own army... General.

389
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,432
[ZAMPANO]
This place is a disaster.

390
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:11,698
[GERSO] You think there's
anyplace left standing

391
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,532
where we could get
something to eat?

392
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:14,665
[AL]
I think so...

393
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:16,532
It's around here somewhere.

394
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:20,498
[AL]
Rose...! How are you?

395
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,765
What a surprise...!

396
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:22,765
So, Al...

397
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:24,665
What brings you
back to Liore?

398
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:26,732
[GERSO] Looks like the kid
knows her, doesn't he?

399
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:27,398

Huh...?

00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:28,765
Yeah, somewhat.

403
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,132
Isn't he with you?

404
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,098
[AL]
Uh...

405
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:35,498
No, we're traveling
separately right now.

406
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:38,398
Oh... that's too bad...

407
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:40,465
I've actually really missed him.

Winry?

409
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:45,598
Wh... What, Al?

410
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,598
[AL]
Oh, nothing!

411
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,232
You just kind of had a
funny look on your face,

412
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,098
that's all.

413
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,398
I did not! You're
imagining things!

414
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:52,598
Okay, Rose...

415
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,832
These pots are as
clean as they get...

416
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,498
You have anything el--
