[ED]
Yea, you're right...

2
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,443
[AL]
It does look like her...

3
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,709
[OLDER WOMAN]
She's a darling girl, isn't she?

4
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,276
That's definitely not her!

5
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,543
[AL]
Yeah, I know!

6
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:52,276
We can't afford to
waste our time here

7
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,443
humoring some old
lady and her stupid cat.

8
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,676
[AL] Come on...

9
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,043
[ED and AL]
Where are you hiding?

10
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,272
[ANNOUNCER]
East City...! East City!

11
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,905
We received new intel on Scar.

12
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,439
[MILITARY POLICE B]
He's still running, then?

13
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,639
Does he never give up?

14
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,805
[smacks]
Ah!

15
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,239
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
about that, dearie.

16
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:42,705
No ma'am. It was
my fault, really.

17
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,805
That's an interesting
outfit you're wearing...

18
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,372
Where're you from, dear?

19
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,272
Xing, actually.

20
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:52,239
Is that right?
You're here sightseeing?

21
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,505
There's not much to
look at in East City.

22
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,872
[MAY] No, I'm just here
transferring trains.

23
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,105
I'm heading north right now.

24
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,405
[ANNOUNCER] The train bound
for North City is departing...

25
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,305
Oh, that's me!

26
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,639
Thank you, for all
your help, ma'am!

27
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,505
Take care, dearie.

28
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,572
I've never seen
a cat like that.

29
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,439
[CAPTAIN]
Which way did he go?

30
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,572
[MILITARY POLICE C]
I know I heard footsteps

31
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,605
coming from over that way.

32
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,372
[CAPTAIN]
Look! Over there!

33
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:01,839
[rumbling]

34
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:04,339
[crashes]

35
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,605
[KIMBLEE] He was seen
with a middle aged man

36
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
who had black hair, right?

37
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,472
Yes... that's what it
said in the report, sir.

38
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:23,539
[KIMBLEE]
And this was yesterday.

39
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,272
[KIMBLEE]
West, huh...

40
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:31,172
Several of our own
people were injured

41
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,372
while trying to apprehend him.

42
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,272
[KIMBLEE] Scar must
be getting desperate.

43
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:39,205
But that could help us...

44
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,539
He's leaving us a good trail.

45
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:50,139
[KIMBLEE] All right...
It's time to get to work.

46
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,705
A suspicious woman...
But that isn't my job.

47
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:31,139
[bell tolling]

48
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:43,172
[GRUMMAN] Looks like
a funeral procession.

49
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,572
Well... this is
the place for it.

50
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,405
It's quite depressing...

51
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,172
When you reach my age...

52
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:52,639
you think about it
being you in the box...

53
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,772
instead of watching it go by.

54
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,272
Surely you can't worry
too much about that...

55
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,805
You still look
plenty young to me.

56
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,472
General Grumman, is that you?!

57
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,705
[GRUMMAN]
The plan was to meet

58
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,672
in front of General
Hughes' grave, wasn't it?

59
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,305
I thought the situation
must be serious

60
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:21,905
for you to resort to
the last-ditch plan...

61
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,639
so, just to be safe...
I wore a disguise.

62
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:26,705
Of course...

63
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,239
Now I see why you're
known for being eccentric...

64
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,905
That really is some get-up, sir.

65
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,539
Eccentric...?

66
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:36,172
I think I'll choose to
take that as a compliment...

67
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:38,705
Now... what is it you need?

68
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,239
[AL]
Alkahestry...

69
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,839
Maybe they have some
information in the library.

70
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:45,805
[ED]
Yeah...

71
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,939
If we can't find that
bratty little girl,

72
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,205
I don't see what
other choice we have.

73
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,472
[AL]I hope we can at
least find something.

74
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,627
[GRUMMAN]
I see.

75
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,627
The Central senior staff
have all turned, have they?

76
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,027
You've gained some information,

77
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,994
but you've lost
too much doing it.

78
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,561
With all the
people you can trust

79
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:13,027
stripped away from you,
you won't get anywhere.

80
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:17,461
[ROY] Yes... You've
got it exactly, sir.

81
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:20,127
[GRUMMAN]
Even Raven, too?

82
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:21,727
Not too long ago...

83
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:24,761
I came to Central and
he asked me something...

84
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,727
something I found quite strange.

85
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:30,594
He wanted to know
if I'd be interested

86
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:32,861
in a core of immortal soldiers.

87
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,827
Immortals?

88
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,961
<i>[ROY thinking]</i>
<i>Did he mean Homunculi?</i>

89
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:42,394
The idea of immortality
is simply ridiculous...

90
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,727
I told him as much and
ended the conversation...

91
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,727
And not long after that,
I was transferred.

92
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,961
You mean you were demoted?

93
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:52,761
Indeed I was, and since then,

94
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,727
I've been stuck with
the inglorious job

95
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,794
of cleaning up the messes
in the Eastern area.

96
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,661
And speaking of messes...

97
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:03,694
Do you remember the difficulties
that we had in Loire?

98
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,561
A false priest was
scheming for power...

99
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:09,827
until the Fullmetal
Alchemist uncovered his plan.

100
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,027
[GRUMMAN]
Yes... I remember.

101
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,127
[ROY] Liore fell into
chaos after that...

102
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,694
but from the outset...

103
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:21,027
forces from the
East acted quickly...

104
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,794
They brought the
uprising under control...

105
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:27,461
Yes... but then the forces
from Central came in...

106
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:30,727
and all of the Eastern
forces were dismissed...

107
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,461
Were you aware of that?

108
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:37,761
Yea. And the peace in
Loire was shattered...

109
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:41,461
<i>After</i> the Central
forces appeared.

110
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,061
What are they
planning now...?

111
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:45,727
And what is it they
intend to do next...?

112
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,794
And why can't they hold off...?!

113
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,094
I'm almost retired...!

114
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:52,061
If they'd only wait,
I'd be free and clear.

115
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:54,661
Now I know that you're bluffing.

116
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:57,627
I'm sorry General,
but someone like you...?

117
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,127
You don't know how
to sit by and watch...

118
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:02,394
You can't do nothing.

119
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:05,594
Especially when your soldiers
are all hardened veterans...

120
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,561
men who fought in
the Ishval conflict.

121
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:15,394
I expected you to
come crying to me.

122
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,294
When you sent me that note,

123
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:18,861
I thought you just
wanted some advice.

124
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,027
But you're trying to get
me involved in this too,

125
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,527
aren't you?

126
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,694
And you know, it's working...

127
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:25,927
Since things are becoming

128
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:28,561
so interesting over
at Central Command...

129
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:31,127
Just when I thought
my ambition was dead...

130
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:34,627
I'm finding myself
fired up again!

131
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,561
Careful now.

132
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,427
You don't want to
mess up your make up...

133
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:38,461
Right, ma'am?

134
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,627
Oh my, no!

135
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,894
Do you have an
opening later, sir...?

136
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,161
Maybe you and I could
grab a cup of tea somewhere.

137
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,761
Very sorry, but no.

138
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:51,494
I appreciate the invitation.

139
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,594
[ED]
No use.

140
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,427
Why is there so
little information

141
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,894
available on alkahestry?

142
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:13,961
At this rate,

143
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,761
I'm thinking we might
as well just go to Xing...

144
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:17,727
It'd be hard...

145
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:21,027
Crossing the desert
in automail sounds hot.

146
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,094
W-What the--?!

147
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,694
Ah ha...

148
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:34,161
There you are, Edward Elric.

149
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:36,527
I've found you!

150
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:38,794
You?! Dammit Major,
what do you want?!

151
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:40,861
Shh! This is a
library, you know...

152
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:44,127
Quiet!

153
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,561
I understand you're after
a certain Xingese girl

154
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:49,761
who possesses a strange
black and white cat.

155
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:53,027
[ED] Yeah... But how
do you know that?

156
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,394
[ARMSTRONG]
Colonel Mustang informed me...

157
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:57,461
I'm running errands
for him today.

158
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,727
The word is the
girl is headed north.

159
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,494
According to an eyewitness,

160
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:07,094
she departed by train

Now that's some
information I can act on!

163
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,894
I appreciate it, Major...

164
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,894
and thank the
Colonel for me, too.

165
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:19,561
Hold on a second...
There's more.

166
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,427
Take this.

A letter of introduction...

but it might not be much use.
First thing, see her.

Her who...? What d'ya mean?

[ARMSTRONG] Even further north

You'll find an officer nicknamed

the Northern Wall of Briggs
who defends our border.

That May girl's use

was pretty impressive.

I wish we could use it...

188
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,124
I should have asked
her more about it

00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:09,858
when we were at
Dr. Knoc's place.

Ling did say it was specialized
for the medical field.

You're wearing a
full suit of armor.

Oh... I'm sorry.

So... what're you
studying? Something cool?

198
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,091
It's called alkahestry.

199
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,891
What's alkahestry?

200
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,624
It's alchemy from
the country Xing.

Oooh... It's from Xing, huh...?

the kind of alchemy they
practice in a foreign country?

have a lot of medical uses...

So, I'm just
doing some research

An amazing man...!

00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:27,024
His job is more demanding than
anybody else's in the world...!

270
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:28,124
He spends all day,

271
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:31,824
every day thinking about
the people of this country.

272
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,791
Of course he does.

273
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,991
[AL] The Fuhrer's duties must
keep him very busy all the time.

274

That is true...

275
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,257
It's something he
always insists upon...

276
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,124
He's determined to
work himself ragged.

277
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:49,191
At his age, I'd prefer if
he took it a little easier.

278
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,291
It's nothing new...

279

He's always been
devoted to his work...

That's what he's good at...

but then where
women are concerned...

282
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,291
I'm afraid he's
a bit of an oaf.

283
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,857
The first time we met,

284
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:04,724
he made me so angry
I actually slapped him.

285
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,391
But it worked out for the best.

286
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,757
He asked me out after that,

287
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,024
and our first date
was amazing...!

[BRADLEY] I had some
free time for a change,

00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,324
so I thought I'd
check in on my family.

297
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:40,791
And I also happened to hear

298
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,024
that the Fullmetal
Alchemist and his brother

299
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,491
were paying us a visit.

300

Hello, sir.

301
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,157

Long time no see.

302

Long time?

303
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,991
I just saw you boys at
Central Command, right?

304
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:00,791
[BRADLEY] So, you ran into
these two at the library, Selim?

305
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:02,224
Yep!

306
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,057
Are you wondering why
he doesn't look like us?

307
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,291
N-No sir...

308
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,891
It didn't cross my mind.

309
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,957
Well, it's because we
aren't related by blood.

310
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:18,757
We were unable to have
any children of our own...

311
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,457
So we adopted Selim,
and he's our son now.

312
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,291
I'm proud of my boy.

313
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:26,357
He's grown into a
fine, devoted son.

314
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,191
Would ya cut it
out already, Dad?

315
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:30,024
You're embarrassing me.

316
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,924
[BRADLEY]
But it's the truth!

317
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,824
What's wrong, Elric?

318
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,157
[AL] Oh... uh, it's just
that we never see you...

319
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,024
except at the command center...

320
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,391
So this is kind of, you know...

321
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:52,791
It's a side of you we're not
used to seeing, that's all.

322
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,891
[BRADLEY]
I see. But as you can tell,

323
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:59,457
even a man like me has a family
waiting for him at home...

324
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,357
I'm sure, of course...

325
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,357
it's quite different from yours.

326
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,191
Aw, Daddy...
you're leaving already?

327
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,057
Yes... You know I have
duties to get back to, Selim.

328
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,991
[BRADLEY] Please...
make yourself at home.

329
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:32,391
You're welcome any time,
State Alchemist.

330
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,191
Let's go.

331
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,491
Please, come back and
visit us soon, okay?

332
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,757
We will. See you later!

333
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,024
[AL] It's sad. Neither
Selim nor his mother

334
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,857
know what Fuhrer
Bradley really is.

335
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,824
[ED] Come on, let's go!
We're headed north.

336
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,357
We'll catch that
obnoxious little brat

337
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:25,891
and make her tell us everything
she knows about alkahestry!

338
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,191
We'll be there soon...
Get some sleep.

339
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:58,457
[KIMBLEE] I see... He managed
to escape us again, did he?

340
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,457
This is an accurate map
of the West Area, right?

341
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:06,291
Uh, yes sir.

342
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,957
This is the spot where
he was last sighted.

343
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:15,757
Right here... And
West City is there...

344
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,157
Scar and Marcoh disappeared

345
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:19,791
somewhere in between
the two places.

346
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,324
Trains slow down
when they turn...

347
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,891
but how much speed
do they lose...?

348
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,791
Is it possible the two
we're looking for jumped off?

349
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,757
It would have been
very dangerous, sir...

350
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,491
But yes, it's possible.

351
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:40,457
You don't say...
All right then...

352
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:44,157
after they jumped off,
which way would they go?

353
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:47,324
North.... Or south?

354
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,324
[AL] This is the first time
we've every been so far north.

355
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:45,191
Yeah, it is.

356
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,324
I wonder if we'll see any snow.

357
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:49,157
That would be something...

358
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,791
I might like to see that.

359
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:53,357
Snow's one thing we
never got much of back home.
