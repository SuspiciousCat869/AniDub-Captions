Alright, Envy... Time to die!

8
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:04,631
Help me... Kill me...

Where's my mommy?

Come on! Snap
out of it, you idiot!

15
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,798
Why didn't you attack him?

16
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:40,564
A person...Those are people...

17
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,298
They need our help...
They're trapped inside him!

Give me back my son!

Shut up...! Stop it!

[voices] Father!
Do you like this power?

25

Help us!

Wanna play?

29
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,731
Let's play.

30
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,898
I'm done playing with you.

Please, wake up!

[Worker] Steady,
steady...! Alright...

41
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,898
[Factory hand] Oh,
this little cat?

42
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,298
Yeah, I saw one that
looked just like it

43
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,964
by the factory earlier...

44
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,531
I thought it seemed
like a weird pet

45
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:12,331
for a guy in a suit
of armor to have.

46
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,764
Armor? Aaahh!

47
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,531
That thing we fought?!

48
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,264
[evil laughter]

49
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,564
That suit of armor's
gonna pay, big time!

50
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,731
He stole Shao May from
me...! Kidnapped her...!

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,364
That creep!!

52
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,431
That's her...! Shao Ma-

53
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:39,431
[Scar] Hold it.

54
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,298
You see that fat one?

55
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,431
I overheard them call
him a Homunculus.

56
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,298
[May Chang] A Homunculus?

57
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,298
He has the power to recover
from any type of injury...

58
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,298
So he's practically immortal.

59
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:55,564
He is...? That's even more
reason for us to go after them!

60
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,431
[Scar] You're
missing my point...

61
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,764
I don't know if
we can stop him.

62

00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,731
Is something wrong?

65
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:18,831
This place...
it's strange...

66
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,664
I could feel there
was something wrong

67
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,298
with this country
since I got here.

68
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,664
But this place...

69
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,331
It's the source of it...

70
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:28,898
Can you feel those things...?

71
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:31,198
Crawling beneath us?

72
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:39,931
[Shao May whimpers]

73
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,864
[Al] What's the matter...?
Are you cold...? It's okay.

74
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,431

75
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,498
[Al] Woah...

76
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,764
I didn't know there were
tunnels like this under Central.

[Al] Hey...!
What's with all that?

81
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:19,531
Huh...? Oh... The
gatekeepers did all that.

82
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:20,831
The gatekeepers?

83
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:24,464
They won't rip you up
as long as you're with me.

[Al] Just pretend
they aren't there.

00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,798
[Al] Do we have
much further?

87
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,631
Not too far...
It's just ahead now.

88
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,764
[Al] You said your
father made you...

89
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,298
Does he know what happens
to the people you swallow?

90
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,798
I'm sure he does.
Father knows everything!

What are these things?

106
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,331
They're known as Chimeras.

[May Chang] It's stronger here.

The feeling... There's
something evil beneath us.

114
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:56,764
[Scar] Is it more chimera?

115
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,498
[May Chang] No, it's worse.

116
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,631
[May Chang] Are those... people?

He made all of us, he did...!

[Crying babies]

124
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,977
[Bradley] I have no memory
of my parents' faces

125
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,210
or their names...

126
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:44,810
In fact, I don't even
remember my own name.

127
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,344
For all I know, I might
have been abandoned

128
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:51,077
or sold before I even had one.

129

you will be the one to step

forward and lead this country?

How 'bout you?

132
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,310
[Bradley] They called us
"prospective Fuhrers"...

133
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,944
And they trained
us to be leaders.

They kept us
confined together...

135
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:08,844
and they taught us at all
times of the day and night.

136
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:12,077
We studied political
science, and humanities...

137
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,277
As well as martial
arts... firearms...

138
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,844
and of course, swordsmanship.

was to help you further
achieve your goal.

144
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,110
[Bradley] I was certain that
I would be the one chosen

145
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:43,944
to lead this country.
I firmly believed it

146
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,910

training to make it so.

become my fury? My Wrath?

Once injected into the
bloodstream, it begins to

160

take over its new host and the
human body tries to reject it.

and then rebuilt by the stone.

163
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:02,244
The only options I had were to
die or to overcome its power.

164
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:04,044
I chose the latter.

165
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:05,377
[Scientist] It's amazing!

166
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,777
We've made a new type of human!

167
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,410
Congratulations. You have
been chosen to lead mankind

168
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,510
down the path of destiny...

169
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:14,944
Everything has been arranged

170
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:18,077
to provide you with
all that you'll need.

171
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,377
From now on, your
name will be...

172
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,744
King Bradley.

173
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,777
[Bradley] Countless
souls had battled

174
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,510
for dominance within me.

175
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:30,844
And only the most
wrathful one survived.

176
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:33,010
I can't tell you if
this remaining soul

177
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,544
was one of those within the
Philosopher's Stone...

178
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:39,044
Or if it's the one I'd
carried since I was born...

179
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:44,244
I doubt that I'll ever know.

180
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,344
You've lived your life
before as a human being...

181
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:49,144
Why choose to be a
Homunculus, sir...?

182
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:52,077
Isn't there some way you could
go back to being a human...?

183
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,110
Or not?

184
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:58,110
You suggest I become human
again...? Ridiculous...

185
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,177
Why would I possibly want
to pursue such frivolity?

186
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,977
[Bradley] I've become
something far superior.

187
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,110
Just as you humans take great
pride in your "humanity",

188
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:11,444
misguided though that may
be... I too am proud...

189
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,444
Because we also take
pride in what we are.

190
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,310
The woman you killed.

191
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:22,310
She died with her pride
intact, didn't she?

192
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,177
There. That should help.

193
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,410
Thank you, Ling.

194
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,510
[crashing]

195
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:31,177
[Envy] I collected all the
fragments that I could find.

196
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,544
[Ling] So this stuff...
It's all from Xerxes?

197
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:37,110
That's right... They're
pieces of a large mural

198
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:40,010
from what remains
of their temple.

199
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:42,344
[Ed] When I saw the ruins
of the mural up close...

200
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:45,244
I thought it was identical
to the transmutation circle

201
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:46,344
from the 5th Laboratory.

202
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,877
The one they used to create
Philosopher's Stones.

203
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,877
But it's actually different.

204
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,777
The sun represents the soul.

205
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,110
While the moon
symbolizes the mind.

206
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,910
And then there's the stone
canvas of the mural...

207
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:01,010
This represents the body.

208
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:04,977
Slow down... Try to
keep it simple, okay?

209
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,244
Basically... The mural
was a summoning circle...

210
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:10,244
For human transmutation.

211
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:13,110
I do know that one...
Well I think I do...

212
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,977
Is it used to bring
back dead people?

213
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,510
Not quite.

214
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,377
[Ed] Alchemy is based on the
rule of equivalent exchange...

215
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,844
You can't transmute a
life form from a soul

216
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:24,244
that no longer exists
in this world.

217
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:27,244
You can trust me on that one.

218
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:30,810
So... this is where I got the
idea to get us out of here.

219
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:33,510
I can't transmute the dead...

220
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:36,810
but what would happen
if I transmute myself?

221
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:38,244
You mean a living person?

222
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,177
Exactly... I can use this
transmutation circle

223
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,777
to deconstruct myself...

224
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,244
And then I'll just put
myself back together...

225
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:50,110
That's human transmutation...
and it'll open the portal.

226
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:53,844
[Ed] You said that Gluttony is
a defective Portal of Truth...

227
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,910
I'll bet that if we pass
through the real portal,

228
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:59,510
then we'll wind up
in our own reality.

229
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:01,377
I'll open up the real portal...

230
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,277
and then you two
jump through it.

231
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,444
What happens if it goes wrong?

232
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,844
Then it'll rebound...

233
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,877
A failed transmutation
ricochets

234
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,477
onto the one who
performed it...

235
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,244
[Ed] In this case,
that would be me.

236
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:16,477
I'm not gonna act like I know
anything about alchemy...

237
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,077
This is all yours.

238
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,077
Right... Hey, Envy...

239
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,677
I've got something else
that I wanted to ask you.

240
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,010
[Ed] The partial mural
I saw in Xerxes...

241
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:33,244
It would've looked
more-or-less like this.

242
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,244
This is the first thing
that caught my eye...

243
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:38,277
The symbol for God is
written upside-down...

244
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,810
And beneath it is the
two-headed dragon...

245
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:45,044
The alchemic symbol for
a "complete lifeform".

246
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,944
Which means... This
basically translates to

247
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:51,244
"I will strike God to Earth
and become a perfect being".

248
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,977
Well that's certainly
an arrogant concept.

249
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,777
It's not a big deal
to talk about it...

250
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,377
but then there's this.

251
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,977
[Ed] This piece takes
it to the next level.

252
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,844
An image of the lion
swallowing the sun...

253
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:07,477
Symbolizing the
Philosopher's Stone.

254
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,586
The Philosopher's Stone is
made with living humans...

255
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,186
Isn't that correct, Envy?

256
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:15,119
Yeah... That's right.

257
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:18,052
[Ed] How could a nation as
advanced as Xerxes fall...?

258
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,519
Let alone in a single night?

259
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,686
What happened to
its citizens...?

260
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,652
These stone fragments
of the mural...

261
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:28,119
You put them here
to hide the evidence.

262
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:32,152
You killed them... You
sacrificed all of Xerxes...

263
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:34,686
You turned them into a
Philosopher's Stone!

264
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:47,719
[transmutation sounds,
screaming]

265
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:49,186
Who was it?!

266
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,119
[Ed] I wanna know who used
this to transmute himself...!

267
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,786
Who slaughtered the population
of a whole country...

268
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,686
Who created all of you...?
Who's trying to make himself

269
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,086
powerful enough to surpass God!

270
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,452
It was your father...?
Wasn't it? Tell me, Envy...

271
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:06,019
Whoever this guy is, he's
been using you Homunculi

272
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,552
to try and recreate the
destruction of Xerxes

273
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,886
here in Amestris, hasn't he?!

274
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,019
You get us out of here and
I'll gladly tell you everything.

275
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,552
You've spent enough time
beating around the bush...

276
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:20,752
I'm tired of waiting
for you to ask...

277
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:24,924
You need to pay a toll,
right...? To open the Portal?

278
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,586
[Envy] This should work.

279
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,886
[voices screaming]

280
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,952
Your body... Those are the
citizens of Xerxes, aren't they?

281
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:43,952
At one time, but their minds and
bodies crumbled long ago...

282
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:47,119
All that's left is energy
to be consumed.

283
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,019
They don't even remember
what they looked like

284
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:51,019
when they were alive.

285
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:54,519
Is that pity...? How
childish are you?

286
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:57,586
You're desperate to see these
things as human because you

287
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,819
wanna believe that your brother
still retains his humanity.

288
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:05,419
Would you hesitate to throw a
bundle of logs onto a fire...

289
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,152
because you pitied the
tree they came from?

290
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,952
These souls can never go
back to being human.

291
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:16,519
You have to use logic if you are
to determine what a human is.

292
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:20,486
Don't let your emotions decide.

293
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,880
[Ed] Alright.

294
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,714
Ling... This might not
work out for me...

295
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:35,147
If so, you gotta warn people
about these guys' plans.

296
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,047
I'm not that concerned about
Amestris. It's not my country.

297
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,614
Are you serious?

298
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,214
You've got people you love
waiting for you, don't you?

299
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,047
So just make it back alive

300
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,814
and tell them yourself.

301
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,147
I'm sorry... But
I need to use you.

302
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Get ready!

<i>[Ed] The body and the soul</i>

318
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,714
<i>are connected to one</i>
<i>another by the mind...</i>

319
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:18,747
<i>A portion of my body now hurtles</i>
<i>toward the Portal of Truth...</i>

320
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,014
<i>So there's no point</i>
<i>in struggling...</i>

321
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:25,014
<i>I have to let my mind guide</i>
<i>me... into the portal.</i>

322
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:27,947
[Truth] Now what's this...?

323
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,280
You're not even trying to get
your body back, are you?

324
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,580
[Al] So this is it...? Your
father's on the other side?

325
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,247
[Gluttony] Mm hm. That's right.

326

329
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,180
[Ed] Alright... I made it.

330
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,780
What the... Were there
always two portals?

331
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,880
[door opening, giggling]

332
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,080
Al!

333
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:40,914
[Ed] Al! Come on! Please...!
Hurry, Al! Aaaaall!

334
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,280
I can't.

335
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:46,014
I can only leave
with my own soul.

336
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:48,147
I'm sorry, I can't go with you.

Look at me! I promise...

341
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:23,247
Someday soon... I'm
coming back for you!

342
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,093
Just you wait!
Wait for meeeee!

343
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:05,014
<i>Our memories are</i>
<i>like the flickering</i>

346
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,880

<i>of time dance,</i>

347
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:15,047
<i>they cast cruel and</i>
<i>distorted shadows</i>

348
