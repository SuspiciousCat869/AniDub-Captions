[screaming]

326
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:49,999
[Scar] Go on, shoot.

327
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,099
[Ed] Don't do it, Winry!
Put down the gun!

328
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:55,065
[Al] You know you don't want
to do this!.. Winry!

329
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:59,265
Shoot, girl... But know... the
moment you pull the trigger...

330
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,432
there's no going back.
You will be my enemy.

331
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:02,599
Scar!

332
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:05,265
If you think I'll let you hurt
one hair on her head--!

333
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,299
Will you kill me?... That'd
be fine with me...

334
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,932
until one of us dies, boy.. this
chain of hatred will continue.

335
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,232
But don't ever forget!

336
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,099
Don't ever forget it was
the Amestrians

337
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,899
who first pulled the trigger
during the civil war.

338
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,865
It was your people!

339
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:24,932
[whimpering]

340
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,299
Winry... don't shoot!

341
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:29,565
[Al] Just put that gun down
and get out of here!

342
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,899
Winry!

343
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,332
If you can't shoot... then
do as the boy told you.

344
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,899
You're in my way!

345
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:41,299
[grunts]

346
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,332
Don't shooooot!

347
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,799
Get back!

348
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,065
[Scar] My brother...

349
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,865
[Al screams]

350
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,165
[grunts]

351
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:16,899
[Al] Ed, you idiot, what
are you doing!?..

352
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:19,199
Both of you will get killed!

353
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,432
Hurry and get Winry
somewhere safe!

354
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,232
[whimpering]

355
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,965
Winry... let go of the gun.

356
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,032
[Winry] I couldn't shoot.

357
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:37,832
I know you couldn't...
and it's okay.

358
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,165
But that man...

359
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,299
You said he's the one who
killed my mom and dad.

360
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:47,499
He tried to kill you and Al
too, Ed. But I couldn't...

361
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,565
Why not?!

362
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,199
[Ed] Remember In Rush Valley...

363
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:56,999
you delivered that baby...
you saved two lives.

364
00:21:57,032 --> 00:22:01,465
And you gave me an
arm.. and a leg..

365
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,865
to replace the ones I'd lost.

366
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:10,265
It's your hands... They
weren't meant to kill.

367
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,565
They're meant to give life.

368
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:18,065
That's why.

369
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,965
[crying]

370
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,499
[Narrator] What happens when
someone must give something

371
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,832
up in order to protect it?

372
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,032
Will his resolve falter?...

373
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:15,332
Will he crumble beneath
the weight of sacrifice?

374
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,599
Or will his heart
remain strong...

375
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,065
ready to do whatever
is necessary.

376
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,599
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

377
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:28,599
Episode 23...Girl on
the Battlefield.

378
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:31,465
You must not show any
tears of sorrow...

379
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:33,499
That is part the promise.
