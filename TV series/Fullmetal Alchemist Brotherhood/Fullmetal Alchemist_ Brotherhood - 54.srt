"1909: The conclusion of the Ishvalan Civil War"

2
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,491
Aren't you going back? You'll be left behind.

3
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:20,583
A war buddy's grave?

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:25,175
No. It's an Ishvalan child.

5
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:27,931
One who was left dead by the wayside.

6
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:33,441
Let's go home. The war is over.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,082
The Ishvalan War still is not over within me.

8
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,506
No, it will never be over for as long as I live.

9
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,891
I am the one who believed in you,

10
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:54,150
and entrusted my father's research to you.

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,780
I am also the one who
entered the military academy,

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,037
in hopes for the happiness of the people.

13
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:03,126
And even if that did come to an unwanted result,

14
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,923
I cannot escape the truth.

15
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,685
There is no way I can atone for what I've done.

16
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:18,532
I have a favor to ask, Mr. Mustang.

17
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:22,498
Please burn and deface my back.

18
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,753
Wha‐‐? There's no way I could do that!

19
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:26,965
At least...

20
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,636
If I can't atone,

21
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:32,936
I at least want to destroy the secrets on my back,

22
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,733
so that no other Flame
Alchemists can be produced!

23
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,660
Can you do that?

24
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:48,466
If so, then please release me from my charge.

25
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:54,186
Please set me free from the burden

26
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:58,278
placed on me by my father‐‐ from his alchemy.

27
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:01,743
I beg you.

28
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:16,690
All right. I will burn you,
leaving as little trace of it as I can.

29
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:25,332
Thank you very much, Mr. Mustang.

What are you trying to pull, Lieutenant?

00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,730
Who do you think you're pointing your gun at?

48
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,902
Who? Don't make me laugh.

49
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:28,912
When it's just the two of us,
the colonel always calls me "Riza."

50
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,252
That's how close you two are, is it?!

51
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:33,881
I lied.

52
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:39,141
Thanks for falling for it, Envy.

53
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:43,232
Now, die here for me.

54
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,998
Ow, that hurts!

55
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,520
Damn it!

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,774
You're taking the potshots too far!

57
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:10,913
I'll dump you in front of the
colonel like a worn‐out dishrag‐‐

58
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:15,714
Colonel!

59
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,681
What are you doing to my dear subordinate?

60
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,574
Don't do anything rash, Lieutenant.

61
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,538
I told you I was going to take care of him.

62
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:11,033
Damn human, don't you look down at me!

63
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,492
Damn it...

64
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,622
Not this again!

65
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,799
Is that your true body?

66
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,597
You're ugly.

67
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:08,355
Envy, your name means "jealous," right?

68
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,569
That makes sense.

69
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,865
No...

70
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,744
Don't!

71
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,623
And jealousy...

72
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:19,211
...is an ugly thing.

73
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,841
No, I don't want to die!

74
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,135
No! No!

75
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,891
Be gone...

76
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,062
...from my sight!

77
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,947
What do you think you're doing, Lieutenant?

78
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,201
That's enough, Colonel.

79
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,413
I will deal with him from here.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,465
One more blast will finish him. Put down your gun.

81
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,597
I cannot obey that order, sir.
Please put your hand down.

82
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:48,603
Stop screwing around! I said put it down!

83
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,953
Fullmetal...

84
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:00,711
Let me have that.

85
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:08,017
I'll tell you one more time. Let me have that.

86
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,440
No.

87
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:28,140
I must give him the worst of all deaths.

88
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,560
No.

89
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,317
Give him to me! Or I will burn
him up along with your right hand!

90
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:36,323
Fine with me! I'll fight you like I mean it!

91
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:39,789
But before I do, take a
good look at your own face!

92
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,797
Is that the face you plan to wear
when you're the nation's top man?

93
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:45,424
That's not what you...

94
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:49,725
Colonel, that's not what you're after, is it?!

95
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:56,113
Those below me will protect those below them.

96
00:08:56,113 --> 00:09:00,664
We tiny humans should be
able to do that much, at least.

97
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:04,379
This could be interesting.
I'll take a piece of that action.

98
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,974
I want to see how your naive
idealism changes this country.

99
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:13,898
Are you going down the path of the beast,
given over to his passion?

100
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:16,361
You can, if you want to.

101
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:19,075
If you're going to live for
revenge, I won't stop you.

102
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,746
H‐Hey!

103
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:24,169
I have no right to stop another
from taking vengeance.

104
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,054
But I do think it would be a
sight to see what sort of world

105
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:32,018
a man who is held captive by his own hatred,

106
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:35,734
at the head of everyone else, would create.

107
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:41,537
Colonel, I cannot allow you to kill Envy.

108
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:45,504
That being said, I do not intend to let him live.

109
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,716
I will dispose of him, sir.

110
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,806
I finally did it! I finally ran him down!

111
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,433
I know!

112
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,104
But still...

113
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,695
But still, what you are about to do

114
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:01,703
is not to help the country, or your friends!

115
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:03,748
It is to vindicate your hatred.

116
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:07,130
That is all that consumes you.

117
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,138
I cannot allow you to descend to that level!

118
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,578
If you wish to shoot me, then shoot me.

119
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:48,671
However... after you shoot me,
what will you do then?

120
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:55,476
I have no intention of living
on by myself, free of care.

121
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,856
Once this fight is over,

122
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:02,281
I will remove my body, along with
its maddening flame alchemy,

123
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,369
from the face of the earth.

124
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:15,684
I can't have that.

125
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,436
I can't...

126
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:19,817
...afford to lose you.

127
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:26,914
What kind of situation is this?

128
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:33,010
Scolded by a child, lectured by a man
who once came after me as an enemy...

129
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,978
...and causing you pain, once again...

130
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,238
I'm just a big fool.

131
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,595
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,165
What are you, dense?!

133
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:12,756
Just flowery words, and make‐believe empathy?

134
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:14,927
Ah, it's turning my stomach.

135
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:18,685
Are you humans really that over‐the‐top?

136
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:22,567
Just do whatever you want to,
like your gut tells you to do.

137
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,947
Colonel Mustang! Have you forgotten?

138
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:28,997
Scar was out to take your life.

139
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,542
As I recall,

140
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:35,552
Scar is also the one who killed
the pipsqueak's friend's parents.

141
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:40,770
Yeah, yeah, and the girl‐and‐dog
Chimera in East City.

142
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,235
Isn't Scar the one who killed her, too?

143
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,031
And as for you, Scar,

144
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,493
what happened to all that hatred

145
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,291
over your countrymen killed in Ishval?

146
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,003
And the woman,

147
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:55,382
all full of herself, being called the "Hawk's Eye,"

148
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:58,346
she shot your pals left and right!

149
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:00,434
You'll never get another chance like this!

150
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:03,858
Well, go get them! This is a prime opportunity!

151
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,071
Hate and weep! Kill, and be killed!

152
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:09,703
Thrash around! Grovel in the dirt!

153
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,957
Teaming up together as friends

154
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,047
is something you scum couldn't possibly do!

155
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:18,095
Right, pipsqueak? Right, Hawkeye?

156
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:21,101
Mustang? Scar?

157
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:31,831
H‐How come?

158
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:36,799
Huh? How come? Huh? Huh? Huh?

159
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,349
How come? How come? How come?

160
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:44,565
How come?!

161
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:47,486
Envy...

162
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:51,202
You're... jealous of humans.

163
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:59,887
Humans are supposed to be so
much weaker than you Homunculi,

164
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,141
and yet even when we're
beaten down, and get discouraged,

165
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,688
or seem like we're about to go astray and fall,

166
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:07,026
we still stand up to the
challenge, again and again.

167
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,656
Those who are around us pick us back up.

168
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:15,417
And you... you're envious of humans like that.

169
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,507
If you forsake the smaller part,
the greater will be saved.

170
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:21,346
If you think about it just a little, you'll see that.

171
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:24,937
You can't shoot like this, huh, human?

172
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:28,611
But then again, that's just
the way you humans are.

173
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,990
But as long as I'm going to transform anyway,

174
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,829
something young and cute would be better, huh?

175
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,710
You humans really are such fools.

176
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,881
You risk your lives over the most pointless things.

177
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,595
Only human, all right.

178
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:43,766
Humans...?

179
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,520
Humans...

180
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,703
Hey, you! Don't run away!

181
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:54,955
Hey, hold on a second!

182
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,669
You idiot, if you squeeze yourself out...

183
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,213
Ow!

184
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,595
Wait.

185
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:04,641
He won't last much longer.

186
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:12,741
It's so humiliating, ending up
like a worn‐out dishrag...

187
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,301
...walked on all over by you humans...
you loathsome beings...

188
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,019
What's worse,

189
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,400
of all the scum out there,

190
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,616
this scummiest pipsqueak had to be the one...

191
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,037
Damn it! Damn it... damn it...

192
00:15:57,037 --> 00:16:01,588
How humiliating! How humiliating!

193
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:06,180
Me, Envy... jealous of you humans?

194
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,894
Me, Envy?!

195
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:16,869
Me, Envy, being understood by this kid?

196
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,419
That's the ultimate humiliation.

197
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:34,320
We'll see how long those flowery words will last.

198
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,660
Best of luck with that.

199
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:07,094
Bye‐bye... Edward... Elric...

200
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:23,001
He terminated his own life?

201
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,005
Cowardly bastard.

202
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:47,967
Whoa, his wounds are healing.

203
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,309
He's a monster!

204
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,396
Hey, what is that thing?!

205
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:56,693
You're here just in time! Give us a hand!

206
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:58,739
Give you a hand?

207
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:03,039
We have orders to shoot General Armstrong...

208
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,416
General?!

209
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,505
And you, too, Major?

210
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,509
You're just in time.

211
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,971
From here on, I'm running the show!

212
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,940
Just help us out, now!

213
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,902
Hey, what are those things?

214
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:24,289
Get your heads down!

215
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:34,351
Bullets don't have any effect on them.
Smash in their upper jaws.

216
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,482
At least we won't have to worry
about being chewed to death.

217
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:42,744
Attack in pairs, and make sure
to take out at least one each!

218
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:47,754
Show me the valor of the Central soldiers!

219
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:51,553
Let's see... what was I doing...?

220
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:57,272
Ah, I remember...

221
00:18:57,272 --> 00:19:00,195
Kill the woman general.

222
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,589
Oh, no you don't!

223
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,635
Let go!

224
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,738
It sure is hard, only being able to use one arm...

225
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,338
‐‐Major!
‐‐General!

226
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,342
He's gonna beat him to death!

227
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:34,137
If someone doesn't get in there to help him out...

228
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,473
Leave him!

229
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,685
My brother...

230
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,691
...has trained himself better
than to be killed like that!

231
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,868
This...

232
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,872
...is the end...

233
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,548
Major!

234
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:08,582
My shoulder has popped back in!

235
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,671
All right!

236
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,626
This artistic muscular and
artistic alchemic collaboration...

237
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:55,299
...is excellent and elegant!

238
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:04,986
Yes, sir. The Armstrong
estate is completely empty.

239
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:09,202
Damn it, is this where they assembled that tank?!

240
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,644
This is the gate commander, calling Operations!

241
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:25,026
We're taking fire from what
we believe to be a Briggs tank.

242
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:28,282
‐‐Come in, Operations!
‐‐Stop shouting, I can see!

243
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,328
No matter, return fire!

244
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:32,373
But the civilians haven't finished evacuating‐‐

245
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:35,296
If we wait for them, we'll lose the main gate!

246
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,927
Contact the command center
and main gate batteries‐‐

247
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:43,522
Damn it, what was that?!

248
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,615
You were going to fire on an urban area?

249
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:52,205
You want that to go out over the radio, too?

250
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,667
Why, you...

251
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,758
This is Briggs equipment!
How did you get in here?!

252
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:01,056
Ah, a man formerly stationed
at Central Command Center,

253
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:06,526
one with a sharp memory,
remembers exactly where this location is.

254
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,615
All that was left was for
someone to single‐handedly

255
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:12,495
dig a tunnel from the urban area to right here.

256
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,750
Is there anyone able to pull
something like that off?!

257
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,213
Yes, there is. Right here.

258
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,967
W‐Who?!

259
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:22,348
When anyone asks who I am,
I tell them I'm a housewife.

260
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:25,772
That is only proper for me.

261
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:30,448
But today, why don't I identify
myself as something else?

262
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:32,786
I'm an alchemist!

263
