to create another
Philosopher's Stone.

[FATHER] What else
are all these pitiful,

powerless humans good for?

12
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,990
[HOHENHEIM] You insist
on treating humans

00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,523
as a lower life form,
but don't you see?

14
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:30,890
Only through them can a
Philosopher's Stone be created,

00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:33,857
and only through a Stone
can a Homunculus arise.

But what does a
Homunculus produce...?

What do you create?

18
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:38,957
[HOHENHEIM]
Creation is all,

19
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,857

all you've reached
