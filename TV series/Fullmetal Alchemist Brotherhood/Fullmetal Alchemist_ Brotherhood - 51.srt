Not good. We have to tell Al--

Wait, please hold on!

00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:01,144

If you're taken
prisoner or something,

176

it's just going to be that
much harder on Alphonse!

Ah, so you're alone, then...?

182

Yes, well, in the end
I had to consume him.

It's not like it's

We are a collective.

We were both born
