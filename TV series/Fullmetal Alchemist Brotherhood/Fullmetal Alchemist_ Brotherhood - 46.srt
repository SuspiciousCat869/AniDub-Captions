[HAKURO]
Your Excellency... I've come
here to give you a warning...

322
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:33,591
General Grumman plans to--

323
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:36,791
To use the Eastern
forces to stage a coup...?

I've anticipated the
General's next move.

Actually... the threat
of a joint coup d'etat

00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:44,124
is just a decoy,
sir... A distraction.

327
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,324
Their plan was
to draw the bulk

328
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,324
of the military's divisions and
attention away from Central.

329
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:51,224
Ishvalan terrorists are
gathering to attack the city.

330
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:54,524
Afterwards... General
Grumman will invade

Central under the pretense
of stopping the terrorists.

ally with Colonel Mustang

take control of Central Command.

According to

A large number of Ishvalans

have been seen gathering in
the slums outside of Central,
