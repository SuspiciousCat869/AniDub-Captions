Yes, that's right.

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:48,953
You got lucky.

00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,753
You were close to
getting frostbite.

5
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:54,853
You need to be careful
walking around in a snowstorm...

6
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,819
The flesh that's touching
your automail will freeze...

7
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,453
and you need to oil it...
or it will stiffen.

8
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,286
So does that
Buccaneer guy have a

9
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,786
different kind of automail
or something?

10
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,319
It's no use, Doc.
I can't get this thing unstuck.

[AL]
Hey...! My head!

12
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,753
[FEMALE DOCTOR]
Up here, your automail has to be

13
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,686
flexible and lightweight...

14
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,819
It also needs to be
resistant to the cold.

15
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:21,886
After some trial and error,
we found an alloy that works...

16
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,419
A combination of dura-lumin,

17
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:27,019
carbon fiber, nickel,
copper, and so on...

18
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,153
And here I assumed
it was just iron...

19
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:33,153
It's no wonder I couldn't
do anything with it.

20
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,886

Are you planning on telling
him all our secrets?

00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,853
Why wouldn't I?
He's a State Alchemist.

23
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:42,753
He has a right to
know, doesn't he?

24
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:44,786
You're kidding...

25
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,053
He has the pocketwatch.

You mean this kid is the

If you're going to be
in the north for long...

29
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:58,353
you should switch to a
different kind of automail...

Yes, but she's in Rush Valley.

[FEMALE DOCTOR] And she
let you come up north

33

without explaining
all of this to you first?

34
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,986
Not exactly... I didn't tell her

on coming up here.

It wasn't even
a good cup of coffee.

42

This is the north.
Get used to it.

43
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,019
[BUCCANEER] So you come up here

Oh, come on...! I hike up
here, a State Alchemist

Actually... that's something

There's no reason to worry...

Folks around here have
plenty they want to hide...

that he or she doesn't
like to talk about.

00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,052
I'm sorry...

160
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,885
but that's the first time
I've heard anyone

161
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,452
give me that kind of an answer.

162
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,019
What, you were testing me?

163
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,985
I know, it was rude...

164
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,552
Since the war,
Amestrians always view me

165
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,585
with a mixture
of guilt and pity...

166
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,985
To be honest,
I'm getting tired of it...

167
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,685
But you're different,
aren't you?

168
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:19,052
Well, Major... an Ishvalan
tried to kidnap me,

169
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:19,919
nearly killed me,

170
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,919
and then briefly fought
alongside me...

171
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,652
After all that...

172
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,552
My feelings
are a bit conflicted.

173
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,185
Besides... I think people should
try to ignore their race...

174
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:34,585
and just treat
each other as equals.

Major Miles, were you on

176
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,785
active duty during the
War of Extermination?

177
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,719
[MILES]
Yes, I was...

178
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,219
I've been under
General Armstrong's

179
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:53,119
command since then.

180
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,919
[MILES] The war began right
after I was posted here...

181
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:58,685
Many of my relatives,
including my grandfather

182
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,519
were killed in the East...

183
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,485
I fell outside the military's
purge requirements,

184
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,185
so I was spared.

185
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,819
You didn't hold any grudge
against the military?

186

You don't understand how the
world works, now do you?

187
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,052
I know I'm ignorant
about some things...

188
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,952
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

189

An "ignorant"
State Alchemist, you say?

190
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,919
(heh)... Interesting.

191
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:28,652
[MILES] I did resent
the military's actions...

192
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,152
And, I also had doubts as to why

193
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:33,985
General Armstrong would
keep me as her Staff Officer.

194
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,752
[MILES CONTINUES] The presence
of someone with Ishvalan

195
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:40,485
blood could cause discord among
the soldiers stationed here.

196
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,885
It would've been easier
for her to get rid of me....

197
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,085
Eventually, I just came
right out and asked her.

198
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:48,485
[OLIVIER]
This is Briggs.

199
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,519
No matter what happens,
this territory must not fall.

200

[OLIVIER]
Every soldier here must be

201
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,852

202
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,152
You must move
as one cohesive unit,

203
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:03,019
following me, your leader,
in all things and at all times.

204
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:08,519
In short...we do not have the
luxury of discrimination here.

205
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,119
[OLIVIER CONTINUES] The blood of
several races flows within you

206
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,985

strengths and values...

207

You can see this country
in a way that others cannot...

208
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,752
I was born and
raised in Amestris.

209
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:22,652
In order to lead, I need
someone with your eyes...

210
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,919
Now shut up and
follow me, Miles...

211
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,485
Understood?

212
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,585
Her words made sense...

213
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:32,019
I knew... she was speaking
without deception.

214
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,085
[MILES] I even went so
far as to ask her...

215
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,919
"What if the
Ishvalan blood within me

cannot forgive what the
military did to my people?"

217
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,519
And do you know want to know
what the general said to that?

218
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,452
Fine then... bring it...

What a scary lady...

223
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,652
Maybe she said that because
she had her troops with her...

224
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,652
No... that wasn't it at all.

No... I don't think he's heard

[OLIVIER]
Who does that thing work for?

I can't answer that!

Why can't you answer me?

399
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:39,221
I can't answer.

400
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,121
This is my last question...

401

Are you on our side,

I told you, it won't
work, General...

Set him on fire,
but he still won't die.

I understand--
I learned from our

last attack
that we can't kill it...

416

The best that we can hope
for is to stop or delay it...

417
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,188
So we'll have to hit it with

418

stronger than fire.
