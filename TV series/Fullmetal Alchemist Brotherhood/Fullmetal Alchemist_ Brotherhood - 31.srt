1
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:08,842
Vengeance, huh...?
Dammit! It's Scar...

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,408
Marcoh must've told him
about his role in Ishval.

3
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:51,798
[Hawkeye] I'll let you
know if I hear anything new.

4
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:55,631
The Fuhrer's basically
hired you to be his hostage...

5
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,698
Will you be alright?

6
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,165
Well, it's all in how
you look at it, I guess...

7
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:00,298
This close to him,
it just means

8
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,831
I'll have a better chance
to kill him in his sleep.

9
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:05,198
You scare me.

10
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:09,198
Oh, yeah...
Pass this on for me...

11
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,565
Tell the Colonel
that Scar is back.

12
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,598
Sure thing, no problem.

13
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,731
Hey, Lieutenant?

14
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,398
Yes? What is it?

15
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:22,298
I just want to say thanks...

16
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:24,731
For telling me about Ishval.

17
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,565
[dog bark]
Ruff!

18
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,958
[Ed] Al!

19
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,124
[Al] Brother... What's wrong?

20
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,058
[Al] That's terrible...

21
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,224
It's tough to even
hear about Ishval.

22
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:44,991
[Ed] And she
didn't hold back...

23
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,358
even though I'm
practically a kid.

24
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,358
They say "an Alchemist is one
who seeks after the truth"...

25
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:55,158
And yet...I knew nothing
about what happened in Ishval...

26
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,624
You think the
Colonel's concerned

27
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:59,924
about what happens after
he gets what he wants?

28
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,158
I know I would be if
I were him... Y'know...?

29
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,324
Hey, Al...

30
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,424
What are you gonna do when
you get your real body back?

31
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,591
I mean afterwards.

32
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:11,458
[Al] Well, let's see...
First thing...

33
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,891
I really wanna eat
some of Winry's apple pie.

34
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:17,058
[Ed laughs]
Ha! Hehe!

35
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,424
And what about you?

36
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,424
[Ed sighs]
Hmmmm...

37
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,924
I've been so busy trying
to get our bodies back

38
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,924
that I haven't even thought
about what happens next.

39
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,991
I guess the first thing...
I'll make some courtesy calls...

40
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,324
Let Granny and our
teacher know we're alright.

41
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:36,224
Yeah, of course... They've
both helped us out so much.

42
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:40,058
[Al] And you know what...?

43
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,624
They'll be smiling
when they see us.

44
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,024
Yeah.

45
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,358
That'll be nice...
Just to see them smile.

46
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,091
[Ed] Yeah.

47
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:50,124
[Al] I know things
are rough right now...

48
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,658
but I'm starting to cheer up.

49
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,158
Well I've found a
trace of hope for us.

50
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,158
[Ed] You know how our
alchemy wouldn't work

51
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:00,258
when we were
under Central command?

52
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,491
Well guess what...?

53
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,291
It wasn't working
above ground either.

54
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:08,358
[Al] But... What about
Scar and that girl?

55
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:12,058
Exactly... They were the
only ones who could use it.

56
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,424
[Al] Well if that's the case...

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,424
They're doing
something different...

58
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,024
something with their alchemy
we don't know about...

59
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,858
Yeah... Which means we
haven't hit a dead end yet.

60
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:25,358
[Ed] You mean she's gone?

61
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,358
The little obnoxious girl left?

62
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,524
[Knocs] Yeah...
Sometime this morning.

63
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,058
[Ed] But she...
Where was she going?

64
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:33,991
[Knocs] She didn't tell me.

65
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:37,224
We can still find her!

66
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:41,324
[Al] But this city is huge...
And we don't have any clues.

67
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,258
But we do have a clue, Al.

68
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,224
What the hell is that?

69
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,624
They're a gift from me.

70
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:55,191
Oh, come on...

71
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:56,024
Couldn't you have just gotten me

72
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,391
some magazines
with girls in them?

73
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:03,991
These should keep you from
slacking off while we're gone.

74
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:05,258
Leaving already?

75
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,424
[Breda] Yep... Gonna eat some
of that famous western cuisine.

76
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:13,358
Hold down the
fort 'til we get back.

77
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,624
Right... I'll see ya later.

78
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,458
Here ya go, boy...

79
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:23,491
You eat up so you
can grow big and strong.

80
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,124
You be good...
Look after everyone.

81
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,424
Sergeant Fuery.

82
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,624
Hey.

83
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,091
Oh, Officer Falman...

84
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,191
I thought you'd already
left for the north.

85
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:39,224
I've gotta return something
to the Colonel first.

86
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:40,591
[Falman] Ah, man...

87
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:44,024
We really weren't in
Central for very long.

88
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:46,291
You're being deployed to
Southern Command, right?

89
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:49,491
Yes, sir...
The opposite from you.

90
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,058
It's gonna be so cold.

91
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,558
I always get
the worst posts...

92
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,224
Well...I've gotta
get moving...

93
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,058
You take care,
Sergeant.

94
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,391
Yes, sir... I'm sure
we'll meet again some day.

95
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,958
[door knocks]

96
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,091
[Hawkeye] Sorry
for the interruption.

97
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:08,424
Oh. Sure.

98
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,058
I just came by to get
something that I left.

99
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,024
[Roy] Ah, right.

100
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:18,158
[Hawkeye] I've got intel that
Scar is back on the prowl.

101
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:20,624
[Roy] I guess I'll have to
watch out for him then...

102
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:23,991
Things are gonna be
tough without my bodyguard.

103
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:30,491
[Hawkeye]
Just don't get killed, sir.

104
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:36,491
Sure... You must
be anxious, huh?

105
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:40,591
Maybe I picked the wrong
person to side with after all.

106
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:43,158
Then go ahead and shoot me,
if that's what you think...

107
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,124
You promised me that you would.

108
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:48,224
You haven't gotten
quite that bad.

109
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:51,424
You're too kind, Lieutenant.

110
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,858
Well, then, Colonel...
See ya later.

111
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,024
Until then.

112
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:02,358
One other thing...
Try not to slack off too much.

113
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,124
Right.

114
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,224
<i>[Roy] My pawn.</i>

115
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:20,591
Yeah...It started
off as a hobby of mine.

116
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:22,024
<i>[Roy] My bishop.</i>

117
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,891
Yes, sir...
I consider it an honor.

118
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,091
<i>[Roy] My rook.</i>

119
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,524
Hello, sir.

120
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:29,558
<i>[Roy] My knight.</i>

121
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,958
I doubt that I'm the
brightest guy you'll meet

122
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,891
but I do know how to shoot.

123
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:37,124
<i>[Roy]</i>
<i>And... Worst of all.</i>

124
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:40,224
I'll follow you
into hell if you want.

125
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,891
<i>[Roy]</i>
<i>They've even taken my queen.</i>

126
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,124
<i>But... I'm still</i>
<i>not in checkmate.</i>

127
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,424
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>

128
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,224
[Ed] Hey! Have you
seen this cat...?

129
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:59,924
I'm trying to find the
little girl who owns it.

130
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,258
Look familiar...?
How 'bout you...?

131
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,391
[Al] No, it looks like this...

132
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,858
I promise it's not
some weird alien.

133
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,958
[Ed sighs]

134
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,958
Seems like this search
is getting us nowhere.

135
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,958
[Al] Y'know, they might
not be in Central anymore.

136
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,424
Fullmetal.

137
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,091
Colonel?

138
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,624
[Roy] You don't say...
Xingese Alkahestry.

139
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,491
Sounds promising...

140
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:29,658
I'll ask around and
let you know what I find.

141
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,258
Thank you, but I really
don't wanna get any deeper

142
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,324
in debt to you
than I already am.

143
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,591
Speaking of...
You owe me some money...

144
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,591
So how about you cough it up.

145
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:41,991
Eyes on the road!

146
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,224
You remembered...?
Come on...

147
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,224
How much did I borrow...?
500 cens?

148
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:51,591
It was five hundred and
twenty cens...! Don't con me.

149
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:53,224
I'm not conning you...!

150
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,624
I'm just not a
penny-pincher like you are.

151
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:58,024
[Al] I'm sorry, Colonel.

152
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,558
[Ed] I'm just gonna
hold onto this...

153
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:09,558
but I promise to pay you
back when you become Fuhrer.

154
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,324
[Roy]
Who told you?

155
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,991
[Ed] Lieutenant
Hawkeye told me...

156
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:18,158
And she told me
about Ishval, too.

157
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,958
Fullmetal.

158
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,258
Go on and keep
that money for now...

159
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,358
but you will pay me back.

160
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,624
Alright, and
when that day comes

161
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,124
I'll borrow some more change...

162
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,491
And pay that back when
this country's a democracy.

163
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,558
But when that day comes,

164
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,924
I'm gonna ask to borrow
even more money from you.

165
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,124
You're not planning
to let me off the hook

166
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,191
for a very long time, are you?

167
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,491
Now you get it...

168
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:52,924
And you better not worry
the lieutenant, either.

169
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,124
Thanks for giving us a ride.

170
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:02,024
Sure... See ya later.

171
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,491
You took long enough.

172
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,458
I was getting tired of waiting.

173
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,558
Hey.

174
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:24,591
It's Roy! Well I'll
be damned! Long time!

175
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,524
Hello, Vanessa...
You're looking well.

176
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,891
[Madam Christmas] My, has
it been a blue moon already?

177
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,391
[Roy] Well good evening
to you, Madam Christmas.

178
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,291
How're you holding up, Roy?

179
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:37,091
I'm barely holding up at all...

180
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:40,058
I was hoping you
could cheer me up.

181
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:41,558
You wanna drink?

182
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,958
[Roy] It's probably
not the best idea...

183
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,958
I just got out of the hospital.

184
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:51,224
But I could use something
special... Eh, Madam?

185
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,991
My pleasure.

186
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,391
General Grumman,
you have an outside call

187
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,891
from a Madam
Christmas in Central.

188
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:01,958
Oh?

189
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:05,624
Please, sir... you really
shouldn't be giving out

190
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,158
our secret line to civilians.

191
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:11,191
Not too bad for
an old fart like me.

192
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,924
The ladies still come a
callin' for my services.

193
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,624
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

194
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,887
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

195
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,266
You lost your arm...

196
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,366
You couldn't protect the prince.

197
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,999
[Fu] And look at you now.

198
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,499
[Slap!!]

199
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:37,299
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

200
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,199
How dare you call yourself
a member of the chosen clan!

201
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,366
Cut it out, old man,
she hasn't recovered yet...!

202
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,466
I told you to stop!

203
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:51,966
[Fu] It's really gone.

204
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,166
Your arm... You lost your arm.

205
00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:00,932
[Lan Fan] Please forgive me,
Grandfather... I'm sorry.

206
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,466
[Fu] You fool.

207
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:10,132
You damn fool.

208
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:17,432
[Ed] I promised Lan Fan
that I would introduce her

209
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:20,099
to an automail engineer.

210
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,299
We decline.

211
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,599
We appreciate
such a kind gesture...

212
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:27,099
but you've already
helped us enough...

213
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:30,332
We can find an engineer
on our own if we must.

214
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,232
[Al] But... We have
to do something.

215
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:35,632
The enemy has now clearly
seen Lan Fan's face...

216
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,399
We refuse to risk the life
of your engineer friend.

217
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:49,132
Alright then... Thank you.

218
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,066
You're the only reason that my
granddaughter is still alive...

219
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,499
You have my gratitude.

220
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,666
What...?

221
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,966
Do I look like the kind of
doctor that wants gratitude?

222
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,199
Thanks, Doctor Knocs...
Thank you for saving me.

223
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:05,399
Eh... Just clear out already...!

224
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,199
I'm not such a pushover
that I'm gonna let you

225
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,966
take my bed for an extra night.

226
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,966
[Knocs] Now get out.

227
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,632
[Fu] The emperor's health is
only growing worse each day.

228
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,232
We don't have much
time to find the prince...

229
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:28,099
But he must return to Xing with
the means for immortality...

230
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:29,332
Let's go.

231
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,199
Right.

232
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:42,366
I promise...I'll seek
out the evil here...

233
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,566
Remember us... we will return.

234
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:12,899
I'll always be indebted to
you for taking care of me.

235
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:17,532
Thanks, Doctor Knocs...
Thank you for saving me.

236
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,332
Treating me like
a real doctor...

237
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,499
What's the world coming to?

238
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,032
Yeah, yeah...
Whadda ya want?

239
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,266
Uh. Good evening, Dad...
Good to see you.

240
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:38,932
It's been a while...
How are you?

241
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,566
[Knocs] Fine...

242
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:45,166
[Knocs' Son] We were in
the area, so we thought...

243
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,232
Well you sure have
grown up... And you, uh...

244
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,532
It looks like you've
lost some weight.

245
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,266
I think both of us have.

246
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,999
How's work going...?
Keeping you busy?

247
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:58,232
Yeah... I'm surrounded
by corpses as usual...

248
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:01,032
Well... I actually
spent the last few days

249
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,366
treating some live patients.

250
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,632
It's absurd, huh...?

251
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,099
Just try to picture
me saving lives.

252
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:12,199
Hey, Dad...? I...well,
I wanna become a doctor.

253
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:14,232
[Knocs' Son] I know that you've
been haunted by the things

254
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:16,199
that you were ordered
to do in Ishval...

255
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,399
No matter what...

256
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:20,066
You never gave up
on helping people...

257
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,932
That takes courage...

258
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:25,999
For that... For being a
doctor... I love you...

259
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,932
You stubborn jackass.

260
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:31,966
Come on in...

261
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,199
It's not gourmet or anything,

262
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,366
but I'll brew us up some coffee.

263
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,366
[Knocs' Son] Oh, man...
It's a disaster in here.

264
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,199
[Knocs' Wife] C'mon...

265
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:45,532
Why don't we try
to clean up a little

266
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:48,632
before he can tell us not to?

267
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,299
[Knocs] I don't know if you
actually exist or not, God...

268
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:54,999
but cut me some slack.

269
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:57,232
Even a guy like me
needs a break...

270
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,232
Just please let me
enjoy the happiness

271
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:02,866
of having a cup of
coffee with my family...?

272
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,483
[Official 2]
The battle is over...

273
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,749
Ishval is now
under our control...

274
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,383
And all thanks to you...

275
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,216
Well done, Major Kimblee.

276
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,816
[Official 1] So tell us...
How did the Stone work out?

277
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,483
It's beyond amazing...

278
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,716
It lets you bypass
the equivalent exchange

279
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,583
to harness an immense power.

280
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,649
[Official 2] Excellent...

281
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,449
Write up the details in
your formal report for us.

282
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,516
[Official 1] But we'll
need the stone back first.

283
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,816
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

284
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,816
[Kimblee] Now let's see...

285
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,116
I guess this makes you
the only ones who know

286
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,349
that I'm in possession
of this stone.

287
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,083
Traitor!

288
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,283
[loud explosion; screams]
Ahh!

289
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:54,949
[Guard 3] What happened?!

290
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:55,583
[Guard 4] Was that a bomb?!

291
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,516
[Guard 5] What's going on?

292
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:06,216
Hahahahahaha!!

293
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:11,349
Visitors...

294
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:17,083
On your feet, Kimblee...
You've been released.

295
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,716
[Kimblee]
So who made this decision?

296
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,183
[Jailer] I didn't say
you could talk, Kimblee.

297
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,816
[Kimblee] Must've been
someone pretty high up.

298
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,716
Shut your mouth...

299
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,649
You must have some
kind of big connections

300
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,449
to avoid the death sentence...
It makes me sick.

301
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:38,283
Nope, no connections...
I just deserve to go free.

302
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:40,383
[Jailer]
You really are psychotic...

303
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,316
What kind of political
move is this...?

304
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:44,749
Letting a nut job like you out.

305
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:59,183
Y'know, Warden... I appreciate
you taking care of me.

306
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:01,616
I hope I never see you again.

307
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,883
Just my way of saying thanks.

308
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:13,749
What is this...
I can't get it off! Help me!

309
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:17,149
Don't do this to me!
Kimblee, please!

310
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,583
[metal spring sound]
Tweet! Tweet!

311
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,716
It's nothing but
a harmless toy...

312
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:28,883
I thought you could give
it to your kid or something.

313
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,583
[Kimblee] Farewell, Warden.

314
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,749
Now then... what next?

315
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,249
It's been a while... Kimblee...

316
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:52,449
Congrats on the early release.

317
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,883
So I take it I have
you guys to thank?

318
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,849
Yep... We could use
a little extra help.

319
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:01,349
My first day out of jail
and I already have a job.

320
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,516
[Envy] You remember
Doctor Marcoh, don't you?

321
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,383
[Kimblee] The scientist

322
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,849
who created the
Philosopher's Stone...?

323
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,816
How could I ever forget him?

324
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,183
[Envy] It appears he's
escaped... Or, we think he has.

325
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:15,149
You think?

326
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:18,849
We're still sorting
out all of the details.

327
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,349
One of the Chimeras that
we had watching over him

328
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:22,449
has gone missing...

329
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:25,816
Marcoh's specialty was
transmuting living tissue...

330
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,283
He might've used the
Chimera in his place...

331
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,849
And if that
wasn't bad enough...

332
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,649
We think he might have escaped

333
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,749
with an Ishvalan
warrior known as Scar.

334
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,849
[Envy] Well how about it...?

335
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:41,449
Considering you were
the one responsible

336
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,449
for the extermination and all.

337
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,183
You do have a point...

338
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:48,116
It's inexcusable if
I've let a survivor crawl

339
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,849
out of my path of destruction.

340
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:54,116
[Envy] You're free to
kill Scar if you want...

341
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:57,283
But we do need Marcoh alive.

342
00:19:57,316 --> 00:20:00,183
You released me just
for this little errand?

343
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:03,183
After you've nabbed
Marcoh for us,

344
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:04,116
there's a certain little town

345
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,649
we'll be asking you
to wipe off the map.

346
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,583
That's your kind of job, right?

347
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:12,349
It's remarkable
how cruel you are.

348
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,516
It's been too long
since I've used this.

349
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,816
[Envy] I don't know if that one

350
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,749
is going to be
enough for this job.

351
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,449
[Kimblee] A new stone...?

352
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,883
Did you use more
Ishvalans to make it?

353
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,583
We actually used
Dr. Marcoh's assistants

354
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:33,183
who helped make the
first stone for us.

355
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,349
Your cruelty's infinite.

356
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,616
Why didn't you kill
me back there...?

357
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,583
After all I've done...

358
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:50,183
We haven't finished our
conversation yet, Marcoh.

359
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:54,516
Tell me everything you
know about Kimblee... Also...

360
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,449
You might be able to
help me decipher some

361
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:59,116
of the research notes
my brother left behind.

362
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:01,083
Research notes?

363
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,549
[Scar] Before he died,
my brother told me

364
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,583
there was something strange
about this country's alchemy...

365
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,116
His notes should explain why.

366
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,116
You are apparently
skilled with alchemy...

367
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:13,616
Can you tell me
what he meant?

368
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,216
He said that our
alchemy was strange...?

369
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,883
I don't know.

370
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,683
Sir...

371
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:23,216
[Yoki] That little girl
was able to find us.

372
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,549
Looks like you made
it out, Mr. Scar!

373
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,616
[May Chang]
Do we have a new companion?

374
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:31,449
He's not our companion...
His name is Marcoh.

375
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,716
[Scar] He created the
Philosopher's Stone

376
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,716
and he killed my
people to do it.

377
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:39,216
The Philosopher's
Stone...? Immortality!

378
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:40,449
Mr. Marcoh...!

379
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,783
Please teach me how
to create the Stone...!

380
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:43,783
How did you make it...?

381
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,316
I'm begging you to show me!

382
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,583
No... I can't.

383
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:50,183
Quiet!

384
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,583
You shouldn't
desire such things.

385
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:03,349
[muffled pain]

386
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:06,583
[painful screams]
Argghh!!

387
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,783
[Scar] I only
destroyed the surface...

388
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:12,183
You can stop the
bleeding, can't you?

389
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,649
Right!

390
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,316
[Scar] It will be
easier for us to travel

391
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:18,383
if your face is unrecognizable.

392
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,716
It's time to leave.

393
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,349
Huh...? Where are we going?

394
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,583
We need to get to the place

395
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:26,516
where I hid my
brother's research notes.

396
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,249
[Scar] The north.

397
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,149
<i>[Narrator] A hidden</i>
<i>figure emerges</i>

398
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,383
from its disguise of innocence.

399
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,349
<i>But it continues</i>
<i>to smile sweetly</i>

400
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,616

<i>"The Fuhrer's Son."</i>

404

405
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:31,483
<i>Or is it a freshly dug grave?</i>
