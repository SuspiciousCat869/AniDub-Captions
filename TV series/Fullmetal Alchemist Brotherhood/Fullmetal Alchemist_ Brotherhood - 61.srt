[YOUNG ED] When the sun

My brother researched
the science of alchemy...

204

From there, his interests
led him to begin looking

into the art of
alkahestry as well.

206

[SCAR] Alkahestry is

However... my brother
realized something...

Alchemists weren't able to use
their power to its full measure.

with the connection between
the alchemist and that energy.

214
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,756

I came to this country...

215
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,179

crawling beneath the earth.

[HOHENHEIM] That's right...
And it worked perfectly...

223
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,818
After that, Scar created
a reverse circle...

00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,659
It will correct the corrupted
alchemy of this country.

It was Scar's brother...

Through tireless research...

227
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,504
he discovered
a secret long kept...

[HOHENHEIM] The existence of the
nationwide transmutation circle.

[HOHENHEIM]
Using that as a base,

230
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,104
he applied his
knowledge of alkahestry

231
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:29,983
and developed what
is known as a

233
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:35,494
This circle would render the
Philosopher's Stone of Amestris

234

You can't have it, Pride.

I won't let you
take this body...

320
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,361
It's not a good
fit for a Homunculus.

[PRIDE] Kimblee...!
There's no way...!

322
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,787
How could you maintain
your individuality among

323
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:30,458
this tempest of souls...?!
It's just not possible!

324
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,420
[KIMBLEE] You call
this a tempest...?

325
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,509
Oh, stop. You're going
to make me laugh...

326
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,803
The bitterness
that all of these

327
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,767
voices contain soothes
me... like a lullaby.

328
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:42,315
[PRIDE] Why are you
interfering...?

329
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,652
Kimblee, why?!

330
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:46,658
[KIMBLEE] Not by choice...
I was perfectly content,

331
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,829
but when you decided
to throw away your honor

332
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,500
as a Homunculus,
you forced me to step in.

333
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,714
[KIMBLEE] You speak of
your precious pride,

334
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,968
that quality for
which you were named.

335
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:58,932
But then suddenly you find
yourself in grave danger...

336
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,311
and you seek to escape
into the body of a human,

337
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,984
the lower life form
that you so despise...

338
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,111
It's Pathetic.

339
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:07,490
[KIMBLEE]
You're a disgrace.

He'll kill me!

[KIMBLEE] If you think that,

He's turned himself
into a Philosopher's Stone

347
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:38,469
and now he's forcing
his way inside me?!

348
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,227
I've caught you... You are mine!

349
