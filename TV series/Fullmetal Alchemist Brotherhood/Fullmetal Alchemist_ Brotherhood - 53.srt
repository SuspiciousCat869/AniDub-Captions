1
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:33,863
[Citizen 1] Wh-What's going on?

2
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:34,839
[Citizen 2] Is the
city under attack?

3
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,739
[Citizen 3] I don't know.

4
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:36,806
[Citizen 4] I heard
the Flame Alchemist

5
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:37,873
turned enemy of the state.

6
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:38,973
[Citizen 5] Are you
sure about that?

7
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:40,606
[Citizen 4] Well,
that's the rumor.

8
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,839
Hey! You got a radio in here?

9
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:45,506
Quick! Turn it on to
Radio Capital! Hurry!

10
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,339
The public news station?

11
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,039
Yeah. You aren't gonna
believe what's going on.

12
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,406
There's never anything
good on that station.

13
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,573
Just turn it on!

14
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:57,306
Before the military shuts
down the broadcast! Come on!

15
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,506
[Broadcaster] Do I understand
you correctly, Mrs. Bradley?

16
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,306
The "Mrs. Bradley"?

17
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,906
[Bradley's Wife] That's
right. Our own military...

18
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,906
They attempted
to have me killed.

19
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,806
You mean, someone
gave out that order?

20
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,806
They actually pointed
their guns at you?

21
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,706
They did. They specifically
said to shoot me

22
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,039
and Colonel Mustang's
men. It was awful.

23
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:30,339
[Broadcaster] Fuhrer Bradley
went east to preside over

24
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:34,373
a military exercise and has
yet to return to Central.

25
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:35,506
[Bradley's Wife] That's correct.

26
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,806
[Broadcaster] So then,
it would seem that an official

27
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,373
took advantage of his absence
in order to stage a coup.

28
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,406
[Bradley's Wife]
That I do not know.

29
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,506
Is that really Mrs. Bradley?

30
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:48,706
I've heard her speak before.
That's her, alright.

31
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:49,906
[Broadcaster] I imagine
you must be relieved

32
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,506
that your son is traveling
with his father.

33
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,006
[Bradley's Wife] I haven't
been able to contact my son.

34
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,506
[Broadcaster] You haven't?

35
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,773
You're kidding!

36
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:58,773
[Bradley's Wife sobs]

37
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:00,373
That poor woman.

38
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,739
I sure hope little
Selim's alright.

39
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,306
[Broadcaster] Please try to
remain calm, Mrs. Bradley.

40
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,473
[Customer 1] A coup d'état?

41
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,406
[Customer 2] They're
fools if they think

42
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,506
they can run this country
without Bradley.

43
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,039
[Bradley's Wife sobs]

44
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:14,006
If... If Colonel Mustang
hadn't saved me...

45
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,473
I'm certain they
would've killed me.

46
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:19,039
[Broadcaster] I see. it sounds
as though Colonel Mustang

47
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,339
was expecting this coup d'état.

48
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:21,939
Did he say Mustang?

49
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,973
[Broadcaster] If it's not
too difficult, do you think

50
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:27,639
you could describe the exact
details of your rescue for us?

51
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,339
Okay.

52
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,873
She doesn't know
Selim's a Homunculus?

53
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,806
Don't you think that
someone should tell her?

54
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,506
How can we? We still
haven't even told her

55
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,506
that Fuhrer Bradley is missing.

56
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,806
[Bradley's Wife]
But that's when--

57
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,506
[Broadcaster and
Bradley's wife gasp]

58
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,039
There's something we haven't
told Mrs. Bradley yet...

59
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,039
but she needs to hear it.

60
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:50,673
The Fuhrer was
returning to Central...

61
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,539
But his train was blown up.

62
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,473
[Bradley's Wife gasps]

63
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,506
I'm sorry, but we
have yet to find him.

64
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,906
[Bradley's Wife
gasps, exhales]

65
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,439
[Broadcaster] Mrs. Bradley!

66
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,406
Is she still conscious?

67
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,039
Uh... Well, uh--
Mrs. Bradley fainted.

68
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,739
She's understandably
a little overwhelmed

69
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,039
by the news we all just
received. And about that...

70
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:14,673
What exactly did you
mean when you said

71
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:17,006
that you have yet
to find the Fuhrer?

72
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,306
Well you should
know this first...

73
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,373
The Colonel's suspected the
senior staff of foul play.

74
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:27,973
And he's expected them to
make a move for some time now.

75
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,806
So with the Fuhrer's train
having been bombed...

76
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,039
And the orders given to
assassinate Mrs. Bradley...

77
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,673
His suspicions were confirmed.

78
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:39,539
We know for a fact.
Someone's attempting

79
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,806
to overthrow the government.

80
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,506
[Cremin] Listen, you fool!

81
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,973
I want that
broadcast shut down!

82
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:48,806
Do you have any idea the
damage that this is causing?!

83
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,306
I only wish it was that
easy, sir... but I can't.

84
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,039
They've taken the
whole studio hostage..

85
00:04:54,073 --> 00:04:56,773
We're sitting here with
guns pointed at our heads..

86
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:58,839
We're lucky that
we're still alive.

87
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,939
The only reason they
haven't shot any of us

88
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:04,373
is because we're
following their orders.

89
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,039
Put Mustang on the phone!

90
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,473
I want to speak to
that traitor directly!

91
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,673
Uh, Mustang? He's, um...

92
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,939
Uh...

93
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
Ah! Ahh! Don't shoot!

94
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:24,506
Nooo! Don't shoot me!
I'm sorry!

95
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,639
[sound of phone
being hung up]

96
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:29,506
[busy signal]

97
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,773
[Cremin snarls]

98
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,339
[laughter]

99
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,573
How was my performance?

100
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,339
You should win an award!

101
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,839
Back to it! Don't
stop broadcasting!

102
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,639
Right!

103
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,473
There's no way
I'm gonna abandon

104
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,439
the story of the century!

105
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:46,706
[Broadcaster]
To continue with our story,

106
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:48,306
we now have an
exclusive message

107
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,806
from one of Colonel
Mustang's men.

108
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,806
So Colonel Mustang isn't
behind the uprising?

109
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,773
[Ross] Those of us giving our
support to Colonel Mustang...

110
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,339
We may be few in number...

111
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,939
[Brosh] That.. voice...
[Ross] But that won't stop us

112
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,906
from protecting the
legacy of the Fuhrer.

113
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,306
We'll do everything we can
to stop these traitors

114
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,339
in the name of justice.

115
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:09,439
[Brosh sighs joyfully]

116
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:12,039
[Grumman laughs]

117
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,639
Brilliant play, Mustang.
Taking advantage

118
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,339
of the Fuhrer's absence
and using his influence

119
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:19,739
any way you like
to suit your needs.

120
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:23,039
And invoking the name
of justice at that.

121
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:28,039
Let's keep our fingers crossed
that the public accepts it.

122
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,739
[Breda] You sounded like a pro.

123
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,406
And that last bit, about
"justice"... Nice touch.

124
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,073
Well, of course.
Everyone's willing

125
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:38,506
to fight for justice.
So I said it.

126
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,039
That's right. And in this war,
it belongs to us.

127
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,006
[indistinct murmurring]

128
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,039
[Man 1] Does anyone
know what's going on?

129
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,739
Mustang's men say that they're
trying to prevent an uprising.

130
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,473
Are you sure
he's not behind it?

131
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:53,506
[Ishvalan 1] Roy Mustang
is telling the truth.

132
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,373
We've just arrived in
Central from East Amestris.

133
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,039
We witnessed the wreckage
of the Fuhrer's train

134
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:00,839
with our own eyes. It is true.

135
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:02,906
The leader of your
country is missing...

136
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,073
And no one has even
informed you yet?

137
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:07,406
Our Fuhrer could be
dead for all we know.

138
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,506
Why would they keep all of us
in the dark about such a thing?

139
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,806
The military must be
staging a coup d'état!

140
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,306
[Citizen 8] But
who's behind it?!

141
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,639
[Citizen 9] If they
storm the radio station

142
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:16,906
and kill Mrs. Bradley...

143
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,839
Then we'll know it's
the senior staff.

144
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,739
[Citizen 11] Selim!
What about little Selim?!

145
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,739
[Citizen 12] Do you think
he's been taken prisoner?

146
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,739
[Citizen 13] I just
hope he's safe.

147
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,039
[concerned murmurs]

148
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,906
[Unidentified Citizen]
Mrs. Bradley...

149
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,339
[Gate Captain] What is the
garrison doing down there?!

150
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,639
[Subordinate 1] Well,
sir, the enemy seems

151
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:37,039
to possess more firepower
than we expected.

152
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,773
They're putting up
a strong offense.

153
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,506
Hmph. No excuse!
They're on foot.

154
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,839
I doubt they have
that much firepower!

155
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:47,039
[Subordinate 2] We have a
transmission from the garrison!

156
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,539
You should hear this.

00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,039
You're late checking in!

158
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,773
I want a detailed
rundown. Now go ahead.

159
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,506
[Garrison Soldier]
The... The Briggs soldiers!

160
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,773
Th-They actually have a--

161
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:58,839
Ah...! Hey, what's happening?!

162
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:00,906
[Gate Captain growls]

163
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,996
Sir? Is everything okay?
I mean, we aren't going to

164
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,787
lose the main gate
to them, are we, sir?

165
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,920
Of course not!

166
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:14,220
Ridiculous!
That's impossible!

167
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:17,454
They'd need a tank to
breach the main gate.

168
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,954
Huh?

169
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:21,387
What?!

170
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:23,954
[fighting sounds]

171
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:27,387
Maybe I could lend you
a hand... Fullmetal?

172
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,020
Colonel?!

[Gerso gurgles, Darius grunts]

174
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:32,754
You just manage
to make new friends

175
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,020
everywhere you go... Hm?

[Scar grunts]

177
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,187
Is that Scar?

178
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,020
I can't help but
think of the last time

179
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,687
we were here, Lieutenant.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,087
As I recall, you were
crying over me.

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,920
Shame I don't get to see that
softer side of you more often.

182
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,954
The last thing I'm gonna do
is start crying for you now.

183
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,920
Water makes you useless.

184
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,920
Save your banter for later!
Kill these things!

185
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,720
Hey, don't you dare
give me orders!

186
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:05,887
He's right! Just start
shooting at these white guys.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,187
No, save your ammo!

188
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,187
Bullets won't even
slow 'em down!

[Dummy roars]

190
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:13,987
Not again! How else
do we kill them?

191
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,354
They're Homunculi?

192
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:19,754
No... They aren't
healing themselves.

193
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,887
But they're not dying, either.

194
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,420
They've got to be powered
by Philosopher's Stones.

[Ed shudders]

201
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:07,187

It had to be done.

You damn fool! Why didn't
you go back to Xing?!

00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:12,561
But I.. I thought...
I just wanted to...

222
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:15,294
[Scar] Forget it. Don't cry.

223
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,861
[May] Please forgive me.
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:23,827
Bleh. Typical whiny humans.
You're making my stomach turn.

[Envy sighs]

226
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:32,494
I gotta admit, you guys really
made a serious mess down here.

227
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,561
So, we've got the
Fullmetal Alchemist

228
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:38,194
and the Flame Alchemist...
And there's even Scar...

229
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:41,761
And I've got a serious grudge
with you filthy chimera.

230
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:45,727
So, then... Who gets the
pleasure of being first to die?

231
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,827
[Roy] You're Envy, right?
[Envy] Hm?

232
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:51,394
You're the Homunculus who can
change his appearance at will.

233
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:55,694
Wow! You've heard
of me! I'm flattered!

234
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,661
Nice to meet you, Colonel.

235
00:11:57,694 --> 00:12:02,361
Hold on. You're teaming up
with him, Scar? You do know

236
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:05,361
that he helped reduce
Ishval to a hell on earth?

237
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:08,327
I'm aware of that.

238
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,794
What?! You're friends now?
You guys are no fun at all!

239

What happened to trying to
crush each other's windpipes?

240

Look at the two of you!

241
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:21,461
You obviously wanna
kill each other, so do it!

242
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:24,361
[Roy sighs] We aren't
going to be the pawns

00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,494
in your sick little
game anymore.

244
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:30,627
Really? And what
about your sick games?

245
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:33,761
Don't kid yourself, Mustang.
You know humans love to watch

other people suffer while
making fools of themselves.

247
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:39,161
I mean, why else
would you constantly

248
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,194
be at war with each other?

249
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,094
Hm. There really is
nothing quite like

250
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,294
watching fools dig
their own graves.

[Envy whistles]

252
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:52,294
Especially when that fool
is an arrogant Homunculus

253
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,827
who's too stupid to
see what he's doing.

254
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,127
[Envy] Hm...

255
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,427
[Roy] I've humored
you long enough.

256
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,727
So how about you answer
a question of mine?

257
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,827
I want you to tell me
who killed Maes Hughes.

258

[Ed gasps]

259
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,761
And I want the truth...
Homunculus.

260
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,827
Maria Ross did. Isn't that
why you burned her to death?

261
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:21,294
[Roy] Shut up.

262
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,194
I know that she didn't kill him.

263
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,427
Huh? You mean to tell me

264
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:29,127
that you scorched an innocent
girl to a pile of ashes?

265
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:31,594
Nicely done, you monster!

266
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,861
Wow. Must've been fun
telling her family...

267
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:36,261
Did you cry when you told them?

268
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,461
Or did you sit back quietly
and endure their outrage?

269
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:42,194
Quit running your
mouth, you idiot.

270
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:46,394
I'm sick of you Homunculi
giving me the runaround

271
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:49,827
when I ask you this question.

272
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,294
Tell me the truth or I'll
burn it out of you...

273
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:53,861
You worthless scum.

274
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,827
[Envy groans]

275
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:59,194
Tell me who's responsible
for his murder.

277
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,294
[Envy] Congratulations,
Colonel Mustang.

278
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,661
You've finally hunted
down your culprit.

[Roy and Hawkeye grunt]

280
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,827
[Envy giggles]

281
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:27,827
You're saying that
you killed Hughes?

282
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:31,561
I doubt a moron like you
could pull that off.

283
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:37,194
[Envy] Moron? Tell me who
the real moron is here.

284
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:39,227
Because I don't think it's me.

[Ed gasps]

286
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,161
I prefer to use that
term for someone

287
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,727
who falls for a
cheap trick like this.

288

[Roy gasps]

289
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:51,661
Ha ha! You should see your face!

290
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,661
Ah, you're not gonna
believe this...

291
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,427
But that was the same look on
Hughes' face when I shot him!

292
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,161
The utter shock...
The dumb confusion...

293
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,427
You could see every
emotion he felt

294
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:04,561
as his own wife shot him.

295
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:08,194
Ah... It... was.. great!

296
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,294
[Ed seethes]

297
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,294
[Roy] That's enough.

298
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,827
You were stupid
enough to confess...

299
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,361
and even more stupid to boast.

300
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:23,261
Everything you've said is
fuel on your funeral pyre.

301
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:27,594
So then... I think
I'll begin...

302
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,627
by burning out your tongue.

303

[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

305
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,567
Stand down, all of you.

306
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,167
I'm dealing with him on my own.

307
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,367
This one is mine
and mine alone...

308
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
Well. You heard him.

309
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,733
Let's keep moving and
find this Father guy. Ah!

310
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,667
[Envy] I don't remember giving
you permission to leave.

311
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,600
I still owe you some pain
and misery for what you did--

312
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,433
[Envy screams]

313
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,733
Keep your eyes on me, Envy.

314
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,633
Our conversation is the only
one that should concern you.

315
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:18,900
[Envy grunts]

316
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,633
[Roy] It's kind of
interesting how quickly

317
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,767
the tongue can be rendered
to a bubbling grease...

318
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,367
It's surprising how easy
it burns... Isn't it?

319
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,567
Lieutenant.. You really
think the two of you--

320
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
[Hawkeye] Edward. Just go.
We can handle this one.

321
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,867
Are you sure?

322
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,800
The Lieutenant said go, Elric.

323
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,400
You've got more important
matters to deal with.

324
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,267
He's right, Ed. Now let's go.

325
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,767
[Ed] Hold on!

326
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,733
Damn it!

327
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,533
[Darius] The Colonel's
gonna be fine.

328
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,200
You saw that back there.

329
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,667
This won't even be
a challenge for him.

330
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,333
That's not exactly what
I'm worried about.

331
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,833
Huh? Then what's the problem?

332
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,667
[Envy] So... You've
been rather dogged

333
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,667
in your pursuit
of Hughes' killer.

334
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,667
You're a true friend
to the very end...

335
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,333
[Envy yells, roars]

336
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,467
Keep your distance, Lieutenant.

337
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,400
Out of respect for your
tireless quest for vengeance,

338
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,833
I'll give you the fight
you're looking for.

339
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:44,433
I'm not exactly capable of
treading lightly in this body.

340
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,500
So you better give
it all you've--

341
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,733
[Envy roars in pain]

342
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:53,933
What's it like having the fluid
inside of your eyes boil?

343
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,267
I'd imagine it
might sting a little.

344
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,400
Damn you!

345
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:02,267
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

346
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,800
[Roy] I can't believe you'd
give me a bigger target.

347
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,400
Did you think that
size would increase

348
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:10,933
your chance of winning?
You idiot. Stand up, monster!

349
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,933
Go on and regenerate yourself.

350
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,800
You'll suffer a thousand
deaths before I'm done.

351
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,400
[Envy] <i>That's right.</i>
<i>How could I forget?</i>

352
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,667
<i>He's the one who</i>
<i>incinerated Lust to death.</i>

353
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,600
[Envy growls]

354
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
[Roy] You coward!
[Hawkeye] Colonel!

355
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,900
[Roy] You wait here,
Lieutenant!

356
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,833
I'm going to take
care of him myself!

357
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,300
[May] This way.
It's gotta be this way.

358
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,400
This place is creepy.

359
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:49,533
These tubes are like veins.
And the further we get,

360
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,400
the more it feels like I've
got a bad case of heartburn.

361
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,233
I'm not surprised.
I've got it too.

362
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:59,567
There's a strong mass
of rancid chi ahead.

363
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Rancid chi?

364
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,933
You know how you can
feel a crowd's fear

365
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:06,400
before a disaster? It's like
that, but it's far worse.

366
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,267
I don't really understand...

367
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,167
but it sure is scarin'
the hell outta' me.

368
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,700
[Gerso] This is the last place

369
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,433
I'd want to run into
that Father guy.

370
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,367
Scar. I need to talk to you.

371
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,367
It's about the Flame
Alchemist, isn't it?

372
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,900
It wasn't that long ago
that I was a monster.

373
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:36,267
I understand the burning desire
for revenge all too well.

374
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,633
The way he's headed...

375
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,833
He will destroy himself
in the flames of hatred...

376
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,733
And it's doubtful that
he will ever recover.

377
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,633
[Ed gasps]

378
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,533
[Envy screams]

379
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,933
[Roy] Show yourself, Envy!

380
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,367
Damn it!

381
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,333
[Roy] Come out now.

382
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,433
Otherwise, I'm gonna
ignite your bone marrow.

383
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,667
Roy! What's up?

384
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,900
[Envy] <i>Stupid human!</i>
<i>He won't kill his friend!</i>

385
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,400
[Roy growls, snaps]

386
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,800
[Envy screams]

387
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,533
What's wrong with you?!

388
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:25,433
You didn't even hesitate to
incinerate your best friend!

389
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,733
Maes Hughes is dead.
That's a fact.

390
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,400
And you invoke his image?

391
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,933
You must be a glutton
for punishment. Hya!

392
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,700
[Envy screams]

393
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,467
Damn! I'll show you
real punishment!

394
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,400
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

395
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:48,400
[Envy] Again?! My eyes!
They're gone!

396
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,633
[Roy] So I'm curious.

397
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,733
Were you trying to get close
so I wouldn't use heavy fire?

398
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,733
No one told you that I
can do pinpoint aiming?

399
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,267
Too bad for you...
Because I can!

400
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

401
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:09,267
Colonel... I'm sorry,
but I can't wait.

402
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,700
[Envy screams, writhes]

403
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,167
Tch. You're not getting away.

404
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,200
[Envy chuckles]

405
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:38,200
[footsteps]

406
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,900
I told you to stay
behind, Lieutenant.

407
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
just sit there, sir.

408
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,800
Where's Envy?

409
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,533
He outran me. This place
is like a labyrinth.

410
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,933
Well, you might as well help me
kill him now that you're here.

411
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,800
Stay right by my
side, Lieutenant.

412
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,733
[Roy] Hm?

413
