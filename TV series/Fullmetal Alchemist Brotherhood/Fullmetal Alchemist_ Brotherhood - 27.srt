Because we can change.

320
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,472
I know it.

321
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,572
We may be weak...

322
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:48,306
But we just have
to be... If not...

323
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,306
Then we wouldn't have
any reason to grow...

324
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,372
to get strong...

325
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:55,139
I know that it may
seem futile to you.

326
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,472
But it's not...

327
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,606
Because we are
getting stronger

328
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,839
with every
step we take.

329
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,306
[ROY]
And in turn they'll
protect the ones they love.

330
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,439
It seems like the least

331
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,306
we tiny humans can
do for each other.

332
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,472
[LING]
But I... I wasn't
ready for this...

333
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:14,472
Lan Fan was though...

334
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,306
She made the decision
that I was too weak to make.

335
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,972
[AL]
I'm sick of
watching people die...!

336
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,039
And I can't just sit back

337
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:21,506
and take it anymore!

338
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,439
I won't let anyone
else get killed!

339
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,406
Not when I
can protect them!

340
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,572
I won't run away this.

341
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:31,306
We'll knock that
Truth jerk on his butt!

342
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,106
Al!

343
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:40,172
Al! Come on! Please...!

344
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,206
Hurry, Al!

345
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,239
Alphonse!

346
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:51,572
Look at me!
I'll come back!

347
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,339
Just you wait!

348
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,172
You see? I'm sure
we can change...

349
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,906
Because we're weak...
And because we die.

350
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,972
[TRISHA]
We have to fight
in order to live...

351
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:05,372
And that's what
will make us strong.

352
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,172
And if that's not enough...

353
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:08,406
If you're still not convinced

354
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:11,039
that we can change...

355
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:14,272
Then think about us.

356
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,106
All of the days we spent...

357
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,406
With our family in Resembool.

358
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,206
I was dreaming...

359
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:28,539
Thanks for all the help.

360
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:05,906
[NARRATOR]
If you find
yourself overwhelmed

361
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:08,606
with a debilitating fear
by the unfathomable power

362
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,239
looming before you,

363
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,472
then you should
run like a coward.

364
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:13,906
And if you lose
what you believe

365
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,972
to be your only power,

366
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:17,439
then you might
as well succumb

367
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,239
to your own weakness.

368
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,872
This is the battle
that you feared was coming.

369
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:24,506
Put everything you've
got into it, human.

370
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,906
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

371
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:30,472
Episode Twenty Eight... Father.
