learn the truth.

That through the
application of science,

111

been given the power

about a hero who
flew on wings made of wax.

117

He thought he could touch the
sun, but when he got too close,

his wings melted, and he came
crashing back down to earth...

Ah, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Welcome to the home

Father Cornello!

160
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:31,214
[Cornello] I must apologize
for my disciples' behavior.

161
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:33,181
It would seem they've
been misguided...

162
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,081
[Ed] Okay, let's say I
believe you weren't the one

163
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,948
guiding them. What next?

164
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,948
Have you come to learn
the ways of Leto?

165
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,148
Well, there are a few things
I'm curious about...

166
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,148
Like how you've been
using second rate alchemy

167
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,448
to deceive your followers.

168
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,714
My dear boy, I don't
know what you mean.

169
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:49,348
What your doubting
eyes see as alchemy

170
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,948
are the miracles of
the Sun God Leto.

171
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,081
Look again. Could
mere alchemy create

172
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:55,814
something from
nothing in this way?

173
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:56,781
[gasp]

174
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:59,048
[Ed] Yeah, that's what
I didn't get at first...

175
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,081
How can you perform
transmutations

176
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,148
that ignore the law of
equivalent exchange?

177
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,781
As I said,
because it isn't alchemy!

178
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,814
But then I started
thinking about it...

179
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,214
If you'd somehow managed to
acquire a certain object

180
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,848
to amplify your alchemy...

181
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,948
one that's said to make
the impossible possible.

182
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,814
That would
explain everything.

183
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:17,781
What...?

184
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:20,681
[Ed] I'm talking about
the Philosopher's Stone.

185
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:23,114
Your ring.
That's it, isn't it?

186
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,348
I've been looking for that.

187
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,081

The ring is just a ring.

I derive my power.

sell that line, huh?

191
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:35,081
If that's the way
you want to play it,

192
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,281
I guess I'll have
to come up there

193

00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:41,981
We don't wanna have
to rough you up.

309
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,715
[laughing]
hahahaha-ha

310
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,115
[screaming]
uhwaaaaaaahhh

311
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,715
Don't go easy just 'cause
he's a kid, ya got that?!

312
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,615
[yelling]
oh-haaaahhahuhh

Ha Ha ha haaaaaaa

314
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,481
[Alphonse] What do you think
of Cornello now, Rose?

315
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,681
He just opened fire. He didn't
care that you were in the way.

316
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,448
[Rose] But... that's because--

317
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:12,015
What he said back there,
is true, isn't it?

318
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,848
[Al] We're not evil.

319
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,115
All we wanted was to see
our mom's smile again.

320
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,781
But our transmutation failed...

321
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:24,915
<i>What we made...</i>
<i>wasn't even human.</i>

322
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,015
[wind gushing]

323
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,915
We learned our
mistake the hard way...

324
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,748
People don't come back
from the dead... Not ever.

325
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,715
That's not true... I mean--

326
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,915
[Al] Alchemy is based on the
law of equivalent exchange...

327
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:43,515
The price of even a failed human
transmutation was enormous...

328
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:46,015
It cost my brother
his left leg...

329
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:48,681
and it cost me my whole body.

330
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,715
Do you see it? My brother
drew that with his own blood.

331
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,915
His leg had been taken.
He was bleeding.

332
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,148
I can't imagine
the pain he was in.

333
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:01,281
But through all that,

334
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:04,048
he still gave up his right
arm to transmute my soul,

335
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,681
and bonded me to
this suit of armor.

336
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:12,815
Now, I just want to help him get
his body back to the way it was.

337
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:16,515
He wants to find a way to
get me back to normal, too.

338
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:20,915
It won't be easy. We might
even get killed along the way.

339
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:25,548
But that's the path we chose...
All we can do is keep moving.

340
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:29,581
[Rose] But... Father
Cornello said...

341
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,581
He said he could do
it. He promised me...

342
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,148
Just because you and
your brother failed,

343
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:34,548
that doesn't mean--

344
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,581
It doesn't mean he will!

345
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,515
[running footsteps]

346
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,181
There you are,
you infernal brat!

347
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,815
Look, can we just cut
the crap and talk here?

348
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:47,581
All I want are some straight
answers about the Stone.

349
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,448
Tell me what I need to know
and I'll be on my way...

350
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,181
...or we could get
the military involved...

351
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,815
[angry grunt]

352
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,848
Ask your questions.

353
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,681
You could do anything with
the Philosopher's Stone, right?

354
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:03,048
So why waste all of that power
performing phony "miracles"?

355
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,681
Because with each miracle,

356
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,681
I can attract new
believers to the order,

357
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:10,548
believers who would lay down
their lives for my sake.

358
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:12,215
I'm slowly building an army!

359
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,515
A legion of holy warriors,
unafraid to die!

360
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:16,781
In a few more more years,

361
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:19,715
I'll be ready to unleash this
mindless horde upon the world!

362
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,481
And I'll use the Philosopher's
Stone to tear this country apart

363
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:26,715
Who knows? I might even carve
you out a slice for you!

364
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,615
[evil laughter]

365
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,681
[childish laughter]

366
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,648
Wait, what are you
laughing about?

367
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,948
I knew it. You really
are a novice, aren't you?

368
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,815
[Cornello echoing]
You don't mean that--!

369
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:47,581
[Al] There were never
any miracles, Rose...

370
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:50,181
He lied to you.
He lied to everyone.

371
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:52,515
[Cornello echoing]
<i>Why you...!</i>

372
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:53,548
[Cornello through speakers]
<i>How long?!</i>

373
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,181
<i>How long has that been on?!</i>

374
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:56,081
[Edward through speakers]
<i>From the start.</i>

375
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:58,548
<i>Your "believers"</i>
<i>heard every word.</i>

376
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,548
[Cornello] <i>How could you?!</i>

377
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,215
You'll pay dearly for this!

378
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,681
[magical ringing]

379
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,115
Sorry... Not today!

380
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:09,581
[Ed] Just face it...
you're outclassed here.

381
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,748
I am without rival!

382
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,181
[magical laser lightning]

[gasping in pain]
ughh ukggg uh

385
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:24,881
It-It's a rebound!

386
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,715
No! I won't be
disgraced like this!

387
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:30,215
Now, boy... Behold...

388
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:34,548
...the chosen emissary
of the Sun God Leto!

[Ed wincing in pain]

392
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:56,715
My word is the divine
word of god himself!

393
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,881
My fist is the almighty
fist of judgment!

394
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,581
Oh, yeah?
The fist of god, huh?

395
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,748
Well if that's what
you want, you can have it!

396
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,181
[magic electricity]

397
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,815
[yelling]
OUGHAAAAAAAH!

398
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:28,648
Shut up! Just give me
the Philosopher's Stone!

399
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:37,181
What the hell? The stone...

400
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,515
It's supposed to be
perfect material!

401
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,815
How did it just
break like that?!

402
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,181
[Cornello] I don't know!
I don't know anything about it!

403
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,915
Spare me! Please! I-I was
wrong! Please! I beg you!

404
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,048
It's a damn fake.

405
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,715
[Cornello] Please don't.
I'm helpless without the stone.

406
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,081
Spare me, please!

407
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,781
You mean, we went
through all this...

408
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,681
risked our lives just for
this one possible chance...

409
00:19:57,715 --> 00:20:00,081
...and it's a fake.

410
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,981
So, uh...
What about me?

411
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:06,681
I don't care what you do!
Just get outta here!

412
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,448
Right!

413
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,215
[Alphonse] <i>And what</i>
<i>about the Stone?</i>

414
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,848
[Edward] <i>A phony.</i>
<i>Just like him.</i>

415
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,881
[Al] <i>Oh.</i>

416
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,281
I'm sorry, Al.
For a while there,

417
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:21,448
I thought we'd really found
a way to get your body back.

418
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,481
[Rose] Give me the
Philosopher's Stone!

419
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:26,215
[Al] Rose...

420
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:27,981
Like I was
just saying...

421
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,081
It was a fake.
It wasn't real.

422
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:32,081
And besides,
it's shattered now...

423
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:34,981
Liar!... You want to keep it
for yourself, don't you?!

424
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,748
So you can use it on your
bodies... that's right!

425
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,181
And so you can try to bring
your mother back again!

426
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:41,815
You shut up!

427
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:46,581
People don't come back from
the dead, Rose. Not ever...

428
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,948
Not ever...

429
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,115
[Rose] But he promised me...

430
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:58,148
He said if I prayed,
it would happen. A miracle...

431
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,081
That hope was all I had left!

432
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,648
What am I supposed
to believe in now?!

433
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:09,181
Tell me what to do... please...

434
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,448
I can't tell you that.
You have to figure it out.

435
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:20,615
[Ed] Stand up and walk...
Keep moving forward...

436
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:23,648
You've got two good
legs. So use them...

437
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,648
You're strong enough
to make your own path.

438
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,581
[angry mob yelling]
Bring him out here!

439
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,681
That damn brat.
It's all ruined--

440
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:44,648
everything I've worked for...!

441
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,215
[Lust] Yes, all that
hard work for nothing.

442
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:50,815
I knew we should have just
incited a little rebellion.

443
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:52,048
[Cornello] You--!

444
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,048
I'm hungry, Lust.
Can I eat the old man?

445
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,881
Please? He's big and fat.

446
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,548
Not this one, Gluttony...

447
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:00,515
We don't want you giving
yourself indigestion.

448
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:03,581
Now you, too?! Everyone is
mocking me! I won't stand fo--

00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,648
[Lust] I'd say this
concludes our business.

452
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,715
Just as things were beginning
to look promising, too...

453
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:21,981
Now I suppose we'll have to
start over from scratch...

454
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:25,481
[Lust] Father won't be
pleased. In any case,

455
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,515
it's time we started
thinking about our next move.
