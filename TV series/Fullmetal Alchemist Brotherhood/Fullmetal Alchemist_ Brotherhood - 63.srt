Why did you

How did I disappoint you?

[TRUTH] You were incapable

[TRUTH] You stole your
power from others...

You rejected
your human origins...

129
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,668
and chose to covet
the power of what you call God.

00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,750
[TRUTH] You never grew
beyond your days in the flask.

Did you truly think
you'd become superior

132
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,208
to humans by removing
your seven desires?

[TRUTH]
Don't make me laugh.

[HOMUNCULUS]
What's wrong with that...?

I only wanted

I wanted this world's

Why should
I be punished for that...?!

What's wrong with
craving knowledge...?

139
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,875
What's wrong with
seeking perfection?!

Well, speak...!

Who the hell do
you think you are?!

[TRUTH]
Who am I?

145
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,793
One name you might have
for me is "the world"...

146
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:54,125
Or you might call
me "the universe"...

147
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
or perhaps "God"...

148

or perhaps "the truth"...

149
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,250
I am all...
and I am one...

150
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,500
So of course...

151
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,250
this also means
that I am you.

152
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,375
I'm the truth
of your despair...

153
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,583
the inescapable price
of your boastfulness.

154
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,543
[FATHER] Humans who
would dare to play god

155
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,750
must pay a steep price
for their arrogance...

156
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,625
[FATHER]
That is Truth.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,208
[TRUTH]
And now...

158
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,875
I will bestow upon you
the despair you deserve.

Home at last.

316
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,166
[AL]
It's so warm.

317
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,750
[MAY CHANG]
Alphonse.

318
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,750
[MAY CHANG]
Alphonse!

319
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:46,960
[AL]
May!

320
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,333
[MAY CHANG sobbing]
I was... so scared!

321
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,708
[AL]
I bet... Sorry...

322
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,918
It was wrong of me to
put you through that.

323
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,375
It's okay now...
Thank you.

324
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,625
[BROADCASTER] You're
listening to Radio Capital.

325
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,668
To conclude our
coverage of today's events,

326
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,793
General Armstrong
and Colonel Mustang

327
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,000
have taken control
of Central Command

328
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,960
and successfully halted
the military coup de tat

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,835
perpetrated by
the senior staff.

330
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,291
[BROADCASTER]
The coup was centered

331
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,668
around an alchemic procedure

332
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,543
which would have sacrificed
the nation's population.

333
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,960
Details of the procedure
have yet to be released,

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,625
but General Cremin and
General Edison have been

335
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:32,500
apprehended as two of
the lead conspirators.

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,875
[BROADCASTER] All of
their opposing forces...

337
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,875
have now been disarmed.

338
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,918
[BROADCASTER]
Our Fuhrer, King Bradley...

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,375
and his son, Selim...

340
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,708
tragically lost their lives
amidst the day's turmoil.

341
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,291
[BROADCASTER] Colonel Mustang
released an official statement

342
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,708
that he would carry on
with the Fuhrer's wishes,

343
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,250
and that he would
personally oversee

344
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,918
all matters of
national security.

345
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:07,625
[HOMUNCULUS] You are the
one who gave me blood, right?

346
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,208
[HOMUNCULUS]
Don't you even want freedom?

347
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,960
[HOMUNCULUS]
Hohenheim?

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,875
[YOUNG HOHENHEIM]
Okay then,

349
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:17,708
what is it that
makes you happy?

350
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,960
[HOMUNCULUS]
Well...

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,918
I'd hate to be guilty
of asking too much,

352
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,083
but I think I'd be happy if I
could just leave this flask...

353
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,750
[HOHENHEIM]
You were born of my blood...

354
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:34,000
dwarf in the flask...
Homunculus.

355
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,125
[HOHENHEIM]
In the end...

356
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,500
You and I were still as one...

357
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:42,918
And I'm...

358
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,875
[ARMSTRONG]
Mr. Hohenheim.

359
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:52,083
[ARMSTRONG] I personally
saw to it that your sons

360
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,918
were admitted to the hospital.

361
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,750
[HOHENHEIM]
Thank you.

362
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm grateful for your help.

363
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,960
[ARMSTRONG]
Nonsense...

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,333
I'm the one who's
truly grateful.

365
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,208
[ARMSTRONG]
We're all in debt

366
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,543
to the efforts of
Edward and Alphonse...

367
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,835
Without those boys'
relentless courage...

368
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,918
this nation
would be no more...

369
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,875
Thank you very much.

370
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,041
[HOHENHEIM]
Thank you.

371
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,668
[HOHENHEIM]
Hello, Trisha... I'm home.

372
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,543
So get this...

373
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,835
Ed actually called
me his father.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,083
Although he did
preface it with "rotten."

375
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,250
Living through all of
these endless years...

376
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,500
I always felt like I'd
been struck with a curse.

377
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:34,708
But then I found you
and we had our sons...

378
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,793
and I suddenly felt blessed...

379
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:39,960
Grateful for the life I had.

380
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've had a fulfilling life...

381
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,375
Thanks to you...

382
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:49,041
It's been enough.

383
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Thank you... Trisha.

384
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,793
But now...

385
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:58,835
Believe it or not,

386
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,418
I actually want
to keep on living.

387
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,500
I guess I'm pretty hopeless...

388
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,291
Aren't I, Trisha?

389
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,125
[PINAKO]
Hohenheim?

390
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,333
I didn't know
you were back.

391
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,835
Silly old fool.

392
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,458
Well, at least you
died with a smile

393
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,875
on your face, my friend.

394
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,668
[NARRATOR] There's no such thing
as an absolute and final ending,

395
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:10,166
for it is always followed
by a new beginning.

396
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,333
The future is yours
to shape as you wish.

397
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:17,208
Craft it with hope upon
a foundation of peace.

398
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,668
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

399
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,750
The final episode:
"Journey's End."

400
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:30,708
Step forward. Embrace your life
and the world that nurtures it.
