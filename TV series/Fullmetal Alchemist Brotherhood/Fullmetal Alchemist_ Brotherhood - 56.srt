Did you say monsters?

319
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,588
What are you talking about?

320
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:44,988
[EXPLOSION]

321
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:46,622
[MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS]

[GAMELAN COUGHS]

323
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:50,622
[GAMELAN] What is that?!
What the hell's going on?

324
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:52,188
[CENTRAL SOLDIER 12]
Wait. I think I see something.

325
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:53,655
[CENTRAL SOLDIER 12 YELLS]

326
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:00,055
[THUD]

327
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,722
[SOLDIERS SCREAM]

328
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:08,888
Whatever's going on down there
doesn't sound too good.

329
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:16,122
Ah...!

330
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:21,155
[GUNFIRE]

331
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,988
[METAL CLANGS]

332
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:25,622
Ahh!

333

[BRIGGS SOLDIER 11 YELLS]

334
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:36,155
Ahh...!

335
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:39,622
[GREED]
Heh... Nice moves, old man.

336
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,288
And thanks for the help...
You really saved my ass.

337
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:44,088
I wasn't trying to
save your ass...

338
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:47,022
I was saving the body
of the young lord.

339
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,655
Well it's
the same ass...

340
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:52,288
Your sickening chi is radiating
from the Prince's body.

341
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:56,755
Although... it did actually
help me to locate you.

342
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:59,922
So... Why don't you tell me
who this is we're fighting...

343
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:03,622
Especially since neither of us
could leave a scratch on him.

344
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,622
That's Fuhrer
King Bradley, old man.

345

[FU GASPS]

346
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,188
Wellll...

347
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:17,688
This is the first time
I've actually laid eyes on him.

348
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:23,288
So now I know...

349
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:27,522
...what the bastard who took my
granddaughter's arm looks like!

350
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:07,555
[NARRATOR]
A man must come to know his
enemy as clearly as he knows

351
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:11,222
his own self in order to
see his victory in battle.

352
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:13,888
And while their two
lives may end as one,

353
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,588
he will not die for nothing.

354
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,955
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood,

355

Episode 57: Eternal Leave.

356
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,622
Farewell, my powerful master.

357
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:32,255
I promise to eternally watch
over you from the other side.
