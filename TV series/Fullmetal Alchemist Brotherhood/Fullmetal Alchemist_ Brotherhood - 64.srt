1
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,400
[KNOCS] Can you
tell me which room

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,633
Colonel Roy Mustang is in?

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,100
[RECPTIONIST]
Well...

4
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,533
Can I ask what your
relation to the patient is?

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,133
I'm his private practice doctor.

6
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,366
Just tell him Knocs
is here to see him.

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,600
[KNOCS] Ah, hey
there, young lady.

8
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,533
[ROSS] Well, this
is a nice surprise.

9
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,033
And who is this
you've brought with you?

10
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,266
[KNOCS] That's a
bit of a long story...

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,766
But if you need to know...

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
He's kind of
my secret weapon.

13
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,766
[KNOCS]
So how's he doin'...?

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
Has this whole
thing got him down?

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,100
[ROY] The farming
method that's used

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,333
in the Ishvalan region...

17
00:00:58,366 --> 00:00:59,700
They mainly double crop.

18
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,633
[BREDA]
Nope... that's close...

19
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,233
But it's called
dual-cropping...

20
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,166
Now think...

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,766
You've gotta know
this stuff inside out.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,633
[ROY] Yeah...
And I do know it.

23
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,766
[BREDA]
Is that so...?

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,700
Which two crops

25
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,133
are the Ishvalans
known for cultivating?

26
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,500
[ROY]
Wheat and cotton.

27
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,133
[BREDA] That's correct...
Not a bad guess.

28
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,566
[ROY] C'mon, give
me some credit...

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,200
I've been researching
this stuff long before now.

30
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,266
[ROSS] He's hoping to
make amends with Ishval...

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,400
He wants to
make things right

32
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,333
before becoming
the Fuhrer.

33
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,500
[KNOCS]
Well... ambitious.

34
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,800
And what makes him so sure

35
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,266
he'll become the Fuhrer?

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,466
[ROY] That voice...

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,233
How long have you
been in here, Dr. Knocs?

38
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,033
[KNOCS] Not long...

39
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,700
So you don't
look so bad...

40
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,400
How're you adjusting?

41
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,500
[ROY] Well...
I can't get any rest...

42
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,766
Thanks to these pests.

43
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,766
[KNOCS] No, I meant
those eyes of yours, Roy.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,066
How are they?

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,333
[ROY]
Right.

46
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,766
I envisioned a better future...

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,533
and this is the price
I had to pay for it.

48
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,400
[KNOCS] And are
you okay with that?

49
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,666
[ROY] Well,
I wouldn't say okay...

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,766
but still...

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,466
I won't let it stop me
from moving forward, either.

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
[KNOCS]
So tell me something...

53
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,066
You're gonna aid in
the restructure of Ishval?

54
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,233
[ROY] The Ishvalan War
of Extermination...

55
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,633
That's where
everything went wrong.

56
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,500
[KNOCS]
You're right, there...

57
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,233
Both for our country...

58
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,166
And for you and me.

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,666
[ROY]
It's time to correct it.

60
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,733
[KNOCS]
Correct it?

61
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,500
[ROY] I'm calling off
the military occupation...

62
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,100
And then I'll
return their holy land

63
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,233
to the Ishvalans left
living in the slums...

64
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,366
There's still a
lot to be done.

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
[FUERY]
We owe them plenty...

66
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,166
We'd all be dead now

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
if it weren't for Scar
and the Ishvalans...

68
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,433
It's the very least we
can do to repay them.

69
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,366
[FALMAN]
Colonel...

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,733
I brought all the
materials you asked for.

71
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,300
[HAWKEYE] We know that
this won't erase our sins...

72
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,433
but it's not too
late to fix things.

73
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,666
[KNOCS] This room just
reeks of optimism...

74
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,233
Hey, Dr. Marcoh,
listen to this....

75
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,566
They're already one
step ahead of you in here.

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,500
[ROY] Marcoh...?
Dr. Marcoh's here?

77
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,414
[MARCOH]
Colonel Mustang...

78
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:16,747
[MARCOH] I've brought a
Philosopher's Stone with me.

79
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,347
I believe that it might be able

80
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,514
to return your eyesight.

81
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,614
[ROY]
I suppose so.

82
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,347
[MARCOH]
This Stone here...

83
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,747
I created this Stone

84
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:34,081
by sacrificing the
lives of many Ishvalans.

85
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,181
[MARCOH]
It might be presumptuous

86
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,014
of me to ask this, but...

87
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:41,347
if your... intentions are
to help their relatives...

88
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,714
[MARCOH]
No.

89
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:50,747
I have no right to speak for
those whose lives I've taken...

90
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,414
So I'm asking this as
a personal request...

91
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,381
Let me heal you with this
stone so you can restore Ishval.

92
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,514
[ROY] I know some people
who might not like this...

93
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,381
Especially Fullmetal.

94
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:13,214
[ROY] But I will
accept your offer.

95
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:17,147
[ROY] And I'll devote my life
to seeing Ishval restored...

96
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:19,114
But first thing's first.

97
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:21,081
[ROY]
There's someone else

98
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:24,481
who needs that Stone
even more than I do.

99
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,281
[ROY] You can heal
me after you heal him.

100
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:35,447
[phone ringing]

101
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:36,581
[HAVOC] From our
hearts to your home,

102
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,981
you've reached the
Havoc General Store!

103
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,681
[HAVOC]
Hey, Breda... What's up?

104
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,147
[HAVOC] Do what...?
Come to Central...?

105
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:49,414
You'll explain
when I get there...?

106
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,147
This better be worth it.

107
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,347
[OLIVIER] How are
you healing, Scar?

108
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,747
[SCAR]
Why did you save me?

109
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,514
[OLIVIER] The only
interest I had in saving you

110
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,347
was for your
alkahestry...

111
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,147
But plans do change...

112
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,281
Colonel Mustang's
requested Major Miles

113
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:09,214
to assist him in dealing
with Ishvalan affairs.

114
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,214
[MILES]
So...

115
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,214
I thought you might
be able to assist me...

116
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,747
Not as Scar...
the killer that is...

117
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,547
But as a true Ishvalan.

118
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,647
[MILES]
How 'bout it...?

119
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:23,014
Will you help me spread
the teachings of Ishvala?

120
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:28,281
[MILES] We can't allow our
religion and culture to die out.

121
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,314
That would be the
death of our race.

122
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,747
And this is our chance...

123
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,081
We can rescue our people.

124
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,581
<i>[SCAR] Is this why</i>
<i>I was saved from death...?</i>

125
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:42,614
<i>Have you given me</i>
<i>this responsibility</i>

126
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:46,547
<i>as my reason to</i>
<i>continue living, brother?</i>

127
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,747
[SCAR]
I accept.

128
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,481
I'll join you...
From now on...

129
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:54,047
I'll follow you
wherever you see fit.

130
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:57,347
[OLIVIER] All right, Miles,
you can take it from here.

131
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,581
Try not to disappoint me.

132
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:00,681
[MILES]
Sir!

133
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,347
<i>[OLIVIER]</i>
<i>Oh, Mustang...</i>

134
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,481
<i>I wish I could see</i>
<i>the look on your face...</i>

135
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:07,747
<i>when you find out</i>
<i>Scar's still alive.</i>

136
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,647
[OLIVIER]
Scar...

137
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,714
Why don't you tell
us your real name?

138
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,514
[SCAR]
I've died twice now...

139
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,714
I'm neither of the
people I once was...

140
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:26,314
I don't need a name...

141
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:28,314
Call me anything.

142
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,747
[OLIVIER]
Fair enough.

143
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,247
You take care... Ishvalan.

144
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,214
[ED]
Are you okay?

145
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,081
[AL] I didn't realize
my muscles had atrophied

146
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,047
so much on the other side.

147
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,981
[ED] Do you want
me to carry you?

148
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,247
[AL]
No. Thanks....

149
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,114
I can walk around on my own.

150
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,647
[AL] I'll just move
at my own pace...

151
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,481
You can go ahead if you want.

152
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:08,781
[ED] Nope...
We left home together...

153
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,114
and that's how
we're gonna return.

154
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:19,581
[AL] Well...
we better get moving then.

155
00:07:19,614 --> 00:07:21,114
[ED]
Yep.

156
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,347
[AL] So, brother...
How's the leg?

157
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,347
[ED]
Well... Ehh...

158
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,614
I haven't maintained it
in a while, so y'know...

159
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:32,714
It's stiff.

160
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,081
[AL]
Thank you, brother.

161
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,714
[ED] Huh...?
Thanks for what?

162
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,481
[AL]
Oh, never mind.

163
00:07:41,514 --> 00:07:44,214
[ED] Whatever...
Quit acting so weird.

164
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,247
[AL] I wonder
how Ling is doing...

165
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,247
Do you think they
made it back to Xing?

166
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,747
[ED] It's been two
months since they left...

167

[LING] You're about
as stupid as I am...

181
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:32,081
Getting mixed up with
this country's problems.

182
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,014
And you didn't even end up

183
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:37,447
with a Philosopher's Stone.

184
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,747
[LING] You know
what this means...

185
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,347
My clan won.

186
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,547
[LING] As far as
your clan goes...

187
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:48,614
The Yao family...

188
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,114
will protect
yours at all costs.

189
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,281

I accepted a Homunculus

190
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:57,181
as a friend, now didn't I...?

191
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:58,347
If I did that...

192
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,081
Then I can accept
the Changs...

193
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,381
and all of the
other families too.

194
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,681
[LING] Whoa, careful
with the tears, there...

195
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,314
You're gonna drown yourself...

196
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:11,214
I didn't think I'd have

197
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,447
to start protecting
you this quickly.

198
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:14,481
[MAY CHANG]
Trying to accept

199
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,481
and protect
everyone is just...

200
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,347
It's too greedy!

00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:20,681
[LING]
Ahhh...

202
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:23,114
I guess he rubbed
off on me after all.

203
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:30,481
[LING] Alright then...
Time to go home.

You're leaving?

205
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,347
[LING]
Yeah...

206
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,547
We need to get home
so we can bury Fu.

Especially you, Alphonse...

00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:55,514
You got pretty close
with a certain princess...

212
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:58,647
You aiming to be the
future prince of Xing?

213
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,481
[AL] C'mon...
She is a nice girl, though.

214
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,047
But forget about that...

215
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,247
What about you...

Yow!

It was worth it.

[AL] Brother...
What's taking so long?

232
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:09,982
[ED]
These damn chores

she's making tea

So...

245
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,149
I've been thinking
about something lately.

thinkin' the same thing.

00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:49,982
[MRS. BRADLEY]
So tell me...

249
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,515
How's work been lately?

250
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,049
[GRUMMAN]
Exhausting!

251
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,249
There's a new
problem every day

252
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,982
and they're sending
me to an early grave.

253
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,149
But I've got help...

254
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,249
Mustang's hard at
work in the east...

255
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:01,849
And General
Armstrong's holding down

00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,315
the northern front
with her iron fists...

257
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:05,949
I might be able to
remain the Fuhrer

258
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:09,315
for some time with the
two of them by my side.

You aren't going to turn

the throne over
to a younger man?

262

[GRUMMAN]
Not just yet...

263
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:19,315
Amestris needs a

[MRS. BRADLEY]
Oh, does it...?

265
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,315
That sounds a
bit like something

266
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:24,415
my late husband
might have said.

267
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:26,149
[MRS. BRADLEY]
I never met a man

268
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,115
more devoted to his work.

269
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,215
[GRUMMAN]
I remember...

270
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,515
I doubt that I can
compare to his...

to our country.

[SELIM]
Please do...

279
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,949
They can fix it, can't they?

It'll be fine, honey...

Now go on and
take him to Gramps.

282
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,149
[GRUMMAN] He has certainly
grown up to be a kind boy.

[MRS. BRADLEY]
Yes...

Everyone was against
me raising him...

but he's such
a wonderful boy.

nothing to worry about.

what must be done.

For all this compassion...

315
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,415
from people like
you and Mr. Hughes...

316
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,882
We feel like it's our
turn to repay the happiness

317
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:49,449
that's been given to us.

318
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,449
[GRACIA] Isn't that like
what the alchemists believe...

319
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,815
Equivalent exchange?

320
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,515
[AL]
No...

321
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:56,849
It's equivalent
if you take ten

322
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,182
and then give ten back.

323
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,315
But if you take ten...

324
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,149
and then add
something of yourself...

325
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:02,849
you return eleven.

326
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:04,115
[AL]
It's not much...

327
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,282
but it's an all new principle
that we're trying to establish.

328
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:10,182
And now we just
have to go out

329
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:13,415
and prove that
it actually works.

330
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,149
[GRACIA] So I take it
you've got something in mind?

331
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,249
[AL] We're still
haunted by the memory

332
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:22,482
of a little girl
that we once knew...

333
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:24,249
We weren't able
to save her...

334
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:25,982
And we will
never forget that.

335
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,082
[WAITRESS]
Come on in!

336
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,115
[AL]
Mr. Gerso! Zampano!

337
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:33,982
[ZAMPANO]
Hey, Al!

338
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,482
[GERSO] There's plenty
of food. Dig in!

339
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,415
[AL]
Thanks!

340
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,515
[AL]
Excuse me...!

341
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:38,815
Could I have
some milk here

342
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,849
when you get a chance?

343
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:41,015
[WAITRESS]
Coming up!

344
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:45,815
[ZAMPANO]
So then...

345
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:46,982
You've paid all your regards?

346
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,049
[AL]
Yes.

347
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:49,382
[ZAMPANO]
Then the time is nigh.

348
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:50,482
[GERSO]
You ready?

349
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,282
[AL]
I'm off to Xing!

350
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,915
[AL] May's gonna
teach me everything

351
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,315
there is to know
about Alkhahestry.

352
00:17:58,349 --> 00:17:59,982
But I'm not
stopping there...

353
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,115
I'm gonna travel
all over the east...

354
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,315
and study everything
I can about their cultures.

355
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:07,882
[AL] I wanna
see all I can...

356
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:08,482
and learn all I can...

357
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,749
and meet new people.

358
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:13,982
[AL]
So you guys...

359
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,749
You're really coming along?

360
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,915
[ZAMPANO] Hell yes we're coming!
[GERSO] Hell yes we're coming!

361
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,249
[GERSO] Good things
are bound to happen

362
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,182
if we stick with you!

363
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:21,349
[ZAMPANO] And you
can't argue with us...

364
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,615
[ZAMPANO] That's based on...
[GERSO] That's based on...

365
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,149
[ZAMPANO] Our animal instincts!
[GERSO] Our animal instincts!

366
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:26,815
[PIG] Rhee-rhee!
[FROG] Ribbit-ribbit!

367
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,215
[ZAMPANO] The truth is...

368
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:32,049
[ZAMPANO]
We're gonna find a way

369
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:34,315
to get our original
bodies back...

370
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,249
You're the one who told us

371
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,115
that we should never give up.

372
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,482
[GERSO] You said
to act for ourselves

373
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,415
and not leave it to others.

374
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,749
[AL]
Mm-hmm.

375
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,315
[GERSO] So your brother
isn't going with you?

376
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:46,349
[AL]
Nope.

377
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,482
I'm gonna take the east...

378
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:51,515
and Brother's heading west
to learn from that region.

379
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:52,249
And if we then combine

380
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:54,349
the knowledge of
east and west...

381
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,115
We might be able to
prevent the tragedy

382
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,349
that befell Nina
from happening again.

383
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,515
[AL]
But that's not all.

384
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,915
We've got more in mind...

385
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,749
It's not just for research.

386
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,849
[AL]
It's an enormous world...

387
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,415
and we want to see it all.

There's your train.

00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,090
[WINRY]
Knowing you...

00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:42,823
You're probably gonna
break it within a month

and have to come
home for maintenance.

[ED] Yeah, yeah...
You're probably right.

402
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,190
[WINRY] Well, whenever
that does happen...

403
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,390
Just call me to
make an appointment.

Sure.

405
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,090

An appointment?

[WINRY]
What's wrong?

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,790
Listen, Winry...

408
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,357
Well, what...?

409
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,423
Just come
out and say it.

410
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,023
Equivalent exchange!

411
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:24,857
Huh?

412
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,523
[ED] I'll give half
of my life to you

413
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:29,257
if you give half
of yours to me!

[WINRY]
Awww... Come on...

Do you have to treat
everything like alchemy...?

416
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:46,557
The whole equivalent
exchange thing is just nonsense.

It's nonsense...!

give you my whole life?

[WINRY] Uh...
Maybe not all of it...!

Ninety, maybe
eighty percent?

00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,857
Seventy...?
That's not enough...

423
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,457
But eighty-five... Yeah...!

424
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,790
Eighty-five is
a good number!

You are so incredible...

flat on its butt

And what's that mean...?

Why can't those boys just
settle down for a while?
