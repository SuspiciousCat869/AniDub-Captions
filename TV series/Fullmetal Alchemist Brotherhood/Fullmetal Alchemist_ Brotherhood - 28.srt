I know him.

That's Ling Yao...

How are you able
to use your alchemy?

Hmm...

Well, you are clearly
still transmuting.

No, Shao May...

Save the stubborn

Can you make it to the

You would allow
me to escape...?

for the deaths of

Yeah, well...

I'd rather beat
you senseless...

And it makes me sick

to have to ask
you for help.

They're not
gonna kill me...

They said they
need me alive.

I'm in right now...
