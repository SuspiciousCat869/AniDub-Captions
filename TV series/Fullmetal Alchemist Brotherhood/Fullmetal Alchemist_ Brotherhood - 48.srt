I can practically smell

I could do without
the ravenous hunger,

[GARDNER]
From what we've uncovered...

337
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:38,716
Mustang's gathered
his subordinates

338
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,682
and is sneaking around.

339
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,782
Mustang's got to have something
to do with the Fuhrer's train.

Hell, he's probably the one

behind the Ishvalans
pouring into the city...

342
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,449
I doubt that
it's a coincidence.

it's all perfectly timed.

If I were in his place...

the Fuhrer's wife as a hostage.

doing such a thing?

He must know that's futile.

So he's going to take
a pointless hostage

and make sure that he's
branded as a traitor...?
