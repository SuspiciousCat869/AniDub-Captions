<i>[NARRATOR]</i>
<i>Alchemy...</i>

00:00:01,678 --> 00:00:03,880

4

5
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:11,613
<i>It is impossible to create</i>

00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:13,513

7
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,880

8

<i>In accordance with this law,</i>

11
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,746
<i>there is a taboo</i>
<i>among alchemists.</i>

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,246
<i>Human transmutation</i>

13

00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:05,897
<i>[NARRATOR] On their</i>

15
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:09,497
<i>Ed and Al encountered former</i>
State Alchemist Dr. Tim Marcoh,

16
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,697
<i>who admitted to possession</i>

17
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,097
<i>of an incomplete</i>
<i>Philosopher's Stone...</i>

18
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,864
<i>Moved by Ed's determination,</i>

19
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:16,597
<i>Marcoh gave the</i>

20
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:19,764
<i>of his hidden</i>
<i>research materials.</i>

21
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,764
<i>After Ed's automail</i>

22
00:02:21,797 --> 00:02:23,697
<i>he and Al immediately</i>
<i>left for the first branch</i>

23
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,964
<i>of the National</i>
<i>Central Library,</i>

24
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,997
<i>where they hoped to</i>

25
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,597
<i>into the secrets of</i>
<i>the Philosopher's Stone.</i>

26
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,164
Augghh!!!

27
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:38,197
[ED] Dr. Marcoh's research...!
It's all gone!

28
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,631
[LUST]
In the end,

29
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:42,731
burning the entire
place down was easier.

30
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:45,064
[GLUTTONY] Oh, is that what
you were doing in Central?

31
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,231
[LUST]
Yes...

32
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,531
The Fullmetal boy found out
about Marcoh's research...

33
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,664
Something had to
be done about it.

34
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,897
[LUST] With that
issue taken care of,

35
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,564
I thought I would
come to see how things

36
00:02:56,597 --> 00:03:00,864
are progressing in
East City... Is he here?

37
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:01,797
[LUST]
Gluttony?

38
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,664
[GLUTTONY] I smell 'im...
I can smell him!

39
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,564
[GLUTTONY]
The scar-faced Ishvalan.

40
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:10,597
He's close. I can taste
his stink--like blood!

41
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,531
[GLUTTONY] I still
get to eat him, right?

42
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,931
[LUST] Oh yes, down to
the last strand of hair.

43
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,731
[explosion]

44
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,064
[HAWKEYE]
Scar hasn't been sighted...

45
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:58,597
Not once since that incident
with the Elric brothers.

46
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,931
[HAVOC] Maybe he's not
even in East City anymore.

47
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:02,631
[ROY] I hope you're
wrong about that.

48
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:03,697
[HAVOC] Huh?

49
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,231
[ROY] This case
has obviously gotten

50
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:07,164
to be too much for
Central to handle...

51
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,931
If I can close it quickly
enough, I'll be golden.

52
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:13,764
[ROY] I've got a
ladder to climb,

53
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,497
and this is how it's done...

54
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:17,797
I need every mark in my
favor that I can get...

55
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,064
At least until I've assumed
the office of Fuhrer, that is.

56
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,464
[HAWKEYE] You may
not want to display

57
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,831
your ambitions
quite so nakedly, Sir.

58
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,831
[ROY]
Yeah...

59
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,097
I'll be sure to remember
that in the future.

60
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:30,564
[SOLDIER 1]
Reporting in, sir!

61
00:04:30,597 --> 00:04:31,531
[SOLDIER 1]
We've just received word

62
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:34,131
of an explosion
occurring on the Marl River.

63
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,764
[ROY]
What?

64
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,031
[MP A]
Was it a gas explosion?

65
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,597
[MP B]
With everything else

66
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,664
that's been going on
around here, who knows?

67
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:49,564
[HAWKEYE]
There's no mistaking it.

68
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,864
This was definitely
Scar's jacket.

69
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:53,664
[ROY] Have you
found the body?

70
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,597
[HAVOC] Not yet,
but we're still searching.

71
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,497
[HAWKEYE] Either way,
he can't be in good shape

72
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,831
after losing
this much blood.

73
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,064
[ROY] Yeah... But we
do this by the book.

74
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,231
We need to find hard
proof that he's dead...

75
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:04,497
All right,
Lieutenant Havoc.

76
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:05,497
[HAVOC]
Yes, Sir?

77
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:06,764
[ROY] You and your men
will work day and night

78
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:08,131
to clear out
this debris...

79
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:09,697
I want his body found...

80
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,897
Don't take so much as a
coffee break until that's done,

81
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,031
do you understand?

82
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:13,831
[HAVOC]
Come on Colonel,

83
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:15,531
can't you cut
us some slack...?

84
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,597
At this rate, you're
gonna work us all to death.

85
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,731
[ROY]
Shut up!

86
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,931
[ROY] I don't get to relax
until I've seen his body.

87
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:23,897
That means you
don't get to either.

88
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,664
[HAVOC] I guess
we'll get to work then.

89
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:28,597
[LUST]
Looks like he got away.

90
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,031
[GLUTTONY]
I didn't get my snack.

91
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,064
[LUST]
Yes, I know...

92
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,964
Maybe next time... Though...

93
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:35,631
I think we can safely assume

94
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:38,497
that Scar will be out
of the game for awhile.

95
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,864
[LUST] I suppose I'll be
heading back to Central again...

96
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:42,197
I need to report to Father

97
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:44,497
about everything
that's happened here.

98
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,631
[ED] There's nothing
left here but ashes.

99
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,197
Everything's gone.

101
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,497

103
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,731
To what do we
owe this pleasure?

104
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,664
[ROSS]
You have been ordered

105
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:02,664
to report back to
the Command Center, sir.

106
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,797
[BROSH] We'll be
taking over supervision

107
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,631

brother, effective immediately.

108
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,031
[ARMSTRONG]
Very well. He's yours.

109
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:09,731
[ED]
What is this?

110
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,031
Just when I think I'm home free,

111
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:12,897
they saddle me
with more bodyguards?

112
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:14,564
This is getting old!

113
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,997
[ROSS]
All might not be lost...

114
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:18,897
There's a woman who

Unfortunately...

00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,497
she wasn't working

why are you wearing

A hobby?!

126

[SHESKA]
Thank you! I'm so sorry!

141
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:30,962
I got myself trapped under
a whole mountain of books!

[SHESKA] I thought I was

Thank you so much!

Yes.

[SHESKA]
Oh, the library...!

148
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,896
The word itself
is so beautiful...!

149
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,796
[SHESKA] I've loved books
my whole entire life...

150
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,129
ever since I first
learned to read as a girl...

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:53,529
[SHESKA]
But I forgot

that I was supposed
to be working,

154
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,529
and all I ever did was read...

155
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,096
So they fired me.

156
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,762
[SHESKA]
If I don't find another job,

157
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,562
I'll never be
able to move my poor,

158
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,829
elderly mother into
a better hospital...

159
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:06,096
But I'm hopeless...!

160
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,829
The only thing I can
do well is read...!

161
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,729
I'll never find another
job as long as I live!

162
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,662
[SHESKA] I'm useless!
Good-for-nothing!

163
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,562
More pathetic
than pond scum!

164

[ED]
Excuse me...

165
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,229
there was one thing
we wanted to ask you.

166
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:19,162
[SHESKA]
Yes?

167
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:20,062
[ED] Do you remember
seeing any research

168
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,829
belonging to someone
named Tim Marcoh?

169
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,862
[SHESKA]
Let's see. Tim Marcoh...

170
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,162
Where do I know that name...?

171
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,629
Oh! Yes, of course.
I remember now!

172
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:29,496
[ED]
Really?

173
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,562
[SHESKA] Oh yes,
I'm absolutely positive.

174
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,062
There were some
handwritten notes

175
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,629
stuffed into a bookcase
where they didn't belong.

176
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,529
[ED] The notes really
were there after all!

177
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:39,529
[ED] Which means
they burned up

178
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,796
along with everything
else in the library...

179
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:42,662
[SHESKA] Did you
want to read them?

180
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,096
Is that why you're asking?

181
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,962
[ED] Yeah, but
it's too late now.

182
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:47,229
They're nothing but ashes.

183
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,729
[AL]
Sorry to bother you.

184
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,696
[SHESKA] I remember
everything that was in them.

185
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,062
Would that help at all?

186
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:54,729
[ED and AL]
Huh?!

187
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:55,962
[SHESKA]
It's just how I am...

188
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:59,762
I'm able to remember the content
of any book I've ever read.

189
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,629
[SHESKA]
It'll take awhile,

190
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:02,196
but I could write
them out for you.

191
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:03,629

Thank you bookworm...!

You're my hero!

193
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,896
[SHESKA]
You're... welcome?

194
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:09,896
[SHESKA]
Here you are!

195

Complete copies of
all Tim Marcoh's notes!

196
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,596
[SHESKA] Sorry, I know five
days is a long time to wait,

197
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,629
but there was quite
a lot to write down.

198
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:18,629
[AL]
Unbelievable!

199
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,096
There are some amazing
people in this world!

200
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,729
[ED] These are really
Dr. Marcoh's research notes?

201
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:24,462
[SHESKA]
They sure are.

202
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,896
Come and take
a look at them.

all this way for a cook book?

it was an
important document?

[SHESKA] Is it not what
you're looking for...?

212
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,262
All I did was copy
down what I remember.

213
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:47,229
[BROSH] Wonderful--so this
was just a wild goose chase?

this is a flawless

Oh yes.

from my annual research grants

00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,696

Sheska gets it, okay?

[ROSS] Right... I'll get
on that right away, sir.

What could they possibly
have to do with alchemy?

[ED] Alchemy's a

It can be incredibly
dangerous if misused...

Dr. Marcoh about this directly.

[SHESKA] Thanks to

00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,880
Edward, I was able

I really appreciate it.

[ED] Aw, it was no
big deal, really.

289
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,880
[SHESKA] Have you had any
luck deciphering it so far?

00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,047
[AL] Have you found
another job yet?

291
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,647
[SHESKA] Anyway... you
two made me feel better.

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,214
It was nice to know
that even a pathetic mess

out sometimes.

294
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,714
[SHESKA] So thanks
for that as well.

295
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:46,380
[AL] You're not
a pathetic mess.

296
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,914
[AL] I think that
the kind of dedication

297
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,947
you show to reading is a
talent all on its own...

298
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,247
And besides that, your
memory is incredible...

299
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,647
You should have
more faith in yourself.

00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,047
[SHESKA]
Thank you, Al.

made it to Central.

00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,127
[ED] What's this
building used for?

466
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,094
[ROSS] It was designed
for the fifth laboratory,

467
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:26,994
but it isn't currently in use...

468
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,394
The building isn't
structurally sound,

469
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,394
so it's been
classified off-limits.

470
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:31,461
[ED]
It's there.

471
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,561
[BROSH] Huh...? How can
you be so sure that's it?

472
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:36,327
[ED] There's a
prison right next door.

473
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,127
[BROSH]
Okay, so?

474
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,361
[ED] What was the
main ingredient

475
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,127
for a Philosopher's Stone?

476
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,294
[BROSH] You said it
needed live humans--

477
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,361
[ED] There'd be plenty
of condemned criminals

478
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,361
in the prison.

479
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,027
Officially, they'd be
recorded as executed.

480
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,061
[ROSS] They're using the
prisoners to make the stone.

481
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,127
[ED] Don't look
at me like that.

482
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,127
I don't like talking about
this anymore than you.

483
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,394
[AL] Prisons from
other jurisdictions

484
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,061
could be used too...

485
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:02,127
I wonder if the
government is involved?

486
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,394
[ROSS] Why do
I have the feeling

487
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,227
that we're getting involved

488
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,527
in something really
dangerous here?

489
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:07,261
[AL] That's why we
told you to pretend

490
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,494
like you'd never
heard anything!

491
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:13,494
[ARMSTROMG]
This has the potential

492
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:16,327
of becoming a political
nightmare before long...

493
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:19,194
I'll look into what we've
talked about tonight.

494
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:20,394
[ARMSTRONG]
In the meantime, officers...

495
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,894
speak of this to no one.

496
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,061
[BROSH and ROSS]
Sir!

497
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,394
[ARMSTRONG]
And you, Elric brothers,

498
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,927
behave yourselves!

499
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,827
[ARMSTRONG]
I know you two boys...

500
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,827
You were thinking
about sneaking

501
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,827
into this building and
taking a look around,

502
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,327
weren't you? Admit it!

503
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:34,894
[ED and AL]
We weren't!

504
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,427
We weren't! We promise!

505
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:39,027
[ED]
Yeah, sure we weren't.

506
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,894
[ED]
Hmm...

507
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,127
A guard posted at an
unused building. Interesting.

508
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:50,927
[AL]
That is suspicious.

509
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:52,994
[AL]
How do we get in?

510
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,027
[ED] We could make
our own entrance.

511
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:55,994
[AL]
They'd notice the light

512
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,127
from the transmutic reaction.

513
00:20:58,161 --> 00:20:59,794
[ED]
Well, in that case...

514
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,827
[AL]
And... Up!

515
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,161
[ED] They're not taking
any chances, are they?

516
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,794
[ED]
Al... you need to wait here.

517
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:30,561
[AL]
You're fine on your own?

518
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:32,261
[ED] Whether I'm
fine on my own

519
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,127
or not isn't the issue.

520
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:36,527
You're too big to
get through here.

521
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,194
[AL] It's not like
I asked to get this big.

522
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,361
[48]
Sixty-six?

523
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:46,294
[66]
What is it, Forty-eight?

524
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:48,294
[48] It looks as
if we've got guests.

525
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,427
[66] Some daredevil idiots
came to visit, did they?

526
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,227
[ED]
Damn...

527
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:57,294
It's even tighter in
here than I thought.

528
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,961
[ED] I couldn't
get through this far

529
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,894
if I was regular sized...

530
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:04,261
Lucky I've got a small body.

531
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:05,261
[ED]
Oh no!!

532
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:08,761
I just called myself a
tiny little pipsqueak!

533
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,127
[ED]
There are lights on.

534
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,327
[ED]
"Not currently in use."

535
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,161
Who are they
trying to fool?

536
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,394
[ED]
This is it all right.

537
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,927
[AL] Ed's taking
a long time.
