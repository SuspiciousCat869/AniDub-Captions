Heh. You're wide open.

317
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,333
In many ways.

318

[MIYANISHI]
Akechi!

321
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,875
[AKECHI] You've never learned
to keep your emotions in check.

322
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,833
[KENSUKE gasps]
My brother.

323
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,375
My life... All of
it is your fault!

324
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,250
Casting blame, now?
Must be easy.

Enough! Both of you!

00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,125
[NAKAMURA] You do realize you're
in police headquarters, right?

328
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,583
[AKECHI]
Nao, could you give him a lift?

329
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,166
[NAKAMURA]
Sure.

330
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,166
[AKECHI] Hanasaki, you're banned
from work for now. Go cool off.

331
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,500
[KENSUKE] Don't bother.
I won't work for you anymore.

00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,416
[NAKAMURA gasps]
Where are you-- Ugh, let's go.

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
[MIYANISHI]
M-Me, too?

334

[YOSHIO]
Are we done?

[INOUE grunts]

00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,208
Let's go home, then.

You are such a--

[AKECHI]
He's right. I need sleep.

339
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,666
We'll start early.

340
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,833
[INOUE]
Start what?

341
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,666
[AKECHI]
We've got jobs, don't we?

342
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,875
[KENSUKE]
Here's fine.

343
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,916
Hey, uh, is there
anything I can do?

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,625
[NAKAMURA]
Yeah. I didn't think so. Sorry.

345
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,750
You're angry, I get it,
but he's just looking out for--

Huh?

00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,541
Whoa, no way. He's a rich kid?

349
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,083
You're kidding, right? I thought
you'd know more about them,

350
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,291
considering your
work relationship.

351
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,208
I don't wanna know.

352
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
Huh?

353
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,666
I can't. If I did, it'd be
too easy to get attached.

354
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,833
[AKASHI]
Welcome home.

[KENSUKE]
Where's Dad?

357
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,083
[AKASHI] He had some work
that required his attention.

358
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,416
[KENSUKE]
And Haru?

359
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,916
[AKASHI]
I don't know.

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,041
[KENSUKE scoffs] Like he hadn't
heard everything already.

361
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,708
[AKASHI] Could I get you
anything for dinner, sir?

362
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,875
I'll bring it to
your room, if you like.

363
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,791
Which hospital is he in?
I need to see him.

364
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,166
Please, Kensuke.

365
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,291
Come on! He's a
part of this family!

366
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,416
[AKASHI] The Hanasaki's have
no connection to that incident,

367
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,791
or any of the suspects involved.

[gasps]

369
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,000
[AKASHI] If the press should
come here asking questions,

370
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,791
please give them exactly
the same answer.

371
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,125
Is this you, or dad
talking right now?

372
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,458
[AKASHI] I took the liberty of
leaving fresh clothes on your--

373
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,458
But, what about Haru?

374
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,458
[AKASHI]
Please. Remain quiet.

375
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,250
Let this blow over
for a few days.

376
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,958
[AKASHI]
I beg you.

377
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,958
[AKASHI] If another tragedy
befalls the Hansaki family,

378
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,458
it will destroy us.

Inoue, how's it going?

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,833
He's arrived at the scene with
another woman. A third one.

[AKECHI] Damn. That hound.
He's good, I'll give him that.

And you?

00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,583

everything cleaned up.

to your work, lately.

Huh? Yeah, well, staying busy

about him when he first joined,

stand him. What changed?
