00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,791
I'm sorry, Kobayashi.

3
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,000
I couldn't keep
my promise after all.

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,333
[INOUE]
Hanasaki!

5
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,500
Are you there?

6
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,833
Answer me!

7
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,416
[KENSUKE]
I'm here.

8
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,750
Don't know how, but I'm here.

9
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,000
[INOUE]
You're insane.

10
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,000
[GROUP sighs]

11
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,791
He'll be the death of me.

12
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,333
[KENSUKE]
We have to win this.

13
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,458
That's all that matters.

14
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,958
[KENSUKE]
It isn't sundown yet.

15
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,125
We can still save Akechi.

16
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,541
Sundown?

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,708
That was the time limit
Twenty-Faces gave us.

18
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,416
Unless we get the boss back by
then, he said he'd be changed.

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,541
He's clever.

20
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,125
Giving you that timeframe
made it impossible to get help

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,500
from the police.

22
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,250
It would've been over
by the time they mobilized.

23
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,291
[KENSUKE]
I'm ending this crap now.

24
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,916
I'll beat him once and for all.
No matter what it--

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,958
[NORO]
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it!

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,458
That kinda talk's a death flag.
It's strictly forbidden.

27
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,083
[KENSUKE laughs]

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:06,916
Fair enough.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,125
[INOUE]
Get serious!

30
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,583
[KENSUKE laughs]
Sorry.

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,666
But you know...

32
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,291
If I go in
expecting the worst,

33
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
maybe I'll pull a miracle.

34
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,958
You never know.

35
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,375
[INOUE]
Hanasaki.

36
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,458
You don't have to.

37
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,541
[KENSUKE]
Goin' in.

38
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,625
Later!

39
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,833
[INOUE]
Hanasaki!

40
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,083
No shock there.

41
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,541
It's not the time.

42
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,958
[YOSHIO]
Send me, too.

43
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,333
[NORO gasps]
Koba?

44
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,083
Get me up there! Now!

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,833
[KATSUTA]
Kobayashi.

46
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,041
[YAMANE]
It's too late.

47
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,375
He's already inside.

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,625
[YOSHIO]
I know that!

49
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,416
That's why you need to hurry!

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,041
Ohtomo, find a way to send him.

51
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,000
Huh? Why should I do it?

52
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,333
Afraid you can't?

53
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,458
[YOKOYANAGI]
Hey! Got a second?

54
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,666
Move it. Unless you'd
rather talk to the police.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,083
[YOKOYANAGI] I have a
few questions for you.

56
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,791
Come with me, please.

57
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
And don't worry
about the plane.

58
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,708
We're forming a search
party as we speak.

59
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,666
[OHTOMO]
Think I'll pass.

60
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,458
Let's go, Yamane.

61
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,833
Hold on! Come back!

62
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,416
[INOUE]
I'll answer your questions.

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Ask away.

64
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,500
I know everything
that you need to.

65
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,166
All about this case,
about Twenty-Faces,

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,291
and Detective Akechi Kogorou.

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,291
[OHTOMO]
He's so damn bossy.

68
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,916
[YAMANE]
Huh?

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,791
[OHTOMO] He could've just said
"Ohtomo, you're my only hope!"

70
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,125
[chuckles]

71
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,958
But then he might've
died of embarrassment.

72
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,375
Guess so. Heh.

73
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,416
You're not going
with them? Why not?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,625
I'm not letting you
take this on by yourself.

75
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,583
[NORO] This might not
be the best time, but...

76
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,333
I wanted you to
know I'm grateful.

77
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,250
To have you with us, I mean.

78
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,625
[engine running]

79
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,125
[OHTOMO]
Thanks for waiting!

80
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,333
Slow down!
I can't do this if it slips out!

81
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,250
[OHTOMO]
Huh?

82
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,750
[NORO] That won't fly!
It's battery's dead!

83
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,125
[OHTOMO]
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,583
[YAMANE] Don't worry, I'm
giving it a speed charge now.

85
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,875
[YOSHIO]
Do it.

86
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,541
We've wasted enough time.

87
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,708
[OHTOMO] You should seriously
consider changing your name

88
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,875
to the Slave Drivers Club.

89
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,416
[NORO]
Pay attention, Koba.

90
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,791
With this level of charge, the
shuttle's only going to get you

91
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,958
as far as the plane's
landing system.

92
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,541
[YOSHIO]
I know. Let's go.

93
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,125
[OHTOMO]
Okay, okay.

94
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,958
But first, let's
go over the plan.

95
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
The shuttle accelerates on fuel,

96
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,958
so the battery won't
drain during launch.

97
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,541
Once you're past
the launch ramp,

98
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,041
activate the guidance system
on the control panel.

99
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,750
From there, the shuttle
will land itself on.

100
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,500
[YOSHIO] I told you
I got it, all right?

101
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,708
Just hurry and
get me to Hanasaki.

102
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,875
But...

103
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,958
[OHTOMO] Save your breath;
he'll be fine.

104
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,583
It's not like he can die.

105
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,833
[OHTOMO]
When you see him...

106
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,958
Tell him to come
by my lab again soon.

107
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,416
Made some new tech.

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,375
He can tell me
how awesome it is.

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,125
[YOSHIO]
Tell him yourself.

110
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,541
[OHTOMO]
Heh.

111
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,833
I'll do that.

112
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,666
[NORO]
Ready, Koba?

113
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,416
[YOSHIO]
You think?

114
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,583
[NORO]
All right, then.

115
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,708

Why are you here?

00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,458
Why the hell do you think?

125
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,208
To win this! To save you!

126
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,666

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,958
Leave it! Forget me!

You're okay with losing to him?

129
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,750
[AKECHI]
Doesn't matter.

130
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,208
[KENSUKE]
It does!

131
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,083
I'll win and end this for good!

132
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,375
It's what we've all
been fighting for.

133
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,541
Right?

134
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,458
If not, then what's the point?

135
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
[TWENTY-FACES]
My, my.

I'm impressed.

138
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,666
But you're too late.

[YOSHIO whimpers]

140
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,625
[AKECHI]
Don't.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,958
Why not?

142
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,958
He deserves it!

143
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,583
You've done enough.

144
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm proud of you, kid.

145
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,208
Good job.

146
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,166
[AKECHI]
Truth be told,

147
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,708
all I wanted was to
look cool to you kids.

148
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,958
To be the hero in
my own little tragedy.

149
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,666
[KENSUKE]
Boss... What are you--

150
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,500
[AKECHI]
So do me a favor.

151
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,166
Let me look cool here.

152
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,250
[TWENTY-FACES]
How naughty.

153
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,791
You turned the helium system
up as high as it would go,

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,500
didn't you, Akechi?

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,791
[TWENTY-FACES] The change
in pressure and altitude

156
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,541
will tear the ship apart.

157
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,708
Only a matter of time.

Were you hoping we would
die in each other's arms?

[AKECHI]
Sorry, Hanasaki.

You're only in this
mess 'cause of me.

Hey, lighten up.

330
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,666
You shouldn't encourage
this sorta thing.

[YOSHIO]
Really?

Well?

339
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,833
What'll it be?

340
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,583
You gonna die?

341
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,166
Or try to live?
