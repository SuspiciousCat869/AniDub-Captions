[NORO]
What the hell?

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,166
Do you see the thief? Who is it?

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,958
The picture quality is abysmal!
They should send that machine

162
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,750
to a museum so it
can die with dignity.

163
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,541
[NURSE A]
Hold it.

[KENSUKE gasps]

00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,833
I'm afraid that patient
isn't accepting visitors.

166
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,875
You'll have to come back--

167
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
[NURSE A gasps]
Sir!

Whoa!

170
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,083
[NORO]
I'm analyzing the footage,

171
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,708
but it might take a while.

172
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,708
The data's broken up
like puzzle pieces.

173
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,833
'Kay. I'll wait in the
lab 'till you're done.

174
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,958
[NORO] Or you could try and
catch the thief on your own

175
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,333
and save me all this trouble.

176
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,083
Nah, I couldn't do
something like that.

177
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,083
[NORO]
I know. That was just a joke.

[NORO]
What?

181
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,041
How d'you become part of
the Boy Detective's Club?

182
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,458
[NORO] Akechi scouted me, and I
just happened to have nothing

183
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,750
better to do at the time.

184
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,666
But, don't you still
have classes?

185
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,250
[NORO]
I already graduated.

186
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,708
From which Grade school?

187
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,500
[NORO] From College, dork!
I was the top of my class!

188
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,708
What?! No way!

189
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,333
[NORO] It was a little
over two years ago.

190
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,291
Before I joined the
Boy Detective's Club,

191
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,583
I skipped Middle and
High school, then breezed

192
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,958
through College without
breaking a sweat.

193
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,166
I'm a full-fledged
member of society.

194
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,541
[YAMANE] So, when you joined
the club you were already...

195
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,583
...well, a shut-in?

196
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,291
[NORO] You say it
like it's a bad word.

197
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,500
I don't have some dark,

198
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,541
traumatic past that
made me run and hide.

199
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,500
[YAMANE]
Ah...

200
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,333
[NORO] Why do regular joes
like you always think shut-ins

201
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,125
like me have to be sad sacks?

202
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,583
[YAMANE] Well, if all you
do is stay in your house...

203
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,083
[NORO] What? It's "unhealthy"?
I exercise three hours a day,

204
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,541
and I can order any
essentials online.

205
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,125
Is that living?

206
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,958
[NORO] Everything I
ever needed or loved

207
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:18,041
is right here in my home.
And that's all there is to it!

208
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,250
[elevator chimes]

209
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,916
[NORO] Besides, I pay
my taxes. I'm no mooch.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,583
If anything, I give
more than I take.

211
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,208
Got a problem with that?

212
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,958
No, no problem here. I just--

213
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,916
Was that Ohtomo's?

[YAMANE]
How?

226
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,500
[NORO] Just whistle and
point at the target!

227
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,875
He'll lock on and do the rest!

228
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,666
Whistle, no problem.

229
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,541
[NORO]
Then do it already!

230
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,291
[NORO]
Fine, I'll handle the whistling.

Those losers don't
deserve any hero worship.

It might look
that way to you.

But at least you're
part of the team.

I'd just be dead weight.

[NORO] Hold on, you want
to be a detective?

I hoped if I worked
hard enough,

they'd see I have what
it takes to join the club.
