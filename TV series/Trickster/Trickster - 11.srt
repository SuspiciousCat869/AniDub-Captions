00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,333
Though, when it comes to your
club, I'm not the biggest fan.

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,583
Whatever, just stay outta
my way. I'm working.

00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,208
And don't stand so close!
I can hear you breathe!

00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,875
Should we split up
and search for him?

166
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,583
Waste of time. He could
have gone anywhere by now.

167
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,958
Then, can I go home, or--?

168
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,791
No! Now will you be quiet!

Uh...!

170
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,458
Just stay put. Unless he
found another stray,

171
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,208
he should still
have his cellphone.

to track his cell, dummy.

wearing freakshow

00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,291
kidnapped the heir to the
Hanasaki corporation.

[AKECHI]
You flip your lid so quickly,

275
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,833
It makes you rush
in without thinking,

276
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,666
and you end up regretting it.

277

That's why you're no
good as a detective.

what I've just done?

I tried to...
And you forgive me?

Doesn't killing go against your
oh-so-precious moral policy?

Yes, you've got me there.

exactly why Akechi would go

to such lengths for you.
The same reason your father did.

[TWENTY-FACES] ...you took
advantage of that love,

and trampled on it
without a second thought.
