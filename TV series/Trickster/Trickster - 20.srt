[HIDE]
Hey, it's one less asshole

163
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,041
posting stupid crap, am I right?

164
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,333
That doesn't justify making
an example out of him!

165
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,416
Maybe if you'd done
this to Lynch Shot,

166
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,083
there'd be fewer creeps
for us to deal with.

167
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,458
The internet would've
crucified 'em, and jerks like

168
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,958
Ayusawa would've thought
twice about posting stuff.

[INOUE gasps]
Shameful!

People can't truly feel regret
until they're put through hell.

It's only after that that
you can try to help them

Dunno, he just panicked.

I received a call earlier.

the most attention.

He wouldn't stop bragging
about it in his interview.

297
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,833
It's no coincidence
that he suggested it,

one day after the robot rampaged
in the Dogenzaka district.
