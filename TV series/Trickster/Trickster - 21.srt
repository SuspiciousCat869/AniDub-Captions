under his control, so she
needed to be moved in secret.

161
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,458
She's about as safe
as they can make her.

162
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,166
He doesn't kill people;
he uses them.

163
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,375
[TATEISHI] Yes, and one of them
could deal the killing blow.

164
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,208
The one at the center of
this investigation is Saga,

165
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,166
the deputy commissioner.

166
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,791
He used to be in
Public Safety, you know.

167
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,250
I don't envy the man,
I can tell you that much.

168
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,083
Having this kind of scandal hit
at the same time the World Fair

169
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,166
is going on?

170
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,458
Must be causing chaos.

171
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,083
How will he deal with it?

172
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,291
It's a matter of time
before someone rats him out

173
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,500
to the court.

174
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,875
The clock's ticking,
and not in his favor.

175
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,000
Maybe he's gonna commit suicide?

176
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,541
[TATEISHI] Of course,
I'm just guessing, here.

177
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,333
No telling what he might do.

178
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,125
I trust it went well?

179
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,708
I told him everything that
you said I should tell him.

180
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,916
Very good.

181

Huh?

Hey! Wait!

Excuse me!

Yes?

This is pretty embarrassing,
but I'm kinda lost here.

[DRIVER 21A grunting]

191
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,166
[AKECHI] The elevator from
the entrance hall only goes

192
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,333
as high as
floor fifty-three,

193
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,250
and it'll be crawling
with security.

If I want to get
to the top floor,

195
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,666
I'll make a right at
the first intersection,

196
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,083
turn left at the dead end, then
take the private elevator tucked

197
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,166
into the corner
of the next intersection.

198

work like he said.

Hey!

This floor is off limits

Well, shoot.

Think you could
deliver this for me?

We have an intruder!

Well?

[NAKAMURA]
You're such a cruel man.

220
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,333
As long as you're having fun,

221
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,916
you don't care how many
people you end up hurting.

222
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,625
I can only imagine how
painful all of this must be

223
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,583
for those poor kids.

224

I'm trying to protect them!

You mean by dumping them? Heh.

226
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,625
You just didn't want
the responsibility.

227
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,375
So you tossed them aside.

228
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,541
[NAKAMURA]
I wonder...

229
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,833
How many people did
you shoot to get here?

230
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,291
[NAKAMURA]
I only shot one.

Miyanishi.

232
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,416
I never imagined that
half-wit would be able

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,833
to track me down.

234

C'est la vie.

235
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,208
In the end, it got you to come
here so I guess his death 

236
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,541
wasn't totally pointless,
unlike his life.

It's him. Twenty-Faces

It really took you
this long to figure it out?

243
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,666
I thought it was
obvious ages ago.

244

I mean, come on,
I've only been dating the guy.

he brainwashed me, you mean?

Hey, there's something I've
been thinking about lately.

00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,708
Twenty-Faces uses
you to kill people.

259
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,958
So then why don't you
put that silly gun away?

260
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,583
Maybe then he would stop
trying to throw targets at you.

261
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,041
Seems like a fairly simple
solution to me, at least.

Of course, you
couldn't manage that.

all's said and done,
