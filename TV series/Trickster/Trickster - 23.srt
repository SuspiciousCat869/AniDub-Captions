Was it my fault?

Nah, it wasn't anyone's fault.

Well, Noro?
You got any other ideas?

[NORO]
Huh?

17
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,791
There has to be another way
to get up to the ship.

The shuttle was our only ticket!

Oh! Koba, I could kiss you.

That won't work!

Do you morons not know
how high the stratosphere is?

There's still a chance, right?

Ugh! Practically zero!

This is a total waste of time!

[NORO]
That's stupid!

You should regroup with Inoue

I hope Kensuke and
Koba are okay.

What's the plan?

Stay here and hold them
off as long as we can.

That's what I promised Hanasaki.
