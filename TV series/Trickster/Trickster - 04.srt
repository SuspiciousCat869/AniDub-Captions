do so, and victory is mine.

158
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,375
Believe me, you don't
want that to happen.

159
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,416
[KANDA gasps]
If I win, our officer friend

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,666
just might be promoted two
ranks before the night is done.

161
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,041
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

162
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,833
[NORO] It means he'll be
killed in the line of duty.

163
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,708
Uh. You didn't have
to explain it.

164
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,416
Something's off.
This isn't like Faces.

165
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
Correct me if I'm wrong,

166
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,000
but wasn't his motto that
he never killed people?

167
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
[TWENTY-FACES]
Yes, exactly right.

168
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,458
That's my policy, Akechi.
Good memory.

169
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,208
How's he talking to us?

170
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,958
[AKECHI] Hm. The creep predicted
how I would react, huh?

171
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,125
[TWENTY FACES] Killing someone
would violate that policy,

172
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,000
and I have no
intention of doing so.

173
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,083
However, if the good
policeman were to die

174
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,250
in a tragic accident, well,
that's another story.

175
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,625
Helping others also
violates my policy,

176
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,375
and I'm a stickler when
it comes to my moral code.

177
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,291
A psychopath with standards.

178
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,875
This must be such
a hassle for you.

179
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,125
[TWENTY FACES] Not nearly as
much as being a detective.

180
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,291
You made your point
the first time, Faces,

181
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,250
now you're just
being a show off.

182
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,625
We'll be waiting, Akechi.
Don't be late.

Holy crap, it really blew up!

You've got to be kidding me!

186
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,000
Please calm down, Inspector.

187
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm gonna beat this freak,

188
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,916
even if it's the
last thing I do.

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
[AKECHI] Guess you don't
need my help, then.

190
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,125
Boss!

191
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,125
I'm just not feeling
this one, is all.

192
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,916
I don't really care
about your guy, anyway.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,250
[NAKAMURA]
Hold on.

194
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,000
[AKECHI] I have a right
to choose the jobs I take.

195
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,250
I won't believe you'd
just abandon a hostage.

196
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,250
I second that. Please, sir!

197
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,250
[sighs] Fine. If he
agrees to it, I will too.

198
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:53,625
[YOSHIO]
Hm? No way, I hate the police.

199
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,416
You just had to
threaten him, didn't you?

200
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,875
[NAKAMURA gasps]
Me?

201
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,708
Come on, please, kid?

202
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,875
You'd be helping to
save someone's life.

203
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,625
And why would I want to do that?

204

[MIYANISHI grunts]

205
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,333
Let's say he survives.

206
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,458
If I helped, will I get
anything out of it?

207
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,208
[INOUE]
That's enough!

208
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,666
Does human life mean
nothing to you?

209

[YOSHIO]
Not really.

[YOSHIO] Last time I checked,
humans were everywhere.

If one dies, it's not gonna
change anything.

You can't be serious!

I answered. End of story.

Nao, I'll do it.

[NAKAMURA]
Huh?

[AKECHI] Seeing him this
pissed off is new to me.

It's kinda interesting.

True!

[INOUE] Please don't
treat this like a joke.

This is not like
what we discussed.

Enough. It's decided,
and that's it.

But, I'll make you a deal.

and solve this case together,

go for the cheap stuff?

Good. Now play nice.

Well? Figure anything out?

is shot all to hell.

[MIYANISHI] What now?
Old fashioned footwork?

won't do us any good.

What do you think, Inoue?

have problems with his eyes?

As far as I know, he's got near
perfect sight. What's up?

have moved him by now.
