00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,833
Cool.

160

[phone rings]

161
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,166
[FUKIYA]
Hm...

162
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,625
[FEMALE PHONE RECORDING] Sorry,
this customer is unavailable.

163
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,500
You may hang up, or leave
a message after the tone.

164
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,875
[YOSHIO]
Tsk

165
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,833
[FUKIYA chuckles] You really
aren't normal, are you?

166
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,125
Fascinating.

167
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,458
[YOSHIO]
Hm?

168
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,375
I've been waiting to meet
someone just like you.

169
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,958
[INOUE gasps]

170
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,791
But in here of all places. It
exceeds my wildest expectations.

171
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,375
I want to know
everything about you.

172
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,791
Hush, creeper.

173
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,666
[FUKIYA]
Oh, my. Where are my manners?

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,041
I should introduce myself first.
That's only etiquette.

175
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,958
Since I was young. I've been
deeply interested in the

176
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:11,250
seemingly infinite variabilities
of the human psyche.

177
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,375
That fascination is
the sole reason

178
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,083
for my venture into psychiatry.

179
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,791
But, in the end,
it wasn't enough.

180
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,041
[FUKIYA] In fact,
my obsession only escalated.

181
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:37,583
I wanted to see something
far more... stimulating.

182
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,708
[FUKIYA]
That's when it hit me.

183
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,958
[FUKIYA]
If death was imminent...

184
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,958
[GIRL PATIENT whimpers]

185
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,291
[FUKIYA]
...what would a person do?

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,958
[GIRL PATIENT screams]

187
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,833
[FUKIYA]
She was 114 years old.

188
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,375
The age when one's mind
is at it's most sensitive

189
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,833
and responsive.

190
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,750
I enjoyed that girl's variations
for two weeks straight.

191
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,333
It was intensely invigorating.

192
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,833
[YOSHIO]
Tsk.

193
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:24,041
Especially, the climax.
The chaos before she died.

194
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,291
That's enough, you psycho!

195
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,875
Well, that's it for
my introduction.

196
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,375
Now, how about you?
And, please, spare no detail.

197
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,083
I want to know
absolutely everything.

198
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,416
[FUKIYA sighs] Fine, then.
Why don't we play a game?

199
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,666
[YOSHIO]
Hm?

200
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,416
Don't worry, there aren't
any complex rules.

201
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,125
I'll give you a series of words,
and you tell me the first thing

202
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,958
that pops into your mind
as quickly as you can.

203
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,291
See? Pure and simple.

204
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,416
I know this. What's it called?

205
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,875
Word association. Jung's test.

206
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,625
Indeed. He used this experiment
to solve the problems that

207
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,458
lurked deep within the minds
of his subjects. But not me.

208
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,041
[INOUE]
Huh?

209
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:13,666
I use it to learn more about the
people who pique my interests.

210
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,708
Shall we begin?

211
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:23,083
Fish... Green... Window...

212
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,833
[HIDE] I've got friends nearby.
We should go see them.

213
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,833
[KENSUKE grunts]

214
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,833
[HIDE]
Huh? What's wrong?

215
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,708
[KENSUKE]
I think I'll pass, after all.

216
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,583
[HIDE]
Why? Don't like strangers?

217
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,583
I'd just be a bother.
You don't want me around.

218
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,208
[HIDE sighs]
Y'know,

219
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,125
it's not up to you whether
you're a bother or not.

220
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,041
Let people decide
that for themselves.

221
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:45,875

But...

[KENSUKE gasps]

224
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,208
Alright, Han. Listen good.

225
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,666
This is important.
The true secret of life is...

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,208
[stomach growls]

227
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,291
[KENSUKE]
Uh...

228
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,000
[HIDE chuckles]

229
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,708
[HIDE] Well, there ya have it.
Glad we had this talk.

230
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,166
[FURUKAWA]
Hm?

231
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,708
[HIDE]
Yo!

232
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,583
Great, you found
another one.

233
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,375
Don't mind him, Han.
He may put the hooligan in

234
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,375
"Hide and the Hooligans",
but he's really a big softie.

235
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,833
[FURUKAWA grunts]
Look, I've told you!

236
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,250
For the hundredth time.
I'm not the "Hooligan".

237
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,333
My name is "Red Beetle",
ya got that?

238
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,666
[HIDE laughs] You hear that?
What a goofy name.

239
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,416
"Red Beetle"!

240
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,791
Well, "Hide and the Hooligans"

241
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
makes us sound like
a crappy punk band.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,083
[HIDE]
Huh? Whatchu talkin' bout?

243
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,000
[KENSUKE grunts]

244
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,458
Set this loser
straight for me.

245
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,250
"Hide and the Hooligans"
is way cooler sounding, right?

246
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,583
Uh...

247
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,083
[FURUKAWA] In your dreams,
Red Beetle is cooler.

248
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,458
Oh, uh... Hm.

249
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,041
There. Ya see that?

250
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,083
Han's such a friendly guy he's
staying neutral so he doesn't

251
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,875
have to deal a death
blow to your fragile ego.

252
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,958
I think Red Bettle's better.

253
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,916
Yup. That's what I thought.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
No way!

255
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,500
Yours sounds dorky.

256
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,791
[FURUKAWA] You didn't
sugarcoat it. Respect.

257
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,000
[HIDE] I'll never give
it to you now, Hans.

258
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,000
[KENSUKE]
Uh...

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,291
It was a "Hide and
the Hooligans"

260
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,000
tanktop with your
name on it, traitor!

261
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,666
[HIDE sobs, yells]

262
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,541
[KENSUKE]
Wait!

263
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,208
What the hell.

264
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,583
So, d'you get into some
kinda trouble, too?

265
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,333
[KENSUKE grunts]

266
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:39,083
I thought so. Well, you've come
to the right place.

267
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,500
All the guys here have
screwed up one way or another

268
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,916
and dropped out of normal
society. Including me.

269
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,250
We're strays. The only kind
of people Hide takes in.

270
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,500
What about him?

271
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
The worst of the bunch.

272
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,250
[FURUKAWA] He's a scumbag.
Been in and out of juvie

273
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,583
so many times, they probably
have a cell set aside for him.

274
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,666
Scumbag...

275
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,000
Want a treat?
I made Bavarian Cream!

276
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,000
You're kidding!

277
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,458
Your timing sucks.

278
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,125
He was about to tell me what
kinda trouble he's caused.

279
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,583
[HIDE]
Who cares? The past is the past!

280
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,250
Everyone screws
up eventually, don't they?

281
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,541
Let's forget about
it and enjoy life!

282
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,875
Starting with this
Bavarian Cream.

283
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,750
Here!

00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,750
Thanks, it looks really tasty.

285

Well? Good, right?
I made it myself!

286
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,541
I came up with the
recipe specifically

287
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,750
for our little party!
So, whaddya think?

What? What is it?

00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,541
[KENSUKE laughs] Is this
really Bavarian Cream?

291
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,666
What'd you say?

292
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,791

Saw that coming.

293
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,375

Of course it is!
