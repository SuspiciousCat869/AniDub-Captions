[grunts]

165
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,333
[NURSE A] He's worked so hard
at his rehab. Poor thing.

166
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,375
[NURSE B]
It's odd that he can't stand up.

167
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,958
His left leg wasn't injured.

168
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,708
[NURSE A] I guess the
psychological trauma

169
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,333
was just that severe.

170
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,500
[NURSE B]
You mean it's all in his head?

171
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,041
[INOUE]
Sorry for the trouble.

172
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,125
I'm gonna focus on being a
leader to the rest of you.

173
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,041
[INOUE]
What's the job? Well?

174
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,958
There is no job.
That't not why I'm here.

175
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,916
'Scuse me?

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,166
[KATSUTA]
What about rehab?

177
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,916
[INOUE grunts]

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,333
[KATSUTA] I thought you
weren't gonna give up.

179
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:09,541
I'm sorry. This is
all I can do now.

180
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,250
[KATSUTA] I can't.
I can't see you like this.

181
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,541
[grunts]
Then leave!

Time's almost up.

184
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,166
[POLICEMAN B]
Let's try this one.

00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,708
[KENSUKE]
Hey! Get out!

188
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,708
Don't go any further,
you'll die!

189
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,750
Be quiet!

190
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,250
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

191
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,708
Do you want Twenty-Faces to
know we're on to his plans?

192
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,750
[KENSUKE] No, but we're
almost out of time.

193
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,125
We need to avoid
unnecessary fighting.

194
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,583
[KENSUKE]
Fine. What next?

195
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,791

Hell of an entrance, Kobayashi.

201
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,458
[KATSUTA]
What is going on?

202
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
[KENSUKE]
I'll explain later.

Boss!

211
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,875
About time.

212
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,000
Is this really everyone?

213
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,250
[MIYANISHI]
No. It's only about half.

214
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,791
Okay.

215
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,750
Then we should at least get
everyone that's here outside.

216
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,125
[AKECHI]
That's what I said, but...

217
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
[gasps]

218
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,000
[NAKAMURA] They won't leave
their comrades to die.

219
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,500
They want to keep searching.

220
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,416
The police have a sense
of pride, too, you know?

221
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,416
Yeah. But...

222
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,541
[AKECHI]
Don't panic.

223
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,166
If we beat Twenty-Faces,
we can save every one of them.

224
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,500
I guess. Our only choice is to
keep searching the long way.

225
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,750
[KENSUKE]
Oh, right.

226
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,958
Inoue said the map of
the channels was fake.

227
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,541
[gasps]

228
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,625
[KENSUKE] He said without a good
map, there's no way to search.

229
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,875
[POLICEMAN E]
Great, perfect.

230
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:33,750
[POLICEMAN C]
Looks like we'll have to go back

231
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,791
and get the
originals then.

232
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,250
[POLICEMAN D]
We don't have time!

233
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,333
[KENSUKE] Don't worry about it!
Leave everything to me.

[AKECHI]
Hanasaki.

00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,125
Huh?

236
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,458
Why isn't Inoue here with you?

[pants]

238
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,958

apologized much sooner.

00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,458
[KENSUKE] Test, test.
You there, Katsuta?

247
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,583
[INOUE]
Huh?

248
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,333
[KATSUTA]
Noro's as fast as ever, huh.

249
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,208
[KENSUKE] For sure.
Did you get to Inoue in time?

250
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:58,958
[KATSUTA]
Yeah.

251
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,583
Hey, what's going on?

252
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,083
[KATSUTA grunts]

253
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,333
[KENSUKE]
Now that's outta the way...

254
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,166
...time to kick out
the party favors.

255
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,041
Noro!

256
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,875
[NORO]
Here we go!

257
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,000
[KENSUKE]
Fly my pretties!

258
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,125
The police should have
the data momentarily.

259
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,500
Put... me down.

260
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,791
The exit's just up ahead.

261
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't care! Stop!

262
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,083
Hanasaki, where are you?

263
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,708
[KENSUKE]
Uh. It says... grid E-12.

264
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay, then head
straight for E-13.

265
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,708
[KENSUKE]
Wha...? But...

266
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,583
We don't have time to wait for
the map to be updated. Go! Now!

267
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,000
[AKECHI grunts] Inoue can
be a real slave driver

268
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,958
when he wants to.

269
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,500
Nao, we're going on ahead.

270
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,750
[MIYANISHI gasps]

271
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,250
[NAKAMURA] Just what
are you planning to do?!

272
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,375
We've got a problem.

273
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,625
[NAKAMURA]
Now what?

274
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,625
[MIYANISHI] There's a
swarm of press outside.

275
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,000
[NAKAMURA]
Huh?

276
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,708
[MIYANISHI] Apparently,
Twenty-Faces sent a message

277
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,125
to every media
outlet in the city.

278
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:19,125
That cocky freak is trying to
make a laughing stock out of us.

279
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,041
[INOUE]
Turn right next.

280
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,083
[KATSUTA] How do you know
that's the right way?

281
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,666
[INOUE] Because I
memorized the fake map.

282
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,416
By looking at the
overwritten locations,

283
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,041
I can narrow down what
path they should take.

284
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,791
[KENSUKE]
What do you think, Boss?

285
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,666
Is Twenty-Faces really trying
to drown all these people?

286
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,916
Hard to say.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,250
[gasps]

288
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,583
[KENSUKE]
Hey! Kobayashi!

289
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,083
[AKECHI]
He must be wiped out.

290
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,250
[KENSUKE]
Yeah.

291
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,416
Pretty ironic, don't you think?

292
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,125
For someone who wants to die,

293
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,958
he pushed himself like
someone desperate to live.

294
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,791
[INOUE]
Focus on the task at hand.

295
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,291
Keep going and you should
reach an open space.

296
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,750
[KENSUKE]
Okay.

297
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,083
It still feels
pretty cramped here.

298
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,916
[INOUE]
Not yet. In another 80 meters.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,250
[gasps]

300
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,708
Five minutes left in the game.

301
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,541
I thought you would
be here sooner, Akechi.

302
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,041
[AKECHI] Yeah, well it
doesn't matter. A win's a win.

303
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,375
[TWENTY-FACES]
True.

304
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,625
[KENSUKE] Hurry and return
the hostage, you creep!

305
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,333
[TWENTY-FACES] Which hostage?
You'll have to be more specific.

306
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,375
Huh?

307
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,666
[INOUE]
He means the other officers

308
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,708
investigating the tunnels.

309
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,916
[TWENTY-FACES]
Is that Inoue's voice I hear?

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,541
[INOUE] He's locked them
in various places

311
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,291
throughout the channel.

312
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,083
There are some sealed locations
that look out of place.

313
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,125
That's probably where they are.

314
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,875
Very good, but why do you think
I would use such a tactic?

315
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,041
[INOUE]
To lower trust in the police.

316
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,083
You released water into the
channel to seal them in.

317
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,583
Hey, Inoue. When I want you
to do my job, I'll tell you.

318
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,208
Too bad your plan
didn't work, Faces!

319
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh, is that so? Were you
not paying attention?

320
