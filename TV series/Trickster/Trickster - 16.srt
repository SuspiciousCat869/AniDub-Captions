00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,291
We're like birds of a feather,

162
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,416
drawn to each other
by our scents.

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,750
It's only natural that
we found each other.

[KENSUKE gasps]

165

[HIDE] That rings a bell
for you, doesn't it, Han?

[KENSUKE grunts]

167
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,916
[HIDE] Think about what you're
going to do once we're there.

168
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,958
You gonna side with your friends

169
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,791
or the hooligans
serving justice?

what you decide to do,

we're not gonna
hate you or anything.

173
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,583
That just wouldn't
be fair, right?

174
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,541
For sure.

Flowers.

[YOSHIO]
Have it easy.

180
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,208
My, my. I didn't expect such
a poetic answer to that one.

181
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,833
Poetic?

[FUKIYA sighs]

00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,541
It should just be another flight
or two. Let's keep moving.

Right.

[FUKIYA]
Hm?

00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,208

We can't. I destroyed it.

[NORO] The closest alternate
route is the west stairwell.

I'd double-time it
if I were you.

West is?

00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,666
[INOUE]
This way.

[NAKAMURA gasps]

197

Of course.

Hm?

[FUKIYA sighs]
Let's continue, Kobayashi.

201
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,791
Freedom.

202
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,041
To find death.

203
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,250
So deep. I knew I liked you.

204
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,833
Would you shut up?

Don't bother.

[NAKAMURA gasps]

207
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,875
That girl's parents.

208

There's no need to
cause them anymore pain.

00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,958
[NAKAMURA]
Huh?

213
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,333
My, my. I thought you'd
be a little more grateful

214
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,541
after everything I did for you!

215
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,250
After all. I sent

[gasps]
You mean.

218
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,583
[FUKIYA] Bingo. Her parents.
They're down there ,too.

219
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,958
Probably working
with the Society.

220
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,958
Impossible!

221
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,416
Oh? Want me to prove it to you?

[INOUE gasps]

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,083
If memory serves, her daddy's
favorite dessert had just

224
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,083
released a brand new
flavor that day.

She looked so happy carrying
that convenience store bag.

Sweet girl. I told her my dog
had gotten away from me.

227
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,541
She was so concerned she
jumped at the chance to help.

Stop it! You wanna get shot?

When I told her I'd let her
go home if she obeyed,

231
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,833
oh, the things she did.

232
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:51,375
She even took a knife to her
ears and lopped them off!

special snowflake, huh?

[YOSHIO gasps]

273
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,541
It's not unusual for a
psychologically unstable child

274
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,375
to develop special
abilities over time,

275
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,041
but yours are a cut
above the rest, my boy.

Chat later!

You truly are a mystery, kid.
How I'd love to unravel you.

278
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,791
There's no mystery. If I keep
solving cases, then I can die.

279
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:50,416
You think so? I think there's
a more primitive desire at work.

280
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,666
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

281
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,458
[FUKIYA] They say people
develop immense strength

282
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,708
during a crisis.
I've experienced it myself.

283

[FUKIYA grunts]

285
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,875
Shut up!

286
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,916
All right. What a pity. I was
just getting to the good part.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
That's enough of your drivel!

288
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,416
Does it sting? Protecting a
murderer like me?

289

[INOUE grunts]

290
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,791
[FUKIYA] I see and here I pegged
you for the type that was only

291
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,916
concerned with business.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,666
You really love to talk.

293
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,333
And you have the
gall to call yourself

How pathetic.

[INOUE gasps]

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,458
Where to next, Noro?

297
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,708
[NORO]
Turn right at the next corner

298
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,666
and go past the cafeteria.

299
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,416
Think you boys can
shut-up long enough

300
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,875
for us to get
through this alive?

301
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,500
[FUKIYA]
Mm?

302
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,166
I'm not seeing a way
to rooftop from here.

Hey! What gives?

[NORO] It's a slightly
longer way around.

305
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,833
Go up and out the left.

00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,333
Kobayashi?

307
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,333
[INOUE]
What's wrong?

308
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,000
[NAKAMURA]
You okay?

00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:08,041
[YOSHIO gasps]

310
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,750
Come on, keep it together!

311
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:19,583
You're the one who accepted this
job, right? Don't quit halfway!

312
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,250
[YOSHIO]
Shut up.

313
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,000
[VIGILANTE A]
Found 'em!

Okay.

316
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,708
[VIGILANTE A]
Hand over that monster!

317
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,333
Sorry, that isn't happening.

318
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,708
[ARISU'S MOTHER]
If you take his side,

319
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,333
then you're as guilty as he is!

320
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,500
[VIGILANTE A]
Get ahold of yourself.

If we're just as guilty,

322
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,958
then why don't you kill us?

323
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,208
[ARISU'S MOTHER]
Be quiet!

324
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:42,958
[YOSHIO]
Shoot me.

325
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,291
[ARISU'S MOTHER gasps]

326
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,875
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and kill me!

327
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:52,250
[ARISU'S MOTHER whimpers]
I warned you!

328
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,250
[ARISU'S MOTHER gasps]

329
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,541
[VIGILANTE A]
What just happened?

330
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,500
[VIGILANTE B] The bullet.
It bounced off him.

331
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,583
[VIGILANTE A]
Hey!

332
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,958
[VIGILANTE C]
Fire!

333
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,750
[VIGILANTE A]
Don't back down! Kill him!

334
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,666
Dude! Those friends
of yours sound tough!

335
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,458
[VIGILANTE A]
Don't let them escape!

336
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,750
[KENSUKE]
Hide, I really do like you.

337
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,125
Aw, I like you too!

338
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,625
But, I...
I can't stay here.

339
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,083
Huh?!

340
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,875
He shot you down.

341
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,333
[HIDE sighs] That hurt more than
I expected. I'm heartbroken.

342
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,000
[KENSUKE gasps]

343
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,166
[HIDE gasps]
Hey, don't look so down, Han.

344
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,625
You gotta do what
you think is right.

345
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,250
I could never
fault you for that.

346
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,500
[KENSUKE grunts]

347
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,750
[HIDE exhales]
Fine. I'll give you a handicap.

348
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,916
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,958
I mean, you're kind
of outnumbered here.

350
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,916
You'll get a head start of...
a hundred! Plenty of time!

351
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,958
After that, we won't
hold anything back.

352
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,916
[KENSUKE gasps]

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,541
[HIDE]
Here goes! One...!

354
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,916
Thanks, Hide.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,541
[HIDE]
Two...

356
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,958
I'm Sorry!

357
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,208
[HIDE]
Three...

358
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,416
Four... Later, Han!

359
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,625
[FURUKAWA]
Hold on.

360
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,708
[HIDE]
Hm?

361
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,125
We could lose
Fukiya cause of this.

362
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,541
You really cool with that?

363
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,833
No, of course
I'm not. That said...

364
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,750
...I don't wanna stop Han from
helping his friends, either.

Twelve... Thirteen...
Fourteen...

[VIGILANTE C]
What the hell is this kid?

369
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,791
[ARISU'S MOTHER] Use it,
while we still have a chance!

370
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,208
[VIGILANTE C]
We can't!

371
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,750
[ARISU'S MOTHER] Well then
why did we even bring it?

372
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,000
[VIGILANTE A] That's our ace
in hole! It's for an emergency!

373
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,083
[ARISU'S MOTHER]
If they get away,

374
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,875
this will have all
been for nothing!

375
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,916
Now hurry up and
blow them to pieces!

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,666
[NAKAMURA gasps]

377
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,916
What'd she say?

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,458
There are explosives
in that man's satchel.

379
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,916
Is it Semtex? Or C4?

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,958
[VIGILANTE C gasps]

381
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,791
[FUKIYA]
From how full the bag looks,

382
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,833
it would annihilate this floor.

383
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,208
And all of you along
with it, of course.

384
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,125
Are you prepared for that?

385
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,083

[NAKAMURA grunts]

388
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,666
Our game was fun, Yoshio.

389
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,416
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

390
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,791
Hand me over to them

391
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,708
and you'll all get out
of here alive, Detective.

392
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,208
[NAKAMURA grunts]
Forget it!

393
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,208
I never valued my life
in the first place.

394
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,458
[YOSHIO]
You want to die? Why?

395
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,375
'Cause. I have no
attachment to this world.

[YOSHIO]
Huh...

397
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,958
Don't.

398
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:24,958

I won't let you, though.

[INOUE gasps]

400

Detectives never quit on
a job half-way. Ever.

401
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,208
Well, damn. Surprising to
the end, huh?

402
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,083

Hey! What are doing?

406
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,791
[ARISU'S MOTHER]
Enough!

407
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,875
Give us Fukiya, or you die!

408
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,375
Don't test me! One press is
all it'll take to end this!

409
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,375
My baby, she'll finally get
the justice she's been

410
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,791
denied for so long.
Hand him over!

No.

[ARISU'S MOTHER gasps]

It's my job to protect
him no matter the cost.

I can't let you
have your way, lady.

00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,250
[ARISU'S MOTHER grunts]
In that case,

416
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,166
you'll go to hell with him!

No!

I knew he'd be here.

He sure took his time.
That cocky showoff.

426
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,916
Bad idea. Put those down
before you get hurt.

Out of our way!

[VIGILANTE E shouts, grunts]

434
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,666
I'll take this. It's too
dangerous for children.

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,291
Pretty sure that's
your ride I hear, now.

Get Fukiya up to the chopper.

Of course. Let's go.

Good to see you, Akechi.

I have a message. Just for you.

"Welcome back.

[FUKIYA]
Bye-bye.

We'll arrive at the courthouse

00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,666
in about seven minutes.
Be advised, the prisoner

Of course. It was only
a matter of time.

But who would have
thought that...

00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,291
...the Kusakabe had someone
inside the police force.

I would rather have been,
killed by him.

[YOSHIO]
You're here.

That means you didn't
