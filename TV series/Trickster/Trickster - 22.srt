[NEWSCASTER 9A] Miraculously,
there were no casualties.

that an unidentified flying

Are you guys coming, or what?

162
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,833
Time's a wasting.

163
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,625
Do you know where
the terminal is?

164
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,375
By the beach,
if I remember correctly.

165
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,666
It would take us awhile,
even with the bike.

166
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,583
Don't bother with
that guy anymore.

167
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,041
Seriously, it'll only
cause you trouble.

168
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,250
[YAMANE]
But he...

169
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,916
[OHTOMO] He brought all
of this on himself.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,583
It's not your problem.

171
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,375
Why put yourself out
for that selfish bastard?

172
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,166
[YAMANE]
Why?

173
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,041
Because.

174
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,791
I'm a Boy Detective too!

175
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,916
They're my friends,
plain and simple.

I'm gonna help them.

You do whatever you want!

00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,375
Have it your way, then.

179
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,458
[INAGAKI] Go get a donut and
leave the real work to the pros.

180
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,458
[YOKOYANAGI] How dare you! Who
the hell do you think you are?

181
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,041
[INAGAKI]
Your replacement.

182
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,333
I have orders to take over from
the Deputy Commissioner himself.

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,750
Guess he didn't want to leave
it to a bunch of failures.

184
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,125
Can't say I blame him.

185
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,791
Just step aside.

186
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,458
There's no need to
embarrass the force

187
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,125
any more than you already have.

188
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,500
Let's move out!

Listen.

00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,791
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

192
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,833
We've always had
some kind of backup.

193
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,583
But we're flying solo,
so stay alert.

194
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,541
No one'll save us
at the last minute.

195
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,958
[NORO]
Whether we live or die really is

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,875
our responsibility now.

197
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,625
I'll be honest, that thought
scares the hell outta me.

You're not alone.

199
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,791
But that doesn't mean I can
go home and call it a day.

200
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,375
Not when other people's
lives are at stake.

201

We have to win this silly game,
and put that psycho down--

Shut up.

We already know all this,
so quit yammering.

[KENSUKE chuckles]
You heard him.

205
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,958
[NORO]
The shuttle runs on autopilot.

206
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,833
Once I have control,
you can just sit back

207
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,333

Sounds good.

to get there.

That said?

It's going too smoothly.

216
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,541

Exactly.

[NORO] The security

Lower your weapons

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,208
What?

322
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,291
[INOUE]
You and Koba go on ahead.

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,416
I'm counting on you.

324
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,333
[INOUE] Save Akechi
and end this madness.

325
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,833
[TWENTY-FACES] He's sacrificing
himself for you.

326
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,416
I'd expect nothing less
of your right-hand man.

327
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,791
[chuckles]

328
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,000
[TWENTY-FACES]
Well?

329
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,958
How does that make you feel?

330
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,291
[AKECHI]
All I did was use you guys.

331
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,166
[YOSHIO]
He's above the sky, right?

333
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,500
[KENSUKE]
Huh? You mean the boss?

334
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,041
[YOSHIO] If he wants to be
saved, why not come down?

335
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,583
[KENSUKE laughs]
You're askin' the impossible.

336
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,208
[YOSHIO] Are you sure
you wanna do this?

337
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,500
I mean...

338
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,375
You were mad at him, right?
Why would you save him?

339
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,666
Well, you're not wrong.

340
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,791
I'm still mad.

341
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,708
That said...

342
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,291
Yeah?

343
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,083
Boss-man gave us so
many awesome experiences.

344
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,875
And whenever you're
given something,

345
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,666
it's nice to return the favor.

346
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,791
[TWENTY-FACES]
Such an admirable young man.

347
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,583
And you used him.

348
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,125
Used him and tossed him aside.

349
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:33,708
[laughing]

350
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,000
[AKECHI grunting]

351
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,000
[TWENTY-FACES]
Tell me, Akechi.

352
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,791
What do you want to do?

353
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,333
And how?

354
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,458
Two of them ran off!

355
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,625
Can you chase them?

356
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,083
[MALE SPECIAL SECURITY 22D
grunts]

357
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,333
[YOSHIO]
You're too slow.

358
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
[KENSUKE]
Heh. You're one to talk.

359
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,041
[YOSHIO]
So which way now?

360
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,583
[NORO] I've got the shuttle
ready to go outside!

361
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,750
[NORO] How do you like that?
You can praise me now!

362
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,916
[KENSUKE laughs]
You're a genius, Noro!

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
[gasps] I forgot!

364
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,750
Hold up! Stop!

365
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,791
What now?

366
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,500
[NORO] We don't know if 
Twenty-Faces set a trap or not.

367
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,416
Better safe than sorry
when it comes to him.

368
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,666
Give me a few seconds
to double check things.

369
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,541
[YOSHIO]
Don't worry about it.

370
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,958
[KENSUKE]
Uh... Huh?

371
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,250
You'll be fine as long
as you walk behind me.

372
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,791
[KENSUKE] You know, you're a
really cool guy, Kobayashi.

373
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,833
[YOSHIO]
Mm.

374
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,375
[KENSUKE]
This might sound weird,

375
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,625
but sometimes I wish
we could switch places.

376
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,875
What would the point of that be?

377
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,458
Think about it.
You could finally die.

378
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,875
And me...

379
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,625
I could finally
be useful to you guys.

380

You've never made it before.
