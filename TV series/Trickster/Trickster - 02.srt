[KENSUKE]
"Stolen" is a strong word.

159
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,166
Lemme guess, that weird kid?

160
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,500
[KENSUKE]
I think so.

161
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,791
[AKECHI] I see. And you're
sticking your nose into

162
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,791
his business again because
you want to help him?

163
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,291
[KENSUKE]
Every time he opens his mouth,

164
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,916
it's to say he wants to die.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,958
But that'd be a total waste
of his awesome power!

166
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,875
[AKECHI] I don't know if this
kid actually wants your help

167
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,166
or not, Kensuke.
Don't get full of yourself.

168
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,541
[KENSUKE]
Uh...

169
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,541
It takes more than sound
reasoning to save someone.

170
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,875
[KENSUKE sighs]

171
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,458
Right!

172
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,125
[AKECHI sniffs]
Something smells.

176
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,458
What an idiot!
You really crack me up.

177
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,000
Who eats noodles
with their bare hands?

178
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,875
[KENSUKE grunts]
Ten, ten, and ten!

179
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,166
[YOSHIO]
Tsk.

180
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,291
[KENSUKE]
Don't eat that. It's filthy!

181
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,833
[YOSHIO]
Now who's the idiot?

182
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,041
[laughs]

183
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,166
All right. It's time
for your first job!

184
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,708
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

185
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,333
[KENSUKE] The Boy Detective's
Club just got a commission.

186
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,083
[YOSHIO]
No thanks.

187
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,750
[KENSUKE]
What? Why?

188
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,333
[YOSHIO]
You're annoying.

189
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,708
[KENSUKE] What's the problem?
I promised to kill you one day.

190
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:58,875
C'mon, join me!

191

Go away.

[NORO]
He's moving!

193
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,041
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

194
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,250
[NORO] Looks like the target's
going on a pretty big

195
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,625
catering run. And from
the sound of it,

196
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,541
he practically begged the senior
chef into letting him do it.

197
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,500
'Kay, I'm on it. Just let
me know where he ends up.

198
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,208
Up and at 'em. Gonna need
your help tailing this guy.

199
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,750
Huh?

200
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,750
I almost lost him earlier thanks
to you snatching my wallet.

201
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,458
Time to work for that Udon.

202
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,666
[gasps]
I-I didn't...

203
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,541
[KENSUKE] I'll get you
something to eat later.

204
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,625
And, if I can,
I'll kill you too.

205
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,750
[YOSHIO]
I wasn't trying to steal it.

206
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,291
[KENSUKE]
Yeah, yeah, I know.

207
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,791
I figured you were trying to
bring it back to me. Let's go!

00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,958
Is it cool if I
prepare the soup here?

00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,208
[DOORMAN]
Sure.

214
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,083
There should already be
a room set up for you.

215
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,291
[NAOKI]
Thanks a lot.

216
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,125
[KENSUKE] So, how long have you
been squatting back there?

217
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,458
[YOSHIO]
Don't remember.

218
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,583
[KENSUKE]
When'd you get your power?

219
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
[YOSHIO]
I don't know!

220
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,875
[KENSUKE]
Where's your family?

221
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
I don't know.

222
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,500
Is there anything
you do remember?

223
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,958
[YOSHIO]
I don't know.

224

You can't be worn out already.

225

[AKECHI]
Hey, guys.

226
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,166
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

227
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,916
[AKECHI] These threat letters.
They smell funny.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,041
[NORO]
Uh! Funny how?

229
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,750
[AKECHI] What do you mean "how"?
They just smell.

230
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,208
It's almost like...

231
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,458
...they were dipped
in cheap cooking oil.

232
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,666
[NORO]
Huh?

233
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,708
Wait, you're saying
they smell, literally?

234
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,291
[AKECHI]
What else would I mean?

235
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,458
I thought you were just
trying to be dramatic.

236
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,000
[NORO] Wouldn't they
smell like cooking oil

237
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,541
because the target
works in a bento shop?

238
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,708
Oh! Now that you mention it,

239
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,333
there were flyers
taped up everywhere.

240
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,583
[AKECHI]
That's strange.

241
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,041
[NORO, KENSUKE]
Huh?

242
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,333
You make these things
to stay anonymous.

243
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,625
The whole point is not
to leave any clues.

244
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,541
But these are covered in them.

245
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,208
You got a point.

246
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,833
[AKECHI]
Also...

247
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,250
Our client's obviously an
organic-eating health nut.

248
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,666
Why would she go out with a guy
who works at a cheap bento shop?

249
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,000
Huh. I'll let you figure that
out while I stop this guy.

eating if you want to die?

I have to eat.

I apologize for his
lack of manners, sir.

279
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,041
He heard he was interviewing
Dr. Senou, one of our alumni,

280
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,458
and he got a
little over excited.

281
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,458

schedule without telling me.

Isn't Dr. Senou on TV a lot?

296

[INOUE]
Yes. He's quite famous.

297

Do you know if Naoki has
anything against his ideology?

Or research?

299
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
[MEIKO] He did yell at the TV
a lot whenever he was on.

300
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,250
Something about violating
the laws of nature.

00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,083
[KENSUKE]
Dude, I just saw you.

313
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,833
Well. What choice do I have--

314

00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,666

Hey!

00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,208
Whoa, are you dying?

319
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,208
[YOSHIO]
The soup!

320
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,458
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

321
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,500
[YOSHIO]
Something in there is deadly.

322
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,916
[KENSUKE]
What?

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,041
[YOSHIO] The same thing
happened when I drank gasoline.

324
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,916
For real?

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,666
[NAOKI]
What are you doing?

326
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,583
[YOSHIO, KENSUKE gasp]

327
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,083
This food is for the conference.

328
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,333
It was. Dinner is cancelled
as of this moment.

329
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,458
Sorry, pal. No one is getting
near these death dishes!

330
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,541
Idiot!

331
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,083
[NAOKI]
Hold on. It's you!

332
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,250
Fess up. We know you
poisoned the food.

333
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,208
Don't try denying it.

334
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,875
I didn't poison it!

335
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,833
[KENSUKE] We also know
you begged your senior chef

336
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,083
for this job. The jig's up.

337
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,166
Because, I--

338
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,916
I also looked over
the catering menu

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,458
and couldn't find
soup anywhere on it.

340
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
I- I just wanted to...

341
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,000
...to show everyone how
amazing this water is.

342
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,250
Huh?

343
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,666
[NAOKI] I recommended
it to the guys at work,

344
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,375
but none of them would listen.

345
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,500
Then, I thought if a
bigshot doctor gave it his

346
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,083
seal of approval, people might
finally see how good it is.

347
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,083
[KENSUKE]
Seriously?

348
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, bro.
This stuff is the best!

349
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,500
It clears your body
of all kinds of junk

350
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,166
and makes food
taste even better.

351
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,916
[KENSUKE]
O-Okay, wait a sec.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm having trouble
following all this.

353
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,875
[NAOKI] Now, what did
you mean by "poison"?

354
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,458
I just wanted these people to
get a taste of my cooking!

355
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,875
Honest!

356
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,833
So, you really don't know
anything about this, huh?

357
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,500
Kobayashi!

358
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,250
[YOSHIO grunts]
What? I didn't do anything!

359
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,500

Let's go!

360
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
[YOSHIO]
Okay.

Hanasaki!

362
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,791
[KENSUKE]
I heard it!

363
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,708
On the phone earlier,
I heard the same sound

364
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,875
when Kobayashi broke
the vending machine!

365
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
That chick's gotta be
somewhere in the area!

[NORO]
Inoue, look at this.

367
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,500
Is Meiko the one who
came up with this plan?

368
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,625
What plan? I don't know what
you're talking about, dude!

369
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,125
So, should we take both of them
into custody? For now, at least?

370
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,500
[EVENT ORGANIZER A grunts]

all this mineral water.

372
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,375
It was Meiko, right?

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,083
[INOUE]
The threat letters, as well.

375
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,750
She even poisoned the food.

376
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,250
And then, she tried to frame
you for the entire thing.

377
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:35,500
[NORO] What? So...
This guy was just being played?

378
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,166
No, you're wrong.
Stop lying about her!

379
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,500
Meiko would never do that.
I'd stake my life on it!

380
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,041
No, don't!

Ah. There, ya see?
I'm perfectly fine.

Huh?

trying to frame her boyfriend,

why would she hang out near

make his girlfriend happy.
