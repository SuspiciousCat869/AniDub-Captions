Mm?

159
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,875
Uh. I can actually
hit you with this?

00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,958
That's awesome!

[YOSHIO]
Don't you dare.

163
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,875
Whatcha gonna do about it, huh?

164
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,250
[YOSHIO]
Cut it out!

165
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,916
[KENSUKE] Oh, now you've
done it. I'm not holdin' back!

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,208
I suppose that's
a friend of his?

Dammit, you're not
playing fair at all!

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,625
[laughs]

171
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,291
Let him go!

Sousuke!

[single person claps]

180
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,708
[NAKAMURA] Jerk. You weren't
even listening, were you?

181
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,666
[AKECHI]
Huh? I did. Loved it.

182
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,500
I especially liked that
cute little voice crack

183
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,166
when you belted out
the chorus of--

184
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,208
Whatever, just tell
me like you promised.

185
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,791
Huh?

186
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,250
You said if I sang, you'd tell
me everything that happened.

187
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,250
Why Twenty-Faces toys with you.

188
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,750
[AKECHI]
Hm. I said that?

189
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,750
Don't try to pull
that crap with me.

190
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,666
It's not cute at all.

191
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,250
Alright... I killed him.

192
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,625
[NAKAMURA]
Huh?

193
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,416
[AKECHI]
My dad... Both of them.

194
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,416
[NAKAMURA]
Uh...

195
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,708
[NAKAMURA]
What?

196
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,125
[AKECHI]
Hm?

197
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,916
I'm... not sure where to begin,
to be honest with you.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,458
You killed your dad?
That's just crazy talk!

199
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,791
And what does it have to
do with Twenty-Faces?

200
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,416
Since I killed someone,

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,708
I'm evil itself.

202
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,083
That's probably what
he thinks, anyway.

203
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,375
That makes no sense. You, evil?

204
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,250
I mean, come on,
is that masked jerk

205
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,375
putting himself on
a pedestal or what?

206
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,333
[AKECHI]
By his standards, probably.

207
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,583
[NAKAMURA]
So what else?

208
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,583
'Scuse me?

209
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
[NAKAMURA]
You know. What happened?

210
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,833
You only sang one song.
That's all you're getting.

211
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,916
If you want any more,
then give me more.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,125
Show me the deepest
part of you.

213
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,166
That's not on the menu.

214
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,250
[AKECHI grunts] Fine. You should
probably get going anyway.

215
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,166
Huh?

216
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,125
You gotta date, right?
Don't wanna be late.

217

Huh?

218
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,958
[AKECHI] Your nails
are painted, for once.

219
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,666
You just came from
the hair salon.

220
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,125
You didn't eat your favorite
shallots or kimchi because

221
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,791
you're worried about bad breath.

222
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,375
[NAKAMURA]
What?!

223
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,083

shaved all the important parts.

off to help you feel better.

Thanks for a massive waste
of time. Enjoy being alone.

Wait! One more thing.
Is the guy hotter than me?

229
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,708
[NAKAMURA]
Obviously!

00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,333
Yeah? Got a picture?

like that look. Quit it.

Fine with me. Get the hell out!

Oops. Sorry about that.

going around online saying

Yikes is an understatement!

Okay, fine.

Can't you move faster?

Huh...

[KENSUKE]
Get your clothes on!

[YOSHIO]
Tsk.

Oh, wow. Scary.

[AKECHI]
Akechi Kogorou.

279
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,083
That's the detective
that saved my life.

280
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,000
I took his name to honor him.

281
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,208
[TWENTY-FACES]
Detective?

282
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,666
Yeah.

283
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,500
[AKECHI] He rescued me
from my useless dad.

284
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,500
From a life of abuse.

285
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,791
[AKECHI]
As far as I'm concerned,

286
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,875
he's my second father.

287
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,333
[AKECHI] He's the one
who made me who I am.

288
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,458
[KOGOROU]
Don't you worry, Sousuke.

289
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:21,041
You're nothing like your dad.
You couldn't be.

290
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,208
I know he hurt you a lot,

291
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,625
but now you have the
chance to save others.

[SOUSUKE sighs]

293
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,333
[KOGOROU]
Well? Sound good?

294
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,375
[AKECHI] He filled my
life with adventure,

295
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,583
and the love I never had. But...

296
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,333
But I couldn't protect him.

297
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,916
[gunshot]

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,791
[AKECHI]
I was right in front of him,

299
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,041
and I couldn't do a damn thing.

300
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,833
[TWENTY-FACES]
Akechi.

301
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,833
[AKECHI grunts]
I wanted to run away.

302
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,958
Somewhere that no one knew me.

303
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,291
Or even cared for me.

304
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,291
A place as far away from
there as I could get.

305
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,541
[AKECHI exhales]

306
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,958
[AKECHI] But before I did,
I saw my dad one last time.

307
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,000
[SOUSUKE'S DAD]
Hey! The hell're you goin'?

308
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,833
[SOUSUKE'S DAD] You're just
gonna leave your old man

309
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:19,625
to die like this?
Sousuke. Please.

310
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,708
[SOUSUKE]
That's not my name.

311
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,750
From now on,
I'm Akechi Kogorou.

312
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:32,125
Alright, fine.
Just remember this.

313
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,250
You chose to leave a
dying man to his fate.

314
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,875
You killed your real father!

315
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,000
[SOUSUKE gasps]

316
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,791
Sousuke!
