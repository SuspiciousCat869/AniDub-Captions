Bye-bye!

159
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,416
[KENSUKE]
Sorry.

160
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,875
[grunts]

161
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,166
Hey.

162
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,375
Just got a little dizzy.
I'll be okay.

163
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,125
Sorry.

164
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,791
What's... with him?

165
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,583
[NORO] Looked like
a Vasovagal response.

166
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,041
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

167
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,541
[NORO]
It's not that unusual, really.

168
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,166
It's a reaction to extreme
stress that makes the victims

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,083
mind go blank and can
even cause fainting.

170
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,375
[YOSHIO]
Stress? From what?

171
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,958
[NORO]
Oh, come on! Think about it!

172
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,333
You were spending time
with friends, then?

173
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,958
Uh... That's right.

174
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,500
[KENSUKE'S DAD]
Sorry to intrude.

175
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,791
I had an opening in my schedule,

176
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,208
so I thought that we could
spend time together.

177
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,750
[KENSUKE]
Yeah.

178
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,083
[KENSUKE'S DAD]
It's all right now, son.

179
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,583
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

180
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,250
There's no need to worry.

181
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,541
Twenty-Faces will
never bother us again.

182

[KENSUKE grunts]

183
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,000
[NORO grunts]
Lynch Shot's been updated!

184
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:44,875
[gasps]

185
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,875
[YOSHIO]
Huh?

186
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,041
What is it?

187
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,708
[KENSUKE gasps]

188
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,125
[KENSUKE]
Kobayashi?

189
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,750
[INOUE] "Terror Artist
thwarted by the Undead."

190
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:09,333
[NORO] "Seeking any information
about the Zombie Boy."

191
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,166
[INOUE]
Kobayashi. Lay low for a while.

192
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Huh?

193
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,541
Unless, of course,

194
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,000
you want people to find
out about your power.

195
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,083
[NORO]
You hate hassles, right?

196
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,750
[YOSHIO]
You hate hassles.

197
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,083
I hate being cooped
up like a damn bird.

198
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,416
[NORO]
Watch it.

199
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,333
[YOSHIO]
Tsk.

200
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,833
Leave the investigations to us.

201
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:32,500
[YOSHIO sighs]
Not "us". "You".

202
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,166
[MIYANISHI]
What should we do?

203
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,916
Do about what?

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,416
Kobayashi! Aren't you worried
that Lynch Shot is on to him?

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,750
Cleaning up after those
kid's is Akechi's problem.

206
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,666
[MIYANISHI]
Yeah, but.

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,333
We've got our own
work to focus on!

208
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,541
I can't explain any of it.

209
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,916
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,916
Why did I have that
gun or want to use it?

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,791
Every hostage said
roughly the same thing.

212
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,416
So, Twenty-Faces did
something to manipulate them?

213
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,541
If he did, there's
no proof... 'Course.

214
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,625
I'm going for lunch.

215
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,625
[MIYANISHI]
Cool, I'll join you

216
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,916
[NAKAMURA]
No.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
[MIYANISHI]
Huh?

218
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,083
[NAKAMURA]
Three's a crowd, Miya!

219
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,125
Oh, her boyfriend.

[YOSHIO]
Hey.

[KENSUKE gasps]

222
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,541
[KENSUKE]
When did you get here?

223
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,916
Keep your promise.

[birds chirping]

227
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,750
[KENSUKE]
So, what is this place?

228
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,708
[YOSHIO] You said if I
solved cases, I could die.

229
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,958
[KENSUKE]
I did, but...

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,375
[YOSHIO]
Then take this seriously.

231
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,083
[KENSUKE gasps, sighs]

232
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,041
[KENSUKE] Okay. That's where
you popped out, right?

233
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:09,083
Then, the photo would have
been taken from around here.

234
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,833
[YOSHIO]
Pretty close.

235
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,083
[KENSUKE]
"In your face" close.

236
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,458
You should have seen him.

237
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,708
Do you know who did it?

238
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
[KENSUKE]
If I had to guess,

239
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,833
I'd say the Invisible
Man is a shutterbug.

240
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,375
So, we've solved the case?

241
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,208
It's a joke.
Don't take me seriously.

242

[gasps]

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,875
[YOSHIO] The guy I
caught was using that.

244
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,708
[KENSUKE]
Huh...

245
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,791
[KENSUKE]
Huh?

246
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,083
[KATSUTA] Sorry, I gotta
help out at home tonight.

247

[INOUE]
Oh, I see.

248
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,250
[KATSUTA]
I feel bad.

249
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,791
[INOUE] I'm the one
that should apologize.

250
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,000
I've been relying on
you for everything.

251
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,958
It's so pathetic.

252
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,666
[KATSUTA]
Look...

253
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,083
What if... Akechi
doesn't come back.

Will you and I keep--

time on "What ifs".

Well? You know who did it yet?

260
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,166
[KENSUKE]
Course not.

261
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,791
[YOSHIO] Just catch
the Invisible Man

262
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,166
and be done with it.

263
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,541
I already told you
that was a joke.

[YOSHIO] I don't care
what it was, do it.

Now you're being a brat.

Well, you're useless.

Fine, I'll give you one bite.

you could forgive me?

You're something else.

Pretty much.
