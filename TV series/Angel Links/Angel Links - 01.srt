The Oracion Planetary System

areas in the frontier of space

00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,583
due to its valuable
mineral deposits.

00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,041
Huge unarmed cargo vessels are
left to haul valuable minerals

through this wild territory,

42
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:42,791
where pirates prey upon the
weak like a pack of hyenas.

43
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,541
The police are out-maneuvered,
and companies have no choice

44
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,291
but to seek out
other protection.

45
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,708
To their rescue come
private security firms

46
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,333
with the most advanced ships,

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:56,333
staffed with professional
pirate fighters.

48
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,500
One of these firms,
the Links Group,

had such a beautiful girl as
the head of their corporation?

97
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,333
It seems to me that you are
much better suited for a...

00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,750
...softer kind of
escort service.

99
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,583
Especially now that
you've volunteered

100
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,333
to fight pirates
for certain clients.

101
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,708
We'll see about that.

102
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,833
You know, leadership
skills have nothing at all

to do with gender.

104

The Commander's reputation

well, we try to protect those
who can't afford an escort.

Forgive me, but you're
creating a false economy.

108
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,375
It costs money to fight pirates,

109
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,916
and not many
businesses can afford

110

than he does, and for free.

Why can't they accept
that a beautiful young girl

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,041
He also takes credit
for the airport bombing.

162
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,916
Mr. Leon Lau owns a
private airline company,

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,583
and in a few short years,

164
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,041
has managed to establish himself
as the Top Gun of Travel.

165
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,166
He's also well known
for his charity work,

166
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,333
such as building a
school for orphans.

167
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,458
Ah. Now I see.

168
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,333
You know, you've got a lot
of nerve picking a fight

169
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,666
with <i>Angel Links</i> of Oracion.

170
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,125
[EXIADE] I would worry about
yourself more than anyone else.

[LEON]
Don't you dare touch Yayoi!

174
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,625
Why, if you end up hurting her,

175
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,583
then I'll kill you
with my own hands!

176
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,625

The escort ship is in pieces!

This is so awful.

181
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:01,083
We request the release of
the hostages, as you promised.

182
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,541
[EXIADE]
All right.

183
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,208
Bring the goods, leave your
weapons, and come aboard.

00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,541
And don't try anything stupid!

[MEIFON]
Understood.

186
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,625
Well, the rumors were
right about you being

187
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,666
a nice little piece of work.

188
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,333
Can't believe a beauty like you

189
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,000
would be working
as a pirate fighter.

190
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,250
[EXIADE]
I'm gonna have to frisk you.

Ugh. Ungrateful wench!

00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,041
Then what about
the Dragon Stones?

[EXIADE chuckles]

Gotta hand it to
you, Links Group.

Only you could come up with

those priceless Dragon

I'm extremely sorry you got

It's not your fault so

There you go again!

Don't be afraid, Yayoi. No way!

You have a beautiful daughter.

Oh, that's right.

You support a

Yes. Some people say it's
just a publicity stunt.

Well, maybe my reasons
are selfish, but...

When I see her smile
and hear her laughter,

I don't care what anyone says.
