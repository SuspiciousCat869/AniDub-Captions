I think one Prelude-class ship

Uh-huh.

to this dinner for
a long, long time!

Do you know how much it costs

28
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,916
to fire the Links

we'll make it after all.

[AIHARA]
What are you going to have

44
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,541
for the main course, Commander?

45
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,166
The prawns or the crab?

46
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,666
I hear the lobster
is excellent, too.

[MEIFON]
Huh?

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,333
So what will you order?
The prawns or the crab?

50
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,125
[MEIFON] Actually, I have
a business engagement.

Do you know how hard it was

to make a reservation
for that place?

54
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,958
[AIHARA]
What's that, Commander?

[MEIFON]
Huh?

You're hiding something there!

[ANNE] Oh, how intriguing!
An invitation!

58

[AIHARA] It's looking more and
more suspicious than ever.

Let go! Give it!

67
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,291
You mean, you used
the Links Cannon

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,708
so you could make it in
time for a rendezvous?

So are you saying we always make

Yes. That's right!

invited on a date.

Especially a date with Leon Lau,
the big corporate tycoon.

Oh, look, the light's

Right.

But isn't that letter from Leon?

93
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,458
There was no return address.

Well, I don't know.

00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,416
But it must've been him,

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,416
'cause it was sent by
someone close to my heart.

98

Let's just call it...
a woman's intuition.

99
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,125
Well, even an ordinary guy
like me can figure out

100
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,416
that a pretentious
letter must be from him.

Now, now, are you jealous?

I just want you to be careful.

I think that Leon
might be dangerous.

Let's just call it
a man's intuition.

110
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,083
A man's intuition
is hardly objective.

[YAYOI]
Really? Yay!

163
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,458
[chuckles]

164
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,875
Well, you're on a roll,
Daddy Warbucks.

165
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,458
[YAYOI screams]

166
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,750
[MEIFON]
Don't worry, Yayoi.

167
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,083
That's a twin tail dragon
and he looks scarier

168
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
than he actually is.

169
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,125
You mean there are dragons
even scarier than that?

170
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,250
[MEIFON]
Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,875
You should see Duuz
with his sword.

172
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
He's even scarier at dinner!

173
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,250
[DUUZ sneezes]

174
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,041
[NIKOLA]
Hey!

175
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,083
Bon appetit.

176
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:04,166
[YAYOI chuckles]

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,583
[MEIFON]
Uh, oh.

178
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,500
[MEIFON] Where do you
wanna go next, Yayoi?

179
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,500
But why don't we go where
you want to go now?

180
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,166
She's right. So tell me,
what would you like to do now?

181
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,875
Well, let's see.

182
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,041
[gasps]

183
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,500
I wanna hear a
song of mermaids.

184
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,625
A song of mermaids.

185
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,791
[KOSEI]
It's not a corporate insignia.

186
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,958
But I'm sure I've
seen it somewhere.

187
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,375
[YAYOI]
Oh! They're so cute!

188
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,458
[BOTH laughing]

189
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,208
[LEON] Those are the cries
of the Oracian Jugon.

190
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,166
Some call them
the "Grey Mermaids."

191
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,708
They mate with their
partner for life

192
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,416
and this is the song they sing
to find their true love.

193
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,333
So that's...
a song of mermaids.

194
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,625
[gasps]

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,041
I haven't had a nice relaxing
day like this in a while.

196
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,625
[LEON] I've never seen
Yayoi so happy before.

197
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,500
She's very fond of you.

198
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,958
I know you saved her life,
but it's more than that.

199
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:08,125
You two have a special bond.
She really loves you.

200
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,500
A song of mermaids.

201
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,833
I really appreciate your
wonderful invitation, Leon.

202
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,583
[LEON]
Invitation?

203
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,125
[MEIFON]
Yes.

204
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,916
I knew it was you right away,
even without the signature.

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,166
I knew it was someone
close to my heart.

206
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,541
Leon?

207
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,500
[gasps]

208
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,958
Leon. What?

209
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,500
[LEON]
What's this about?

210
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,375
Huh?

211
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,333
[LEON]
Who in the world...?

212
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,916
Hey. What's the matter?

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,125
[LEON]
It wasn't me.

214
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,166
I was not the one who
sent you that invitation.

215
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,416
What?

216
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,916
You see, I thought it was you
who asked me to come here today.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,833
[gasps]

218
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,708
What about... the, uh,
invitation that I got?

219
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,625
[gasps]

220
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,041
Just look at mine.
It's exactly the same.

221
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,583
[gasps]

222
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,666
Who would do such a thing?

223
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,750
I think someone is trying to
bring us together, Meifon.

224
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,166
Where are you going?

225
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,125
That's insane. How could it be?

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,750
Marin? But why would such
an ancient pirate be...?

227
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,916
[LEON]
Meifon. Meifon!

228
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
[MEIFON]
I know this place.

229
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:30,166
[laughing]

230
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,833
[MEIFON]
Grandpa! Hurry up!

231
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,875
[CHENHO]
Meifon! Don't go there!

232
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,375
Meifon! Come back! Meifon!

233
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,083
Meifon!

234
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,875
[MEIFON]
This way, Grandpa! This way!

235
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,916
[MEIFON]
Huh?

236
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,583
What's your name, mister?

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,500
[CHENHO]
Don't do it! Goryu!

238
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,000
A pirate shouldn't
pretend to live the life

239
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,583
of a respectable citizen.

240
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:49,958
[MEIFON] That day...
I was standing right here.

241
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,875
Go... ryu...

242
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,625
[MEIFON]
Go... ryu...

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,291
Go... ryu...

244
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,583
[LEON gasps]

[growling]

246
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,666
M-Meifon?

247
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,166
Go... ryu...

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,291
[gasps]

249
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,875
Goryu!

250
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,041
I'm going to take a
piece of that angel.

251
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,250
[MEIFON]
Goryu!

252
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:39,333
You... will...

253
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,666
...die!

254
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,375
[MEIFON yelling]

255
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,833
[MEIFON]
Destroy... Goryu. Destroy!

[YAYOI]
Meifon...

259
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:41,125
Meifon. I'm awake now.

260
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,875
It's you.

[gasps]

262
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,708
[YAYOI]
I'm glad.

263
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,416
Meifon!

264
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,291
[KOSEI]
Oh, no!

265
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,458
Are you all right?!

266
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,708
You! What did you do to Meifon?!

267
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,666
Just stop. Don't you see?
There's a little girl.

268
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,125
[KOSEI]
Why--!

269
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,791
Leon Lau.

270
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,666
I don't know who you really are,

271
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,375
but I promise,
I will protect her.

272
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,041
Go... Goryu...

273
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,458
[KOSEI]
Meifon.

274
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,666
[MEIFON]
Huh? Where am I?

275
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,375
I must have just
dozed off, I guess.

276
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:22,166
How embarrassing.
And in front of Yayoi.

277
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,541
You're just exhausted.

278
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,916
I think you've been pushing
yourself too hard lately.

279
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,458
I guess.

280
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:37,166
But today... I had
a good time today.

281
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,000
I really did.

282
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:47,083
[LEON] Meifon.
Granddaughter of Chenho Li.

283
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Oh, Meifon...

284
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,083
[LEON]
It must have been you.

285
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:04,208
It must have been you, Chenho,
who brought us together.

[LEON chuckles]

287
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,666
[LEON]
I accept your challenge.

288
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:53,000
[MEIFON] Until next time on
