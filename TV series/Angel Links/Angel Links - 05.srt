[JESIA]
Ko-Kosei.

Jesia!

4
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,041
[ANNE] A large Striker-class
ship, registration unknown.

5
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,541
Sighted 350,000 kilometers
directly above us,

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,791
and following at the same speed.

7
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,000
Ugh.

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,958
Did you hear me?

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,541
Ahem.

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,125
Meifon, they may be out
of our danger zone,

11
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,916
but they remain unidentified.

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,458
Nikola, please put us
into defensive formation

13
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,708
just in case.

14
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,166
And, Aihara, tell the
client there's nothing

15
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,958
they need to worry about.

16
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,250
At least, not for now.

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,583
Meifon!

18
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,041
These sprinkler
beams are harmless.

19
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,416
It's just that same old

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,708
trigger-happy pirate
ship bothering us.

21
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,083
It'll shoot it's load and run.

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,166
Just an idle threat.

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,208
[ANNE] And now the unidentified
ship is retreating.

24
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,541
Ya see? That's the third time.

25
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,166
So what do they want, anyway?

26
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,833
[MEIFON] Elvis has
finally left the building.

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,333
[ANNE] Commander, should
we have a wrap up party?

28
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,625
[AIHARA] There's a
hip little joint I know,

29
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,291
and the food is great!

30
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,625
Let's book the whole place.

31
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,541
[AIHARA, ANNE laugh]

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,250
But first, I'm going
home for a nice hot bath.

33
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,041
With raspberry bubbles and...

34
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,833
[MEIFON]
Back again?!

35
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,083
[KOSEI] They must've heard
Valeria talking about a bath.

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,833
[VALERIA]
It wasn't an invitation.

37
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,375
Well, it looks like
they sure know how

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,666
to manage a surprise attack.

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,666
And for pirates, these guys
have a pretty good ship.

40
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,708
[MEIFON]
Well, I'm glad they impress you.

41
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,708
They don't do a thing for me.

42
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,833
They want our attention.

43
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,416
Maybe they have unfinished
business with <i>Angel Links</i>

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,333
or one of the crew.

45
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,958
Seems... personal.

46
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,875
Well, gee, Meifon.

47
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,916
I wonder which one of
us could've possibly

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,583
picked a fight.

49
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,708
What do you mean?!

50
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,375
Well... it's just...

51
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,625
Never mind. We'll just find
out when we ask them.

52
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,375
Aihara, why don't you
send out a signal?

53
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,666
[AIHARA]
Aye-aye.

54
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,750
This is Meifon Li,
Commander of the <i>Angel Links</i> .

55
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,458
Would you please explain to me

56
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,666
why you dare to take
pot-shots at us?!

57
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,291
If you don't cut it out,

58
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,500
we're going to chase
your ship down

59
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,208
and blow it to smithereens!

60
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,083
[sighs] Just great...

61
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,166
[MEIFON]
Huh?

62
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,291
A girl...

63
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,958
But where...?

64
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,916
You can't... You're the pirate?

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,625
I'm captain of the <i>Rainy</i> .
I'm Jesia Garland.

66
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,958
Captain, will you
kindly explain,

67
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,250
What is it that you
want with <i>Angel Links</i> ?

68
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,125
[gasps]

69
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,291
Kosei Hida?

70
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,125
[KOSEI]
Huh?

71
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,750
Uh. I wanted to...

72
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,500
...see you.

73
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,291
I wanted to see you again.

74
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,666
Huh?

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,166
And power ready now!

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,791
But wait!

77
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,083
And fire!

78
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,791
So how many hits?!

79
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,375
Well, uh... Hold on...

80
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,958
No way! It looks like the pirate
ship has started to retreat now!

81
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,625
Can't be!

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,333
Kosei?

83
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,208
But what?

84
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,208
[ANNE]
Did you hear?

85
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,416
[AIHARA]
She wanted to see you.

86
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,458
Please, don't look
at me that way.

87
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,083
[MEIFON]
Don't tell me, Kosei,

88
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,416
that you actually had a pirate
as an acquaintance.

89
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,833
That's not true. I've
never seen her before.

90
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,291
Is that so?

91
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,833
Valeria!

92
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,041
Remember, we went to the Western
Region for an investigation.

93
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,583
It was two weeks ago;
you met her then.

94
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,500
[KOSEI]
Huh? Hmm...

95
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,875
[DICE]
How about it, Jesia?

96
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,708
Wanna come up to
my room tonight?

97
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,500
I'll roll ya a few sevens.

98
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,666
[JESIA] No dice,
Snake Eyes. Good-night.

99
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,708
[DICE]
Your loss!

100
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,750
[JESIA gasps]

101
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,500
[JESIA]
Huh?

102
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,916
Be careful.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,166
Here.

104
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,166
[VALERIA]
Love at first sight.

105
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,916
There is nothing between us.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,375
All I did was give
her my handkerchief!

107
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,916
She's a pirate girl.
You treated her like a lady.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,458
For the first time.

109
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,208
This is so totally romantic!

110
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,166
I think those beams just must
be a show of her affection!

111
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,083
Oh, the forbidden love between
a pirate and a pirate fighter!

112
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,833
[AIHARA, ANNE]
Oooh!

113
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,458
Enough you two!

114
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,375
[MEIFON]
This is ridiculous!

115
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,125
Kosei, as you very well
know, our next assignment

116
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,916
is a rather important one,

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
so we can't waste our time
on a love-sick pirate.

118
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,750
Before you get
back on this ship,

119
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,416
you will deal with this
stupid distraction!

120
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,583
[KOSEI]
Huh?

121
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,708
How?

122
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,208
Kosei, give her what
she wants for now.

123
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,791
Wine her, dine her, you know!

124
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,208
Come on!

125
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
Meifon, and what
are you going to do

126
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,708
without your
personal assistant?

127
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, consider it a
vacation without pay.

128
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,083
What?!

129
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,666
Wait a minute,
if Kosei's not around,

130
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,500
who's going to handle the books
and all of the payroll for us?

131
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,416
[AIHARA gasps]

132
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,125
My paycheck!

133
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,666
Look, nothing's decided yet.
I'm not going to be gone long.

134
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,000
So does that mean now we have to
bring the commander her tea?

135
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,083
[groans]

136
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,916
[DICE] Why did you retreat from
<i>Angel Links</i> after shooting?

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,375
Was it because of
that guy, Kosei?

138
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,083
Are you hot for that pansy?

139
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,791
Even your father said I could
have his daughter, Jesia!

140
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,458
Dice, stay cool, and remember

141
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,041
that if the captain were
to leave the ship

142
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
and not return for
whatever reason,

143
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,083
then the crew would be
forced to replace her

144
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,916
with another captain.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,666
And the choice will come
down to you or me.

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,916
[JESIA]
This is torture.

147
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,541
[KOSEI]
Meifon... I just... uh...

148
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,125
[MEIFON]
Kosei, you can dump her later.

149
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,166
Just go on a date
and get her to lie low

150
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,041
till we're finished
our next job.

151
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,125
[KOSEI]
Date?

152
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,541
Well, you could marry her.

153
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,375
Uh. Ma-Marriage?!

154
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,083
Bye!

155
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,166
Wait, what do you mean?

156
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,208
[sighs]

157
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,375
Oh, man.

158
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,208
At this rate, I'm going
to be out of a job

159
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
at <i>Angel Links</i> soon.

160
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,791
[sighs]

161
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,458
[KOSEI]
Women.

162
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,750
Date it is.

163
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,708
She may be just a girl,
but she's still a pirate.

164
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,541
Ah, that felt good!

165
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,625
[MEIFON]
Huh?

166
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,833
Gee, I wonder if he's
going to cuff her

167
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,291
and hand her over to the police.

168
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,541
[MEIFON laughs]

169
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,083
Hey, what are you
up to in there?

170
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,208
[MEIFON] I'm just gonna do
a little under-cover work.

171
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,791
Recognize me?

172
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,541
But isn't that spying?

173
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,833
I'm... It's for...
his own protection.

[AIHARA]
Speaking of Cupid...

175
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,208
They're from Leon Lau.

176
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,208
Why, this is so big,
it's almost obscene.

177
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,958
Why... does he send me flowers?

178
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh. Stick them in the office.

179
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,333
[AIHARA]
Huh?

180
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,583
Hey, they're your flowers!

181
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,375
You don't just stick them in
the office, they came for you!

182
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,875
Don't you care?

183
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,750
[KOSEI]
Have you seen this girl?

184
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,291
What are ya? Some kinda cop?

185
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,250
Well, not really.
I'm just a friend of hers.

186
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,833
[CLADE] No doubt. I can
tell by lookin' at ya.

187
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,541
You're too soft to be a cop.

188
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,416
[CLADE chuckles]

189
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,583
[KOSEI]
Hm?

190
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,291
Just get me a Scotch.

191
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,916
[CLADE]
Strong drink for a little man.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,708
Jesia should be here soon.

193
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,125
This is her regular
watering hole in Altile.

194
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,583
Hey. Speak of the devil.

195
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,250
Wait. Only when I tell you.

196
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,750
But I never expected you
to come after me like this.

197
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,208
So what... do you want with me?

198
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,458
[KOSEI]
I don't know.

199
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,583
Well...

200
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:40,125
You, uh... looking for a
place where we can be...

201
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,375
...alone for a while?

202
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,625
Well, yeah.

203
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,791
[JESIA]
This way.

204
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:50,791
[SALLY]
Hi!

205
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,000
[KOSEI grunts]

206
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,666
So, Kosei.

207
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,916
[JESIA]
Wha--?

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,583
Sally! I was going to
call you! Honest! I was!

209
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,208
Cut the crap, Kosei.

210
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,166
I don't believe you
for one single minute.

211
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,458
She's your new girlfriend?

212
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,916
No. Not really.

213
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,375
[SALLY]
Hmm.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
[KOSEI]
Uhh...

215
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,583
What I like about you is
that I can't hate you, Kosei.

216
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,875
[KOSEI]
Uh. Thanks, I guess.

217
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,333
You know, you should get

218
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,958
your little space urchin
some decent clothes.

219
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,750
Look how she's
eyeing that dress.

220
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,375
That's not your
style, is it, Jesia?

221
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,125
Maybe.

222
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,791
Yeah, I'd wear that.

223
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,916
[KOSEI]
Huh?

224
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,916
[KOSEI]
What am I doing?

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,833
[SALLY]
Here she comes.

226
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,375

Look.

228
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,666
Is this okay?

229
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,708
It's beautiful, Jesia.
Give it a twirl!

230
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,250
[IRIS]
Kosei!

231
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,291
[IRIS]
You're back!

232
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,166
So why haven't
you called me? Hm?

233
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,250
Is this another new girlfriend?

234
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,083
Well... no, she's...

235
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:38,833
Jesia.

236
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,500

Oh.

237
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,958
Hey, will you come
by the restaurant?

238
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,708
But... I...

00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,708
[IRIS] Come on!
And your girlfriend, too.

240
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,583
What's the matter?

241
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,000
Nothing. The way you eat
reminds me of someone.

242
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,375
I'll buy this time, okay?

243

[KOSEI]
Oh...

Huh?

You're melting.

No!

so please keep it!

I just don't know
what to do with you!

I don't know how
you feel about me,

and I've never even been
with a man like you!

I've shocked you now,
haven't... haven't I?

Tell me why all of
this so painful.
