[LEON]
Dear Meifon.

2
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,291
This is your invitation
to a final battle.

3
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,750
[gasps]

4
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,000
[LEON] If you wish
to save Yayoi's life,

5
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:05,083
you should come to see me.
If you refuse to come to me,

6
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,208
I'll release the same
virus onto Oracion IV.

7
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:14,416

Meifon...

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,333
[gasps]

00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,250

[MEIFON gasping]
Yayoi!

14
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,875
Why would he go after Yayoi?!

15
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,666
Goryu!

16
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,375
Goryu...!

17
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,291
[KOSEI]
Hm?

18
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,125
[MEIFON]
Stay away!

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,000
Huh?

20
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
Don't you dare come near us now!

21
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,125
But what are you going to do?

22
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,166
Sorry... I know you wanna help

23
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,750
but this is something I need
to resolve all on my own.

24
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,916
Thank you, my friends.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,833
Come back! Meifon!

[MEIFON grunts]

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,458

[DUUZ]
Stop it!

30
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,375
Will you let go!
Let me go, Duuz!

31
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,500
Meifon!

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,250
<i>Angel Links</i> !
Ready to launch!

33
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,666
Just takes off on her
own like that?! [growls]

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,500
She's crazy!

35
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,416
Kosei!

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
Where do you think you're going?

37
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,375
Take a guess!
I'm going after her!

38
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,291
--Aw. yeah!
--Let's go!

39
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,375
[LEON] I'm sure you can
figure out where I am.

40
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,291
[MEIFON]
A place that only I know.

41
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,333
[gasps]

42
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,291
[MEIFON]
The asteroid Mystel...

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,750
You want to use the
B Configuration?

44
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,250
[VALERIA]
It's an emergency.

45
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,958
Equip the Carrier Dress
with the Dummy Core.

46
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,250
[JAEGER] That requires
Commander approval.

47
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,500
Let's not quibble
over details here.

48
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,500
The commander--didn't she say
that Angel Links was dissolved?

49
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,208
Never mind that!
Make the preparations!

50
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,125
Get on it!

51
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,875
Yes, Officer. I understood you.

52
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,500
[JAEGER]
Hm? Huh?

53
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,791
[JAEGER] You said emergency.
May I ask what it is?

54
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,541
We'll explain later.
It's time to launch!

55
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,500
Well, we should
be able to manage this.

56
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,041
Yeah.

57
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,541
[NIKOLA] The B configuration
gives us five times the output,

58
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,916
we'll catch up to the commander.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,833
Can you pick up Meifon's course?

60
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,333
Too much time has
passed, impossible!

61
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,791
And she hasn't filed
a flight plan yet, either.

62
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,791
Check the registers of each
planet and space station.

63
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:19,625
Yes, sir.

64
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,958
[TAFFEI chirping]

65
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,708
[KOSEI]
Taffei...

66
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,250
Can you please tell us where
Meifon might've gone, huh?

67
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,666
[chirps]

68
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,916
That's right, Taffei.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,541
You know Meifon better
than anyone else does.

70
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,666
Huh?

71
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,625
[NIKOLA]
Taffei seems to think

72
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,458
the course is in the
north-eastern rim.

73
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,791
All right. Assault
Carrier Dress! Launch!

74
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,125
[MEIFON]
I'm getting closer...

75
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,708
[MEIFON]
I'm getting closer...

76
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,208
...to where I was...
as my real self.

77
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,541
My place of origin...
My birth place?

78
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,833
What real self?!

79
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,875
No!

80
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,208
In order for me to
remain myself,

81
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,750
I must destroy Goryu
using my own free will.

82
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,250
For my own sake!

83
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,541
Yes...

84
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,958
[LEON laughs]
How strange

85
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,500
that I have awakened the one

86
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,250
who was created
specifically to destroy me.

87
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,333
But I don't regret it.
In fact, it gives me

88
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,458
a certain sense of perverse joy.

89
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,125
Do you think I'll be able
to acquire Meifon?

90
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,583
Yes, Master Goryu.

91
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,583
As you wish, sir.

92
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,125
[laughs] Soon enough we will
have the answer to it all.

93
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,625
[MEIFON]
All right.

94
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,458
I will fight the program and
defeat Goryu of my own will.

95
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,416
That will prove that
I am truly alive.

96
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,583
He has entangled innocent people
into this battle between us.

97
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,083
I will never let him
get away with it!

98
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:45,500
[growls] Goryu!

99
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,125
No!

100
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,625
[MEIFON] As long... as
I can remain myself...

101
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,750
...no one else will get hurt.

102
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,583
So Doc, what do you think?

103
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,833
So far, it doesn't seem like
there was any viral contagion

104
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,125
along the route the girl took.

105
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,416
I see.

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
It has, however, recently
come to my attention

107
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,833
that an experimental virus
was stolen 3 weeks ago.

108
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,333
What about the vaccine
for the virus?

109
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,791
There was a vaccine
stolen with the virus

110
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,958
and it's the only
one that exists.

111
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,750
So it all lies in
the hands of Goryu.

112
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,750
Found it! Identity confirmed!

113
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,958
It's the <i>Angel Links</i> ,
in its normal dress.

114
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,875
[VALERIA, KOSEI]
Huh?

115
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,541
Where's it heading now?

116
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,750
[ANNE]
Towards an asteroid.

117
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,916
[KOSEI]
What's there?

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,208
According to the data,

119
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,708
there's nothing at all
but an abandoned

120
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,208
resource station
down there. [gasps]

121
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,291
[KOSEI]
What's the matter?

122
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,208
It's registered under...
under Chenho.

123
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,541
Chenho?!

124
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,416
[VALERIA] Probably a
secret weapons plant

125
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,125
disguised as an abandoned mine.

126
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,333
Can we catch up?!

127
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,458
I doubt it.

128
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,500
Even with the Assault speed...

129
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,750
But there is one way.

130
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,833
This route here.

131
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,250
We can't!

132
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,333
The ship won't be able to bear
the heat from the star.

133
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,541
Besides, we could get
caught in its gravity field,

134
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,333
causing us to crash.

135
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,125
Certainly the ship
may get damaged.

136
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,458
But given the considerable
power of the Assault Dress--

137
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:28,041
we'll be able to break
through the gravity field.

138
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,416
[JAEGER]
Let's go.

139
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,250
I am not afraid of my own death

140
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
as long as it protects
our commander.

141
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,625
I believe that I speak
for everyone present.

142
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,916
Everyone...

143
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,000
...let's... go!

144
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,625
We might not be able
to do anything

145
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,041
even if we catch up to her,
but we've gotta try!

146
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,041
Set course for the
north-eastern rim!

147
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,500
[CREW]
Aye-aye!

148
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,791
[MEIFON] I'm so sorry
you got drawn into this.

149
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,375
I will make sure
you're saved soon.

150
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,958
Even if I have to
give up my life.

00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,625
So hold on, Yayoi.

[MEIFON] Please, I know
I don't pray very often,

154
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:32,041
but please let me be who I am
now for a little bit longer.

155
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,000
If only to save Yayoi, I don't
care what happens to me.

156
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,541
There is no time!

00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,416
I'll take the shortest
route possible!
