by Lord Hiraga Dynecourt.

00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,708
It's the only one of
its kind in space.

00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,250
And it's so deadly,
it makes me shudder.

00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,166
That's why I love it!

'Casue this ship and I must
be perfect for each other.

With both Duuz

00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,041
we're going to be invincible.

Sounds good.

There's only one person who
can handle "the dragon"

in your faction, not mine.

[PRIEST] I wanted to ask
you a question, Meifon.

22
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,958
Why did you not even shed a
single tear at the funeral?

23
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,625
I know you were close
to your grandfather.

I think you're still in shock.

I'm concerned about you.

You're going to need some
good friends you can trust.

No. I don't need any friends.

28
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,166
I need a professional

And so, are you Meifon Li?

I was told that I should offer
my support to you when needed.

00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,125
I made a promise to your

Thirdly, full control
of said enterprise

shall be granted to Meifon Li.

A free pirate fighting service?
What is this, a charity?

48
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,750
That's the most lame-brained
excuse of an idea

00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
My screen is showing
several merchant vessels

84
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
that caught in
behind the pirates!

Seventeen vessels in total!

86
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,666
[ANALYST]
The Oracle Cannon is a weapon

87
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,666
that disturbs the flow of ether,

88
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,083
robbing a ship of its
power and control.

89
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,333
It creates a violent
wave in space

90
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,083
and all ships in
range are affected,

91
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,791
both civilian and enemy.

92
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,583
Sufficient care
must be exercised

93
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,083
when using this weapon

94
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,958
because the Oracle Cannon not
only affects normal flight

95
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,625
but it makes control under
ether drive impossible.

96
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,666
Yeah. Go ahead and
shut 'em down, boys!

Good riddance to the
free pirate fighters!

With this recent accident,

the TS Military Treaty will most
certainly be put on review.

There're some hungry pirates

00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
[MEIFON]
Hm.

160
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,708
[VALERIA]
I understand your situation.

161
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,625
I'm just not interested
in the position.

162
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,583
Please let me by.

163
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,750
Forget it.

164
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,041
Listen, I appreciate your offer,

165
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,083
but you aren't
even in my league.

166
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,750
I know I am young, but
I know my own strength.

167
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,250
[VALERIA]
You're naïve.

168
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,166
[MEIFON]
Three months.

169
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,333
[VALERIA]
Move.

170
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,750
[MEIFON]
Just give me three months!

171
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,458
[VALERIA]
Why?

172
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,583
[MEIFON]
Because with or without you,

173
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,833
this project will happen.

174
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,333
I have total faith in it.

175
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:56,291
This work will be done, so
please have faith and follow me.

176
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,458
If three months pass and you
still don't believe in me,

177
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,750
then leave.

178
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,833
[gasps]

179
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,291
Okay. Luck is half the battle.

180
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,541
So I would like to
see if you're lucky.

[chuckles]

183
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,208
[KOSEI] Of all the Dragonites
in the known world,

184
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,125
Duuz Delax Rex is considered

185
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,083
the finest commander of
hand-to-hand combat.

186
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,250
He'd be an excellent
addition to our personnel,

187
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,500
or should I say, Dragonnel?

188
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,375
So you want to
employ me, do you?

189
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,625
[yells]

190
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,583
If you want me to
submit to you,

191
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:12,166
come at me with your
sword, young girl.

192
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,541
[DUUZ]
I'm surprised.

193
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,083
You're quite skilled
for a mammalian girl.

194
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,166
But you're useless
without a sword.

195
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,833
[MEIFON]
I wouldn't move.

196
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,833
Girl, I'm really impressed
with your courage.

197
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,833
But you definitely
need more than courage

198
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,208
to win in barehanded combat.

199
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,750
Barehanded? My battle sword
is directly above your head.

200
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,208
What?

201
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,666
Girl, I submit.

202
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,250
Not bad.

203
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,083
It's all right.

204
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,375
[MEIFON] While you are
on this assignment,

205
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
you must set your
personal feelings aside

206
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,750
or they will interfere
with your judgment.

207
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,583
In space, the smallest loss
of judgment can be fatal.

208
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,041
You may feel resentful taking
orders from a young girl

209
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,125
and I don't care
if you dislike me.

210
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,333
But while we're on board,

211
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,541
I ask that you set
your feelings aside.

212
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,916
And let us all work
as a unified team,

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
together as professionals.

214
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,750
You're late.

215
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,916
I'll sign for three months.

216
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,333
As soon as my nails are dry.

217
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
All crew have now reported.

218
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,833
Good! Then let's
prepare to launch!

219
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,416
[ANNE]
Grappler ships sighted ahead!

220
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,166
All stations report status!

221
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,500
They-They just won't respond to
our identification calls at all!

222
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,458
[gasps] The enemy Grappler ships
are approaching really quickly!

223
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,541
Commander! What should
our course be?

224
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,458
We could shoot them
any time now!

225
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,708
[gasps]

226
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,958
Oh, brother. A little
performance anxiety?

227
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,083
[BOWIE]
Uh.

228
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,625
Oh, relax, boys,
and think of baseball.

229
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,916
These lousy pirates will
simply be target practice.

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,041
And if it comes to
hand-to-hand combat,

231
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,708
I'll gladly take them on.

232
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,333
Anne, keep me informed
of our status!

233
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,541
[ANNE] Grappler ships
approaching at eight o'clock!

234
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,000
In 20 seconds, we'll
be in range of firing.

235
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,375
Serge, what's the output
of the Links Cannon?

236
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,375
Output is at 30%!

237
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,958
Maintain it there.
The surrounding area?

238
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,791
I detect that there
are no merchant vessels

239
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,125
within firing range of
the Links Cannon.

242
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,833
We're all ready.

00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,875
Cherubim! Fire!

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,041
[sighs]

245
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,333
[DUUZ] The first battle
is always like this.

246
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,166
President, congratulations
on your magnificent success!

247
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,500
[KOSEI]
There's a hornet on your face.

248
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,875
Look out!

249
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,916
Got it.

250
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,750
Oh, Commander! Hey, Commander!

251
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,041
[MEIFON]
Huh?

252
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,000
[ANNE]
Are you free tonight?

253
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,375
[MEIFON]
Why?

254
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,041
[AIHARA] Anne found a great
little Chinese place!

255
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,708
Really? I'm starved, let's go!

256
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,416
Okay, sounds good!

257
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,416
Hey, do they have ginger beef?

258
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
I could go for tofu dim sum now.

259
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,916
[MEIFON]
Right, you're a vegetarian!

260
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
[KOSEI] Yeah, and he
eats like a whale!

[DUUZ]
She eats more than me.

262
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,000
[VALERIA]
If Meifon eats more than Duuz,

263
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,541
Kosei picks up the tab.

264
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,000
Wh-Wh-Why me?

00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
[MEIFON] Hear that, Taffei?
Kosei's treating tonight!

[TAFFEI chirping]

[KOSEI] A volunteer
pirate fighting service?

268
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,416
Why would you send
your granddaughter

269
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,375
into a dangerous
business like that?

270

She's so young
and... beautiful...

Oh, hey there, Meifon.

[MEIFON] I know,
my name's on the grave.

00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:48,916
A joke, I guess.

Y-Yeah, I suppose so...

276
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,583
When the time comes,
maybe I'll be reborn as a cat.
