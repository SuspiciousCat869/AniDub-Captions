Receiving ship identity codes.

166
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,083
It's a Marcotte cargo vessel,
positioning to link up with us.

167
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,291
We will approach in
spherical formation.

168
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:48,375
[MARCOTTE] I'm going to
see you, Emma. Soon!

169
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,375
So how are you doin'?

We'll have ya home in no time.

I'm in your hands.

You're safe and sound.

[MARCOTTE]
Meifon.

175
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,833
Yeah?

176
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,208
You get so many calls,
so why'd you pick me?

177
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,708
[MEIFON]
Well, maybe it was the way

178
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,000
you looked at the picture
of your daughter.

179

Uh?

180
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,291
You must really
love your family.

I'm a lucky man.

Hey, you think she's

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
you should see her in real life!

I guess in a few
hours, you will!

He's got the wrong space ship.

It looks like we'll
arrive without a glitch.

But it sure is quiet out there.

194
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,958
That's a rare luxury for us.

195
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,375
So don't count your
chickens just yet.

[ANNE] We're 10,000
kilometers off course!

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Do the idiots dare to strike
us head on with one ship?

00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,500
[ANNE] Enemy Striker

[MEIFON]
Hm!

00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,958
No doubt, the fools.

Wait.

211
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,375
That was a decoy!

00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,875
Here come the others!

What's going on?!

[ANNE] Six Grappler ships
approaching fast!

[MEIFON]
Very clever...

221
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,250
They lured us here because
it's tough to maneuver.

222
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,458
[MEIFON] We'll blast them
with the Oracle Cannon!

We can't use it here.

[MEIFON growls]

225
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
[DOLCE]
They got the <i>Angel Link</i> escort,

226
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,791
proof that this is definitely
the ship with the guns.

227
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,166
I was right!

228
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,333
And we have the advantage.

229
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:25,375
The <i>Angel</i> 's too big to do
battle in an asteroid field.

weakness of the <i>Angel</i> .

Move the <i>Angel</i> forward now!

out that much longer!

[MEIFON] I'm so sorry
you lost your cargo.

Oh. Well, at least we're
alive. That's what counts.

Yes, but you...

[MARCOTTE]
What do you mean, sir?

00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,166
I blew up your cargo.

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,125
[MAN IN SUIT]
You never had cargo.

[MARCOTTE]
Hm?

280
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,500
What are you saying?

281
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,916
[VALERIA]
The weight readings didn't match

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,416
between the ship
and the containers...

283
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,250
...because they were empty.

[MEIFON]
Huh?

285

the Einhorn Empire?

I don't believe my past
is any of your business.

[MEIFON]
Why were the containers empty?

288
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,291
Marcotte's was a decoy ship,
meant to fool the pirates.

289
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,833
Bet you didn't know
that, did you?

290
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,541
Yes. They keep them in the dark
to avoid any information leaks.

291
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,833
Then where's the real cargo?

00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,791
[GORDON] Ohh... Susie...
Where's my Susie?

293
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
[MAN IN SUIT] Gordon Hoi decided
to transport it himself.

so please sign here.

You could've had this man
killed out there playin' decoy!

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,708
Marcotte has a wife
and child, you know!

00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,250
Huh?

299
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,000
It's okay. I'm used to this,
and at least I get paid for it.

300
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,041
And thanks to you, I made
it home safe this time.

as to take on this kinda work?

You really...

305
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,416
You really have no
idea how hard it is

306
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,708
for a person like me
to raise a family.

307
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,166
This is the only kind
of work I'm offered.

308
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,916
And if it means risking my life

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,250
for the sake of
my daughter, I'll do it.
