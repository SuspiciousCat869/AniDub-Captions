[LEON]
Chenho...

3
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,958
Is this a judgment of blood?

00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,208
[CONTROLLER]
Your entry permit number please.

5
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,208
[VOICE] C338. Cargo delivered
to Ride Transport.

6
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,375
We have requested
an <i>Angel Links</i> escort.

7
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,875
[CONTROLLER]
Instructions received,

8
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,250
you'll embark tomorrow.

9
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:52,541
Please complete your
inspections at C Gate.

00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,833
[VOICE]
Thank you.

11
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,250
[KOSEI] So this is the
shipment cargo manifest

12
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,375
and the contract between
Ride Transport and us.

13
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,791
Ah...

14
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,041
[LAWYER] The contract stipulates
the route to be taken,

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,916
details of the escort,
and a contingency agreement.

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,416
[gasps]

17
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,083
Please read it carefully,
and sign there at the bottom.

18
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,708
Yeah... It's amazing
there are pirates

19
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,958
who will come after
us small fish.

20
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,208
I can't afford to
hire a security firm

21
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:27,041
for such small merchandise so
we're very thankful for you!

22
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,125
[yawns]

23
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,708
[MEIFON]
Give me a break, you worry wart!

24
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,458
The planet Dela route
is a walk in the park.

25
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,708
I'm tired of babysitting
cargo for these stiffs.

26
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,041
[yawns]

27
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,750
[MEIFON] There's never
an attack! It's so boring.

[RIDE PRESIDENT gasps]

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,875
There's trouble!

32
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,166
[RIDE PREZ, MEIFON]
Huh?

33
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,833
The cargo was stolen
while being brought in...

34
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,291
Just right before it entered
into our security zone!

35
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,291
And the culprits?

36
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,458
[CONTROLLER]
They've escaped!

37
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Looks like the "Outside" Gang.

38
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,083
You mean the beggar pirates?

39
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,791
[KOSEI]
Great. She's thrilled.

40
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,458
Please tell me! What was taken?!

41
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,625
[CONTROLLER] Ride Transports.
Containers 2 and 3.

42
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,625
No! That's ours!

43
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
[RIDE PRESIDENT]
I knew it!

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,833
Container 3 has the client's
priceless artwork!

45
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,375
And we can't pay it back!

46
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,666
Counselor! Please tell me
the responsibility

47
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,208
was handed over to
the Angel Links!

48
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,500
Tell me they're liable, please!

49
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,166
No! We haven't signed yet.

50
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,583
So? There's my signature!

51
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,958
I'm telling you it's
already a done deal!

52
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Wait just a minute.

53
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,250
It was your responsi--

54
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,791
It certainly was not!
The deal is done!

55
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,500
Angel Links has to compensate
for all the stolen cargo!

56
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,541
It's part of the
contingency agreement!

57
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,208
It didn't reach our safety zone,

58
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,083
so therefore it wasn't
on our property!

59
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,958
You should have arranged
for other security.

60
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,083
Altair is a dangerous place.

61
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,041
You should be responsible for
the shipment in your territory!

62
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,375
Counselor, it's a contingency!

63
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:05,041
Well, it did actually happen
outside of the gate...

64
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,833
[RIDE PRESIDENT] I beg you.
Consider it a contingency!

65
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,041
No, it isn't.

66
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,166
No, it isn't.

67
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
[RIDE PRESIDENT]
But you drew it up!

68
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,291
Not valid!

69
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,583
--[RIDE PREZ] Deal is done!
--No it isn't!

70
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,000
--Yes it is!
--No it isn't!

71
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,208
--It is!
--It isn't!

72

--It's not!

73
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,333
--It's done!
--No! Not done.

74
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,916
--Done!
--No way!

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,875
[MEIFON]
It's done!

76
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,375
Meifon!

77
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,416
She signed it!

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,208
So we have a case! We have a
binding contract with you!

79
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,333
Hurrah! Ha, ha!

80
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,625
Why did you sign it?

81
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,458
Haven't you heard
what's been going on?

82
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,583
I heard.

83
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,833
Once signed, it's
our responsibility.

84
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,875
So, let's go get
that shipment back.

85
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,791
Huh?!

86
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,208
Get it back?!

87
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,625
Actually, I don't mind if you
reimburse me with cash.

88
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,125
We have our own
way of compensating.

89
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
The contract doesn't specify

90
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,666
how we do it,
that's our business.

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
Huh?!

92
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,291
[MEIFON]
Next time...

93
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,208
...you should read
the fine print.

94
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,791
[RIDE PRESIDENT]
Y-Yes, ma'am...

95
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,500
[KOSEI]
They call this is the "Outside."

96
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,291
A Skid Row for vagrant pirates
who've lost their ships

97
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
or were injured in space.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
[ANNE, AIHARA laughing]

99
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,041
[KOSEI]
They use the Outside as a base,

100
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,750
and emerge onto
the surface to plunder.

101
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,625
This incident is
definitely their doing.

102
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,625
[KOSEI] This underground world
is controlled by one man...

103
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,708
...Cyrus.

104
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,083
A former pirate--
the one who built

105
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,750
the Outside up
to what it is today.

106
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,916
[KOSEI]
Please take a look at this.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,500
It's a map of the airline route,
and one of the subway system.

108
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,291
As you can see, they both divert
around this empty space here.

109
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,000
The Outside.

110
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,833
Cyrus owns the land surface,

111
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,250
the underground,
and air rights too.

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,583
The railway department
of the Links Group really

113
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,041
wanted to purchase the land
and build a subway system,

114
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,625
but it was to no avail.

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,666
Ooh. I see now...

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,083
I always wondered why the subway
took such a roundabout route.

117
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,083
The diversion makes my
commute twice as long!

118
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,333
Me, too! Commuting
drives me crazy!

119
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,916
Does this Cyrus drag queen
have that much power?

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's rumored he uses Tao.

121
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,708
Tao... Magic.

122
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,291
We don't know the exact
extent of his power,

123
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,500
but nobody who has
crossed into his territory

124
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,125
has ever returned alive.

125
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,958
So, my conclusion is...

126
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,250
Let's just compensate
the client with cash.

127
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,208
'Cause it's not worth the risk.

128
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,708
[MEIFON]
We'll head out in 30 minutes,

129
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,125
so be prepared.

130
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,333
W-W-Wait a minute!

131
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,041
What about Valeria and Duuz?

132
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,500
[MEIFON]
Well. They're not required

133
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,958
under contract to do
any surface duty.

134
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
We're on our own!

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,916
Meifon.

136
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,875
It's not required in my
contract either, you know.

137
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,958
Ya got enough guns in here?

138
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,500
I don't feel like dying today.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
[AIHARA] The commander
sure likes a fight.

140
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,083
I suppose. But maybe
there's more to it.

141
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,458
Huh?

142
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,166
[ANNE] One of the containers
plundered was filled

143
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,833
with personal belongings
like letters and gifts,

144
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,291
children's toys. You know.
That kind of thing.

145
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,750
[AIHARA]
So?

146
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,583
[ANNE]
Probably reminded her.

147
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,666
Apparently, her grandfather sent
her some birthday presents

148
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,333
right before he died, but
she never received them.

149
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,916
The ship was
plundered by pirates.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,541
So, the commander makes a point

151
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:46,083
of protecting shipments that are
worth more than just money.

152
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,958
Oh, wow! She has
such a great heart!

153
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,416
I think she also just likes
to have a good scrap.

154
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,916
[KOSEI coughs]
Bad pavement kicks up the dust.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,166
Oh, I'll have to wash
my hair when we get back.

156
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,000
[KOSEI]
If you still have a head.

157
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,125
[GANG chuckles]

158
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,250
Huh?

159
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,333
[MEIFON]
Can ya spare a moment?

160
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,833
I'll spare you anything,
babe. Come home to Papa.

Good!

323
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,416
[DUUZ]
Now! Run!

324
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,791
[KOSEI panting]

325
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,791
[VALERIA, MEIFON panting]

326
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,416
Huh? This way everyone!
And hurry!

327
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,916
[CYRUS] You can run as much
as you want, but it's useless.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I see your every move.

329
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,916
No! Don't end this way!

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
[CYRUS]
It is time to admit defeat.

331
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,541
I've won.

332
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,916
[laughing]

333
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,875
[laughing continues]

334
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,125
[KOSEI]
Uh...

335
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,375
[MEIFON grunts]

336
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,000
Cherubim fire!

337
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,791
That's it!

338
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,166
[CYRUS]
What's that above?!

339
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,125
A spaceship, Captain!

340
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,291
[CYRUS]
A... Spaceship?

341
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,125
[AIHARA] Isn't it a breach
of the TS Military Treaty

342
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,000
that I fired the Links cannon
onto the surface like that?

343
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,416
It's fine. Pinpoint accuracy.

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,541
Besides, what's done is done.

345
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,916
You're right!

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,083
So, let's give them another one!

347
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,416
[CYRUS whimpering]

348
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,083
[MEIFON]
Get a load of this!

349
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,250
[CYRUS] What are you...
What are you doing?!

350
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,041
[CYRUS whimpers]

351
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,458
[CYRUS]
What's goin' on here...?!

352
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,250
Hey boss, have we been cleared

353
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,291
to start building
the subway yet?

354
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,083
Hm? That's what everyone wants!

355
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,500
[CYRUS]
Subway...?!

356
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,291
That's right. The Links Group
is building a subway.

357
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,166
Right through your ship.

358
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,125
Stop it!

359
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,875
[CYRUS groaning]

360
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,708
Cyrus may be a criminal,

361
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,125
but he does still legally
own the land.

362
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,625
He'll be compensated.

363
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,166
As for the people who live here,

364
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,166
I have a little work
project for them.

365
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,625
Huh?

366
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,083
[MEIFON] If they behave,
they can run the subway line.

367
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,083
[KOSEI]
What?!

368
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,333
[DUUZ]
That is, if it suits them.

369
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:01,333
My Outside ship...
Oh, my ship...

370
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,375
[cries]

371
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
Now, I want my shipment back.

372
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,916
Curses, on you! You are
destroying my ship!

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,583
What do you mean your ship?!

374
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,041
You're nothin' but a
grounded old pirate!

375
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,291
No more suckin' all
the power from the Earth

376
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,583
for your stupid Tao!

377
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,083
I bet you were a third-rate
pirate in space,

378
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,583
you Pippy Long Stockings.

379
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,958
You're lucky to be stuck
in this soil, you bad weed.

380
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,750
How dare you insult me!

381
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,208
How dare you! I am a captain!

382
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,291
[CYRUS yells]

383
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,708
[CYRUS groans]

384
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,250
You can spend some time
behind bars on the Inside now.

385
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,625
[KOSEI] Meifon! I just
found the shipment!

386
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,125
[MEIFON]
Hmph.

387
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,125
[KOSEI] They were getting ready
to sell off the container

388
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,916
with the artwork, but this
one was going to be dumped.

389
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,250
Someone is going to get
their birthday present.

390
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,083
Thank goodness.

391
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,541
You all right? Hey,
what's wrong? Meifon!

392
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,583
[ADMIRAL] So... you want
data on Angel Links?

393
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,791
[LEON]
That's right.

394
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,791
I need this favor from you,
your excellency.

395
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:11,041
Well, since it's you
requesting it... I'll do it.

396
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,083
Special Forces III.
Will that do?

397
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,666
Thank you, Admiral.

398
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,125
I would like to send
those armaments to you

399
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,250
as a token of my gratitude.

400
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,750
[ADMIRAL laughs]

401
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,416
[ADMIRAL]
May we always be good friends.

402
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,041
Yes.

403
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:51,875
[MEIFON] Next time on
<i>Space Guardian: Angel Links,</i>

404
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,708
"A Pheasant
Chooses its Nest."
