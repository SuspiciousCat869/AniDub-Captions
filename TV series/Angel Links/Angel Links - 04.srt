1
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,916
[TOKACHEV] Finally, after 178
years, you have appeared!

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,333
My elusive LiEF.

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:21,166
You will soon be in my grasp
and I will have eternal life.

4
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,958
Commander, you're right.
It's a remarkable creature!

5
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,250
I've never seen
anything like it.

6
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,500
You mean the LiEF?

7
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,541
Actually, its full name
is "Living Ether Flier."

8
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,125
It generates ether energy
through Dragon Stones

9
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,791
stored in its body.

10
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,250
And it's the biggest
living creature in space!

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,958
Lots of hype.

12
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,791
[KOSEI] It says here that
because the Lief lives so long,

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,041
some people think they can
actually gain immortality

14
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,583
by eating its liver.

15
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,833
Well, I suppose we better be
on the look-out for poachers.

16
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,000
Furthermore, his notion of
immortality is perpetuated

17
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,708
through both legends
and the occult.

18
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,291
You know, I do remember
my grandfather tellin' me

19
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,666
about the nutcase weirdos
who actually believed

20
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,000
in all of that whole liver
eating immortality nonsense.

21
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,041
It's very important to
many people out there

22
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,541
that we do our absolute
utmost to protect the LiEF.

23
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,791
The LiEF is safe with us.

24
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
[VALERIA]
I suggest we put <i>Jaeger</i> on this,

25
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,791
we need all the
hands we can get.

26
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,000
And convert the <i>Angel</i>
into <i>Carrier Dress</i> .

27
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,000
Speed won't be an issue.

28
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,125
The LiEF likes to take
her own sweet time.

29
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,833
Probably why she's
lived so long.

30
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,083
Yup.

31
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,375
And it'll be good to put
Jaeger's unit to work

32
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,458
so they don't get rusty.

33
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,458
[NIKOLA]
Three, two, one.

34
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,875
Take-off!

35
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,500
All right then.
<i>Angel Links</i> ! Launch!

36
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,541
Advance flying unit
surpassing Mach 1.

37
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,541
Spreading the sound barrier.

[ANNE]
Confirm <i>Carrier Dress</i> Base,

39
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,250
commence with
conversion operation.

40
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,416
We're now commending the
adjusting of the orbit velocity

41
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
between the dock
and <i>Angel Links</i> .

42
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,041
Darlings, time for wardrobe!

43
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,458
The <i>Angel</i> will be the
lady in red tonight.

44
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,541
<i>Angel Core</i> , all
compartments sealed.

[BOWIE]
Gantry arm, making contact.

operations: Complete.

50
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,916
We're headin' out now!
Let's go meet the LiEF!

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,458
Ready to launch.

52
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,125
Welcome to the <i>Carrier</i>
<i>Dress</i> , Commander.

53
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,708
There's no need to salute
little 'ole me, Captain Jaeger!

54
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,125
This isn't the military.

55
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:04,833
[JAEGER]
Aye-aye.

56
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,333
Nice to see you again,

57
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,833
but let's cut the formalities
and get down to business.

58
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
[TOKACHEV]
Well, my lady LiEF,

59
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,708
you don't look a day
over 10,000 years old.

60
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,333
Do tell me your secret.

61
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,291
You are like a wizard who
lives on nothing but air,

62
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,125
but somehow, you've
gotten awfully fat.

63
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,750
Not that I'm complaining.

64
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,625
Every pound I carve out
of your round belly

65
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,666
earns me a small fortune,

66
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,333
then I'll have wealth
and eternal life!

67
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,416
[laughs]

68
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,708
[ANNE]
We have sighted the LiEF.

69
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,958
[MEIFON]
Adjust speed and stay astern.

70
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,208
[NIKOLA]
Aye-aye.

71
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,291
[ANNE]
Monitor screening of LiEF.

72
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,500
[MEIFON]
What's that?

73
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,916
[ANNE]
That's the LiEF child.

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
I'll have to zoom
out for the mother.

75
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,833
There she is in all her glory.

76
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,625
Wow. I don't believe it.
The LiEF is so totally huge.

77
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,250
Do you think that thing is
actually a real living creature?

78
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,666
So they say.

79
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,500
Yes, because the LiEF converts
space ether into energy

80
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,291
by using the Dragon Stones
stored within its body.

81
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,666
So poachers are on the prowl for
her famous liver of immortality

82
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,791
and also for those
Dragon Stones.

83
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,000
You know, I'm thinking our space
ship uses ether for fuel

84
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,833
just like the LiEF.

85
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,916
So do you think that mean that
the <i>Angel</i> 's a living organism?

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,708
And to think that
you passed Biology.

87
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,458
[ANNE]
Commander!

88
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,333
There appear to be several
ships approaching the LiEF.

89
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,833
What should we do?

90
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,875
What kinda ships?

91
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,041
[ANNE] Private sightseeing tour
ships. Registration's confirmed.

92
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,875
They're getting awfully close.

93
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,500
Well, I bet that those
tourists paid mighty big bucks

94
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,375
to get a first-hand look
at the real LiEF.

95
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,625
Well, they better back off
quickly, or they might get hurt.

96
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,708
That LiEF baby is one
very agile creature.

97
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,250
Oh, c'mon, what's
a baby gonna do?

98
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,208
I'll go out and
warn them anyway.

99
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,750
Nikola, keep <i>Angel Links</i>
at this position.

100
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,291
Yes, Captain.

101
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,875
Captain Jaeger.

102
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,291
Yes?

103
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,416
Come along for the ride.
We could use a few more ships.

104
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,291
Sir! I mean, Commander!
I'm ready when you are.

105
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,875
[MEIFON]
He really needs to get out more.

106
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,958
[OPERATOR 1]
You're required to use a hood!

107
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,250
And mess up my hair? Bah!

108
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,666
Now, you be careful, Commander.

109
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,916
I just wanted to warn you,
this thing may look small,

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,291
but it's extremely powerful
and sometimes even kind of wild.

111
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,750
[MEIFON]
I've heard that one before.

112
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,500
Look, I know what I'm doing.

113
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,791
These ships were ordered
to my specifications.

114
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,875
[OPERATOR 1] Well then, I'm glad
your investment isn't wasted.

115
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,416
And good luck.

116
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,958
Man, I really should give
these guys more to do.

117
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,208
They're so uptight.
Just chill out, boys.

118
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,375
[OPERATOR B] Captain Jaeger,
you're cleared to launch.

119
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,875
Launching!

120

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,500
[chirping]

124
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,791
[ANNOUNCER] The sounds
that you hear right now

125
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,583
are the communications
between the LiEFs.

126
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,916
They are actually
transmitting energy signals,

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,291
but we've converted them to
sound so that you can hear them.

128
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,833
Wow. What's going on?

129
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,291
Hello. My name is Meifon
Li of the <i>Angel Links</i> .

130
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,291
We're here today
to safeguard the LiEF

131
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,041
against any pirate attacks.

132
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,375
Just in case of trouble,

133
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,875
we'd like you to withdraw
from the danger zone.

134
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,125
[CREW MEMBER] Understood,
Commander. We will withdraw.

135
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:43,375
Thank you for your cooperation.
You all have a safe passage now.

136
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,791
What?!

137
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,041
Hey!

138
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,625
[yells]

139
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,375
[MEIFON]
Get off of me, you little twerp!

140
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,250
Stop that! I'm not
a punching bag!

141
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,458
What on earth is she doing?

142
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,000
Deputy, I see an
approaching ship.

143
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,000
[KOSEI]
Huh?

144
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,458
[ANNE]
It's headed for the LiEF.

145
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,416
I can't identify
its registration.

146
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,333
[KOSEI]
Looks like a labor barge.

147
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,083
[ANNE]
I don't know. It's huge.

148
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,458
Hmm...

149
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,500
Seems very odd.

150
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,291
[JAEGER] We're alongside
the unidentified ship,

151
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,666
but there seems to be
no response from them.

152
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,000
[TOKACHEV]
They're blocking my view.

153
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,416
Get rid of them!

154
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,791
Oh, no!

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,875
Look! The ship has
just opened fire!

156
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,083
I knew it!

157
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,791
The approaching ship
is considered hostile,

158
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,916
so let's prepare to attack!

159
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,375
Fire!

160
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,750
Wh-What is happening?

161
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,833
We're jammed!

162
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,458
[ANNE]
We've lost the Jaeger unit!

163
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,375
Their controls have been jammed!

164
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,500
[gasps] A trap?!

165
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,708
[SUBORDINATE A]
The LiEF is now in range!

166
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,333
[TOKACHEV]
All right! Let's shed our cover!

167
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,166
[ANNE]
The enemy ship has separated.

168
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,333
It's approaching the LiEF!

169
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,000
There's no time for
confirmation! Attack and fire!

170
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:35,958
Huh?!

[ALL screaming]

00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,833
Idiot! There's a retreating
cruiser ship here!

173
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:41,958
Hold your fire!

[KOSEI]
Huh?

175
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,000
[MEIFON]
Ridiculous!

176
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
[TOKACHEV]
Go after the LiEF child!

177
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,416
Capture it at once!

178
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,416
Huh?

179
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,875
Move the cruiser ship!

180
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,250
[TOKACHEV]
Give the tourists a ticket home!

181

00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,958
[TOKACHEV]
Immortality is in my grasp!

186
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,791
Oh, no! They've captured
the LiEF child!

187
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,250
They're making an
escape to nine o'clock!

188
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,625
Do your <i>Angel</i> squadron proud
and do not let them escape!

00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,041
Oh, no!

[WORKERS]
Whoa!

194
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,041
[MEIFON]
Where am I?

195
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,166
You crashed into our ship!

196
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,625
So who are you anyway?

197
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,791
[MEIFON]
Huh?

198
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,000
[MEIFON] So you were repairing
a relay broadcast satellite?

199
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,291
[WORKER A]
Yeah, but we took cover here

200
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,958
when the attack started.

201
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,625
What do you mean attack?

202
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,125
[MEIFON gasps]

<i>Angel Links</i> !
Come in, <i>Angel Links</i> !

204
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,250
I'm recieving a transmission
from the commander!

205
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,583
Status report!

206
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,291
[KOSEI] Well, Meifon,
we're pursuing the pirates

207
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,708
who captured the LiEF child.

208
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,875
Deputy! The mother LiEF is
suddenly changing her direction.

209
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,250
What?!

210
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,500
She's following
the transmissions

211
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,916
being sent out by her child.

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,333
[ANNE] There's a space
station in her course!

213
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,625
And if she keeps going,
she will collide with it.

214
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,708
What do we do?

215
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,083
[VALERIA]
The LiEF is two miles long

216
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,416
and weighs millions of tons.

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,458
That's a catastrophe!

218
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,166
The only possible way to make
the LiEF change her course

219
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,083
is to re-capture the child
and move it away.

220
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,958
[MEIFON] What should I do?
There must be a way.

221
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,000
[gasps]

222
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,916
[MEIFON]
Is that a Newton Reactor?

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,166
[WORKER A] Yeah, it's
for satellite propulsion.

224
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,625
[MEIFON]
Great!

225
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,875
Oh, no, you don't!

226
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,916
That one's a brand
new replacement.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,041
[MEIFON]
Hmm.

228
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,750
[MEIFON]
Kosei!

229
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,333
Deploy the <i>Angel Links</i> fleet
onto the LiEF's course

230
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,208
at full battle speed.

231
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,416
If it looks like she'll
penetrate the safety zone,

232
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,250
force her to change course,
even if you have to fire!

233
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,625
[KOSEI]
Roger!

234
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,166
That's easy for her to say.

235
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,166
I'm going to be the one burnt at
the stake if I hit the LiEF.

236
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,791
Ah! That was close!

237
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,500
[WORKER A]
You can't take it!

238
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,958
We need it for work!

239
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,666
I promise I'll buy you a new
one! Just name your price!

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,666
What? Hey, look here, lady,
we got a job to finish!

241
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,125
[MEIFON]
I don't have time for this!

242
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,916
Just send the invoice
to Angel Links.

243
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,541
Ya got that, smarty-pants?

244
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,500
[TOKACHEV] If we can just get
in there, we'll be home free.

245

[MEIFON]
The signal.

246
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,000
I can only hope they
don't change course now.

247
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,250

[SERGE]
All gun-ports ready for firing!

250
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,625
Hold your fire till it crosses
the safety barrier zone.

251
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,375
Then fire all at once!

252
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,333
[ANNE] There's a heat
source fast approaching.

253
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,333
I've identified it.
It's the commander! No!

[yelling]

255
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,583
[ANNE] The commander
is on a direct course

256
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,291
for the enemy ship.

257
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,125
She's equipped with a
satellite propulsion reactor!

258
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,250
Why, she's ramming it into
the ship to change its course.

259
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,208
She's gone insane! What happens
if she misses her target?

260
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,375
There it is!

261
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,125
[TOKACHEV]
She dares to follow?

262
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,666
Destroy her!

263
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,083
And here I come!

264
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,958
We must make a path
for the commander

265
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,208
and do not let any
craft near her!

You're such a good man, Jaeger!

Huh?

No! This is supposed to be new!

271
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,875
Oh, no! The commander's craft
is now going off course!

272
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,458
It's headed into the station.

273
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,750
The reactor is out of control!

274

How much worse can this get?
