1
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,041
You seek your vengeance
even in death, Chenho.

2
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,291
But you miscalculated,
didn't you?

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,916
Because your assassin does
not even recognize me.

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,333
How unfortunate for you.

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:31,291
I will take Meifon before
she remembers anything

6
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,875
[KOSEI] Chenho and Goryu
were both pirates...

7
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,791
But Chenho put a price on
Goryu's head... why?

8
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,416
What does it mean?

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,916
[KOSEI]
Meifon!

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
[MEIFON]
Goryu...

11
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,250
[knocking]

12
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,458
[KOSEI]
Hm?

13
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,500
A client is here to see you now.

14
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,958
[KOSEI]
All right.

15
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,500
[MEIFON laughs]

16
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,500
[MEIFON gasps]

17
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,375
[MEIFON cries]

18
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,000
[CHENHO]
Don't!

19
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,375
[MEIFON growls]

20
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,666
[TAFFEI yelps]

21
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,541
[MEIFON] Something's strange.
I just know it.

22
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,916
[TAFFEI chirps]

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,208
Something inside me is not me.

24
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,875
[KOSEI]
Meifon.

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,750
[MEIFON]
Wh-What is it, Kosei?

26
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,125
A client who's scheduled for
embarkment tomorrow morning

27
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,916
is here to say hello. But if
you're tired, then I can tell--

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,708
[MEIFON]
No, I'll come.

29
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,750
[MEIFON yawns]

30
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,583
I think I think too much!
Time for to work!

31
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,625
Meifon!

32
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,666
[gasps] Uncle Ulgen!

33
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,083
It's been a while, Meifon.
You look well.

34
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,541
You, too! Oh, I've missed
your growly voice!

35
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,833
Well, I see you
know each other.

36
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,500
Yes, he's an old friend
of my grandfather's.

37
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,750
Correct. We were
"blood brothers"!

38
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,416
Master Chenho's?

39
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,541
But you have yet
to meet my Marcia.

40
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,833
My one and only grandchild.

41
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,375
Nice to meet you. I'm Meifon.

42
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,458
I'm Marcia.

43
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,333
And this is her first
time to Altair.

44
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you think you could show
her around, Meifon?

45
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,208
I can discuss matters
about tomorrow

46
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,208
with this fellow I suppose?

47
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,458
Sounds great!

48
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,458
I'll take Marcia around
all my stomping grounds!

49
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,875
Well then,
where should we go?

50
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,916
It's okay. if you're busy...

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,416
Oh, I'd rather do this
than dreary office work!

52
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,375
[KOSEI] This is the first
time I've seen Meifon

53
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,625
spend time with
someone her own age.

54
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,291
[inaudible]

55
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,125
[MEIFON, MARCIA laugh]

56
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,791
So, I understand that you
lost both your Mother

57
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,208
and your Father...?

58
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,250
Yeah. Since then, I have always
been with my grandpa.

59
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,625
Huh. Seems like we've
got a lot in common.

60
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,541
Right down to stubborn
grandfathers!

61
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:04,458
Let's have a toast--
here's to our meeting!

62
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,750
What? Did I say something?

63
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,666
This is the first time

64
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,750
that I've ever been
out with anyone

65
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,250
other than my grandfather.

66
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,083
Huh? Don't you go to school?

67
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,833
So ya don't?!
These days, I don't go either.

68
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,208
But it was fun.
Lots of friends and stuff.

69
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,666
Huh...

70
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,250
Yeah!

71
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,875
[GIRL 2
I'd love to go.

72
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,250
[GIRL 3
Oh, he is so cute.

73
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,708
[MEIFON]
Friends... Strange...

74
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,500
I can't recall even one
friend I used to have.

75
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,791
[MEIFON]
Not even one...

76
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,208
Is something wrong?

77
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,041
Huh? Mm! Mm-mm.

78
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,833
[MEIFON]
What's wrong with me?

79
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,833
Meifon, thank you for
taking the time.

80
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,291
[MEIFON]  My pleasure!
See you tomorrow!

81
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,833
[MARCIA]
Meifon!

82
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,791
Huh?

83
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,916
Can we be friends
from now on?

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,083
Of course!

85
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,416
[MARCIA]
No matter who I am?

86
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,458
Huh?

87
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,458
Marcia, you're a...

88
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,250
That is right, Meifon.
Marcia is an android

00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,041
[gasps]

90
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,291
[ULGEN] When I lost my son
and his family in the accident,

91
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,208
I simply couldn't bear
the sorrow of it.

92
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:38,125
So I had an android made to
look like my granddaughter.

93
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
Now she's my family.

94
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:44,375
But Marcia has no memories
yet, and no friends, either.

95
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,875
No friends?

96
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,250
I appreciate your help.

00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,083
You will be my friend,
won't you?

101
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,125
My first friend?

102
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,125
We have so much in common,
you said it yourself.

103
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,000
We understand each other.

104
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:29,000
We are not the same!
I was not manufactured!

I'm so awful.

[GORDON]
Why, this is...!

109
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,458
I can't believe this is the
escort route of Angel Links.

110
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,416
How did you get a hold of this?

111
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
[LEON]
Hmph.

112
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,333
Do you really need to know?

113
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,958
No. Not at all, I'm not nosy.

114
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,041
[LEON] We'll fire a barrage
when we get into orbit

115
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,250
around Oracion V.
With your ship.

116
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,458
Uh. What?! Wait a minute...!

117
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,958
You're going to use us again,

118
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,875
and I'm trying to run a
respectable business here.

119
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,166
This will be a
hand-to-hand battle.

120
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,750
And you are going to handle it,
a small favor between friends.

121
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,791
Anything for you, my friend.

Spreading the sound barrier.

130
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,291
[ANNE] We will be entering the
orbit around Oracion V shortly.

131
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,083
No suspicious vessels sighted.

132
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,041
Let's maintain our
current formation

133
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,500
and continue our course.

134
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, Captain!

135
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,541
And how is my uncle's group?

136
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,916
They seem just fine.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,166
That's good.

138
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
[GORDON]
How much longer

139
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,333
till we intersect the
<i>Angel Link</i> 's route?

140
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,833
About 300 seconds.

141
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,833
Well, isn't it time to
send them a signal now?

142
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,541
It's been done.

143
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,875
Tell me, why is it that you're
going out of your way

144
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,833
to do all of this yourself, eh?

145
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,958
I thought you said
that you weren't nosy.

146
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,583
No. Just curious.

147
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,291
[LEON]
You can relax.

148
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,166
I don't intend on
making you fight.

149
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,958
[ANNE] There's a ship ahead
intersecting our course.

150
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,958
The registration search says...

151
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,375
Gordon and Company.

152
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,875
And they have a space
bureau flight permit.

153
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,416
Gordon And Company? Creepy...

154
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,416
They're getting a bit
too close for comfort now.

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,583
Let's caution them.

156
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,916
Signal them, Aihara.

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,166
Sure.

158
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,166
[DOUE] There's a transmission
in from <i>Angel Links</i> .

159
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,791
[LEON]
Ignore it.

160
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,500
We'll launch the assault ball.

161
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,541
Not on <i>Angel Links,</i>
but on the ship it escorts.

162
