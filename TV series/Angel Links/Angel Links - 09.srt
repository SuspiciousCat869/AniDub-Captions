anything about Goryu?

[VALERIA]
The Goryu?

00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,625
You mean the famous
pirate who disappeared

00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,500

During this trip, when we
get to our destination

00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,291
we get a half day off
at the station, don't we?

12
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,333
You have a hot
date or something?

[AIHARA]
No! A hot plate!

That station serves
the most amazing crab!

[LAWRENCE] It looks as
though we spooked you.

55
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,375
Sorry. We are headed towards

56
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,958
our current base station
at Oracion 3.

We have no intention

I'm having scotch on the rocks.

This is where to get it,

64
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,625
it's the only place
in the station

decent single malt.

It's been 5 years and you

00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,458
[VALERIA]
Thank you.

[gasping]

73
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,250
[SUPERIOR] Your actions were
clearly a breach of orders.

74
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,833
Because of you, our fleet has
been dealt a severe blow.

75
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,458
My mission was simply
to destroy the enemy.

76
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,666
It was certainly not to
protect a misguided fleet

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
that held on to faulted views.

78
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,291
I obeyed, even if it meant
ten thousand casualties.

79
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,458
Officer, you incriminate
yourself further

with that answer!

00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,416
Defendant, refrain from making
statements out of order.

82
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:21,416
After that, you disappeared
from the Forces and from me.

83
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,833
Do you ever regret it?

84
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,000
[VALERIA]
Why? Should I?

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,750
By the way, how is your boy?

86
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,416
[LAWRENCE]
He's already in junior high.

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,208
I can't believe it.

88
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,208
[LAWRENCE] Actually,
encountering Angel Links

89
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,000
was not a coincidence.

90
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,541
[VALERIA]
Huh?

91
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,916
Do you have any desire to
return to the Einhorn Forces?

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,083
[VALERIA]
Einhorn? Me?

93
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,541
[LAWRENCE]
Yes.

94
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,708
Despite the past, your tactical
skills are highly regarded.

95
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,291
[VALERIA] If General McGuire's
here just to tell me that,

96
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,791
then I'm flattered.

97
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,208
[LAWRENCE]
But that's not all.

98
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,041
Einhorn is also looking for
information on Angel Links.

99
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,166
[VALERIA]
"Angel Links"?

100
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,250
[LAWRENCE]
It's a peace-keeping,

101
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,458
private para-military
organization.

102
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,250
We want to know about
its establishment,

103
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,125
battle capabilities
and crew data.

104
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,958
[VALERIA]
So, the Angel Links has become

105
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,333
a thorn in the side of
the Einhorn Empire, hm?

106
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,083
If we can obtain that data,

107
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,333
then you will be re-instated
to your former position.

108
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,875
[VALERIA]
So, that's the bait?

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,916

a bad proposal, frankly.

and Valeria Vertone.

If the Empire had to choose,

112
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,500
one or the other,
which would it be?

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,416
[LAWRENCE] I would do anything
to start over with you...

if they had to choose one

117
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,291
or the other, you'd
be the first priority.

118
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,333
I'll give you time
to think about it.

119
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,000
[VALERIA]
A return to the Einhorn.

120
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,500

When you put it that way...

Hey, Duuz, do you plan on
staying with Angel Links

for a little while?

00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,958
Well, it's a pretty
comfortable place.

130

So I'll at least finish
off my contract.

And the chairs are comfy, too.

00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,750
[VALERIA]
They must have suspected him.

162
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,166
Why... What's their
relationship with Goryu?

163
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,125
There's something I'd like
you to check out for me.

164
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
[LAWRENCE] I found it in
an old file on Chenho Li.

165
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,166
[VALERIA]
Chenho?!

166
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,666
[LAWRENCE]
According to the documents,

167
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,000
Chenho and this Goryu were
suspected of working together

168
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,541
in the pirating business.

169
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,916
[VALERIA]
Pirating? Chenho?

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
[LAWRENCE] Yes. And somehow
he managed to become

171
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,958
the head of a major
conglomerate.

172
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,208
[VALERIA] And Goryu
killed Chenho's daughter

173
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,666
and her husband.

174
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,291
[LAWRENCE] As to how Chenho
built up the Links Group,

175
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,875
or why Goryu went after his
daughter and husband,

176
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,875
and whether that
has anything to do

177
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,083
with the founding
of Angel Links--

178
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,708
that's what the information
department is interested in.

179
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,833
[VALERIA] It's certainly
an intriguing story.

180
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,708
[LAWRENCE] Intriguing enough
to have you stay on

181
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,166
with Angel Links as
part of their staff?

182
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,291
Now honor our agreement.

183
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,833
In exchange for
information on Goryu

184
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,208
the data on Angel Links.

185
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,416
[VALERIA] Agreed,
I'll hand over the data.

186
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,166
[LAWRENCE]
But you aren't coming back.

187
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm sorry, but it doesn't
suit my purpose

188
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,458
to build a nest in
the Einhorn tree.

189
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,791
That's crazy!

190
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,083
You could have a fleet of
thousands in the Empire

191
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,375
You'd rather grub it out
here in the frontier?

192
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,958
[VALERIA] I'd rather have
a small tree and fly free

193
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,958
than have a big tree
in the Einhorn cage.

194
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,125
[LAWRENCE]
Someday someone's gonna

195
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,625
clip your wings, Valeria!

196
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,500
[VALERIA]
No Jack for this Jill.

197
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,583
All right! Now that
we're all here... Launch!

198
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,041
Yes, Captain!

199
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:10,125
Valeria... at least I
tried to save you.

200
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,916
Stubborn woman.

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,958
[OPERATOR] Analysis of Angel
Links' data, complete.

202
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,541
[LAWRENCE]
Right, give me a report.

203
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,375
Yes, sir. The maximum
firing range

204
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,750
of the Oracle cannon is
approximately 20,000 kilometers.

205
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,250
And there is a dead angle
to the cannons on board.

206
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,333
Dead angle?

207
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,750
[OPERATOR]
In this configuration,

208
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,083
it's at 6 o'clock, low.

209
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,500
Below and directly astern
is the dead angle.

210
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,750
Ah, yes. So I see.

211
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,458
[OPERATOR]
Are you sure about this?

212
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,333
We haven't received orders.

213
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,375
[LAWRENCE] Using the same
degree of battle strength,

214
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,458
we sink the fleet which Valeria
Vertone has embraced.

215
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,041
I think that's a very
appealing prospect.

216
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,625
But General!

217
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,833
[LAWRENCE] The Einhorn has had
their eye on Angel Links for

218
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,000
a while. They won't object
if we leave no witnesses.

219
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,750
[NIKOLA] We're about to
reach the point at which we

220
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,208
can commence sub-ether drive.

[MEIFON]
Huh?

224
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,625
Hey, what are you
doin' there, Valeria?

225
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,291
I'm programming course
settings for the missiles.

226
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,000
Wh-What? Why are
we doing that?

227
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,583
Well, I wish it were
just my imagination.

228
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,916
Anne, I would like you
to keep a good watch

229
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,333
on the surrounding space.

230
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,541
[ANNE] Hm? Yeah, sure,
whatever you say.

231
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,000
Valeria, what's up, huh?

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,416
[MEIFON]
Uh. Hey?!

233
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,875
But it can't be! Because there's
nothing at all on the radar!

234
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,875
[VALERIA]
It's the Einhorn Ziedlitz.

235
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,166
[MEIFON]
Huh?!

236
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,666
[MEIFON] The Ziedlitz...
Then you mean...?

237
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Yes. I'm sure of it.

238
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,166
[NIKOLA] We're in battle
with the Einhorn?

239
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,500
[CREW muttering]

240
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,791
[AIHARA]
Can't be?!

241
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,583
Stay calm, everyone!
I doubt they'd be bringing

242
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,125
a major fleet into
the Oracion system.

243
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,083
I bet it's only Lawrence's
single squadron.

244
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,791
Valeria...

245
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,791
There's no way...

246
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,833
Valeria and... Einhorn?

247
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,083
[DUUZ]
Hm...

248
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,791
[VALERIA]
Relax and remember,

249
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,083
Einhorn attacks knowing
that I'm on board

250
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,375
They are by no means
any friends of mine!

251
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,875
Oh!

252
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,833
Retreat from enemy fire!

253
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,791
Yes, Captain!

254
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,541
Bowie! Don't use the radar.

255
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,250
You have to calculate their
position based on their barrage.

256
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,708
Aye-aye, Captain!

257
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,666
[LAWRENCE] I'm impressed.
They have determined that

258
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,500
the use of radar will
help us to detect them.

259

[ANALYST] Should we proceed
with standard tactics?

260
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,541
[LAWRENCE] Launch the sensor
pods, find their exact position.

261
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,041
[ANNE] Something's been
launched by the enemy ship!

262
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,166
It's probably some sensor pods!

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,500
Nikola! Retreat!

[MEIFON] At this rate we'll
end up taking a direct hit!

266
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,416
Isn't there something
we can do?!

267
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
There's one strategy
that might work.

268

[MEIFON]
Valeria?

270
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,958
The movement is technically
illegal, it's really up to you.

You're an acquaintance

member of the <i>Angel Links</i> .

All right. Then you're on.

like they know our position.

moving alone?

Around 21,000 kilometers!

However, we won't

00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,916
[VALERIA]
Never mind their fleet!

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,208
Aim for the command ship!

318
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,791
Ready Links cannon!

319
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,458
[SERGE]
Energy charge-up, 30%!

320
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,083
Activate, ship-wide
anti-shock system.

321
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,208
[VALERIA]
Links cannon! Fire!

322
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,375
[LAWRENCE groans]

323
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,916
[OPERATOR 1]
Number 1 gun turret destroyed!

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,541
[OPERATOR 2] Number 1 and 4
turrets aren't functional!

325
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,833
[OPERATOR 3]
Missile ports destroyed!

326
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,041
[OPERATOR 4]
Power output down 50%!

327
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,125
How could this be...?!

328
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,750
[gasps] Valeria!

329
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,666
We do not have any desire
whatsoever to sink you.

330
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,083
If you leave the battle
theatre immediately,

331
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,750
we will not give chase.

332
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,041
[LAWRENCE] Y-You mean
you're letting us go?!

333
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
[VALERIA] If we were
to sink your ship

334
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,791
we would have to fight against
the Einhorn Forces proper.

335
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,833
Even <i>Angel Links</i>
has no desire for that.

336
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,416
How did you know
our exact position?

337
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,708
[VALERIA]
It was the best position

338
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,000
from which to attack us.

339
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,791
So, you intentionally...

340
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,000
[VALERIA]
An able commander

341
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,541
never misses the enemy's
unguarded points.

342
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,625
I know you, you always attack
my greatest... weakness.

343
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:21,583
[LAWRENCE gasps]

344
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,083
[LAWRENCE]
My ship is damaged,

345
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:27,041
but my squadron is still
capable of attack!

346
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,750
Convert this to Imperial.

347
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,125
The real firing range
of the Oracle cannon

348
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,250
is 30,000 kilometers.

349
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,916
Your entire squadron is
within our firing range.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,041
Our escort ships are
surrounding you as we speak.

351
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,625
[LAWRENCE]
Huh?!

352
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,250
So, that data you
gave us was fake?

353
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,208
[VALERIA] The truth is
for you to figure out.

354
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,791
You lied to me from the start!

355
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,500
Perhaps I did lie to you.

356
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,666
I really wish it didn't
have to be this way now.

357
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,416
[LAWRENCE]
You're not the woman I knew.

358
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,791
[VALERIA] No, I'm not. You
however, are exactly the same.

359
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,916
It's disappointing.

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,750
[LAWRENCE]
What do you mean by that?

361
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:20,791
End transmission.

362
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,166
Valeria!

363
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,166
[LAWRENCE sighs]

364
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,833
[growling]

365
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,166
[OPERATORS gasp]

366
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,250
[LAWRENCE]
Little vixen!

367
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,916
[VALERIA]
Commander.

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,125
I leaked information about
<i>Angel Links</i> to Einhorn.

369
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,583
A clear violation of contract.

370
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,250
I expect you'll have
to discharge me.

371
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,875
[MEIFON]
Hm...

372
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,416
But, Valeria, do you think that
you acted on your best judgment

373
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,291
as a tactical officer
in this situation?

374
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,958
Under the circumstances.

375
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,125
Very well. It's understood.

376
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,583
[ANNOUNCER]
The Einhorn Empire Forces

377
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,458
officially announced today
that the accident was caused

378
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,500
by cosmodust impact
during exercises.

379
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,416
However, a full investigation
is still underway.

380
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,958
[LEON] The Einhorn people
should have been satisfied

381
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,166
with simply obtaining
this data. Hm...

382
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,750
[MEIFON] Next time on
<i>Space Guardian: Angel Links,</i>
