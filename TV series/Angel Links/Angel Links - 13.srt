I don't know.

I'm surprised at myself.

169
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,458
I guess I didn't want to lose
you for the third time.

When I was reunited with you...

172
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:54,291
...I felt true joy... for the
first time in a long time.

00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,916
In the past I-I betrayed Chenho,

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,875
killed Lifon with my own hands
and even you, an orphan.

175
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,375
Fearing revenge, I changed my
appearance, my name...

176
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,750
I still wanted to survive.

So I decided to live
a new life. Start over.

However... I was never
able to truly run away.

It was never supposed to happen,
from the very beginning.

180
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:28,041
And so this is... This is...

181
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,708
