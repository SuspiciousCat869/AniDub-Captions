[MEIFON]
Yayoi!

00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,250
So what brings you
here, sweetie?

6
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,041
Well, my Uncle Leon
brought me here today!

7
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,416
I hope we haven't
disrupted you, Meifon Li.

8
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
It's just that, I promised
the children a field trip

00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,083
to see Angel Links.

[NARRATOR] The Oracion
planetary system is considered

24
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,750
one of the richest areas
in the frontier of space

25
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,250
due to its valuable
mineral deposits.

26
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,625
Huge unarmed cargo
vessels are left to haul

27
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,291
valuable minerals through wild
territory filled with pirates,

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,791
who prey upon the
weak like hyenas.

29
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,333
The police are out-maneuvered.

30
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,333
To their aid come
private security firms.

31
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,666
One of these firms fights
pirates free of charge

32
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,833
to help smaller businesses
with limited resources.

33
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,000
This firm is Angel Links,

34
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,166
commanded by a 16-year-old
girl called Meifon Li!

35
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,416
[KOSEI] Leon Lau didn't even
discipline those brats.

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, I still can't believe
what they said to Duuz.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,250
But they're only children,

38
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,416
you didn't have to scare
the life out of them.

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,041
It's proper protocol.

40
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,958
Go read my Angel Links Contract,
specifically Section 8-C.

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,458
Protocol?

42
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,583
[DUUZ] When encountering a
hostile assemblage of civilians,

43
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,041
a paramilitary member
of Angel Links must not use

44
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,541
unnecessary intimidation
to ward off an attack.

45
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,208
[KOSEI] Oh, so that growl
was an expression

46
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,833
of Dragonite hospitality?

47
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,833
Remind me not to put you in
charge of public relations.

48
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,208
[DUUZ]
Hmph.

49
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,583
[KOSEI]
Wow!

50
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,583
Now that's "art."

51
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,458
Here we have an ancient
Dragonite sculpture

52
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,500
dating back 60 million years.

53
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,750
They were far more advanced

54
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,166
than their mammalian
contemporaries.

55
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,791
[KOSEI] Meifon, why did you
bring us to see this statue?

56
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,041
[MEIFON]
To understand the culture.

57
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,041
Although, I don't care
for the art too much.

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,458
Why don't you feel free to
take the time to admire

59
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,541
these artifacts
before we embark.

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,750
[WARREN] This is the infamous
Angel Links Group, I presume?

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,416
Who are you?

62
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,250
Oh, this is Doctor
Warren Phatom.

63
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,458
He's the curator in charge--

64
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,958
...of shipping this exhibition.

65
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,625
Now then, I don't believe
we had an agreement to ship

66
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:27,375
a real, living Dragonite as
part of this archival exhibit.

67
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,333
Doctor, I believe the
Dragonite is a member

68
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,583
of the <i>Angel Links</i> crew,
and will be escorting--

69
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,708
[WARREN] Captain,
I can't possibly approve.

70
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,875
We must have qualified
escorts for this shipment.

71
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,875
Duuz Delax Rex is a highly
qualified platoon commander.

72
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,083
What's your problem?

73
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,166
Listen to me,
Dragonites are barbarians.

74
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,625
Although, I do admire your
efforts to civilize him.

75
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,708
I'd call you a humanitarian, but
your subject isn't even human.

00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,875
Doctor Phatom!

77
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,708
The only barbarian
here, Doctor, is you.

78
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,750
There is nothing more
uncivilized than a racist pig.

79
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,291
Now, Commander Duuz,

80
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,875
I thought the Dragonites were
supposed to be a proud race.

81
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you really content to be a
guard dog for this young girl?

82
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,333
You're a reptile
for Heaven's sake!

83
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,208
Does Angel Links provide you
with a comfortable cage?

84
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,166
[chuckles]

85
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,583
Doctor, that's enough!

86
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,708
Listen, Angel Links will
continue to escort this shipment

87
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,041
for your sake, Captain.

88
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,500
However, we won't put up
with any more slime

89
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,208
from this Oracion sea slug!

90
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,291
I do apologize for his behavior.

91
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,833
Meifon, just ignore him.

92
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,833
What was your name, muffin?

93
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:35,291
You're just a spoiled little
brat in need of some discipline.

Now, wait! This is
highly unprofessional!

96
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,791
Exactly my point!

97
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
I won't have a space-bound bimbo

00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,041
[KOSEI] Meifon, I don't care
how much of a jerk he was,

107
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,500
you shouldn't have hit him;
it solved nothing.

Kosei! I can't help it,
'cause bullies tick me off!

109
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,375
The very thought that I even
have to breathe the same air

110
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,083
as that slug makes my
skin turn all blotchy!

111
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,750
I don't think you were even
defending Duuz' s pride,

112
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,541
you were defending your own.

113
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,125
[MEIFON] So what? Duuz can
take care of himself.

114
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,333
You've got that right.

115
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,541
[MEIFON]
Hmph.

116
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,500
Meifon, Kosei has a
valid point, you know.

117
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,291
Yeah, Duuz kept his composure

118
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,833
and he was the one who
was actually insulted.

119
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,291
Yes, it's true.

120
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,875
I never waste my energy by
getting angry at mammalians

121

because they are inferior to me.

122
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,333
Most humans insult Dragonites
to elevate themselves

123
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,166
simply because they
feel threatened.

124
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,375

00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,625
Commence sub-ether
drive immediately!

161
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,958
[NIKOLA]
Commencing sub-ether drive.

162
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,333
[NIKOLA]
We have arrived.

163
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,833
[MEIFON]
All ships, re-calibrate!

164
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,583
Resume normal flight
after re-forming!

165
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,666
We'll have to wait
and regenerate

166
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,125
before we can use the
sub-ether drive again.

167
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,208
[ANNE]
Launching patrol pod.

168
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,375
Patrol pod launch
was successful.

169
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,791
I'm now making a map
of the gaseous field.

170
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,000
[MEIFON]
How long will it take?

171
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,291
[ANNE] Let's see...
about three minutes.

172
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,750
[MEIFON]
That long?

173
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,208
Fine. While you're at it,
scan the field for pirates.

174
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,041
Then give me five?

175
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,958
No dice. Three minutes!

176
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,541
[ANNE]
Aww!

177
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,458
[ANNE] No moving vehicles
in the area. And no heat traces.

178
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,625
Generating route map:
75% complete.

179
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
[MEIFON]
You've got 45 seconds!

180
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,916
[ANNE]
Aww!

181
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,083
[DUUZ]
I see darkness in my sword.

182
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,500
Hey, Duuz, where are ya going?

183
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,583
[DUUZ]
I'll be right back.

184
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,458
Duuz pretends not to be upset,

185
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,458
but, you know, I wonder
if his feelings were hurt.

186
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,125
He can't be that upset,
his tail was wagging.

187
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:50,833
His tail?

188
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,333
[MEIFON]
Yeah.

189
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,375
That's the only way to tell
what a Dragonite is feeling.

190
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,125
When his tail wags,
he likes you.

191
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,541
When it's still, look out!

192
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,833
I think it's kinda cute
in a reptilian kinda way.

193
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,375
Yahoo! I made it in three!

194
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,291
Yee-haw! You're the best, Anne!

195
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,083
[ANNE]
Mm-hm!

196
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,041
Well, okay.

197
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,291
Comrades, it's time to
hit the battle field.

198
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,041
[AIHARA] Escort fleet
re-formation complete.

199
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,916
[MEIFON] Just in case,
proceed in alert status.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,250
[NIKOLA]
Aye-aye.

201
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,583
Wait a minute.

202
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,458
There's a sub-ether drive
trace at two o'clock.

203
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,666
Identity unknown.
Looks like a Striker ship.

204
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,916
[KOSEI]
Pirates?!

205
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
[VALERIA]
Well, it ain't the Avon lady.

206
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,333
[MEIFON] Aihara, send
out a hailing signal.

207
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,625
I did, but there just
wasn't any response!

208
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,541
I've lost their trace
in the gaseous field.

209
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,333
Have <i>Nakhodka</i> standby
at its current position.

210
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,041
Let's take the initiative
and attack first!

211
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,500
[CREW]
Aye-aye.

212
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,541
Wait. We don't know if they
are civilians or pirates!

213
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,125
Kosei, if they're
civilians, they're hostile!

214
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,166
And I just don't care what it
says in the TS Military Treaty!

215
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,791
They're obviously pirates!

216
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,125
[MEIFON]
Fire a warning!

217
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
[MEIFON]
Hmm. No response.

218
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,916
Well, if they are
indeed hostile,

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,916
it may be dangerous for us
to enter the gaseous field.

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,291
We'll never get anywhere
if we just sit here.

221
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,291
<i>Angel Links</i> , fire missiles!

222
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,166
[CAPTAIN] Has <i>Angel Links</i>
engaged with the enemy?

223
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,958
[CREWMAN 1]
No, they're still searching.

224
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,833
We just left port and
there's already trouble.

225
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,666
Captain!

226
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,958
Yes?

227
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,583
We've traced an ether drive.
Five o'clock high!

228
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,750
[CAPTAIN]
What?!

229
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,250
[CREWMAN 1]

230
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,458
Pirates!

231
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,791
We request cover
from <i>Angel Links</i> !

232
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,166
And we must immediately
retreat at full power!

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,625
Captain! Power output
is stuck at Level E!

234
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,083
And there doesn't seem
to be any response!

235
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:15,166
Allow me to escort you, Captain,
all the way to Hades!

236
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,000
[MEIFON]
What happened?

237
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,291
We were set up!

238
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,291
[VALERIA]
The first ship was a decoy.

239
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,250
Enemy ship approaching.

240
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,583
It's a Striker,
one o'clock high!

241
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,750
All hands get ready
to reverse course

242
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,750
and cover the <i>Nakhodka</i> now!

243
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,291
Aihara, tell the captain we will
be there in only three minutes!

244
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,708
Yes. I understood!

245
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,166
Nikola, now it's your turn
to do it in three minutes.

246
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,583
We'll be lucky if the

247
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,166
Aye-aye.

248
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,375
Looks like it's my turn now. Go!

249
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,958
[DUUZ] Should I lower
myself to his level?

250
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,833
[CREWMAN 1]

The target is the
enemy Grappler ship!

265
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,666
[DUUZ] No. The target
should be <i>Nakhodka</i> .

266
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,666
The only person who could
plan an attack like this...

267
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,416
...would be an insider.

[MEIFON]
Hm.

00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,791
Duuz, you're absolutely right.

270

Target the <i>Nakhodka</i> !

271
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,458
NOw you will follow the orders
of the platoon commander!

272
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,125
Then you will launch
the Assault Ball

273
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,166
and annihilate the enemy!

We haven't launched
an assault in a while.

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,250
[WARREN]
He's disappeared!

317
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,250
Where is he? Why can't
I see his figure?

318
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,958
[WARREN]
Can he see me?

319
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,625
[WARREN]
That's right!

320
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,458
Dragonites can change
their body temperature.

321
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,458
My sensor can't read him!

322
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,000
[screams]

323
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,916
[WARREN screams]

324
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,583
[DUUZ]
Get a grip. You spineless fool.

325
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,333
I suppose your
mammalian vertebrae

326
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,958
can't even handle the
back of my sword.

327
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,083
Oh, yeah!

328
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,541
[MEIFON] Duuz, how did you
know where Phatom was?

329
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,583
[DUUZ]
Simple, he's a mammalian.

330
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,208
I can smell him a mile away.

331
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,250
[MEIFON]
Really?

332
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,333
What if you thought it was him,

333
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,958
but it was me
you were smelling?!

334
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,208
It doesn't say anywhere
in my contract that

335
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,500
in times of battle,

336
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,541
I cannot sacrifice the
life of the commander.

337
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,458
Well, it would take more than
the blunt end of a sword

338
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,125
to deal with me, sweetie.

339
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,666
[chuckles]

340
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,375
[DUUZ]
A proud Dragonite would never

341
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,416
let that happen, Commander.

342
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:51,875
[MEIFON] Next time on
<i>Space Guardian: Angel Links</i> ,

343
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,208
"LiEF - Living Ether Flier."
