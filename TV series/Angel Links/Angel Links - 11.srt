Huh? D-Duuz...

35
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,541
[DUUZ] I got some information
out of Gordon Hoi, in exchange

for dropping our complaint

And so?

38
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,416
[DUUZ]
A long time ago,

39
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,791
before he became a corporate
tycoon, Chenho Li was a pirate.

40
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,958
Among his subordinates
in the group,

41
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,166
Chenho favored Goryu the most.

42
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,458
[PIRATES groan]

43
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,458
[DUUZ] And Goryu treated
Chenho like family.

44
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,250
[PIRATES groan]

45
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,166
[DUUZ] Chenho and Goryu were
like father and son,

46
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,541
but the close bond between
them broke apart when they

47
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,500
encountered an alien spaceship
full of rare metals.

48
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,583
Chenho decided
to use the treasure

49
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,666
as seed money to
build a new life,

50
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,166
give up pirating and become
a corporate tycoon.

51
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,125
However, the young hot-blooded
Goryu could not accept this,

52
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,666
so he betrayed Chenho.

53
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,541
So, you call yourself
a pirate, Chen?

54
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,333
You're the traitor,
getting soft in your old age!

[GORYU groans]

56
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,125
However, Goryu survived,

57
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,333
and then he claimed revenge
against Chenho Li.

58
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:31,791
[DUUZ] He proceeded to kill
Chenho's family one by one.

59
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,583
And then...

60
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,000
[MEIFON cries]

Chenho, if you can give me up,

64
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,916
you can give up the
rest of your family.

65
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,375
[DUUZ]
After carrying out his revenge,

66
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,000
Goryu underwent bio-surgery
and re-invented himself.

67
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:57,833
He emerged into society as
the young tycoon, Leon Lau.

68
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,041
On the surface, he's known
as a philanthropist

69
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,958
and the "Top Gun of Travel."

70
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,083
But behind the scenes,
he's an arms merchant.

71
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:10,166
Now, Goryu seems interested
in Meifon as a weapon.

72
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,541
[KOSEI]
An invincible bio-android...

73
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,000
He wants to mass-produce
and trade killer robots.

74
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,333
[KOSEI]
So, you built a bio-android

75
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,541
that resembled your dead
granddaughter, Meifon Li,

76
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,041
and you had her start the free
pirate fighting business

77
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,708
all to flush out Goryu
who was in hiding.

78
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,208
Chenho...

79
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,958
Now I understand what the date
on the grave stone means.

80
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,958
You gave your killing
machine a time limit

81
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,416
just in case she falls
into the wrong hands,

82
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,208
regardless of whether she
accomplishes her revenge or not.

83
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,166
If that date passes,
then Goryu wins without a fight.

84
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,125
However, as an arms merchant,
he has a vested interest in her.

85
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,750
So he'll pursue her until
the last possible moment.

86
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,750
[KOSEI gasps]
She has only one more month.

87
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,791
She won't even live to
see past her 17th birthday.

[MEIFON] All of this sorrow
and not one tear.

91
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,958
When I grow up, I want to be the
president of grandpa's company.

92
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,750
Then I'm gonna fall
in love and get married!

I'm gonna be a wild cat that's
free and can eat a lot!

look like Mother.

95
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,750
[VALERIA]
I still can't believe it.

96
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,875
To think she's bio-android.

97
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:11,458
I say that she's human no
matter which way you look at it.

98
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,791
It must be the hardest of
all for her to believe.

[MEIFON]
I don't know who I am.

I don't know what's

I might end up killing
you for interfering.

Then why don't you kill me?

Uh!

If you can't do it,
then you must listen to me!

[gasping]

I wonder what a real human girl
would do at a time like this?

Fighting pirates... revenge...

121
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,416
I don't want to be
programmed that way.

122
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,750
I just want...
to live my own life.

00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,125
Then, let's go.

to live your own way.

You can start a new life

to live a normal life.

First of all, let's start by

Come back anytime, my dear!

00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,791
at a time like this.

161
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,083
[MEIFON]
I know.

162
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,708
Bit of truth to that.

163
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,750
I am always coming across
things that I'm still missing.

164
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,375
[ANNOUNCER] We interrupt this
program now to bring you

165
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,708
an important news flash.
Pirates attacked today

166
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,375
an Oracion V.
It was in the vicinity of...

167
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,916
I thought that I would buy
a tablecloth tomorrow.

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,125
To match the color
of the curtains.

169
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,750
[KOSEI]
And don't forget the sugar!

170
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,625
[MEIFON] Right! So you
can drink your tea! Ha, ha!

171
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,083
I really hope I'm doing
the right thing.

172
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,708
[screeches]

173
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,708
[gasping]

174
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,625
[gasping]

175
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,333
[screaming]

176
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,916
[MEIFON]
Goryu...

177
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,000
[MEIFON gasping]

178
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,208
[MEIFON laughs]

179
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,583
[laughing continues]

180
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,666
[MEIFON]
No!

181
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
Miss Aihara!

182
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,333
Oh. Hi, Anne!

183
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,791
[exhales]

184
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,875
[SERGE] Huh? What are
you guys doin' here?

185
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,166
[ANNE]
Huh?

186
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,375
We're all thinking the
same thing, aren't we?

187
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,458
Nikola! Serge! Hi, guys!

188
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,708
I knew you'd all show up.

189
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,166
Ha, ha! Well, hello
there everyone!

190
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,958
Hello Yayoi!

191
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,708
But where's Meifon?

192
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,041
[KOSEI]
Kosei Hida...

193
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:47,791
What's a simple man like
you to do now, huh?

194
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,125
Wha...?!

195
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,291
Meifon?

196
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,708
[MEIFON] I can't accept this
reality so easily, Kosei.

197
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,875
I just can't.

198
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,083
But I have learned
something here.

199
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,083
Nothing will ever be
resolved if I avoid it.

200
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,541
I wanna live the way I choose.

201
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,750
If I have to fight
for it, and I will...

202
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,666
For my own sake,
I will defeat Goryu!

203
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,041
[sighs]

204
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,333
Let's go.

205
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,583
Are you sure that's
really what you want?

206
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,583
Is this what you want, Meifon?

207
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:42,375
I've decided... I will fight.

208
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,583
[KOSEI]
I understand.

209
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,416
I promise I won't stop you

210
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,666
if that's the way you
choose... to live.

211
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,875
[MEIFON]
Kosei...

212
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,333
Yes, Meifon?

213
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,458
[MEIFON]
Thank you.

214
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,875
Sure.

215
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,000
[MEIFON gasps]

216
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,500
What's up? [gasps]

217
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,625
[AIHARA] Commander, please
reconsider your decision.

218
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,541
We understand...

219
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,125
We do understand that you
are deeply suffering.

220
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,250
And we have no illusion that
we can resolve it for you.

221
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,916
We're just not able to.

222
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,833
But... But we've worked
together all this time,

223
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,083
and we've supported
you all along.

224
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,125
Commander, we're professionals!

225
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,958
Whatever the situation,

226
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,958
we've always followed you.

227
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:16,625
So please, please
come back to us.

228
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,833
Oh, Commander...

229
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,791
Please come back!

230
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,708
Oh...

231
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,041
[NIKOLA, SERGE, BOWIE]
Commander...

232
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,291
I'm so sorry everyone.

233
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,416
Listen carefully, crew.

234
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,625
I have decided to
go back into battle.

235
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,958
This time, I won't be
fighting for someone else.

236
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,916
I will simply be
fighting for myself.

237
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,458
Alone.

238
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,416
I can't ask you to follow me.

239
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,375
But I... want to tell you this
while I still remain myself.

240
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,708
That I am very grateful...

241
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,500
...to have... known all of you.

242
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,291
I feel just like a human.

243
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,875
With human tears and all...

244
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,500
Why are you so sad, Meifon?

245
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,916
Don't cry now, don't cry!

246
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,166
Oh, thank you, Yayoi.

247
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,958
It's okay; it's all
right... to cry today.

248
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,166
[gasps]

249
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,041
Yayoi... Yayoi?!

250
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,000
--Oh... Meifon...
--[MEIFON] Yayoi!

251
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,875
[ANNE]
She has a high fever!

252
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,625
This is... [gasps]

253
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,875
What's this?

254
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,041
Oh, Commander!
This was in her bag!

255
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,208
Leon...!

256
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,291
Dear Meifon...

257
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,833
This is your invitation
to a final battle.

258
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:10,125
If you wish to save Yayoi's
life, you should come to see me.

259
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,833
If you refuse to come to me...

260
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:17,125
...I'll release the same
virus onto Oracion IV.

261
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,375
[gasps]

262
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,416
[LEON] I am sure you can
figure out where I am.

263
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,375
I'll be waiting. [laughs]

264
