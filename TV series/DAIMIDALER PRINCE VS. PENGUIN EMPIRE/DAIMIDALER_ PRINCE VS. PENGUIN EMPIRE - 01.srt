[MATAYOSHI]
These mass-produced machines.

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,166
They aren't gonna
cut it anymore.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,208
Our enemies are
learning and evolving.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,750
[MORIKO] Type-2 is
warmed up and ready.

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,041
[MATAYOSHI]
Will it work?

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,333
[SORIKO] It's passable,
but I should warn you,

10
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,500
the pilot's particle
oscillation has been acting up.

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,166
[MATAYOSHI]
We have no choice.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,208
Send it out!

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,250
[ANNOUNCER]
Starting preparation.

[MATAYOSHI] The particle
compartment's unstable.

26
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,500
Think you can handle it?

27
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,625
[KIRIKO]
I'll give it a shot.

[NARRATOR]
The mysterious army

37
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,291
that suddenly
appeared overnight,

38
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,291
wrought great
destruction upon mankind

39
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:35,958
with its incredible robots.
However, the enemy's intent

40
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,125
remains, for the
moment, unclear.

41

[CHIEKO] Hold it right there,
Kouichi Madanbashi!

42

Huh?

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,416
[KOUICHI]
What now, Miss Chieko?

44
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,166
[KOUICHI]
Busted.

45
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,375
But what a bust it is!

46
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,708
[CHIEKO]
Well, well.

47
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
Look who thinks school
rules don't apply to him.

48
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,416
Why should I be surprised?

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,416
[KOUICHI]
Rules?

50
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,625
[CHIEKO]
As guidance counselor,

51
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,541
my patience for you
is wearing thin,

52
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,416
much like that whole bad-boy
routine you've got going on.

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,041
[KOUICHI]
Hey, wait a minute! Not cool!

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,708
Gonna give some
lame excuse now?

55
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,250
Oh, come on! Since when
is it against school policy

56
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,833
to sneak a peek at a pair of

57
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,333
ginormous sweater stuffers
in broad daylight?

58
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,625
[CHIEKO] Stare any harder
and your eyes'll fall out!

59
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,916
But no, the rule that you're
breaking is the dress code!

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Dress code? Sleeves aren't
too long, pants aren't too short

61
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,958
and crotch leaves just
enough to the imagination.

62
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,333
What part of this outfit
violates the dress code?

63
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,041
All of it!

64
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,875
[CHIEKO] Why can't you wear the
uniform like the other boys?

65
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,791
Am I gonna have to get
physical with you here?

66
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,625
Here or the janitor's closet.

67
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,041
[CHIEKO]
Ew! I will make you wear this!

68
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,291
[KOUICHI]
Oh, please!

69
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,791
If I wore that jacket,
I'd look like a boob!

00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,625
Hey, you get your butt
back here, Kouichi!

71
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,958
Real men always wear black,

72
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
not whatever ugly-ass
shade of green that is!

73
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,625

grope women and run!

find a new particle accumulator.

87
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,375
In order to do that,
you'll need to track down

88
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,416
and make contact with potential
Factor candidates, then test

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,833
their power and skill to see
if they're worthy specimens.

90

Be warned, the enemy is also
hunting Factor candidates.

00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,666
So don't let your guard down!

Damn!

[KYOKO] I can't afford
to scare him off.

95
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,500
Maybe I should try
direct contact?

like you're being watched?

You're just imagining things.

100
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,000
[GIRL 1D]
Yeah, you're probably right.

101

[KOUICHI] I don't care
what the guidebooks say.

just a minute to talk?

No, that's not it.

to what I have to say.

in your caboose!

around and those long legs.

You're a walkin' wet dream!

00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,583
How rude!

129
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,583
Is that any way to speak to
a lady who you've just met?

130
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,791
Spare me! I compared
you to a dream!

131
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,833
That's a compliment!

[MICHAEL]
Isn't it, though?

136
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,125
From here, one can gaze upon
their undergarments perfectly!

Bravo! Good show!

[MICHAEL]
Very well.

146
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,291
That's quite enough
tomfoolery for now.

something in him, too, huh?

[JAKE]
Of course!

in a variety of ways.

Aren't you embarrassed to be
ganging up 3-to-1 on a lady?

00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,833
[MICHAEL]
Not even a little!

158
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,458
[ALL]
Because...

159
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,083
[JAKE]
We're all stark naked right now!

160
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,625
[MICHAEL] And compared
to waltzing around town

161
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,250
entirely in the altogether.

162
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,208
[JIM] Picking on a girl is
hardly embarrassing at all!

163
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,416
Yeah, all right.
Can't argue with that.

164
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
[JAKE] By the way
you're staring I'd say

165
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,500
there's been a misunderstanding.

166
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,666
What?

167
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,500
[MICHAEL]
These ample bulges protruding

168
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,083
from between our legs.

169
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,416
[JAKE] I do not think they
are what you think they are.

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,625
I know exactly what those
are and I'm kinda jealous.

171
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,500
[JAKE]
These are our trademark!

172
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,083
[MICHAEL]
Our pride, our joy!

173
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,541
[JIM] Our most
resplendent front tails!

174
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,000
What? No way he
just said "tails."

175
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,416
[JAKE]
That's right, it's a tail!

176
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,625
[MICHAEL]
Definitely a tail!

177
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,458
[JIM]
It's most assuredly a tail, so.

178
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,875
[ALL]
Not embarrassing!

179
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,208
I guess not.

180
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,250
Even a cold shower can't
help ya if they're tails.

181
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,750
Enough about their dick-tails.

182
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,375
[JAKE]
Fireworks!

183
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,916
[MICHAEL]
So sparkly!

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,041
[JIM]
Front tail!

185
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,166
[JAKE]
Huh?

186
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,833
[KOUICHI, KYOKO panting]

187
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,916
[KOUICHI]
Hang on!

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,833
Who the hell were
those guys anyway?

189
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,125
[KYOKO]
They're part of the commando

190
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,625
from the Penguin Empire.

191
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,541
And right now,
they're coming after you!

192
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,625
[KOUICHI]
But why me?

193
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,041
[KYOKO]
Because of what you are--

194
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,125
[JAKE]
Hello!

195
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,125
There's no use
trying to run from us!

196
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,291
[MICHAEL] This world is round!
We'll catch you eventually!

197
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,041
[JIM]
And now we have you surrounded!

198
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,916
[JAKE] Trapped like rats
in a bag of rattraps!

199
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,458
Step aside.

200
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't get any of this crap.

201
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,416
But if there's one thing I love,
it's fighting for no reason.

202
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,666
Oh, Kouichi!

203
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,500
[KYOKO]
This is the perfect chance.

204
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,833
Now I can see his
powers in action.

205
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,625
[KOUICHI]
Heh.

206
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,375
Let's--

207
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,708
[KOUICHI groans]

208
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,166
He sucks!

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,833
[KYOKO]
Kouichi!

210
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,083
[JAKE cackles]
Oh my.

211
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,916
He's not even a
little bit impressive.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
[MICHAEL] That guy was
supposed to be a great Factor.

213
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,875
Eh, least we got
to tour the sewers.

214
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,958
Hey, are you all right, Kouichi?

215
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,541
[KYOKO]
I don't understand!

216
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,541
According to headquarters,
he's supposed to be--

217
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,541
[KOUICHI laughs]
We're up close and personal.

218
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,833
[KYOKO] Huh?
[KOUICHI] So soft!

219
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,833
[KYOKO]
What do you think you're doing?

220
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,000
This is the first time I've
ever given a girl's boobs

221
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,750
the thorough fondling
they so richly deserve!

222
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,083
Let go of me,
you dirty little horndog!

223
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,291
[KOUICHI]
Hold on, I'm almost there!

224
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,666
[KYOKO screams]

225
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,041
[JAKE]
That brilliant light!

226
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,958
[JIM]
Oh no! He's going to awaken!

227
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,208
[KYOKO gasps, screams]

228
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,625
[MICHAEL]
What?

229
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,625
[JIM] This is a tragedy!
An absolute horror!

230
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,875
[JAKE]
Are you folks all right?

231
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
[MICHAEL] We weren't the
bad guys here, were we?

232
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,166
We couldn't know
this would happen!

233
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,875
[JAKE] You shouldn't play
at a construction site!

234
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,333
It's not safe!

235
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,583
[MICHAEL]
I don't believe it!

236
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
[JAKE]
That light!

237
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,583
[KYOKO]
Hi-ERO particles!

238
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,458
[KOUICHI yells]

239
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,458
[MICHAEL]
He's awakened!

240
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,541
[PENGUINS yell]

241
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,750
[KYOKO]
You really are--

242
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,833
[KOUICHI grunts]

243
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,708
[JAKE] Ah-Ugh!
[MICHAEL] Save-Mwagh!

244
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,583
[JIM]
Terri-Blugh!

245
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,666
Amazing...

246
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
[KOUICHI grunting]

247
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
[KYOKO]
This kid's power is incredible.

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,583
[KYOKO gasps]

249
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,541
[KOUICHI]
Come with me.

250
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,250
[KYOKO]
Finally, a candidate.

251
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,791
Is he the one?

252
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,541
[KOUICHI sighs]

253
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,541
[KOUICHI]
What in the hell was that?

254
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,208
Did you hear anything I said?

255
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,166
Those penguins are evil
and their existence

256
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,000
threatens all mankind!

257
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,833
[KOUICHI] Those giant robots
that sometimes show up

258
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,000
and terrorize the city.

259
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,958
They're on the local
news from time to time.

260
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,500
Is that their doin'?

261
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,041
[KYOKO]
That's right.

262
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,083
They're an evil empire that
must be defeated at all costs!

263
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,166
They're a rotten,
festering, plague

264
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,583
upon the face of this planet!

265
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,875
They're as wicked as they come,

266
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,333
and we have to crush
them all to smithereens!

267
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,333
[KOUICHI] They must've done
something to piss her off.

268
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,708
Like leave the toilet seat up.

269
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,041
[KOUICHI]
Okay, I get it.

270
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,583
But before you draft
me into your army,

271
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,166
you do know I'm just an average
high school student, right?

272
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,833
I need a fake ID to buy porn.

273
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,750
[KYOKO]
No, don't you see, Kouichi?

274
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
You're not just an average
high school student.

275
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,500
You're special.

276
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,416
Someone capable of storing up
powerful Hi-ERO particles.

277
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,875
You're a Factor.

278
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,083
[KOUICHI] Hi-ERO? You mean
the weird pink sparks

279
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,125
that shot out of me
and roided me out?

280
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,208
[KYOKO] Correct. But those
were just side effects of it.

281
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,375
Byproducts. The particles
that you're able to emit.

282
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,791
They can control an
enormous amount of power.

283
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,750
I don't care if they can make me
piss lightning and crap thunder.

284
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,916
This battle? It's not mine.

285
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,208
[KOUICHI]
See ya.

286
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,416
[KOUICHI]
Man, that chick.

287
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,750
What was her name, Kyoko Sonan?

288
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,375
Please, I'm begging you,
Kouichi! Lend us a hand!

289
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,291
For them I'd lend two!

290
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
[JAKE]
Greetings.

291
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,250
We thought we'd drop by
and pay you a visit.

292
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,833
[KOUICHI]
How'd you find this place?

293
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,250
[JAKE chuckles]
We have limitless resources.

294
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,708
And Google Maps.

295
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,083
[MICHAEL] It's our job to
squash any potential threat

296
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,416
to the Penguin Empire.

297
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,583
Except for global warming,
'cause who has the time?

298
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,916
[JIM] Plus we have to pay you
back for our last encounter.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,250
[JAKE]
Brace yourself for battle!

300
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
[KOUICHI] If we throw down
in here and so much as

301
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,791
peel some paint off the wall,

302
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,875
I can kiss my security
deposit goodbye!

303
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,791
[KOUICHI]
See ya!

304
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,208
[JAKE]
Don't let him get away!

305
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,416
[MICHAEL] But we have to
clean up these dirty magazines!

306
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,750
[JIM]
True.

307
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,791
If one peruses another
individual's pornography,

308
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,750
it's only proper to return
said smut to its rightful place.

309
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,083
[JAKE]
Hurry!

310
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,666
[KOUICHI grunts]

311
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,625
[KOUICHI] I can't believe those
penguins were in my apartment!

312
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,458
And screwed up my
porn filing system!

313
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,583
[KYOKO]
Kouichi!

314
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,125
[KOUICHI]
Whoa, Kyoko?

315
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,166
[KYOKO] I was just on my way
over to your place to find you.

316
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,458
Why are you running?

317
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,083
Those freaks got
into my apartment!

318
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,416
Then they got into my porn!

319
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
That figures.

320
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,291
[CROWD screaming]

321
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,625
[WOMAN 1A]
What is that thing?

322
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,583
A robot! I've seen 'em
on the local news!

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,958
[JAKE cackles]

324
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,000
[MICHAEL] Even a Factor
such as yourself cannot hope

325
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,291
to defeat our
Antarctic Type 8!

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,041
It's a Penguin Empire Robot!

327
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,208
Yeah, a giant robot
attacking an unarmed kid.

328
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,833
Seems real fair!

329
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,083
[KYOKO] Get in!
[KOUICHI] No problem!

330
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,583
[KOUICHI screams] Are you nuts?
You're driving toward it!

331
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,958
Because, Kouichi, you have it
in you to destroy that thing.

332
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
Huh? When are you gonna
get it through your head

333
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,250
that I'm just an average, very
handsome high school student?

334
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,666
Yes. Kouichi Madanbashi is an
average high school student.

335
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,375
[KYOKO] But Kouichi plus
Daimidaler can be much more!

336
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,958
You forgot the
"very handsome" part!

337
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,291
It's Kyoko.

338
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,166
We've got a penguin
soldier robot on the loose.

339
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,500
[KYOKO]
Time to release Type-2!

340
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,500
[MORIKO]
Type-2? That's a no-go.

341
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,708
[KYOKO]
What do you mean?

342
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,541
The repairs should've
been done by now!

343
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,125
[SORIKO] They're done,
but it's not moving at all.

344
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,708
[SEWASHIKO]
Oh, but hey, there's still

345
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,250
the Type-3 maintenance robot.
It can move. What about that?

346
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,000
[KYOKO] A mass prototype like
the Type-3 would be useless!

347
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,708
Send over the Type-2 now!

348
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,041
Faster!

349
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,458
[MORIKO] The administrator
isn't here right now,

350
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,541
so I'm not feeling
particularly motivated.

351
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,500
[SEWASHIKO] Sonan, are you
willing to take responsibility?

352
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,250
[KYOKO]
Yes, I'll take responsibility,

353
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,583
I'll take the blame,

354
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
I'll even take you out for
a fancy lunch at Juju's!

355
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,750
[SORIKO] Dessert?
[KYOKO] And apps!

356
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,541
[MORIKO] All right,
give me your coordinates.

357
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,583
I sent them your way.

358
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,541
[SORIKO]
Route 23, Butsudangaeshi,

359
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,750
is pretty close to you.

360
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,250
What the hell is that?

361
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,666
This, Kouichi,
is our secret weapon.

362
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,833
It is our great power.

363
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,541
[KYOKO]
Your power. Daimidaler!

364
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,333
[KOUICHI gasps]
That thing's Daimidaler?

365
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,333
[KYOKO] Come on.
Get in there and let's go.

366
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,250
[KOUICHI] You want me
to crawl inside a mummy?

367
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,500
Uh, yeah, no thanks.

368
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,625
[KYOKO] But you have to!
I've already explained

369
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,625
that the particles you emit
are able to control great power.

370
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,208
About that...

371
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,833
[KYOKO]
Only people like you.

372
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,833
People with Hi-ERO particles,
can control Daimidaler.

373
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,000
So get in there!

374
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,083
[KOUICHI]
You're not exactly putting me

375
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,250
at ease here, you know!

376
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,583
That thing looks,
like, crazy-dangerous!

377
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,083
[KYOKO] The fate of mankind
rests on your shoulders!

378
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,166
[KOUICHI]
And yet shockingly,

379
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,000
that doesn't make
me less nervous!

380
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,291
[KYOKO] What if I treat you
to lunch and dessert at Juju's?

381
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,375
[KOUICHI]
I'm not hungry!

382
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,916
[BOTH gasp]

383
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,416
[JAKE]
What is this thing?

384
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,458
[JIM]
Looks suspicious.

385
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,458
[MICHAEL]
Dispose of it!

386
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,375
[KYOKO gasps]

387
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,375
[KYOKO]
Daimidaler!

388
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,333
[KYOKO]
Flightless bastards!

389
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,541
[KOUICHI] Do you really need
that giant mummy? Really?

390
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,041
[KYOKO gasps]

391
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,708
[KYOKO]
Yes. It has to be Daimidaler.

392
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,416
Only it can defeat their robot.

393
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,458
Who'd have thought
that this power

394
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,125
I was somehow born
with would turn out

395
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,916
to be such a big deal?

396
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,791
Might be fun being more
than just an average,

397
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,041
very handsome, charming
high school student!

398
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,375
Do you really mean that?

399
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,458
[KOUICHI] I don't know
if it'll do any good,

400
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,666
but I'll give it a shot.

401
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,041
Hatch open!

402
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,083
[KYOKO]
Come on!

403
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,708
[KOUICHI]
With ya!

404
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,625
[KOUICHI laughs]
Oh man, this is sick!

405
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,458
[BOTH grunt]

406
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,541
What was that?

407
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,125
I'll teach you how to
fight as we go along.

408
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,000
Why don't you start out
by grabbing the controls!

409
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,833
Uh. ike this?

410
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,583
[JAKE]
What? What's happening?

411
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,041
[JIM]
Impossible!

412
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,833
[MICHAEL]
It's Daimidaler!

413
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,458
[JAKE]
They revived it?

414
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,708
[KYOKO] It moved!
Just like I knew it would!

415
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,708
So this is...

416
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,458
Daimidaler's battle mode!

417
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,041
This is the true
form of Daimidaler!

418
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,041
To go forward just press your
foot down on the right pedal!

419
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,625
I like how this feels!

420
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,791
[KOUICHI]
I'm gettin' amped up!

421
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,958
[KOUICHI] You want a
piece of me, bro-bot?

422
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,625
All right, now push down on
that lever to attack, okay!

423
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,500
[KOUICHI grunting]

424
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,583
You can't just keep
punching him over and over!

425
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,916
Try some attack combos!

426
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,958
Whoa, attack combos?
I'm more of a button-masher!

427
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,791
[KOUICHI grunts]

428
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,750
[JIM] You've had your fun,
now it's our turn!

429
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,250
This is bad!

430
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,375
[KOUICHI groans]

431
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:33,958
[KYOKO yells]

432
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,666
Wait, do we have
any weapons like that?

433
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,833
[KYOKO] Yeah, but they
require Hi-ERO particles.

434
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,791
And we don't have
enough now to use 'em!

435
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,958
Well, that seems like a
pretty damn big design flaw!

436
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,458
[MICHAEL]
Fire the Antarctic missiles!

437
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,000
[KOUICHI]
Damn it!

438
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,416
There's no way we can
handle all these torpedoes!

439
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,833
[KOUICHI]
That's it.

440
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,833
You said we didn't have enough
of those "EROs" things, right?

441
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,916
Yeah, right. Hi-ERO particles.

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,583
[KOUICHI]
So if I make some of those,

443
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,291
will this thing be good to go?

444
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,625
Sure will.

445
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,583
That's all the Daimidaler
system needs to operate.

446
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,833
[KOUICHI] Okay, great.
Kyoko, help me out here.

447
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,666
Of course, I'll do anything!
Just tell me what you need!

448
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,500
[KOUICHI]
Let me touch your boobs!

449
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,875
Hm?

450
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,958
How can you think about
that at a time like this,

451
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
you sick pervert? Seriously.

452
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,958
You've got a real
problem, buddy!

453
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,375
[KOUICHI]
Just hear me out, all right!

454
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,083
I think the only way
for me to unleash

455
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,500
my Hi-ERO particles.

456
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,833
Is to do perverted, degrading,
sexy things to girls!

457
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Yeah right!

458
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,333
I'm telling you the truth.

459
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,416
Yeah, but earlier--!

460
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,458
I honked those honkers good.

461
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,500
[KYOKO gasps]

462
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,708
No, this. This can't be right!

463
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,000
[KOUICHI] And I bet if I
do some really sick stuff,

464
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,083
I'll be able to shoot out
even more particles.

465
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,416
[KYOKO]
Please, just stop talking, okay?

466
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,416
[KYOKO]
Although...

467
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,208
It is true that earlier...
But no, I can't!

468
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,625
[KOUICHI]
Kyoko.

469
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,083
How about fewer "no we can'ts"
and more "yes we can's"?

470
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,333
And speaking of "cans,"
it's grabby-grabby time now!

471
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,500
No!

472
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,666
[JIM cackles]
It's not moving at all!

473
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,375
[JAKE]
Victory is ours!

474
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,416
[MICHAEL] Shall we hit it
once more, just in case?

475
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,583
We've got no other choice!

476
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,291
Our backs are up
against the wall here!

477
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,250
Would you rather die than have
your headlights adjusted?

478
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,000
[KYOKO]
No. You're right.

479
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,000
So here! Go ahead. Objectify.

480
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,208
Oh yeah, awesome!

481
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,125
You know, I can tell
you got a lotta heart.

482
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,000
Even if it is buried under
those tig ol' bitties!

483
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh, just shut up and grope me!

484
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
[KOUICHI]
Yes, ma'am! As you wish!

485
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,750
[KYOKO gasps]

486
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,416
[KOUICHI]
Their size. Their bounce.

487
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,750
Their sheer heft!

488
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,583
Everything about them
is pure perfection!

489
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,375
[KYOKO]
Isn't. Isn't that enough?

490
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,625
[KOUICHI]
No, not yet! Not yet!

491
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,791
Not yet!

492
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,708
[KYOKO screams]

493
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,041
[KOUICHI]
There it is!

494
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,500
[KYOKO] It's the same
pink light as before!

495
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,875
[KOUICHI]
I feel so much power!

496
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,500
[JAKE]
It's erect!

497
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,583
[KOUICHI grunts]

498
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,291
[KYOKO]
Amazing!

499
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,916
I can't believe
the Hi-ERO particles

500
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,458
are already fully charged!

501
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,541
[KOUICHI]
Let's do this! Special attack!

502
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,958
Finger beam!

503
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,083
[PENGUINS]
What?

504
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,958
[PENGUINS scream]

505
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,583
[KOUICHI panting]

506
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,291
Wow! You did it, Kouichi,
you really did it!

507
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,458
[KOUICHI] No, not yet.
I haven't finished.

508
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,500
But, you destroyed their robot
and the penguins are gone.

509
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,041
It's over. What could you
possibly still wanna do?

510
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,791
I want you!

511
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,416
[KYOKO screams]

512
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,583
[KYOKO]
Those bastards have a lot more

513
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,916
firepower in their arsenal.

514
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,458
[KOUICHI]
I thought they might.

515
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,458
So, whadda ya say, Kouichi?

516
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,000
Will you join us in our fight
against the penguins?

517
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,333
Hell yeah!

518
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,666
I'll do whatever it takes
to help you beat 'em!

519
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,125
[KOUICHI] Even if I have to
glue my hands to your yabbos,

520
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,250
I won't back down!

521
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,708
[KYOKO]
Can't we find some other way

522
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,583
for you to spew your
pent-up particles?

523
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,125
[NARRATOR] At last,
Daimidaler has been revived.

524
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,916
But the fight against
the Penguin Empire

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,625
has only just begun. Do us
proud, Kouichi Madanbashi!

526
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,958
Never give up!

527
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,000
Win this war, Daimidaler!

528
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,791
[NARRATOR] Recognizing
his weakness, Kouichi learns

529
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:43,000
of true EROs as yet another
page of his youth is turned.

530
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,500
Next time:
Danger! The Stolen Sun.

531
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,250
Please look forward to it.
