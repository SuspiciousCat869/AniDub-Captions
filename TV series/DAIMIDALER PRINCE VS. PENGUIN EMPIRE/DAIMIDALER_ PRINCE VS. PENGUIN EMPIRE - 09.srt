1
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,250
[YOUNG RITZ breathes]

2
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
This was a battlefield?

3
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,375
What a travesty.

4
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,500
We're relieved the war is over,

5
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,750
but that hasn't stopped
things from getting worse.

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
How so?

7
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,333
[YOUNG RITZ] Because now
we have no Mommy or Daddy.

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I see.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,416
So where will you go?

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
[YOUNG RITZ]
We don't know yet.

11
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,208
Anywhere but here,
that's for sure.

12
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,166
[YOUNG RITZ]
What exactly are you?

13
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] I am a
super-intelligent penguin.

14
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,166
[YOUNG RITZ gasps]

15
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,000
[YOUNG RITZ]
Where did you come from?

16
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Somewhere that's so distant,

17
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,958
I've been forced to wander
your world for years,

18
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,458
as I try in vain to
find a way back home.

19
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,375
[YOUNG RITZ]
So, you're lost.

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] I don't
like to ask for directions.

21
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,083
[YOUNG RITZ] And if
you're lost, that must mean

22
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,208
you're all alone too.

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
That's quite true.

24
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,291
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Why are you following me?

25
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,583
[YOUNG RITZ]
Because of loneliness

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Are you
referring to your loneliness?

27
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,750
Or to mine?

28
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,958
[YOUNG RITZ] We'll leave
that to you to decide.

29
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Very well.

30
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,958
I accept that we're both lonely.

31
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,416
[YOUNG RITZ] You're nice
to talk to, for a penguin.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Wrong.

33
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,750
It's nice because I'm a penguin.

34
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,958
[YOUNG RITZ]
We agree. You are so adorable.

35
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,166
[YOUNG RITZ]
And talented!

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Well, it comes easy

37
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,041
when you're a penguin.

38
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:16,916
And I can't stress this enough:
I'm a talking, alien penguin.

39
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,083
[YOUNG RITZ]
A town!

40
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Human civilization.

41
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,625
It looks no different
than the parallel world

42
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,333
I once called home.

43
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,333
[YOUNG RITZ]
Parallel?

44
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
This is where we part ways.

45
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,500
[YOUNG RITZ]
Huh?

46
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The time
is not yet right for someone

47
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,750
of my kind to reveal himself
in front of so many humans.

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,083
But we just bonded
over shared loneliness

49
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Bonding, yes, I suppose.

50
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,333
Well, this has been a good
experience for our two peoples.

51
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,750
Thank you.

52
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,708
Things were already getting
rather maudlin earlier,

53
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,208
so I didn't mention that I left

54
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,833
a family behind when
I first came here.

55
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,666
I should probably return.

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,583
But, before that can happen,

57
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,625
there's something I
must accomplish first.

58
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,000
[YOUNG RITZ]
Well, then.

59
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,750
We'll become a penguin, too!

60
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] No, you have
to find your own family.

61
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,416
Surely, there's someone in that
town who would take you in.

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,916
[YOUNG RITZ gasps]

63
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I've been hoarding different

64
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,750
Earth money towards
accomplishing my goal.

65
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,125
It's not much, but it should

66
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,208
help you live a bit
until you find someone.

67
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,750
[YOUNG RITZ]
Live?

68
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,083
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Yes, live!

69
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,333
Build a new life for yourself.

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,500
You have the inner
strength to do so.

71
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,958
Will we see you again?

72
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Someday, perhaps.

73
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,458
Fare thee well,
young human girl-child!

74
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,166
[YOUNG RITZ whimpers]

75
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,875
[YOUNG RITZ]
We won't give up!

76
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,500
We'll spend the rest of
our lives looking for you,

77
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,375
Mister Cute Giant Penguin!

78
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,750
[RITZ]
A dream.

79
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,916
We don't know if it's
real for certain.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,708
Let's just call it
penguin fantasies.

81
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,166
[JIM]
You had quite the deep slumber.

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,583
[RITZ] Jim, why is your
front tail at our mouth level?

83
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,000
[NELSON]
Actually, we're all here.

84
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,666
[MICHAEL]
Whaddup, Ritz!

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,583
[JAKE]
Cup of coffee to get ya going?

86
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,208
This explains why we
felt cramped all night.

87
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR sighs]

88
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
The once mighty Penguin Empire

89
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,541
has fallen far.

90
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,083
[ADELIE]
True.

91
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,250
We have suffered many defeats
at the hands of the Humans,

92
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,500
even though we, the strongest
five, stand by your side.

93
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,083
For this, we beg your
forgiveness, Penguin Emperor.

94
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Nonsense, Adelie!

95
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,583
Yes, there have been failures,

96
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,041
but we must still plan
for ultimate victory!

97
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,166
[MACARONI]
Your Highness!

98
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,083
Please take a look
at this, right away!

99
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I've never seen Hi-ERO Particles

100
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,666
with this high of quality
and in this kind of density.

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,458
[MACARONI] It looks like they're
all concentrated in the balls.

102
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,958
Or in a nest of some kind.

103
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Even in my sweatiest dreams,

104
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,083
I can't imagine such a place.

105
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,125
[MACARONI] Because this
is a parallel Earth.

106
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,125
I accidentally found
its signature

107
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,666
while cleaning out the device.

108
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,125
Thought we could get some good
coin for it on Penguin eBay.

109
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You were gonna sell off

110
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
the Empire's stuff?

111
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,916
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.
But we're at the point now,

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,833
where we can't even
feed the Commanders.

113
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Very well then.

114
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,291
We shall recalibrate the
device so we can jump

115
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,583
to this world of
Hi-ERO Particles.

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ah, the "Penguin Dimensional

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,958
Transportation Device,"
or for brevity's sake,

118
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,166
the "Penguin Device!"
Begin testing.

119
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,500
What? I just turned it on and
it's already malfunctioning?

120
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,333
Macaroni and the others
will be so mad if I break this.

121
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,666
Oh, sugar.

122
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:22,875
Bad machine!

123
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR screams]

124
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,083
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Oh, woe
unto the Penguin Emperor!

125
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,666
My portal home has closed off.

126
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
If that's truly the case,

127
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,000
then I'll have to
make the best of it.

128
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,333
I will create a new
Penguin Empire on this planet!

129
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
And due to this parallel world's

130
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,458
abundance of Hi-ERO particles,
the front tails

131
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,791
of the penguin commandos I
created grew hard and grew fast!

132
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,208
Now, we are nearly finished

133
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,041
with a second
Penguin Dimensional

134
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,791
Transportation Device.

135
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Funny. I just remembered that

136
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,791
during my earlier
wanderings of this world,

137
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,083
I came across a
little orphan girl.

138
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,458
Since I am not a creeper,

139
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,708
I never stalked her
on social media,

140
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,166
but I hope she's doing well.
Never did pay me back.

141
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] This operation
is a new penguin operation!

142
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,791
That description was equal
parts literal and confusing.

143
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,000
I know. It's awful.

144
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,833
Whatever their latest
operation actually is,

145
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,583
I'm sure it's going
to be quite huge.

146
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,625
Oh, if only
Madanbashi were here.

147
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,416
He was the Factor for
them before I returned.

148
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,041
He piloted the
Daimidaler, Type-2.

149
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,250
[SHOUMA]
Okay, so where is this guy now?

150
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,500
And please don't say dead.

151
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,916
[MATAYOSHI]
He's dead.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,458
Sacrificed himself for a
co-worker when the penguin robot

153
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,250
self-destructed
in West Shinjuku.

154
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,166
Oh, so that's what
that fireball was all about.

155
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,791
The extreme temperature
disintegrated everything

156
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,291
and we never found
his body. It's so sad.

157
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,458
All that survived was
Daimdaler's left arm.

158
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,250
[MORIKO]
And his partner.

159
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,958
[KIRIKO]
Don't worry, Administrator.

160
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,291
Everything will work out.

161
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,291
Stop that!

162
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,041
[MORIKO gasps]

163
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,875
[MATAYOSHI gasps]

164
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,750
[KIRIKO giggles]

165
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,791
All you have to do
is look at the density

166
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,416
of our particles of love.

167
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,208
Put the two of us
in the cockpit

168
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,916
of the Daimidaler
Type 6, Kiriko,

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and those Penguins
are dead ducks

170
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,083
Hm. That's the spirit, kids.
I think the time has come,

171
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,125
to place more
trust in the two of--

172
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,041
[KIRIKO moaning]

173
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,041
[MATAYOSHI]
Gag me with a valentine.

174
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
The Super Antarctic

175
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,833
we brought over won't move?

176
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,125
[DENNIS]
It won't power up!

177
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,333
There's no explanation
for its impotence.

178
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR groans]
We went to great lengths

179
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,958
to transfer the
Super Antarctic Humboldt.

180
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,458
It is imperative this
robot not go to waste!

181
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,666
Question, Your Highness.
Who is this Humboldt?

182
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
In my old world, she was one

183
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,375
of the five strongest warriors
loyal to the Penguin Empire.

184
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,791
And among those five,

185
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,125
she ranked a very
respectable number 2.

186
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,583
Thanks to her
mastery of Peng-Fu.

187
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,916
[DENNIS] Was she a little
blonde girl who looks, acts,

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,833
talks, and even smells
like Ritz? No offense, Ritz.

189
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Yes, as a matter of fact.

190
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,333
[DENNIS]
Is that her down there?

191
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR, RITZ]
Hm?

192
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,583
[HUMBOLDT] Wow, that is
a rock-hard front tail!

193
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,375
[JIM]
Stop, you embarrass me.

194
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,250
Commanders where I
come from don't have

195
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,833
bodies that you
could rub for hours.

196
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,791
[MICHAEL] Wait, there are
penguin commanders?

197
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,750
You sure you don't mean
penguin commandos?

198
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Humboldt!

199
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,750
[DENNIS] We found her
unconscious in the robot

200
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,083
that came through the portal.

201
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
Before pulling her out,
I checked her vital signs,

202
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,916
and I'm sad to report her
bust is a flat 28 inches!

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You lied to us, Your Highness!

204
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,291
When we first came here,
you made a big stink about

205
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,541
how humans couldn't become
members of the Penguin Empire!

206
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Humboldt is
not actually all human being.

207
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
What?

208
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
She was created artificially,

209
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,208
from Humboldt penguin DNA.

210
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,791
She's a mutant?

211
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
And a nympho.

212
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,250
Her penguin DNA came from a
Humboldt during mating season.

213
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,666
[HUMBOLDT] Come on in,
boys, the water's warm!

214
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,083
[JIM]
I'll carry that egg all winter!

215
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,375
[NELSON]
Oh, my!

216
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
She can be a lecherous girl.

217
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,375
[RITZ]
Huh.

218
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,333
Oh, hello, Your Highness

219
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,125
[HUMBOLDT] It's been a
long time. You look good!

220
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,750
As your loyal subject
that makes me very happy.

221
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Uh, thanks.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,333
Now, cover those small breasts 

223
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,833
[HUMBOLDT] You must
understand, Your Highness,

224
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,833
you happened to transport me
during a routine systems check.

225
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,333
When I woke up, your guys had
their flippers all over me,

226
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,291
cupping and measuring.

227
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I apologize

228
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,791
for their perversion, Humboldt.

229
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,541
Groping aside, I must say
your arrival is fortuitous!

230
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,708
[HUMBOLDT]
How so?

231
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We need your help.

232
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,541
[HUMBOLDT] I've looked
at all the sub-systems.

233
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,625
The penguins you have in
this world don't generate

234
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,416
enough Penguin Line to power
the Antarctic Series.

235
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,041
But, I happen to have a solution
to that, Your Highness.

236
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,375
If you add in someone
with my breed's DNA,

237
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,750
you'll close that
performance gap, no problem.

238
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] It sounds
like you're volunteering

239
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,666
to pilot it yourself, Humboldt!

240
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,083
Leave it to me!

241
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Why the awkward silence?

242
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,333
My bad.

243
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Oh, come on!

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,583
After all that work, you forgot
how to pilot the blasted thing?

245
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,833
[HUMBOLDT]
I look at those controls

246
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,125
and it's just, like, a blur.

247
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,583
[DENNIS]
Oh, I know!

248
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,875
[MICHAEL] Her piloting
memories are what she lost!

249
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR groans]
Of course they are.

250
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,875
This really sucks.

251
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,833
We'd happily pilot
the Super Antarctic

252
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,291
if you could just get it moving!

253
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,333
[DENNIS] That's it!
[RITZ] Huh?

254
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,208
[DENNIS] If we use the
generators humans built

255
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,000
from our tech, we can close the
gap between the power we have,

256
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,166
and the power we need!

257
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,416
We love it!
Good thinking, Dennis!

258
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,708
[DENNIS]
Oh, it was nothing.

259
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,875
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
No! It's way too dangerous!

260
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,291
Last time, those generators
made Ritz lose control!

261
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,291
But we promise we'll be fine.

262
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] I don't
like where this is going.

263
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,625
Generators, that's funny.

264
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,791
[RITZ, PENGUINS]
Huh?

265
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,791
Our home world recently
saw the appearance

266
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,708
of robot tech similar to what
you guys are describing.

267
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You mean robots that use

268
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,833
Hi-ERO particles as
a source of energy?

269
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,166
[HUMBOLDT]
Yes, but those generators

270
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,708
aren't useful back home.

271
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,541
We had to change them to
regular thermal power systems.

272
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Since
generators work on this world,

273
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,208
the only question is:
Can the Super Antarctic

274
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,916
be rebuilt to run off one?

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,541
[HUMBOLDT] I don't think
it'd be impossible.

276
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,625
It'll just take a lot
of money and hard work

277
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,416
from your hard bodies.

278
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,333
[DENNIS] To use a colloquial
human phrase, "We got this."

279
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
But how will you fund it?

280
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,833
[DENNIS] We can sell off
our porno collection

281
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,166
to a country without
Internet access!

282
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,541
[MICHAEL] And as for the labor,
we'll just do triple shifts.

283
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,708
The Union will waive all
overtime and break regulations!

284
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Pause!

285
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,708
The Penguin Empire always treats
its subjects with dignity.

286
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,708
I cannot allow my commandos to
work in sweat-shop conditions!

287
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,583
[JAKE] But we're happy
to do it for Ritz!

288
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,000
[PENGUINS] That's right!
For Ritz's sweet ass!

289
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,541
Morning Sick Ritz!
Morning Sick Ritz!

290
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Fine.

291
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,500
If you're all on board
with this plan.

292
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,000
Then I, the Penguin Emperor,
pledge my full support!

293
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,875
[PENGUINS cheering]

294
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
Love for us.

295
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,666
[PENGUINS]
Morning sick Ritz!

296
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,000
[JIM] Farewell, pornography!
You serviced us well.

297
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,583
[JAKE]
Suck it up, Jim!

298
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,708
I hear once we delve into the
depths of digital dirty mags,

299
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,833
we won't miss a thing!

300
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,000
[MICHAEL]
Yes, it's all for the best.

301
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,083
For the Penguin Empire.
For Ritz!

302
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,708
They're sacrificing
so much for us.

303
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,583
[HUMBOLDT]
Now's no time for tears!

304
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,666
Rikantz Seaberry.

305
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,333
[HUMBOLDT]
Try to hit me, hot stuff!

306
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,458
[RITZ yells]

307
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,833
[HUMBOLDT grunts]

308
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,000
[RITZ grunting]

309
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,041
Not bad, girl.
But, can you handle this!

310
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,750
[HUMBOLDT]
Embarrassment Hold!

311
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,416
Don't look!

312
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,750
[NELSON]
Ooh!

313
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,125
Looks like our look-a-likes
are getting freaky!

314
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,375
[JAKE] Yeah, is this
martial arts practice

315
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,916
or identical twin-cest!

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,125
Either way, Humboldt's
coming out on top!

317
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,875
[JIM] Ah, but you're
too quick to forget

318
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,208
that Ritz still has
the larger bust size.

319
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,083
Stop it!

320
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,125
[JAKE]
True. A cup versus C cup?

321
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,708
It's no contest there.

322
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,166
[JAKE] Well, we can't very well
work while this is going on.

323
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,500
[NELSON]
Agreed!

324
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,875
We'll watch this fight
to its toe-curling climax!

325
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,500
[HUMBOLDT grunts]
Fiery Blast.

326
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,291
Huh?

327
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,958
Penguin Thrust!

328
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,000
[RITZ screams]

329
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,333
[RITZ grunts]

330
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:36,166
[HUMBOLDT breathes]

331
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,958
Teach us that.

332
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,875
Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust.

333
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,625
It tears the clothes
from the body

334
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,541
but leaves the
panties still intact.

335
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,666
A powerful attack that
only the strongest

336
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,875
of the Penguin Empire can pull
off without being called a perv.

337
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,166
The Penguin Thrust.

338
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,750
If you really want
to become one

339
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,333
of the Penguin Empire's elites.

340
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,375
You must master the Fiery
Blast Penguin Thrust!

341
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,750
[RITZ gasps]
Yes, we will, Mistress Humboldt!

342
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,958
[RITZ grunting]

343
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,666
[DENNIS]
Closer! Closer! Closer!

344
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,083
[HUMBOLDT, RITZ grunting]

345
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,875
Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust!

346
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,416
[NELSON]
Well, it's done, and so am I.

347
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,000
[DENNIS] That wasn't the fun
kind of all-nighter for sure.

348
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,500
It's ready for battle, sir.

349
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Okay.

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,208
I'm sure everyone
worked very hard,

351
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,416
but I'll be blunt.

352
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,083
It looks like the old
Antarctic Number 8.

353
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,416
[HUMBOLDT]
That's by design!

354
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,541
We took out the
Super Antarctic's weapons

355
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,791
and computer brain and
then re-installed them

356
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,708
into the body of the Ritz Custom

357
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Interesting.

358
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,958
I don't understand any
of that, but I trust you.

359
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,166
[RITZ] This form's better
anyway, because it actually

360
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,583
looks like a penguin.

361
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,958
Well that's it for me.

362
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,125
I'm going home.
I'll pray for your victory.

363
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,625
I just wish I got a chance
to ride these front tails.

364
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Thank you, old young friend.

365
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,958
[RITZ] Yeah, we thank you for
everything, Mistress Humboldt!

366
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,083
We can't wait to use
the moves you taught us.

367
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,333
We're gonna beat Daimidaler and
humiliate them in the process.

368
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,166
[HUMBOLDT grunts]

369
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,708
[RITZ grunts]

370
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,416
[HUMBOLDT]
Later!

371
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,791
[ALL gasp]

372
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,166
[MICHAEL] Knew that dress'd
look good on the floor!

373
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,791
[DENNIS] You know,
we never managed to find

374
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,958
a bra small enough for
her while she was here.

375
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,791
[NELSON] That means,
over there she's in

376
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,916
just panties!

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,041
[JAKE]
Just panties!

378
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,916
[PENGUINS]
Just panties! Just panties!

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,041
Clean or dirty--

380
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:30,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Less panty singing,

381
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,208
more human beating!

382
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,333
[MORIKO] The target has
passed the third line!

383
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,291
It's seconds away
from the city center!

384
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,250
[SORIKO]
Daimidaler Type-6, Kiriko,

385
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,083
ejecting through
Route 32, Gobanzeme.

386
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,541
Here it comes, sweetie.

387
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,791
Roger that! Honey bear.

388
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,958
A penguin robot.

389
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,791
Moriko is it me, or is that
model a Type-8 Plus?

390
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,833
The same kind that
blew up West Shinjuku

391
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,000
and took out Daimidaler
Type-2, Kouichi.

392
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,708
But that was only
'cause it went berserk

393
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,958
and self-destructed.

394
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,291
So why would they use
this old model again?

395
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,375
[MATAYOSHI] I don't care
about their reasoning.

396
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,625
I only care about us destroying
it as fast as possible!

397
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,125
[MATAYOSHI]
Kiriko Kiyuna! Shouma Ameku.

398
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,000
We're stronger, we're smarter.
Go crush that thing!

399
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,250
Boy, the Administrator
does not like Penguins.

400
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,916
Before we fight,
I have to know:

401
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,375
why are you piloting that
old robot deathtrap?

402
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,291
[KIRIKO]
Well, Rikantz Seaberry?

403
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,958
No, no! We know each other
by now. Call us Ritz!

404
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,333
[KIRIKO]
Will you surrender?

405
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,250
[RITZ]
Fat chance, mushy pants!

406
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,333
You're the one who should
be on your knees begging.

407
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,666
Our robot is locked,
cocked, and ready to blow.

408
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,500
[KIRIKO] You know, you are
so arrogant for someone

409
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,250
who thinks that pig tails with
bangs is a flattering look!

410
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,708
Time to throw down,
Rikantz Seaberry!

411
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,458
Whatever plans you
had for us today

412
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,833
are going in the shredder!

413
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,541
[KIRIKO] Thanks to the
Daimidaler Type-6, Kiriko!

414
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,166
Well that is cute.

415
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,791
[RTIZ] It's go time,
Number 8 Ritz Custom 2!

416
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] I have
every confidence that Ritz

417
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,000
will keep her sanity
this time around.

418
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,000
The real question
is whether merging

419
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,375
a Hi-ERO Particle
Generator with a robot

420
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,083
from the parallel Earth
is our best idea yet,

421
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,000
or the mistake that
will ruin our Empire.

422
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,791
[RITZ groans]

423
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,541
Their power levels
don't even compare!

424
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,250
There's no puttin'
lipstick on a pig, Ritz.

425
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,708
That's right! Unless you're
feelin' really freaky

426
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,500
and your pig's got
room for your hog.

427
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,708
What has happened to you? Jeez.

428
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,333
[RITZ]
That's nothing!

429
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,750
Time for a special
Cock-a-Doodle-Doo. Attack!

430
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,125
Kiriko!

431
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,000
[KIRIKO gasps]
My love!

432
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,541
[KIRIKO whimpers]

433
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,583
[RITZ]
What?

434
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,125
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA yell]

435
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,583
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA] Complete!
Daimidaler Type-6, Kiriko.

436
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,458
Disguise!

437
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,208
[RITZ gasps]

438
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,625
[KIRIKO]
Ritz!

439
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,541
Our robot is now ten times
more powerful than yours!

440
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,958
Surrender or die!

441
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,208
[RITZ screams]

442
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,375
Finish her!

443
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,708
'Kay!

444
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,458
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA]
Daimidaler!

445
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,541
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA]
CP Slash!

446
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,916
[MATAYOSHI]
In your face!

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,833
[RITZ] You're strong,
as expected, Daimidaler.

448
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,458
But things are
just getting started!

449
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,333
[KIRIKO]
What?

450
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,291
[RITZ]
Embarrassment hold!

451
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,125
Shouma, please
don't look up there!

452
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,375
No, Kiriko, don't
let it get to you!

453
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,000
Those aren't your real legs
splayed for the world!

454
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,250
Oh yeah.

455
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,458
And now, the grand finale!

456
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,916
[SORIKO]
Where's she going with them?

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,083
Oh, god, not this again.

458
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,625
Don't self-destruct!

459
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,958
Not this time! In fact,
you're not even close!

460
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,625
Why would we
self-destruct when we

461
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,375
plan on playing a key role
in the coming penguin utopia?

462
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] You have
the inner strength to win!

463
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,833
Sorry, you can't get rid of us.
