Kouichi's back in the heezy!

That doofus Kouichi is alive?

00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,458
Oh, no!

Suh-weet!

00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,791
Right on the money!

00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:29,875
[RITZ]
Ouch!

00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,125
He's way stronger
than we remember!

[MATAYOSHI]
Madanbashi!

11
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,875
You sure it's him?

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,916
[SEWASHIKO]
Our pervert pilot's back!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,916
 But what's
that candle all about?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,125
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
A candle!

15
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,416
That can mean only one thing.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,625
I kept believing
that you were still alive.

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,958
'Sup, Kyoko.

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,250
I swear.

19
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,375
I heard your voice
and sex puns.

20
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,208
[KOUICHI] Well that explains
why you rushed to me

21
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,833
in nothin' but
an ass-flashing blouse!

22
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,375
That's not why!

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,416
[KOUICHI] We'll talk later about
the signals you're flashing.

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,041
For now, we got
a Seaberry to squish.

25
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,916
Hey. Why am I all
the way up here?

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,541
Just leave everything
to me, sugar tits.

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,541
[KOUICHI]
Finger Beam!

we'll kill you again!

[RITZ]
Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust!

00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,291
Not fair! He's got
the weaker bot!

32
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,375
Hey, Kyoko!

33
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,583
What's up?

34
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,250
[KOUICHI]
Let's do this!

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,875
Yeah, every girl's dream:

36
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,625
Grabby groping instead
of a nice romantic reunion.

37

[KYOKO gasps]

38
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,125
What?

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,666
When did you add this?

40
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,166
While I was on
the other side,

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
I had some aftermarket
tweaks done.

42
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,708
And I did it all
with these in mind!

43
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,875
Hey! I know it's been a while,
but don't be so rough--

44
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,416
Ah!

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,708
I missed hearing
you make those porno moans.

46
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,916
Don't you ever get tired of
being horny all the time?

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,416
Hands outside the clothes!

Hold on, we're almost there.

It's 20 times that
of the normal Type-2!

No wait, it's way
more than that!

of life-giving energy!

be okay if I came, too?

[JOSEPH] I did just say
"we" have to save her.

74

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,625
Well, at least we won.

00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,958
[MATAYOSHI]
"Daimidaler, Super Thermal

80
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,125
Power System Mounted
Type, Kouichi."

81
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,166
That's catchy.

82
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,791
[KOUICHI] You can shorten it
to Type-Super, if you fancy.

83
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,458
It's one bad mo-fo.

84
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
[SORIKO] So you have
a thermal power system

85
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,750
responsible for your
Daimidaler's physical movement.

86
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,416
Which then allows you to
stockpile your Hi-ERO Particles

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,416
and use them only for fighting.

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,875
So that big cloud at the end

89
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,750
was unused particles
being emitted.

Cleaning the pipes,
so to speak.

What the hell, Master?

93
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,625
You can't wrap your head
around this concept?

94
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,875
All we're really getting at's

95
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,333
this robot has
two energy sources.

96
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,625
What I don't get

97
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,666
is where this robot
was repaired and modified

98
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,333
if not here at the Beauty
Salon Prince, under my orders!

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,166
[KOUICHI]
Well, there was the explosion.

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,291
And the next thing
I remember is waking up

101
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,583
in some weird place
with a wrecked Daimidaler.

102
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,000
[KYOKO]
Weird place?

103
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,708
[KOUICHI] Yeah. Like here,
but just different enough.

104
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,625
I couldn't contact
any of you.

105
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,750
So I wandered around
clueless for a while,

106
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,000
until another
human-piloted mech found me.

107
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,083
Luckily, they
were as friendly

108
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,583
as they were
smart with robotics.

109
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,541
They're the ones who rebuilt
and tricked out my Type-2.

110
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,041
They also took care of me.

111
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,291
Saved my life.

112
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,541
[MATAYOSHI]
What did you say?

113
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,291
You let some strangers
touch your Daimidaler!

114
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,708
What was I
supposed to do?

115
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,083
So? What kind of group
were these rescuers?

116
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,250
Corporate, military,
or what?

117
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,458
Oh, yeah,
they were, uh...

118
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,375
Wait a minute.

119
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,375
Hm... They were...

120
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,375
What's wrong now?

121
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,250
I don't remember who they were!

122
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,958
Or even the faces of the
people who took care of me!

123
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,041
If you're too lazy to give us
a full report, just say so.

124
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,041
They told me I could
return to this world,

125
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,875
so long as
Daimidaler's left arm

126
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,083
was still here
and in one piece.

127
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,125
I spent my days
alone in that cockpit.

128
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,166
Thinking of things I never
had the chance to do with Kyoko.

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,000
Somehow, she must
have felt these feelings

130
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,666
across time and space.

131
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,500
You were thinking about me?

132
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,208
No, he was thinking
about how he wants

133
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,208
to stuff your body
like a turkey.

134
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,125
Wow.

135
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,208
What are you doing up?

136
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,208
You're supposed to
be on strict bed rest!

137
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,208
[KIRIKO] You're the new pilot,
Kouichi Madanbashi. Right?

138
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,416
Yeah.

139
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,333
And you must be...
not wearing a bra!

140
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,416
Wha--?

141
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,250
I've been recuperating
in the sick bay!

142
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,375
F-Y-I, that's Kiriko Kiyuna.

143
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,041
She's a senior Daimidaler pilot,
so please be respectful.

144
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,250
Wait.

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,250
You're that pervert!

146
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,666
All this time you two have been
attending the same high school.

147
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,750
[KIRIKO, KOUICHI]
Huh?

148
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,208
[KYOKO] She's a third year
student, and Kouichi's a second,

149
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
so at school Kiriko
is his senior as well!

150
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,291
[MORIKO]
Well, that's when he attends.

151
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
Anyway, Kiriko, your Type-6.

152
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,250
[KIRIKO]
What's up?

153
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,041
[MORIKO]
The damage was all superficial.

154
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,666
The combat chassis
is still intact.

155
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,458
[SORIKO] We just need
to swap a few parts,

156
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,500
and you'll be back in
the fight in no time.

157
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,875
[KIRIKO] Great! One less
thing to worry about.

158
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,041
Our long wrestling match
with the Penguin Empire

159
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,833
is heating up to its climax.

160
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
Now with the upgraded Type-2--

161
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,125
No Type-Super!

162
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,958
We can shred those
tuxedo-wearing

163
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,875
flightless birds into
chicken noodle soup.

164
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,500
You know, when you use
that kind of language

165
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,541
you make this whole war
sound like a joke!

166
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,125
[KOUICHI]
I take it seriously!

167
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm not taking your tits
for granted again!

168
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,458
My hands are ready to grope!

169
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,583
[KYOKO gasps]
No! Not like this, Kouichi!

170
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,708
[KOUICHI]
Stop playin' hard-to-get!

171
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,458
[KYOKO]
Stop being pervy!

172
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,458
[KIRIKO] I'll die saving Shouma
if that's what it takes.

173
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,916
Being a penguin
must be horrible!

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,208
[SHOUMA]
Being a penguin is awesome!

175
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,333
[NELSON laughs]
Glad it suits you!

176
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,708
[JAKE]
Nice to meet you, brother!

177
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,833
[MICHAEL]
Pinochle? 4:30? You in?

178
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,708
[JOSEPH]
With outstretched flippers,

179
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,208
we welcome you to
your new family, Shouma.

180
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Penguin transfer!

181
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,041
[JIM] Your Highness,
you shouldn't call

182
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,041
for a transfer
while in the bath.

183
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Did you see that candle

184
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,333
that appeared over
the new-old Daimdaler?

185
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,833
It's not just decoration.

186
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,333
It means it was running
on thermal power.

187
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,291
That's a system
of limitless energy

188
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,416
the humans in
the other world created.

189
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,625
[RITZ]
Hold on.

190
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,291
You mean to tell us
that Kouichi has spent

191
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,875
this whole time in
the same world as Humboldt?

192
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Normally,
it takes a Penguin Device

193
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,041
using a massive amount
of Hi-ERO Particles

194
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,375
to transfer things
between dimensions.

195
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,291
But the Hi-ERO
Generator that blew up

196
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,916
was so overloaded with them,

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,416
it functioned in the same way.

198
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,541
Its blast catapulted Kouichi
to the parallel world.

199
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,541
Now, the strong
Hi-ERO particles

200
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,541
powering the
new Super Antarctic

201
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,958
must have acted as
a kind of tractor beam,

202
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,041
pulling him back to this Earth.

203
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,041
And that left arm that
survived the Shinjuku Blast

204
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,791
probably served as
an inter-dimensional beacon.

205
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,541
Building the Super Antarctic

206
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,541
made the Penguin Empire
more powerful than ever.

207
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,916
But it also revived that
sex crazed, lunatic pilot.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,125
[RITZ]
Hmm.

209
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,208
Most of that sounds like
gobbledygook to us.

210
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,500
But we do like the thought
of curb-stomping Kouichi.

211
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Unrelated, but I see the boy

212
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,625
who goes by Shouma excreted
all his Hi-ERO particles

213
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,416
and became a penguin commando.

214
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,625
While Henry, whom we injected

215
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,625
with Hi-ERO particles,
became human.

216
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,625
Why is it so hard to figure out
the rules to this stuff?

217
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,083
My brain can only
handle so much

218
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,458
before it starts
giving me a headache.

219
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,125
[ALL]
Your Highness!

220
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,000
[RITZ]
Your Highness?

221
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I think this is the end.

222
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,458
No, you can't leave us!

223
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,458
[JIM]
It's just heatstroke.

224
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,125
[MICHAEL]
Eh, he had a good run.

225
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,750
Shall we break
for lunch then?

226
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR groans]
Would somebody please

227
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,625
get me a glass of water?!

228
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,750
More Daimidaler damage.

229
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,375
That robot is
incredibly troublesome.

230
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,125
Indeed, and this
isn't the only location

231
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,500
I wanted to show
you today ma'am.

232
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,166
[WOMAN] I could swear
we had the city

233
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,125
shut down this
adult book store.

234
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,125
[WOMAN]
How disgusting.

235
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,166
At this rate, all
the promising boys on the block

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,000
will become degenerate perverts!

237
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,166
They tell me this
entire area of the capital

238
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,750
became unhealthily
pornographic overnight.

239
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,000
[WOMAN] I assume we know
what's causing this shift?

240
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,250
[MAN] It's likely
due to them, of course.

241
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,791
I'm coming, Shouma.

242
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,458
[KOUICHI]
You're overreacting!

243
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
[KYOKO]
No! I'm not wearing it!

244
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,708
[KOUICHI]
Don't be selfish!

245
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,958
Kyoko, you're my partner,
that means it's your duty.

246
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,541
Now come on, it's
a co-pilot battle suit!

247
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,250
[KYOKO] How in Antarctic hell
is that a battle suit?

248
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,500
[KOUICHI]
It's got support?

249
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,541
[KYOKO growls]

250
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,916
[KIRIKO]
Kyoko, you're so lucky.

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,291
[KYOKO]
Kiriko?

252
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,083
Your boyfriend's human.

253
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,041
[KYOKO]
Boyfriend? Who told you that?

254
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,458
That's a strong word!

255
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,458
We're Daimidaler
co-pilots, not lovers!

256
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,333
Oh, who cares what we are,
just try on your new uniform!

257
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,583
Alright.

258
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,041
[KYOKO]
But only for a second.

259
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,166
[KOUICHI]
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

260
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,250
But let me watch!

261
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,750
[KYOKO]
See you later, Kiriko.

262
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,125
Uh, yeah.

263
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,500
[KYOKO]
I'm just trying it on.

264
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,041
I'm not doing
anything else with you!

265
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,708
[KOUICHI] But that won't
help with our training!

266
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,416
[KYOKO] Two seconds ago,
you said that was fine!

267
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,333
[KIRIKO]
What is their relationship?

268
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The new
thermal powered Daimidaler.

269
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,208
As I suspected he--

270
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
[RITZ] You worry too much,
Your Highness.

271
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] 
Hmm? Ritz?

272
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,333
We're confident we'll
smash his face next time.

273
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,875
'Cause we can use the Hi-ERO

274
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,875
particle generator
without it blowing up!

275
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ah, the high-risk, high-reward

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,375
Hi-ERO Particle Generator.

277
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,666
Mankind's idea to use them as
a force in battle is impressive.

278
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,083
In the end, though,
Daimidaler is nothing

279
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,958
but a reverse-engineered
knock-off

280
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,541
of Penguin Empire technology.

281
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,041
With you and the power
of your Hi-ERO particles

282
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,166
leading the charge,
we have little to fear.

283
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,250
[RITZ]
Yup!

284
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,583
Or the short version,
they're toast!

285
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
But originally, Hi-ERO particles

286
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,791
were not something
to be used as weapons.

287
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,208
Huh?

288
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ritz.

289
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,750
I have made a huge mistake.

290
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,375
For a guy who loves talking,

291
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,541
the Emperor can be
really vague sometimes.

292
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,541
[MICHAEL]
What's wrong?

293
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,916
Sad? Confused?
Constipated?

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,625
[RITZ]
Oh, hey, Michael.

295
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,750
So, get this, the Emperor
poured himself out to us

296
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,583
and said he'd
made a huge mistake.

297
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,000
[MICHAEL]
He did what?

298
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,625
Hmm...

299
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,500
What do you think
he means by that?

300
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,708
Huh? Michael?

301
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,833
No biggie! We can't
worry about the past

302
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,708
when there are
Daimidaler's out there.

303
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,250
Whatev!

304
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,208
[MICHAEL]
I have terrible news!

305
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
[JIM] Oh, Michael. It's always
something. What is it?

306
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,208
[MICHAEL] His Highness
"poured himself into Ritz,"

307
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,833
then said it was a "mistake."

308
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,541
[JIM]
Oh my god.

309
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,708
[DENNIS]
What happened?

310
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,125
[JIM] Our Emperor
sexually assaulted Ritz

311
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,750
then tried to apologize.

312
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,375
[NELSON]
You can't apologize for that!

313
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,250
That's fifth degree
sexual harassment!

314
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,625
[JAKE]
His Highness did what?

315
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,875
[SHOUMA]
Sexual harassment?

316
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,833
[JAKE] What's worse:
Sexual harassment

317
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,916
or trying to apologize for it?

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,833
[ALL]
Hmm.

319
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,500
[SHOUMA] He should have just
busted out the Gulliver Stick!

320
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,625
[DENNIS] Sorry, pal,
but that's your front tail.

321
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,291
[JAKE]
Yes, again, it's a tail.

322
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,416
Not genitals.
A tail on our fronts.

323
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
[SHOUMA]
Sorry. It's hard to get used to.

324
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,541
[NELSON] You're the
Penguin Empire class clown!

325
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,375
Is it true that
we've found the location

326
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,416
of the main
Penguin Empire base?

327
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,208
Yeah, their address
popped right up

328
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,750
when we searched online.

329
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,833
That's crazy.

330
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,375
I know, that's what we said.

331
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,958
I mean searching
for secret bases

332
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,000
hidden in hollowed-out
volcanoes or under the ocean

333
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,000
or on the moon is
really hard work.

334
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,500
Googling's way easier.

335
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,083
Kyoko, you are totally giving
it up tonight, aren't you?

336
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,208
Huh?

337
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,458
[KYOKO gasps]

338
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,041
I forgot to change back
to my normal clothes?

339
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,750
Silky intimates, huh?

340
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,500
No, it's a battle suit
Kouichi made me!

341
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,666
[KOUICHI]
Kyoko!

342
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,958
Now let's put
that battle suit

343
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,750
through its paces
with some test gropes!

344
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,500
You guys hear that?
Kouichi called it a battle suit.

345
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,666
So... Wait.

346
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,041
Did he say, "grope"?

347
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:03,916
[KYOKO yelps]

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,041
Hah, nice fit!

349
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,208
I said no!

350
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,166
[MORIKO]
Wow, he's already engorged...

351
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,000
...with particles!

352
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,291
Hell, yeah.

353
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,958
I don't care if I'm fighting
Penguins or Ritz,

354
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,125
with you dressed like this,
I can't lose again!

355
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,458
Good job!

356
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,750
I love seeing you training
so hard before battle.

357
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,666
He's not training.

358
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,625
Stop him, someone, please!

359
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,375
[KYOKO moans]

360
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,416
[MINISTER 11A] This isn't just
scandalous. It's depraved!

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,916
[MAN] This is real time
video from a hidden camera.

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,916
[MINISTER 11B] I can't watch
anymore. Turn it off.

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,375
[MAN]
Well, since my boss,

364
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,208
the Minister of Art,
is traveling abroad.

365
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,875
I'll be presenting
the report in her absence.

366
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,791
We found a steady
uptick in the sales

367
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,791
of morally unsound magazines,
games, movies, comics,

368
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,375
and self-published
erotic slash fiction.

369
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,166
The amount of exposed breasts
and barely-obscured genitalia

370
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,541
in anime has also
reached new heights.

371
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,416
And all in the
last three weeks.

372
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,875
[MINISTER 11C]
The perversion's spreading

373
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,500
faster than a flu epidemic.

374
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,833
[MAN]
Yes, and it all started

375
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,583
only after the appearance
of this Daimidaler.

376
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,750
Beauty Salon Prince.

377
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,375
We should have eliminated
them when we had the chance.

378
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,000
After that robot
blew up West Shinjuku.

379
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,125
To think, when the
penguins first showed up,

380
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,583
I thought that stupid
Salon would emerge

381
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,291
as the saviors of our world.

382
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,666
[PRIME MINISTER]
The saviors who actually

383
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,250
cleansed the world
of all the filth,

384
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,750
however temporary,
were the Penguins!

385
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,541
[MINISTER 11A]
It's very ironic, yes.

386
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,791
[PRIME MINISTER]
I want immediate measures

387
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,750
in place to stop
this epidemic.

388
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,208
Before we become a land
of pillow-humping perverts.

389
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,791
[KYOKO moaning]

390
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,791
[KYOKO]
Isn't this enough?

391
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,541
[KOUICHI]
Not even close!

392
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,708
I still have to show you

393
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,750
all the special
features I had thrown in!

394
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,708
Open top!

395
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:42,916
You asshole!

396
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
[KOUICHI] Now I have
naked boob access

397
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,916
in the middle of
the most heated battles!

398
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,708
[KYOKO moans]

399
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,083
The Hi-ERO Particle
load is maxing out!

400
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,125
Wow.

401
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,833
With this much
power in his hands,

402
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,708
I like our odds of killing
every last Penguin on Earth.

403
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,375
[KIRIKO]
Administrator!

404
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,291
[MATAYOSHI]
What is it, Kiriko?

405
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,625
I want in on this
battle, too, sir!

406
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,208
[MATAYOSHI]
Two Daimidalers at once.

407
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,333
Well I do like
the sight of double Ds.

408
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,250
Alrighty, then!

409
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,833
Thank you, Administrator!

410
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,833
I'll go give
the Type-6 a once-over!

411
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,708
[MORIKO]
There's one problem, sir.

412
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,291
To move the Type-6, Shouma
needs to be in the cockpit,

413
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,916
regulating Kiriko's power.

414
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,375
[Sewashiko]
They gotta get dir-tay.

415
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,833
[MATAYOSHI]
That's true.

416
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,500
Otherwise, there's a chance
Kiriko goes berserk again,

417
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,000
which would be
balls-to-the-wall cool

418
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,750
if we could channel that
energy into killing Penguins.

419
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,000
Actually, her melting down

420
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,041
right on top of their
base would be perfect!

421
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,458
[laughing]

422
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,041
[ALL]
Uh...

423
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,875
[KYOKO] Kiriko! I heard
you were healed up.

424
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,833
So now the three
of us can do it!

425
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,791
Fight, that is.

426
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,250
[KIRIKO]
Sure, no problem.

427
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,458
[KOUICHI] We should
probably think of a plan.

428
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,833
Yeah, like what?

429
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,791
Like, I'll start by
fondling your tits and then--

430
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,333
No way!

431
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,166
Once I've got her in
"Full Burst Mode" I'll jump over

432
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,666
to the Type-Super
and start working on your ass.

433
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,125
Why my ass now?

434
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,291
Fondling boobs doesn't
give me enough variety.

435
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,416
Alright, that's
enough sex talk!

436
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
Now listen up!

437
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,833
I'm a strong
independent woman

438
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,958
who don't need
no man to save my man!

439
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,916
I can go into Full Burst
Mode using nothing

440
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,583
but my imagination.

441
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,083
[KYOKO, KOUICHI]
Your what now?

442
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,291
Just forget I said
anything, all right?

443
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,666
The point is, I won't
let anyone touch my body

444
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,000
other than my true love
and white knight, Shouma.

445
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,291
Well, she's weird.

446
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,208
We're trying to team-up,
but she keeps goin' on

447
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,083
about her lame ex-boyfriend.

448
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,958
Poor Kiriko.

449
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,958
[KYOKO] Sorry for all
the trouble, this year.

450
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,083
[CHIEKO] Yeah, speaking of,
I'm glad you came to me.

451
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,250
It seems that Shouma Ameku
hasn't attended class, lately.

452
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,750
Uh...

453
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,250
It's my ass in the fire if
even a single student flunks.

454
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,750
That's... That sounds bad.

455
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,625
[SHOUMA]
Heyo!

456
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,666
He's gone.

457
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,583
[CHIEKO]
Gone?

458
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,291
Yeah, he's gone
to the Pentagon.

459
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,041
In Washington DC, to train.

460
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,291
[CHIEKO]
The Pentagon?

461
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,750
So you Beauty
Salon Prince people

462
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,458
also have ties to the American
military establishment?

463
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,333
Yeah, we're that important!

464
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,375
[KYOKO laughs]

465
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,750
[KYOKO]
Forget having ties with America.

466
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,375
Lately, we're not
even on good terms

467
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,333
with the Japanese government!

468
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Thanks for talking to her.

469
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,875
I was worried
I'd missed too many days.

470
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,833
You know, with all
the head trauma.

471
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,916
[KYOKO chuckles]
Miss Chieko and I figured

472
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,041
everything out right
before you returned.

473
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,833
Your days missed due
to "the penguin war"

474
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,583
won't count against you.

475
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,708
Man, school is stupid.

476
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,458
Why's the city so dead?

477
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,416
That's weird. There should
be people outside.

478
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,708
[KYOKO gasps]
[tires screeching]

479
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,958
Hey, where'd you
learn to drive?

480
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,208
What the hell?

481
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,083
Where'd that thing come from?

482
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,833
[KYOKO]
Why is it out here?

483
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,583
Kyoko, turn on the radio,
maybe there's some news!

484
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,958
Right, yeah.

485
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,375
[RADIO ANNOUNCER] In response,
the national government

486
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,333
has announced an
emergency evacuation

487
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,166
of the Edogawa District.
Please follow all police dire--

488
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,750
[KIRIKO]
Emergency evacuation?

489
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,916
[KOUICHI]
The hell's happening?

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,166
[RADIO ANNOUNCER]
An armed terrorist group

491
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,625
known as the
Beauty Salon Prince

492
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,166
has barricaded
themselves in a building

493
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,958
in the central
Edogawa District.

494
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,166
In response,
the national government...

495
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,333
Why does that
name sound familiar?

496
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,958
That's our beauty salon!

497
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,208
I know, someone's
out to get us!

498
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,541
I want a report, now!

499
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,375
[MORIKO] All I can tell
you is that multiple

500
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,750
Type-3 Daimidaler's are
heading this way!

501
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,458
[SEWASHIKO] It's like a
whole army of Daimidalers!

502
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,791
[MATAYOSHI]
That's the mass production model

503
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,916
we gave the government.

504
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,333
[SORIKO]
They said they destroyed it.

505
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,416
Clearly, that was a lie.

506
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
[MORIKO] They've churned 'em
out on an assembly line.

507
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,541
Plus normal people
can pilot the Type-3

508
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,208
because it runs on plasma.

509
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,916
[SORIKO] That explains why
they kept the prototype

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,541
and lied about destroying it.

511
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,333
[MATAYOSHI]
What is their angle here?

512
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,750
Attention terrorist mastermind.

513
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,291
Matayoshi.

514
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,958
We have an ultimatum for you!

515
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,375
Terrorist, what?

516
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,750
Mastermind?

517
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,625
[COMMANDER] We have your
lady barber shop surrounded.

518
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,833
Lay down your
weapons and surrender!

519
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,083
What can we do?

520
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,458
How are we the bad guys?

521
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,125
[COMMANDER]
With the Penguin Empire's help,

522
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,041
we were able to
halt the epidemic

523
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,500
of perversion and porno
addiction in our young men!

524
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,375
But your continued
existence threatens

525
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,416
to make them all
re-harden and relapse

526
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,958
into masturbatory madness!

527
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,333
[ALL gasp]

528
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,666
Idiots!

529
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,958
Have you forgotten
everything the Penguin Empire

530
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,208
has done to us with
their warmongering ways?

531
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,250
I know their attacks

532
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,666
don't hurt us
as much as yours!

533
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,208
You should see what
we spend rebuilding

534
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,791
after Daimidaler battles!

535
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,916
Right now, the greatest
threat our country faces

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,541
is you, the Beauty
Salon Prince!

537
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,958
[MATAYOSHI]
What?

538
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,458
[SEWASHIKO groans]

539
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,500
I guess he does have a point
about the destruction thing.

540
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
[COMMANDER]
I take it you'd rather die

541
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,375
as martyrs than surrender?

542
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,750
What?

543
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,583
That makes my job easy, then.

544
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,166
How did it come to this?

545
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,291
Hold on!

546
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,791
We haven't even
responded yet!

547
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,583
[MATAYOSHI]
Forget it.

548
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,833
Admin?

549
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,416
[MATAYOSHI] They never
intended to let us live.

550
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,125
No matter how we
answered their demands,

551
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,416
the end result was always gonna
be them attacking the salon!

552
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,750
That blows.

553
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,583
[SOLDIERS]
Ready to attack!

554
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,416
[COMMANDER]
Ready, aim.

555
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,666
Fire!

556
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,416
[NARRATOR] Everyone sets
forth on their own path.

557
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,916
But no matter
where life takes you,

558
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,166
these days will
never be forgotten.

559
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,083
Front tails forever!

560
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:46,291
Next episode, "Showdown! Sound
Robots versus Daimidaler!"

561
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,166
Please look forward to it.
