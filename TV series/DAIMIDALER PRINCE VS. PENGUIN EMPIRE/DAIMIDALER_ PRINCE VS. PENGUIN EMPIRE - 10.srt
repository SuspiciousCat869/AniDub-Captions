1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,791
[SHOUMA]
That's all you've got?

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,750
[KIRIKO] A few pink
sparks aren't an upgrade!

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,250
It's like putting
streamers on your handlebars.

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,500
[RITZ chuckles]
It's so much more than that.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,291
The sparks you mock
are "Penguin Line"

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,916
and they appear
in the Penguin Field

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,666
when the penguin device
has reached full power!

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,541
That makes sense right?

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,500
Well, we won't bore you
with the details.

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,541
[RTIZ] All you need to
know is that this power

11
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,000
will transform
Antarctic Number 8!

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,333
This is evolt!

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,833
[BOTH]
What's evolt?

14
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,583
[RITZ] Now, prepare
to poo your panties 

15
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,958
as you gaze upon the strongest
robot in the world!

16
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,083
Ta-da!

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,583
It looks exactly the same.

18
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,458
Really? What happened?

19
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
This is most troubling.

20
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,708
[JIM]
Ritz's machine failed to evolt!

21
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,875
[MICHAEL]
Oh no! Why?

22
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,416
[NELSON]
What a colossal screw-up!

23
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,375
[DENNIS]
Hold on!

24
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,625
Guys! Ha! That's it!

25
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,833
[NELSON] What, Dennis?
Is it good? Bad? Tell us!

26
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,208
[JAKE]
Go on, say it!

27
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,666
[DENNIS]
Screw-up!

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,833
It's the perfect name for
an adult version of Twister!

29
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,500
[JIM] Oh my God, Dennis,
you're right!

30
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,916
[JIM]
We've gotta tell the world!

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,541
[DENNIS]
Screw-up!

32
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
This is serious, you nitwits!

33
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,166
At this rate, not only will
Operation New Penguin fail,

34
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,125
but we're poised to lose
our beloved Ritz as well.

35
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,166
The body sustained
too much damage.

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,166
And losing the head
was a major blow.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
In this condition,
she won't be able to

38
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,625
build up enough Penguin Line!

39
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,166
[KIRIKO laughs]

40
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,583
[RITZ]
What's so funny, trick?

41
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,958
[KIRIKO] Just enjoying
the ironic comeuppance

42
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:09,125
after all your big talk
about being so awesome.

43
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,666
It's hard to
believe she's the enemy

44
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,166
we've been so afraid of.

45
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,666
When the truth is she's
as soft as a teddy bear!

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,333
She can't do anything to us!

47
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,916
Right? She's harmless.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,083
Yeah she's so pathetic,
I almost feel bad for her.

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,666
[SHOUMA] Like a three-legged
puppy barking at a pitbull.

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,625
Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,083
[RITZ]
We won't lose!

52
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,833
We love the Penguin Empire!
And we love all penguins!

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,333
[RITZ]
Ever since that very first day

54
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,708
when we appeared out of nowhere,

55
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,166
they've welcomed us
with open arms!

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,416
They're our family now,

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
and we wanna stay
with them forever!

58
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,083
We'll push forward with
Operation New Penguin.

59
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,083
It's the least we can do!

60
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,916
We're gonna make a penguin
world for our family!

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,750
[RITZ screams]

62
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,166
[KIRIKO] Quit playing penguin
and act like a person.

63
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,375
[PENGUINS]
Ritz!

64
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,875
[JIM]
Your Highness, look!

65
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,833
[DENNIS] We have to take
care of our family!

66
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,875
[JIM] We must
do something!

67
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I know.

68
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,333
Switch the Penguin
Device to standby.

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,750
Come, Joseph!

70
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,958
[JOSEPH]
Yes, sir!

71
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
The glorious commando, Joseph.

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,416
It is time to show the world
the power of your front tail!

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,375
[JOSEPH]
Yes, sir!

74
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,000
[JIM]
Go save her, Joseph!

75
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,750
[DENNIS] We're trusting
you with our Ritz!

76
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,125
[JOSEPH]
Don't worry!

77
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,833
If anyone can
do it, it's me!

78
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,041
[JIM]
"Do it"?

79
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,208
[JAKE]
As in, "doing it"?

80
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,625
[NELSON]
And doin' it well!

81
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,541
[PENGUINS] Doing it!
Doing it! Doing it!

82
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Stop that!

83
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,333
Penguin Device,
physical transfer initiated!

84
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,958
Target: Antarctic Number 8,
Ritz Custom's cockpit!

85
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,083
Transfer!

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,625
Whoa! Is that Joseph?

87
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,708
[JOSEPH] The one and only,
at your service!

88
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,416
[RITZ] Boy, are
we glad to see you!

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
[JOSEPH]
I see.

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,916
This is quite a predicament.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,416
But don't fret.

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,583
I'll push this machine
into evolt in no time.

93
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,375
Yeah? But how can you?

94
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,750
[JOSEPH]
It's simple, really.

95
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,708
All I have to do is use
my front tail as an antenna.

96
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,583
[RITZ]
It can do that? Good to know.

97
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,708
[JOSEPH] You know
the power of my front tail!

98
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,166
They don't call me the glorious
penguin commando for nothing!

99
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,041
[RITZ]
But...

100
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Oh, dear God!

101
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,875
[JIM]
It's gone flaccid!

102
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,041
[JAKE]
Unfathomable!

103
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,291
The gloriously
potent penguin commando's

104
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,708
ever-turgid tail
can't possibly be limp!

105
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,916
[NELSON]
What profound tragedy.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,625
For the penguin device to rob
him of such a sacred treasure.

107
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,125
[JIM] So the thing he lost
in the transfer was...

108
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,875
[DENNIS]
His robust front tail power!

109
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,083
[JAKE]
Oh, the penguin-ity!

110
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,375
[NELSON]
Everyone panic!

111
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,041
[JOSEPH]
Don't give up hope yet.

112
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,541
[PENGUINS]
Joseph?

113
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,750
[JOSEPH] There are plenty of
ways for a floppy front tail

114
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,875
to regain its
rock-hard vigor.

115
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,625
And if you don't believe me,
check your spam folder!

116
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,708
Ritz!

117
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,041
Yeah, what? We're kinda
busy right now.

118
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,875
[RITZ yells]

119
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,333
[RTIZ]
What's gotten into you?

120
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,458
[JOSEPH] To recharge my battery,
I'll need a jumpstart.

121
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,791
Now, when you say,
"jumpstart."

122
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,125
[JOSEPH]
Oh, yes!

123
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,500
These are just the pick-me-ups
I was looking for!

124
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,583
[RITZ yelling]

125
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,708
[JOSEPH]
I need more! More!

126
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,708
[RITZ moans]

127
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,583
[JOSEPH]
Shine more brightly!

128
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,375
[JOSEPH]
Charge complete.

129
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,041
[RITZ groans]

130
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,583
[JOSEPH]
Thank you, Ritz.

131
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,875
You gave my tail this
raging resurrection.

132
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,333
Now, penguin line!

133
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,833
Gather! Gather
to my front tail!

134
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,583
Is this another
one of their bluffs?

135
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,875
Don't know.

136
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,541
[SHOUMA]This feels
different from before.

137
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,458
[JOSEPH]
Penguin transform!

138
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,916
[RITZ]
Super Antarctic Humboldt Kai!

139
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,333
We did it!

140
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,250
Welcome back.

141
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,041
Nicely done, Joseph.

142
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,958
Super Antarctic?

143
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,625
[SHOUMA]
Now that is an upgrade.

144
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,791
[KIRIKO] Let's see how
powerful... it really is!

145
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,375
[KIRIKO yells]

146
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,250
[KIRIKO]
Hey, wait!

147
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:27,166
[KIRIKO and RITZ grunting]

148
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,583
[MATAYOSHI]
Such speed! Such intensity!

149
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,333
[SHOUMA and KIRIKO grunting]

150
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,166
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA gasp]

151
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,625
Checkmate, bitches!

152
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,791
[RITZ]
Kiriko's ours now!

153
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,708
Oh no.

154
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,250
Aw, my hero!

155
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,333
Hmm.

156
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,291
[RITZ]
Outta the way, Romeo!

157
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,541
[SHOUMA]
No! I won't let you have Kiriko!

158
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,625
I'll protect her
no matter what it takes!

159
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,166
I'm a lucky girl!

160
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,166
[KIRIKO gasps]

161
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,791
[SHOUMA]
What's... happening to me?

162
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,958
I feel kind of funny.

163
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,250
What? Shouma?

164
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,583
What's... going on?

165
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,416
[SHOUMA yells]

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,583
[MORIKO]
That light, it's...

167
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,458
...a Hi-ERO particle reaction.

168
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,583
[SORIKO] From a human
who's not a Factor?

169
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,083
How is that even possible?

170
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,625
Please, Shouma!

171
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,625
If you can hear me,
say something!

172
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,000
Anything at all!

173
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,291
[SHOUMA]
Of course I can hear you.

174
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,500
[KIRIKO gasps]

175
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,916
I've got ears, don't I?

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,416
[KIRIKO]
Nooo!

177
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,750
What the hell?

178
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,916
How could a normal person
emit Hi-ERO particles?

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,833
And why would he
turn into a penguin?

180
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,208
Hubba-hubba!

181
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,208
Okay, Joseph is it
just us or is he--

182
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,750
[JOSEPH] That skin, that form,
that refined dignity.

183
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,750
There's no question
he's a penguin commando.

184
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,625
[RITZ]
Oh, hello there, stud muffin!

185
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,750
[SHOUMA]
Who, you mean me?

186
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,000
[RITZ]
Oh, yeah!

187
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,291
Listen, you should
come with us now.

188
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,541
You'll have a bunch
of friends just like you

189
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,208
and we have some
great bath-time parties!

190
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,083
[SHOUMA] Really?
Sounds great! Count me in!

191
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,666
[KIRIKO]
No, wait!

192
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,291
You can't go with them,
they're the bad guys!

193
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,500
[RITZ] You bitch!
How dare you try to stop him!

194
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,708
[KIRIKO]
Excuse you,

195
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,458
I'm having a domestic
dispute with my man.

196
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,833
[RITZ]
Uh, check yourself, homegirl.

197
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,250
'Cause he is all penguin now!

198
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,250
Shut up! I can change him!

199
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,666
I mean isn't that what having
a boyfriend is all about?

200
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,041
[KIRIKO]
No matter what he looks like,

201
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,541
I know the Shouma
I love is still deep inside.

202
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,750
[KIRIKO gasps and yells]

203
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
[KIRIKO]
Keep that tail to yourself!

204
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,791
[SHOUMA groans]

205
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,083
[RITZ]
Yoo-hoo!

206
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,916
How 'bout you leave
that uptight prude behind

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,750
and come have some real fun
with us in the Penguin Empire?

208
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,166
[SHOUMA]
Awesome!

209
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,583
[KIRIKO]
No! Don't go!

210
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,333
I was just kidding before.

211
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,541
You can do whatever perverted
thing you want to me!

212
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,666
[SHOUMA]
For real?

213
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,833
Yeah, right!

214
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,083
She's lying to you bud!

215
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,458
[KIRIKO]
Am not!

216
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,791
Then what kinda stuff
are you down for?

217
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,125
[KIRIKO gasps]

218
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:43,250
Well that's kinda personal,
but I guess maybe...

219
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,750
Huh? Speak up!
We can't hear you!

220
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,791
Yeah.

221
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,583
I'm not talking
about this with you!

222
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,625
Shouma my breasts
are bigger than hers.

223
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,916
Remember, you measured? Right?

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,208
[SHOUMA]
Boobies!

225
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,000
[RITZ] Those measurements
were never verified.

226
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,625
Besides, we're still growing!

227
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,000
So our gazongas
are only

228
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,500
gonna keep getting
bigger and bigger!

229
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,250
[JOSEPH] Ritz's C-cups
will be D-cups in no time!

230
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,041
[SHOUMA]
Delicious!

231
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:07,791
[RITZ]
Come on!

232
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,375
[SHOUMA]
Be right there!

233
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,625
No, don't go!

234
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,083
You have to stay
with me, Shouma!

235
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,666
Stay right here!

236
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
Don't leave me!

237
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,000
You can't go!

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,375
[beeping]

239
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,500
What do you think
you're doing, you hussy?

240
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,500
Go ahead and emit all
the Hi-ERO particles you want.

241
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,875
[RITZ] It won't turn
him back into a human.

242
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,791
Yes, it will.

243
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,541
[KIRIKO]
Because Shouma is special.

244
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,125
We're connected by all
of the Hi-ERO particles

245
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,833
that he's absorbed from me.

246
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,208
I know this is going to work.

247
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,208
Please return to your
normal, beautiful self.

248
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,833
You know you want to.

249
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,458
Come back to me Shouma!

250
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,083
Her Hi-ERO particles!

251
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,708
[JOSEPH]
Shouma's absorbing them.

252
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,166
[RITZ]
No way!

253
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,791
[SHOUMA]
Thanks for that.

254
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,875
I feel like a new man.

255
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,500
[KIRIKO]
Welcome back.

256
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,666
I missed you.

257
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,875
[SHOUMA]
Look at me.

258
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,208
I'm engorged with virility!

259
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,666
[KIRIKO whimpers]

260
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,125
How come?

261
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,416
What happened?

262
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
Why are you...?

263
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,208
[SHOUMA]
So plump with vitality?

264
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,708
'Cause you had your boobies
smooshed up against me!

265
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,291
That's not what I meant!

266
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,625
[RITZ laughs]

267
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
Sorry, but you lost
this one, Kiriko.

268
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,666
Just accept it, okay?

269
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,583
He's a straight-up
penguin for life!

270
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,916
You're wrong!
There's gotta be some way

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,375
I can change him
back to normal.

272
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,875
Stay here and we'll
figure it out together.

273
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,375
[SHOUMA]
Nah, I'm good. Lates!

274
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,208
Wait--

275
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,625
[SHOUMA]
Yo!

276
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,625
You really don't mind
if I join your crew?

277
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,625
[RITZ]
Not at all!

278
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,541
So, our name is
Rikantz Seaberry.

279
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,875
And I'm Joseph.

280
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,958
Also known as the Glorious
Penguin Commando Joseph.

281
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,041
[SHOUMA]
I'm Shouma. Nice to meet ya!

282
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,333
[JOSEPH, RITZ]
Yeah, likewise!

283
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,250
[KIRIKO]
Give him back!

284
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,416
Okay.

285
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,250
Give me back my Shouma.

286
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,208
[KIRIKO cries]

287
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,791
[RITZ] Women who cry at work
make us all look bad!

288
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,833
We will kick your ass,
of course, but first.

289
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,458
How 'bout a change of venue?

290
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,416
It's the responsible
thing to do!

291
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,500
[MATAYOSHI]
It's all over now!

292
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,416
Kiyuna's doomed.

293
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,125
[RITZ]
You guys should get off here.

294
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,541
[JOSEPH]
Give it your best, Ritz.

295
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,166
[SHOUMA] But don't
push yourself too hard!

296
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,875
[RITZ]
Giving up already?

297
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,416
That's too bad.

298
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,125
We really wanted to see what
the Super Antarctic could do.

299
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,041
Oh well. We'll just have to
take you back with us.

300
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,666
Oh, sweet Shouma.

301
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,625
[RITZ]
To the Penguin Empire!

302
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,041
My poor Shouma!

303
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,416
[KIRIKO yells]

304
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,750
What was that?

305
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,750
[MORIKO] A full burst
of Hi-ERO particles.

306
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,875
No, even more than that!

307
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,833
But how can she produce
that much despite being alone?

308
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,500
Because she's alone!

309
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,250
Disguise mode!

310
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,666
[MATAYOSHI]
Kiyuna was only able to utilize

311
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,291
her Hi-ERO particles freely
after she first met her love.

312
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,208
Now that he's been taken away
from her by the Penguin Empire,

313
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,333
she's completely
giving in to her emotions,

314
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,791
causing her
machine to go berserk!

315
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,291
[MORIKO]
Type-6, Kiriko, Disguise.

316
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,125
Hi-ERO particles increasing!

317
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,625
Levels too high for chakra
gauges to measure!

318
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,958
[JOSEPH]
Oh my!

319
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,916
That's Daimidaler's
something-slash!

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,333
[SHOUMA]
If she uses that,

321
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,333
this city'll be
in big trouble!

322
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,708
Continuing down this path
will put Kiriko's life at risk.

323
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,750
--We have to stop her now.
--[MATAYOSHI] It's no use!

324
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,083
[ALL gasp]

325
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,875
[MATAYOSHI] No matter what
we say, she won't stop.

326
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,750
This is the last stand of
a girl who's lost everything.

327
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,500
She's hell-bent
on destroying them,

328
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,041
even if it means
destroying herself.

329
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,458
That light is her passion.

330
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,000
So be it, Kiyuna!

331
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,500
Feel the rage!

332
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,416
Shine brighter!

333
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,208
And burn those goddamn penguins

334
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,958
to the ground with
your furious light!

335
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,833
[MATAYOSHI laughs]

336
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,041
[KIRIKO]
Oh, Shouma.

337
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,583
Just hold on a little while.

338
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,083
Because I promise
I will bring you back!

339
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,625
[RITZ] 
She's up to something.

340
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,583
We'll crush her
while we still can.

341
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,416
[SHOUMA]
Don't do it, Ritz!

342
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,125
You can't attack Daimidaler.

343
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
[RITZ]
What? Why not, Shouma?

344
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,583
[SHOUMA] Trust me. I spent
some time in that thing.

345
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,291
If you go in there now,
all sloppy-like,

346
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,000
it'll blow up
into smithereens!

347
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,375
Oh my geez!

348
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,333
[RITZ] Joseph and Shouma,
let's get outta here.

349
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,416
That bitch is just too
damn volatile right now!

350
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,875
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ritz.

351
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,750
Using the penguin computer,

352
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,958
we've simulated
Daimidaler's attack.

353
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,666
According to our calculations.

354
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,541
Egads!

355
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,458
Tell me.

356
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,833
How long before
she attacks us?

357
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ten seconds.

358
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,250
Ten seconds?

359
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Or five minutes. Y'know.

360
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,625
That's quite a window.

361
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,916
Hey, wait! The Penguin Device!

362
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,458
You can use
that thing to retrieve

363
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,750
Joseph and Shouma can't you?

364
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It's recovering from

365
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,125
its last transfer. It can't
just go again right away.

366
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,000
[RITZ]
This sucks!

367
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,333
The penguin device is down

368
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,833
and we don't have enough
time to rescue the guys!

369
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
[RITZ]
Joseph. Shouma. Run far away!

370
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,541
Somewhere safe!

371
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,791
Or, if you don't mind
getting a little dirty,

372
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,083
plunge into a manhole!

373
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,541
[JOSEPH]
A manhole?

374
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,875
[SHOUMA]
Any particular man's hole?

375
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,708
[JOSEPH]
Or just the first guy we see?

376
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,583
We don't have time
for double entendres!

377
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,125
[JOSEPH]
Don't worry about us, Ritz.

378
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,916
You just escape on your own.

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,291
[RITZ gasps]

380
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
What? That's crazy
talk. There's no way

381
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,666
we would ever leave
you two behind to fend for--

382
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,125
[JOSEPH]
No, Ritz!

383
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,750
Operation New Penguin
has only just begun.

384
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,000
The Penguin Empire is
counting on you to persevere!

385
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,166
Your heart has to be hardened,
like a penguin's front tail!

386
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,000
Now go!

387
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,000
[RITZ]
But Joseph--

388
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,541
[SHOUMA]
Really, it's okay.

389
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,375
So our luck runs out in this
convenience store. No big deal.

390
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,958
[RITZ] Shouma--
[SHOUMA] We'll be fine.

391
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,916
[SHOUMA] There's plenty of nudie
mags and sugary snacks here,

392
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,750
so at least our lives will come
to an end with a sweet climax.

393
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,625
[JOSEPH] We'll party like
our front tails: Hard.

394
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,833
[RITZ]
No!

395
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,750
We can't bear to see
the two of you die!

396
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,916
[RITZ]
We won't let you die!

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,333
[MATAYOSHI] However strong
that Super Antarctic may be.

398
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,250
It doesn't stand
a chance of being able

399
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,583
to stop a fully
powered CP Slash!

400
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,375
Ah, fantastic! This is perfect!

401
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,666
So what if a city or two has
to be demolished in the process!

402
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,291
That's a small price to pay for
getting rid of Rikantz Seaberry!

403
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,958
[MATAYOSHI]
You go, Kiyuna!

404
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,166
You're no longer just a lovesick
teenybopper or a Factor!

405
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,708
You're a ticking
Hi-ERO time bomb

406
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,791
full of anger and resentment!

407
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,666
Blow those blasted
penguins away

408
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,916
so nothing's left of them!

409
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,375
Do this and your
name will be etched

410
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,541
in the Beauty Salon
Prince hall of fame!

411
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,291
And you'll be
remembered as a hero!

412
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,375
[MATAYOSHI laughs maniacally]

413
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,708
[JIM]
Make it stop! Make it stop!

414
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,291
[DENNIS]
Joseph! Shouma!

415
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,958
[NELSON]
Ritz!

416
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,125
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ritz.

417
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Your Highness?

418
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Use it.

419
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,166
The Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust!

420
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,125
Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust?

421
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,708
But that means
hand-to-hand combat!

422
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,625
We don't know if
we can pull that off

423
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,125
with a robot we're piloting
for the first time.

424
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,000
If we fail, then--

425
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What's wrong, Ritz?

426
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,791
[RITZ]
It's just a lot of pressure.

427
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,666
[JIM] You have nothing
to worry about.

428
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,333
[DENNIS]
You're a fierce young woman.

429
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,083
You can do anything
you set your mind to!

430
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,500
Thanks, you guys. Needed that.

431
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,666
[SHOUMA] Now go on and flip
the script on that trick.

432
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,583
[JOSEPH]
Yes, show her who's boss.

433
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,541
[RITZ]
Aww, we sure will!

434
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,958

Just do your best!

[RITZ sniffles]
You guys.

438
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Give yourself
completely to the penguin.

439
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:24,833
Believe in your inner penguin
and release it upon the world!

440
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,291
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The penguin
reflects your feelings.

441
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,041
As you wish, Your Highness.

[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Now Penguin
Thrust your way into the future!

443
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,250
Okay!

444
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,250
[RITZ] We have nothing
to be afraid of.

445
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,208
The Penguin Empire's
behind us all the way.

446
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,041
They believe in us 169%!

447
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,916
And so!

448
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,666
We'll use every
last bit of power

449
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,958
in Super Antarctic Humboldt Kai!

450
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,166
And we'll bust out.

451
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,791
This last, strongest, and most
difficult special attack!

452

Here we go.

Type-6 has shut down.

[MATAYOSHI]
No way!

469
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,166
This enemy can't be smacked down
with a piece of scrap metal!

470
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,541
Do it!

471
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,416
There's a strong Hi-ERO
particle response

472
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,041
from the left arm of Type-2!

Fine. Let's give it a shot!

We don't have time to
set up a route for you.

475
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,500
We'll just eject you
straight from the equipment bay!

476
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,583
Phew, we did it.

477
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,041
Somehow, we pulled it off.

478
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,291
The Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust.

479
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,375
That was one hell
of a powerful attack.

480
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Good job, Ritz.

481
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,291
[SHOUMA] You were able to save
us and the entire city!

482
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,625
You're a hero!

483
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,083
Glad you're okay!

484
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,000
[JIM]
You were incredible out there!

485
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,125
You guys!

486
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,875
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It was superb, Ritz.

487
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,083
You harnessed the power

488
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,625
of the Penguin
Empire's trust in you.

489
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,833
That is the essence
of Penguin-hood,

490
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,375
and what truly fuels
the Fiery Blast Penguin Thrust.

491
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,208
Penguin power.

492
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,458
Thank you, Your Highness.

493
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,125
[RITZ]
Thank you, everyone.

494
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,583
And thank you,
Super Antarctic Humboldt Kai.

495
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,708
We are indebted to you.

496
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,791
Huh...

497
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,750
That's kind of a mouthful.

498
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,666
We'll just call you "Kai."

499
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,958
Now then...

500
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,541
[RITZ] You still alive
in there, Kiriko?

501
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,291
Huh?

502
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,250
[RITZ]
What the eff?

503
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,875
[RITZ]
Jeez, him again?

504
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,416
[KOUICHI]
Oh, yeah!

505
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Kouichi's back in the heezy!

506
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,875
And he's better than ever!

507
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,166
[NARRATOR] Those
voluptuous mounds are truly

508
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,875
the stuff dreams are made of.

509
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,250
The hope for tomorrow.

510
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,625
God, grant courage to EROS.

511
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:46,291
Next episode: "Distraction! The
Emperor's Sexual Harassment."

512
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,166
Please look forward to it.
