1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Blast! Foiled again!

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,791
And by that infernal Daimidaler!

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,125
To think that I would
face defeat at the hands

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,458
of a robot designed by humans!

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,291
[NELSON]
Uh, Nelson here, sir.

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,708
I would love the opportunity
to fight that malicious mech!

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,500
[JIM] No, I shall
accept the challenge!

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,041
[DENNIS]
Dennis here! I want a rematch!

9
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,375
[PENGUINS]
Huh?

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,500
Penguins!

11
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,958
And you're even cuter in person!

12
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,958
[SORIKO] Yoga, derived from
the Sanskrit root word, "Yuji,"

13
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,583
comes to us from ancient India,

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,375
by way of
Santa Monica, California.

15
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,583
We use it to reach a new level
of personal enlightenment...

16
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,916
[KOUICHI] Well your poses
are certainly helping me

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,791
reach a new level of arousal.

18
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,083
[KYOKO]
Kouichi!

19
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,416
Aren't you supposed
to be training right now?

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
[KOUICHI] Hey, don't be
so quick to judge, Kyoko.

21
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,708
It may not look like it,
but even as we speak

22
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,958
I'm deep into training.

23
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,375
What?

24
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,125
In order to reach a rock hard
state of super arousal.

25
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,666
I've been peeping on you and the
three professors every hour,

26
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,916
even while you sleep at night!

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,125
Stalking is illegal!

28
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,416
No it's natural!

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,416
When you become
a cool Factor like me,

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,625
this is your fate.

31
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,458
You know, you could
be my personal trainer,

32
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,250
--emphasis on the "personal."
--[KYOKO] Stop it!

33
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,000
I think she's really
warming up to him.

34
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
How in the h-e-c-k

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,541
did you get in here, young lady!

36
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,416
[RITZ] Cute little penguin.
So squeezable.

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,250
[NELSON] There's a
human girl in our base!

38
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,000
Wow. So many
penguins to snuggle!

39
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,666
[DENNIS screams]

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,375
Ah! Your skin feels so smooth
and properly moisturized.

41
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,291
[MICHAEL] Somebody stop her!
Dennis is being violated!

42
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,000
[NELSON] Grab her before
she gives him PTSD!

43
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,208
[RITZ]
Whoa!

44
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,833
[screams] Your flippers
touched our boobies!

45
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,541
[RITZ]
No!

46
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,041
Not funny!

47
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,583
[MICHAEL]
Your highness!

48
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,291
We've completed our analysis
of this girl's specifications!

49
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Tell me everything!

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,000
[NELSON]
Her bust is 32 inches!

51
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I don't care about that!

52
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,791
[DENNIS]
Her waist is 25 inches!

53
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Enough with the measurements!

54
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,416
[MICHAEL]
Her nipples are pink.

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Oh, that's good to know.

56
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,708
Oh, wow. You guys are pervy.

57
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,750
We take it you're
the big bird here?

58
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,166
Question for you then.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,166
May we please
merge with you?

60
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,166
[NELSON]
Merge with us?

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,666
[DENNIS]
Like, procreate?

62
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] So this is
what daddy issues look like.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,083
Icky, that's not what we mean.

64
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,916
We would like to become
the newest recruit

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,291
in your great penguin army!

66
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,875
We think you penguins
are so completely adorable.

67
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,166
Please let us join you,
your majesty!

68
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,625
We'll even sit on
your eggs for ya!

69
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Well, I guess
having a human under me

70
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,583
isn't the worst idea.

71
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,125
Oh you mean it?

72
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
With one condition!

73
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,125
Huh?

74
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You must prove your worth to me

75
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,375
by passing the penguin exam.
Pink nipples be damned.

76
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,791
[PENGUINS gasp]

77
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,708
[RITZ]
Penguin Exam?

78
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Oh, the
bar to pass is quite low.

79
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,541
Almost a formality, in fact.

80
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,375
Simply fight and
destroy an elite,

81
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,625
hand-to-hand combatant
of my choosing.

82
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,250
[JAKE]
I will fight this depraved girl!

83
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,416
I am the brave
penguin commando, Jake!

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,875
[NELSON]
You?

85
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,291
[MICHAEL] Jake, what would
possess you to fight today,

86
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,458
of all days?

87
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,666
[DENNIS]
People could be hurt!

88
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Front tails could be lost!

89
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,458
Okay, that's enough.
We're in it to win it now.

90
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,458
[DENNIS] You silly girl!
You haven't a clue

91
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,625
about the brave health
struggle Jake's fighting!

92
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,208
This man. This brave,
beautiful man

93
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,916
currently has a fever, of 101.2!

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,875
[JAKE sighs]

95
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,125
[PENGUINS]
Stay with us, Jake!

96
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,750
That's amazing.

97
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,375
They're brave even
when they're sick!

98
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,375
We love penguins more than ever!

99
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Well, if he's
sick, then just dog pile her.

100
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,791
I don't care.

101
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,041
[PENGUINS]
Sir, yes, sir!

102
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,125
[NELSON] Your merging
shall be most painful!

103
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,916
[PENGUINS screaming]

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Gasp!

105
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,041
She defeated an elite
penguin commando squad

106
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,125
with a single kick!

107
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,541
[RITZ giggles]
Despite our petite size,

108
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,541
we've still picked up
some Krav Maga.

109
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Gasp again!

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
You have splendid
fighting ability.

111
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,458
We won.

112
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,166
Here, we'll show you
some more moves now,

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,666
so you know what you're getting!

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,125
[RITZ]
Brace yourself, Your Highness!

115
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR whimpers]

116
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,750
[RITZ]
These are our fighting skills!

117
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,583
What do you think,
Your Highness?

118
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,541
Did we pass your
little Penguin Exam?

119
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,666
Huh, did we, huh?

120
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Don't be ridiculous!

121
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
Knocking out the Penguin Emperor

122
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,375
is the highest form of treason
in the Penguin Empire!

123
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,625
Huh?

124
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You have failed the Exam.

125
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,625
I bid you good day, sir!

126
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:48,666
[RITZ sobbing]
He's so mean.

127
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,000
We only did what
he told us to do!

128
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,541
We just wanted to show him

129
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,291
our usefulness and
sweet Krav Maga skills.

130
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,958
[JIM]
Stiff upper lip, child.

131
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,708
Throwing around a reigning
monarch is quite the faux pas.

132
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,791
But believe it or not, he's
still taken a liking to you.

133
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,541
[RITZ]
R-Really?

134
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,083
[JIM] Many years have passed
since a human liked our kind

135
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,208
beyond what they saw
of us in cartoons.

136
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,333
Your passion has
moved us, deeply.

137
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,916
That said.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,875
I know a service you can provide
that'd make you really popular.

139
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,083
[RITZ]
What kind of service?

140
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Maybe I was too rough.

141
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,125
Let my temper get
the best of me.

142
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:33,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR groans]
Zounds! What's happening here?

143
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It's blinding!

144
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,166
Rays of light more
brilliant than those

145
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,958
of any sun in the firmament!

146
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,958
[RITZ] Your Highness,
we're sorry for throwing you.

147
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,375
Please, sir.

148
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,958
We beg you to let us join
the great Penguin Empire.

149
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,583
[JIM] This girl got down
on her knees and polished

150
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,833
each one of our front-tails.

151
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I can't refuse a girl

152
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,375
who's good with her hands.
You have proven your worth.

153
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,916
Henceforth, this handsy girl
is part of the Penguin Empire!

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,083
No! Penguin family!

155
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,916
[RITZ gasps]

156
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,708
Oh, your Highness,
we will serve only you!

157
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Okay there. Huh.

158
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,458
Come to think of it,
I don't know your name.

159
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,916
We're so glad you asked!
Our name's Rikantz Seaberry!

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Rikantz?

161
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,250
That's strange and
foreign-sounding.

162
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,875
You'll need something cuter.

163
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,083
Ritz!

164
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,875
[RITZ]
Ritz it is!

165
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,708
[MORIKO]
A penguin robot has appeared!

00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,041
[MATAYOSHI] Ready Daimidaler
for battle, at once!

167
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,416
I guess they want
another good ass-kickin'.

168
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
These guys need to learn,
with your boobies here,

169
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,833
there's no way they can
beat me off my winning streak!

170
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,208
You're sure cocky for a guy
who skimps his training.

171
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,750
[KOUICHI]
Everything will be fine, Kyoko.

172
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,708
Now let me work my magic.

173
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,916

[SORIKO] Connect to Thruster
[KYOKO] Not yet.

[SORIKO]
Route 15, Shumokozori.

176
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,291
Right. Shumokuzori, roger.

177
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,666
I got it all figured out,
and I'm never losin' again!

178
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,083
[KYOKO] As a girl,
I like his bad boy way,

179
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,833
but as his partner,
I don't know.

180
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,333
I'll have to focus
for both of us.

181
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,958
[MAN 3A]
A huge robot! How original!

182
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,125
[MAN 3B] Where are they
getting all this sheet metal?

183
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,333
[WOMAN 3A] Crap. This means
Daimidaler's on the way!

184
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,666
[RITZ giggles]

185
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,208
[RITZ] It's fun to watch
them panic, but,

186
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,708
we don't want them to leave yet.

187
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,208
The real fun is about
to get started.

188
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,166
[RITZ] First, we need
to take out that big,

189
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,750
thickly ribbed hose,

190
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,000
and insert it firmly into the
hole on the front of the body.

191
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,166
[MAN 3C] It just went
from six to midnight!

192
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,458
[RITZ] Now, fish around with
your finger and pull that plug

193
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,666
out of the rear hole,
but be careful

194
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,333
and don't do it too forcefully.

195
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,500
Parts can tear
easily back there.

196
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,750
When it's time to finish,
give it a tug.

197
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,041
Slide it in to release gently!

198
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,083
[MAN 3D] Too young!
She's still too young!

199
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,625
[WOMAN 3B]
I'll have what she's having.

200
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,750
For more hose suction,
try pulling the hose out

201
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,041
of the hole. Then flip over
and firmly re-insert the hose,

202
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,791
using the opposite end!

203
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
For best performance,
remember to always adjust

204
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
the unit to the thickness
of your carpet.

205
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,750
Especially if it's an
extra-long, exotic rug!

206
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,625
[RITZ] You may need to push and
pull the unit harder at first,

207
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,541
pushing and pulling back
and forth several times

208
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,916
until you reach
that perfect glide!

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,708

This feels weird in public!

Are these vacuum instructions?

211
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,750
[RITZ]
So what do you think?

00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,583
We call this,
"Operation Penguin Vulgarity!"

213

Stupid humans. So easy
to embarrass them.

own size, giant penguins!

[RITZ]
Oh, wow. So this is him, huh?

217
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,166
Smaller than we thought he'd be.

218
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,541
[KOUICHI]
Wait, they've got a human!

219
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,458

they're taking hostages?

[MICHAEL]
How dare you insinuate that!

224
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,583
We penguin commandos would
never do something so cowardly!

Hey, jerk-butt!

"cute, wittle" penguins,
it's our duty to kill you.

If you fight angry you'll
play right into her game!

We hope you're ready.

00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,458
Because we've got
our own special attack

while motion sickness

00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,500
had that Ritz girl
barfing up her breakfast,

291
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,125
we were able to
retrieve Daimidaler.

292
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,708
[SORIKO] And the Penguin
robot pulled out, too.

293
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,708
So today was effectively a draw.

294

[KOUICHI] That sounds like
loser talk ya ask me!

No matter how you
spin it, I lost today.

[MATAYOSHI] If you don't
wanna feel like this,

297
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,041
you should train harder!

00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,500
[KOUICHI]
More training?

299
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,625
[MATAYOSHI] You can't just
jump into battle half-cocked

300
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,208
and expect it to go,
"wham, bam, moneyshot."

301
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,583
You need to soften your target
first with some foreplay.

302
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,750
You've gotta fight
smarter in the cockpit!

303
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,791
A decent pilot wouldn't
go through every battle

304
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,791
dependent on Kyoko's
hypnotic chest torpedoes!

305
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,625
[KOUICHI]
Yes, sir!

306
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,041
[SORIKO] I was expecting
something like this to happen,

307
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,750
so I'd already
prepared a special

308
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,333
training program for Kouichi.

309
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,208
[KOUICHI]
I need to get stronger.

00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,000
So I can beat the hell out of
that stupid, annoying girl!

311
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,750
I mean it! Imma
train crazy hard!

312
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,166
[KYOKO]
Kouichi...

313
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,583
[KOUICHI]
Sorry, Kyoko.

314
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,500
Please don't let another
man touch your gazongas

315
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,333
until I return, having
mastered Daimidaler.

316
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,708
See you on the flip-side.

317
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,541
Let's go, Master!

318
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
[KYOKO]
If he's committing to training,

319
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,250
then I'll commit to
him and be patient.

320
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,750
Good luck, Kouichi!

321
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:55,041
I'll think of you every time
I see a pervert on the bus.

322
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,083
[PENGUINS]
A toast to Ritz!

323
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,375
[MICHAEL]
Congratulations!

324
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,500
[RITZ] Thank you!
[DENNIS] Morning Sick-Ritz!

325
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,583
[RITZ]
You guys, you're so adorable!

326
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,583
We love having penguins
all around us, all the time!

327
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,541
We're in a penguin dream world!

328
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I love these faceless smiles.

329
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,375
[RITZ]
Greetings, Your Highness!

330
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,166
[DENNIS] And now,
we shall begin our Salute

331
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,625
to Ritz Slideshow Spectacular!

332
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,208
[PENGUINS]
Morning Sick-Ritz!

333
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Ritz,
getting the better of Daimidaler

334
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,166
on your very first encounter
was as impressive

335
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,583
as your toned buttocks.

336
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,000
[RITZ giggles]

337
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,791
We're a natural at driving
around giant robots.

338
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
[PENGUINS]
Morning Sick-Ritz!

339
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I look forward to seeing you

340
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,958
fulfill your potential.

341
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,375
[RITZ]
Roger that!

342
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR laughs]
I'm quite the lucky Emperor

343
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:40,250
to be surrounded by such
talented and loyal subordinates.

344
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I do solemnly swear.

345
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,208
I shall obtain
the Hi-ERO particles

346
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,625
needed to complete this
penguin super weapon

347
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
and take over the Earth.

348
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,708
In a very penguin fashion.

349
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,458
[SORIKO]
Nice strike!

350
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,250
[SEWASHIKO]
Nice stroke!

351
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
[SORIKO]
Enough with the sex puns!

352
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,291
[KYOKO]
It's been ten days.

353
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,166
I hope Kouichi's
holding up okay.

354
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,875
Finish your training.

355
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,541
And come back to me!

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,416
[KYOKO gasps]

357
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,083
[KYOKO]
Kouchi, you're back!

358
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,583
Administrator, is he done?

359
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,833
[MATAYOSHI] Yes, it was
a hard, rough program.

360
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,750
But he wasn't above
getting down on all fours

361
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,583
and taking it like a man.

362
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,625
This guys's now a fully insured
and licensed Daimidaler pilot.

363
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,541
You did it, Kouchi.
I'm so proud of you!

364
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,583
Don't touch me!

365
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,333
[KYOKO gasps]

366
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,500
[KYOKO]
You don't like touching now?

367
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,833
[KOUICHI]
Sorry.

368
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
Oh, it's weird because we
haven't seen each other

369
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,208
in a while, right?

370
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,208
[KOUICHI]
Stop it!

371
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,791
[KYOKO gasps]

372
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,250
[KOUICHI grunts]

373
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,333
[alarm blaring]

374
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,916
[MATAYOSHI]
Penguin attack!

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,958
Launch Daimidaler immediately!

376
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,291
[KOUICHI]
Yeah! Let's go!

377
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,083
[PENGUINS]
Panty attack!

378
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,916
[MICHAEL] Cover the world
with ladies' undergarments!

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,916
[STORE OWNER 3A] These panties
have soiled my muskmelons!

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,166
[MAN 3F] Does this sign
mean panties are banned?

381
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,666
[MAN 3G]
It's panty-monium!

382
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,791
[MAN 3H] Now this is a
cherry blossom festival!

383
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,166
[RITZ giggles]

384
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,125
Thanks to a large
population of perverts,

385
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,666
our panty attack's turned
this town into a hot mess.

386
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,333
[KOUICHI]
That's enough!

387
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,250
Daimidaler!

388
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,000
I've waited ten
long days for this,

389
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,750
Rikantz Seaberry it's
time I get my revenge.

390
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,416
[RITZ] You can't see it, but
we're rolling our eyes at you.

391
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,208
Stand in the way of
the Penguin Empire,

392
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
and we'll beat you hardcore.

393
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,541
Shouldn't you charge
the Hi-ERO Generators?

394
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,041
[KOUICHI]
Not yet!

395
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,875
Okay.

396
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,958
Let's go Rikantz Seaberry!

397
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:44,916
Yawn!

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,125
[KOUICHI yells]

399
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,958
Ha!

400
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,250
[KYOKO] His piloting skills
have gotten way better.

401
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,875
He hasn't even glanced at
me to charge the Generator,

402
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,541
but the chakra
levels are stable.

403
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,375
I guess he doesn't
need me anymore.

404
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,625
[SEWASHIKO]
Daimidaler's hand-to-hand

405
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,916
combat reaction speed
has increased by 30%!

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,458
That was part of his training.

407
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,916
I'm actually impressed.

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,583
But it's not
the only difference.

409
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,500
[SORIKO gasps]

410
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,833
[KOUICHI gasps]

411
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,375
[KOUICHI]
What's going on?

412
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,541
I didn't feel like this before.

413
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,166
[KYOKO screams]
[KOUICHI grunts]

414
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:23,291
[KOUICHI gasps] Her shampoo.
It smells so good! Oh, mama.

415
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,000
Has Kyoko always been
such a grade-A piece of A?

416
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,083
What's wrong, Kouichi?

417
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,625
It's nothing!
Don't look at me during!

418
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,458
[KYOKO] Ever since he
came back, he's treated me

419
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,833
like I'm in the way.

420
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,500
[KOUICHI] What did that
training do to me?

421
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,958
It's like I can't even look
at Kyoko in the face now.

422
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,083
The second I get a
glimpse or scent of her,

423
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,083
my whole body feels like
it's gonna explode!

424
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,375
His moves are different!

425
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,083
I'm putting your
stupid penguin robot

426
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,083
right where it belongs,
in a junkyard!

427
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,541
What did you say?

428
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,208
How dare you make fun
of our penguins

429
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,041
and the Antarctic
Number 8! Douche!

430
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,125
We won't let you
get away with that!

431
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,875
[KOUICHI, KYOKO gasp]

432
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,375
Now, Special!

433
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,125
[RITZ]
Cock-a-Doodle-Doo Attack!

434
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,666
[KOUICHI, KYOKO grunting]

435
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,583
[MORIKO]
It's that attack again!

436
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,833
[SORIKO]
This is bad!

437
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,208
No, Madanbashi has the
skills to beat it now!

438
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,208
I don't know why
it's so different,

439
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,458
--but I do know I got a bunch
--Sometime today please Kouichi!

440
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,291
of backed up Hi-ERO particles
just waiting to get out!

441
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,291
All I need is one
spark to get me goin'

442
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,000
and I'll blow 'em sky high!

443
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
[MATAYOSHI]
That's the spirit, son!

444
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,583
[KYOKO groans]
I understand.

445
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,666
Fondling my boobs is the
spark you need, right?

446
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,750
Not this time!

447
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,791
[KOUICHI] If I let go of
Daimidaler's controls.

448
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,916
we'll be defenseless.
That's why I need you to...

449
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,833
To what?

450
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,875
[KOUICHI]
Show me your tits.

451
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,083
Huh?

452
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,416
Don't play dumb,
whip 'em out! Come on!

453
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,916
This job is insane!

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,666
[SEWASHIKO]
Body damage at maximum.

455
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,500
Structural integrity failing!

456
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,375
[KOUICHI] Seeing those
puppies is the key to victory!

457
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,666
What are you waiting for?

458
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,041
Five minutes ago,
you wouldn't even

459
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,083
look me in the eye,
now you wanna see me topless?

460
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,375
Uh-oh.

461
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,958
Ever since you returned
from your training

462
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,875
you've been so cold and distant.

463
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
Your piloting skills
have gotten way better,

464
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,875
and so has your control
over your Hi-ERO particles!

465
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,958
I wish you'd man up
and tell me to my face

466
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,208
that you don't need me!

467
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,083
What? Who said--?

468
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,625
That's not it.
That's not it at all.

469
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,458
My god I suck at talking.

470
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,125
Damn it we don't
have time for this!

471
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,250
I need you more than I've ever
needed anything ever, Kyoko!

472
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,416
[KYOKO gasps]

473
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,666
[KOUICHI]
I can't beat Ritz without you!

474
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,541
So be a good friend
and show me your tits!

475
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,375
[KYOKO] I'm glad my Dad's
not around for this.

476
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,125
If you don't defeat her,
I'll never forgive you!

477
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,166
[KOUICHI yells]

478
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,125
[RITZ]
What the--?

479
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,208
[MORIKO]
Oh, snap!

480
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,416
[SORIKO]
100. 120. Still increasing!

481
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,041
[MATAYOSHI] Behold the explosive
power of the abstinent man!

482
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,833
It's like a wall of
water bursting forth

483
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,750
from a broken dam!

484
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,541
Here I go!

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,333
[KOUICHI yells]
[RITZ gasps]

486
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,541
[KOUICHI]
Finger Punch!

487
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,875
[RITZ screams]

488
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,166
It's really working!

489
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,083
That's right. So long,
Rikantz Seaberry!

490
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,208
Penguin Lovin' Freak!

491
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,666
[KOUICHI]
Special Attack, Finger Beam!

492
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,958
Now that's a finger technique!

493
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,000
Damn right.

494
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,291
[BOTH gasp]

495
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,000
[KOUICHI, KYOKO gasp]

496
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,625
You may have taken this
round against us, Daimidaler.

497
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,875
[RITZ] But next time,
your big-armed robot butt

498
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:41,291
won't be so lucky.
Penguins rule, humans drool!

499
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,875
So, earlier...

500
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,166
[KYOKO]
What you said.

501
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,833
Is that true?

502
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,875
Wait, what did I say?

503
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,458
Oh, you know.

504
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,791
How you need me now
more than anything ever?

505
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,208
[KOUICHI]
Yes. As sure as I'm handsome.

506
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,875
I need you right in front
of me, Kyoko Sonan.

507
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,958
Oh, Kouichi!

508
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,916
Your sweet devil dumplings.
They look so damn delicious!

509
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,041
Huh?

510
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,250
Stop it!

511
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Even though we lost,

512
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,250
the skills Ritz showed piloting

513
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,666
the Antarctic Robot
were astounding.

514
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,958
The key must be
the Hi-ERO particles.

515
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,250
Ones emanating from her
positively affected the robot.

516
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,458
[JAKE] Another genius
discovery, your Highness!

517
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,708
You've unlocked the secret
of Hi-ERO particles!

518
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Oh, I already knew all that.

519
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,875
It simply slipped my mind.

520
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,041
[JAKE]
The only thing greater

521
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,833
than your intellect
is your honesty!

522
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,708
[JIM] Omega-three supplements
could help with your memory.

523
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Anyway, the amount of particles

524
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,541
Ritz released. It means
that she is a Factor.

525
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR cackles]
I see. What a marvelous twist!

526
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,208
To be continued.

527
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:53,333
[NARRATOR] The pent-up lust of a
teenage boy exploded to victory.

528
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,875
Don't screw this up,
Kyoko Sonan!

529
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,833
And don't get cocky,
Kouichi Madanbashi!

530
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,083
Follow that advice and
Daimidaler will never lose!

531
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,416
[NARRATOR] The chilling,
salty breeze of the dockyard.

532
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,958
Look up, at the wings
that fly toward you!

533
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,916
Are they heavy with
yearning, or with pity?

534
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,708
Next Episode:
Challenge from 6.

535
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,541
Please look forward to it.
