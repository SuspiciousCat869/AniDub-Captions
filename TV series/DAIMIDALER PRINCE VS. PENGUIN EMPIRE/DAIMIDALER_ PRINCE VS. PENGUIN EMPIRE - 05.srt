1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:09,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We filled up a Penguin Commando

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,875
with Hi-ERO Particles secreted
from an excited Ritz,

3
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:16,083
but even that wasn't enough
to defeat Daimidaler.

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,541
And while Ritz is
obviously powerful,

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,791
she lacks battle experience.

6
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,958
How can we narrow
the technology gap

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,625
between the Antarctic
series and Daimidaler?

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,041
[MICHAEL]
So frustrating!

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,250
Especially because Daimidaler's
a copycat of our models.

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,291
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Copycat?
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,625
[MICHAEL gasps]

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,875
[DENNIS] Well, a long time
ago we accidentally left

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,166
one Antarctic series robot
in town and the humans

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,958
sort of absconded with it.

15
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:40,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What?

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,041
[MICHAEL]
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,750
Then the humans reverse
engineered our robot

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,375
and used that stolen
alien knowledge

19
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,416
as the basis for Daimidaler.

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,041
[DENNIS] That's what you
meant by "copycat."

21
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,500
[MICHAEL]
Precisely.

22
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Wait.

23
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,250
Why is this the first time I'm
hearing about any of that?

24
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,625
[MICHAEL]
Oh! Raspberries!

25
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,208
[DENNIS]
I forgot we promised each other

26
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,083
to keep this secret between us!

27
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,666
[MICHAEL laughs] Well, we're
telling you now, aren't we?

28
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,041
[DENNIS]
Look, what's done is done.

29
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,750
And I'm sure His Highness
isn't so cruel

30
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,500
that he'd discipline us for a
tiny mistake made years ago.

31
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
So, to summarize:

32
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,458
It's fair to say that
Daimidaler was built

33
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,708
off of our hard work
and technology?

34
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,291
[MICHAEL, DENNIS]
Mm-hmm!

35
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Before we
arrived, the humans' preferred

36
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,791
weapons were tanks and planes.

37
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,333
I should have known
something was up

38
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,958
when they suddenly had
their own giant robot.

39
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,875
[MICHAEL] Hey, I don't
think he's scolding us.

40
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,541
[DENNIS]
We dodged a bullet.

41
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] So if
their giant robot is basically

42
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,916
just our giant robot,
how is it that a penguin-built

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,958
Antarctic series still can't
seem to destroy Daimidaler?

44
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,291
Idea! Dennis! Michael!

45
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,291
I want you to study Daimidaler
down to the very last nut

46
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,750
and then give me a full report!

47
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,000
[MICHAEL, DENNIS]
Yes, sir!

48
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Oh, and one more thing.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,791
There will be no food
for either of you

50
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,875
until that report's in my hands.

51
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,875
Never keep secrets
from me again!

52
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,958
[DENNIS, MICHAEL] We were
wrong. He is scolding us!

53
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,208
Ah! You guys, I can't take it!

54
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,791
[SEWASHIKO]
He's coming.

55
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,208
And he's so banged up!

56
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,375
Um, Professor Sewashiko,
please stop moaning like that.

57
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,541
[SEWASHIKO] I can't keep up
with the pounding you're taking!

58
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,750
Don't blame me!

59
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,000
It's the penguins
who like to play rough.

60
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,958
When Kouichi pilots Daimidaler,

61
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,708
the whole robot becomes
engorged with his particles.

62
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,958
[SEWASHIKO] Yeah, and all
that raw, throbbing heat

63
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,708
is pushing the
frame to its limit.

64
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,875
[MATAYOSHI] So, in other
words, this worn out 'bot

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,541
is proof that you're
a huge pervert.

66
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,916
[KOUICHI]
Yes, sir. That's me!

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,958
[KYOKO]
Uh, Kouichi?

68
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,208
Your school sent a letter
saying they're going

69
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,125
to hold you back because
you're always absent.

70
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,458
Alright! Leaves me more time
to fluff those pillows!

71
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,875
[KYOKO yells]

72
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,166
It's not even 10AM!

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,416
[KOUICHI]
Uh, I was just testing you.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,666
Your reflexes are much
improved, grasshopper.

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh, can the "wise master" act.
That was clearly a boob grab!

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
[MORIKO] Their conversations are
getting really sexually charged.

77
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,083
This could get tricky.

78
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,541
[MORIKO] We can't afford
long refractory periods.

79
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,458
Kouichi's gotta make the Type 2
last without busting its nuts.

80
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,125
[SORIKO] Yeah, the new model
is incredibly expensive,

81
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,166
hard to maintain,
and basically a black budget

82
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,166
WMD program with zero
political oversight,

83
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,000
but it'll be way stronger
than the Type 2,

84
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,916
and with kick-ass
special attacks!

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,208
I can't wait until it's done!

86
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,958
[KYOKO] I'll get down on my
knees if that's what you want!

87
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,833
[CHIEKO]
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.

88
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,916
I mean, Kouichi's only
attended class four days

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,083
in the last three months.

90
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,583
His GPA is a 0.2!

91
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,916
I know it's bad!

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,083
But, my Kouichi-- I mean,
Mister Madanbashi here,

93
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,958
has had extenuating
circumstances

94
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,750
that keep him from attending!

95
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,666
Like what?

96
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,333
[CHIEKO]
Oh, wait. Don't tell me.

97
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,791
Kouichi's the guy who pilots
that giant robot, Daimidaler?

98
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,041
[KYOKO] Yes! He's devoted
his life to fighting penguins!

99
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,250
Fighting to save the world

100
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
has to count for
something, doesn't it?

101
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,750
[KOUICHI yawns]
[CHIEKO giggling]

102
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,875
I was being sarcastic,
but you ran with it!

103
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,000
No it's the truth!
He really does!

104
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,625
You sound insane!

105
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,208
Like I'm supposed to believe
that hair gel-loving truant

106
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,458
can pilot a giant robot?

107
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,541
[KOUICHI gasps]

108
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,833
[CHIEKO]
A good lie should be realistic!

109
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,625
Hold on a second,
Mrs. Chieko, please!

110
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,541
[KYOKO]
Kouichi!

111
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,083
You're right; me in a
robot does sound ri-donk.

112
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,333
'Fact, I can hardly
believe it myself.

113
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:45,000
But still, like her rack,
the story's all real.

114
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,708
if you just give me a second,
I'll even prove it to ya.

115
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,625
All right.

116
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,416
Here goes!

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,250
[CHIEKO gasps]

118
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,541
[KOUICHI]
Grope charge!

119
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,208
[CHIEKO gasps]

120
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,791
[KOUICHI grunts]

121
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,291
[CHIEKO]
Hey! Get off of me!

122
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,375
[KOUICHI] You wanted proof
of my skills, well here it is!

123
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,666
[KYOKO] Student-teacher
relations are frowned upon!

124
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,541
[KOUICHI] She's about
the same size as Kyoko,

125
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,500
but the consistency's
way different!

126
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,375
They're pouring through my
fingers like warm cookie dough!

127
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:12,625
Wow you have the bedroom skills
of an international businessman!

128
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,791
How about it?
You believe us now?

129
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,333
Um, and how does this prove
you pilot a giant robot?

130
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,458
Wait! What the hell is this?

131
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,375
Not fair! This explosion's
way more intense

132
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,125
than when you're pawing at me!

133
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,750
[KYOKO] So, you just have
to pass a make-up exam,

134
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,125
and pay for the clothes
you ripped off her body.

135
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,666
[KOUICHI] Well, getting
expelled sounds like

136
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,875
it would have been easier.

137
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,791
[KYOKO]
No, Kouichi don't say that!

138
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,625
You have to get your diploma.

139
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,416
So I would like to offer
you my tutoring services.

140
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,375
[KOUICHI]
No thanks.

141
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,708
Come on, it's all free.

142
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,291
Your school problems
are my fault

143
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,833
because I got you
involved in this.

144
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,458
I don't care about that.

145
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,666
Why give a damn about
high school exams?

146
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm better off here
learnin' the ins and outs

147
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,250
of Damidaler and oinking
your sweater pigs!

148
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,500
Please! If you're as great
as you think you are,

149
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,750
you can do it all.

150
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,458
My dumb education
is none of your business!

151
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,083
[KYOKO]
We've gotten too intimate for me

152
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,208
not to have a say, Kouichi!

153
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,458
Why can't you take

154
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,291
"get the hell out of my face"

Whole thing's smells
like a bluff, anyway.

311
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,791
[KOUICHI grunts]

312
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,916
[RITZ]
A bluff?

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,958
Now does this feel
like we're bluffing?

314
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,208
[SORIKO] There are seven
chakras, located within

315
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,708
the perineum, genitals, navel,
chest, throat, forehead,

316
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,958
and vertex of the skull.

317
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,958
The Generator draws out
the Hi-ERO particles...

318
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,875
[SEWASHIKO] Watch out!
[MORIKO] Kouichi!

319
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,625
[SORIKO] This is the
reason Daimidaler's form

320
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,375
roughly resembles that of a
human, although such a form

321
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,125
does present the pilot with
control issues in battle.

322
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,833
If it resembles
humans, how the hell

323
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,166
did it get stuck with
such a gimpy right arm?

324
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,708
Talk about crummy
design philosophy!

325
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,708
You may surrender to us
whenever you're ready.

326
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
The Hi-ERO particle generator

327
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,416
you created for the Ritz Custom
is working splendidly.

328
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,708
Dennis! Michael! Good job!

329
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,708
[DENNIS]
Huzzah!

330
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,291
[MICHAEL]
Now we can eat again!

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,166
[KOUICHI]
Finger Flash!

332
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,625
[RITZ gasps]

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,583
[RITZ]
Huh? Hey! What happened?

334
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,208
[RITZ gasps]

335
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,250
[KOUICHI]
Finger beam, maximum power!

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,458
Well! Is she destroyed?

337
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,666
No.

338
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,416
[MORIKO] Rikantz Seaberry
shows no damage.

339
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,875
[KOUICHI gasps]
--Wait, Is that a...

340
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,416
...Type 2 Hi-ERO
Particle Barrier?

341
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,541
[KYOKO]
No. It's stronger than that!

342
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,666
The game's up, Daimidaler!

343
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,708
If you don't surrender,
you will die hard.

344
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,458
[JAKE]
Oh, heavens no!

345
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,708
[JAKE]
Sam's buried alive under rubble!

346
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,875
[JIM]
Take short breaths!

347
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,041
[RITZ]
Sam!

348
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,791
Please tell us Sam is okay!

349
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,625
[NELSON] His front tail
now hangs flaccid.

350
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,458
[JAKE] It'll be a long time
before it rises again.

351
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
No. Tell us...

352
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,416
...this didn't happen!

353
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,791
[RITZ]
No. No!

354
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,416
[RITZ]
How dare you hurt our Sam!

355
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,416
We will never forgive you!
We will never forgive you!

356
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,625
[KOUICHI, KYOKO scream]

357
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:07,083
[MORIKO gasps] Admin.
You have to look at this data!

358
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, my God.

359
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,000
[RITZ] We will kill
anyone who lays a hand

360
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,000
on our penguin family!

361
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,875
Right arm destroyed?
This is bad!

362
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,250
[KOUICHI] I admit she's strong,
but I'm not sweatin' her yet.

363
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,791
[MATAYOSHI]
Both of you, get out of there!

364
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,333
It's no big deal; that arm
was useless anyway!

365
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,041
[MATAYOSHI] We finished
analyzing her new robot!

366
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,458
[MORIKO]
Kouichi, listen!

367
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,291
This robot is five times
stronger than Daimidaler

368
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,958
in all areas of combat!

369
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,416
Oh, fudge me!

370
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,916
Five times stronger?

371
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,625
[RITZ growls]

372
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,166
[KOUICHI groans]

373
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,208
[RITZ]
More like ten times!

374
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,541
[RTIZ cackling]

375
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,750
[MATAYOSHI] Beating
Rikantz Seaberry is impossible.

376
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,500
You have to pull out!

377
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,416
I never pull out.

378
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,416
Kouichi...

379
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,916
[KOUICHI screams]

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,458
[NELSON]
Ooh, grisly.

381
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,833
[JAKE] You think something's
wrong with Ritz? Like, mentally?

382
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,208
[JIM]
Funny you should mention that,

383
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,458
because today it has
crossed my mind.

384
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,625
[RITZ cackling]

385
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,791
[MICHAEL]
Dennis!

386
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,000
The Antarctic Number 8's
chest is blinking!

387
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,791
[DENNIS]
Is that a bug or a feature?

388
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,625
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
This isn't good!

389
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,375
[MORIKO] Hi-ERO generator levels
have dropped drastically.

390
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,958
[KYOKO]
I can't reroute power!

391
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,583
God dammit all!
Piece of crap! Come on!

392
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,208
[RITZ] Aw, what's wrong?
You spent already?

393
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,541
Well, in that case...

394
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,666
Die.

395
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,583
Die!

396
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,208
Die!

397
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Extract Ritz at once!

398
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,375
That's an order!

399
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,708
[NELSON]
Uh, right now?

400
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,458
[JIM] Yeah, she only needs
a couple more minutes

401
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,000
to completely
vanquish Daimidaler.

402
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ritz is fraught with emotion,

403
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,250
and the Antarctic Number 8's
Hi-ERO Particle Generator

404
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,166
is feeding off that energy.

405
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,416
She risks being
absorbed altogether!

406
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,791
[DENNIS]
Well that's not good.

407
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,416
It sounds like Ritz doesn't
have enough experience

408
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,458
controlling her
Hi-ERO particles.

409
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,041
[MICHAEL] So the robot's
completely out of control?

410
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,125
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] It could
self-destruct at any moment.

411
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,875
You must release Ritz
from its infernal bowels!

412
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,000
Sometime today!

413
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,250
[JIM]
Understood! Penguin jump!

414
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,083
[JIM grunts]

415
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,125
We're gonna kill you!

416
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,666
That's what you'll get for
hurting our little friend Sam!

417
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,333
We'll avenge his
flaccid front tail!

418
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,916
[JIM]
I'm sorry to do this.

419
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,250
[RITZ whimpers]

420
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,416
[JIM]
Ritz, extracted.

421
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,333
[JAKE]
Behind you!

422
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,666
[JIM]
Hm?

423
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,458
[NELSON] Antarctic Number 8's
moving on its own!

424
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,916
[MICHAEL] Well, that's an
unexpected and creepy twist.

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,750
[DENNIS]
How's it doing that?

426
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The particles
the generator harvested

427
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,000
from Ritz possess
enough emotional charge

428
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,833
that they're able to propel
the entire Antarctic Number 8

429
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,916
on their own. What a
terrifying, but colorful,

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,125
weapon of war we've created.

431
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,583
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Evacuate the area!

432
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,375
I wasn't kidding about that
robot self-destructing!

433
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,750
[PENGUINS]
Understood!

434
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,500
[MORIKO]
Daimidaler's paralyzed.

435
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,791
[MATAYOSHI] Sonan!
Madanbashi! Leave on foot!

436
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,375
[SEWASHIKO]
Emergency eject!

437
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,500
Right. I'm on it.

438
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,250
I have got the worst
friggin' rogues' gallery.

439
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,750
[KYOKO]
No!

440
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,583
What's happened now?

441
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,333
[KYOKO] The computer
won't let us bail out!

442
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,583
Well, can we reboot it?

443
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,958
[SORIKO]
It's melting down!

444
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,125
[MORIKO] At this rate,
the whole city stands to become

445
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,791
an irradiated wasteland!

446
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,583
Eject! Eject!

447
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,833
The hatch is stuck,
too. What now?

448
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,375
I guess we've reached
the end of the line.

449
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:09,250
[KOUICHI grunting]

450
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,083
[KYOKO gasps]
Kouichi, no! Please don't!

451
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,541
Move!

452
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,166
[KYOKO screams]

453
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,875
This is it. Bye, Kyoko.

[KYOKO gasps]

455
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,958
[KYOKO]
Kouichi, no!

456
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,500
You should know.

457
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm so in love with...

[KYOKO gasps]

459
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,916
...your tig ol' bitties.

460
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,625
[MORIKO]
Daimidaler Type-2, Kouichi...

461
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,500
[MORIKO]
Destroyed.

462
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,541
[MATAYOSHI gasps]

463
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,583
[MORIKO] I'm afraid there
are no signs of life.

464
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,958
It can't be.

465
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,166
Kouichi, gone. And Kyoko.

466
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,583
[MORIKO]
Wait, there's a life signal!

467
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,000
[MATAYOSHI]
What?

468
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,875
[KOUICHI]
You should know.

469
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,125
I'm so in love with...

470
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,375
[NARRATOR] If you can
accept a girl's emotions

471
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,916
melting down a robot.

472
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,416
Then you shouldn't
be thrown for a loop

473
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,125
when our main
characters suddenly change.

474
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:46,166
Next time:
"Arrival! Shouma and Kiriko"

475
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,958
Please look forward to it.
