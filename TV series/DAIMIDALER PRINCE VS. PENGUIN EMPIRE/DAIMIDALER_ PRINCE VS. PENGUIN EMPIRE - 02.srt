1
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,250
And this is the hanger
where we service Daimidaler.

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,125
[KOUICHI]
Whoa, even his room kicks ass.

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,958
[MORIKO]
Sonan.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,291
Professors!

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,916
[KOUICHI]
Professors?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,708
[KYOKO] Yes, Kouichi,
girls can be scientists, too.

7
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,708
In fact, these three
built Daimidaler.

8
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,041
This is team leader,
Professor Moriko Tomoyose.

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,750
[MORIKO]
Hello.

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,458
Nice titles.

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,041
Up next.

12
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,666
You'll see, without leering, I
hope, Professor Soriko Majikina.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,916
She handles Daimidaler
maintenance and repair.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,458
Hello.

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,750
[KYOKO] And last, and least,
because she's short,

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,416
is Professor Sewashiko Goya.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,625
She does operations
and control guidance.

18
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,291
How-dee-doo!

19
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,000
[MORIKO] So I take it
you're the new Factor

20
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,833
we've been hearing about, huh?

21
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,833
Well, you certainly look
like a leading man.

22
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,458
[KOUICHI laughs]

23
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,416
[KOUICHI] How did you
pass engineering school

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,125
with those D's? I must squeeze!

25
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,583
So horny.

26
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,375
[MORIKO] But the objects of
your affection are over there.

27
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,833
Oh, yeah!

28
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:15,541
[KYOKO]
Huh?

29
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,250
Yeah, time to charge!

30
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,833
[KYOKO] Hey! This wasn't
the job I signed up for!

31
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:21,958
No! Stop!

32
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,708
[KOUICHI]
Here it comes!

33
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,250
[KYOKO whimpers]

34
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,041
[SORIKO] He really does have
a lot of potential backed up,

35
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,458
just waiting to burst out.

36
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,208
We might even be able to
call him an S-Class Factor.

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,625
[KOUICHI]
S-Class?

38
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,583
Yup. For "strong," like
a horse. Right? Like a horse!

39
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,750
Behave.

40
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,750
Having hot chicks
compliment me on my hair

41
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,958
and compare me to a horse.
Imma have my hands full!

42
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,000
Stop it!

43
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,875
[KOUICHI]
Don't mind me, just loitering!

44
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,208
[AUNTIE 2A]
Whatever.

45
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,500
[KOUICHI]
Yee-haw!

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,000
[SORIKO] Penguin robot
spotted moving out from

47
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,833
Sector D-11 to Sector C-4!

48
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,666
Roger that! Clearing
traffic on Route 22!

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,375
Type-2, ready for lauch!

50
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,083
[SEWASHIKO]
Daimidaler entering shaft!

51
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,000
[CROWD screaming]

52
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,166
[MAN 2A]
A penguin robot attack!

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,041
[MAN 2B]
It's marching!

54
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:56,375
[CROWD screaming]

55
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,125
[KOUICHI yells]

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,041
This new seat feels amazing
on my golden boy haunches.

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,458
[MORIKO]
This is the Daimidaler 2-seater.

58
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,291
[SORIKO] We made some
mechanical enhancements

59
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,708
to make it easier for you
to get a full power release

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,125
from Kyoko's
natural enhancements.

61
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,208
This is so humiliating.
It's like I'm a hood ornament.

62
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,916
[KOUICHI] Alright, you penguin
bastards, let's throw down!

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,625
It's on!

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,958
[KOUICHI yells]

65
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
[KOUICHI]
What the hell?

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,416
[NUMBER 9]
Penguin. Penguin.

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,708
[KOUICHI]
You're giving me a headache!

68
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,458
So I'm giving you my fist!

69
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,041
[KOUICHI]
You are so cheap!

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,041
[NUMBER 9]
Penguin.

71
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,833
[KYOKO] It isn't moving
like a normal robot!

72
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,875
[PENGUINS cheering]

73
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR laughs]
That's one for the good guys.

74
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,625
Before going into battle,

75
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,166
Number 9 received a
firmware upgrade with new

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,166
combat tactics derived
from our deadliest

77
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,666
pair of penguin commandos.
Michael and Dennis!

78
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,583
[NUMBER 9]
Penguin.

79
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Can you keep up with their

80
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,708
grace and whimsy?

81
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,375
[KYOKO screaming]
[KOUICHI grunting]

82

[KOUICHI groans]

85
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,750
I'm not goin' down that easily!

86
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,916
I'll show you what my
Daimidaler is packing!

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,791
[SORIKO]

Huh? What? You're not serious.

90
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,291
Sure am. You ready
to rub him out?

91
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,583
Fine. Make it quick.

92
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,958
[KOUICHI] Oh, mama!
That hits the spot.

93
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,333
That, huh--?

94
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,125
[KYOKO]
Hm?

95
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,666
[KOUICHI]
Twist and squeeze.

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,041
Twist and squeeze.
Twist and squeeze.

97
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,541
What's wrong?

98
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,333
[SORIKO] There's just a 2%
rise in Hi-ERO particles.

99
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,416
[SEWASHIKO]
How embarrassing for him.

100
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,458
I lost it.

101
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,125
Not now! We're right
at the climax!

102
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,791
[KOUICHI]
You're making me tense!

103
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,666
He's still a mere novice.

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,125
[KYOKO gasps]

105
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,166
[MICHAEL]
Hey, that looks like--

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,666
[DENNIS]

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,083
[ORSON]
All the newest releases!

In Blu-Ray and 4K!

109

[JAKE] Even the barely-legal
American cheerleader stuff!

110
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,666
[JIM]
Their pink bosoms are as wide

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,125
as the heartland's
great prairies!

112
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,541
[DENNIS]
Let's have Number 9 collect them

113
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,250
for our common area bookcase!

114
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,708
[MICHAEL] Ooh! Now that's
thinking on your feet, Dennis!

115
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,958
[NUMBER 9]
Penguin.

[KOUICHI grunts]

117
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,166
[MICHAEL]
No! Number 9!

118
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] We have
no other choice: Retreat!

119
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,458
[ORSON]
Oh, the pornography!

120
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,208
[JIM] It's a day
that'll live in infamy!

121
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,708
[NUMBER 9]
Penguin.

122
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
[SORIKO]
Return on Route 26.

123
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,583
With two seats, you can
use the carpool lane!

124
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,166
Why? Of all times.

125
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,333
Who dropped all that porn?

126
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,916
[RITZ sighs]

127
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,208
So, today's fight.
Daimidaler got worked.

128
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,208
[MORIKO] I wonder why
Kouichi went soft on us.

129
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,166
[SORIKO] I inspected all his
equipment thoroughly

130
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,375
this morning. Maybe he
just needs a pill?

131
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,000
[MORIKO]
So, where's our grabby duo now?

132
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,791
[KYOKO] Give it a rest!
The battle's over!

133
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,333
You should stay calm, and gently

134
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,208
talk about your problem.
That sound good?

135
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,916
But talking only
makes things worse!

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,791
[KOUICHI] Who the hell are you?
Shouldn't be down here, weirdo.

137
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,666
And this is no
place for cosplay!

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,125
[MATAYOSHI]
Beauty Salon Prince!

139
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,500
[KOUICHI gasps]

140
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,666
[MATAYOSHI] This place began
as a mere beauty salon.

141
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,500
But over time,
it evolved into

142
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,333
an electrical engineering
and robotics think-tank.

143
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:53,375
One that contributed to society
and various political campaigns.

144
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,375
In turn, the beauty
salon attracted

145
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,958
an international assortment
of top scientists and engineers.

146
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,125
In the blink of an eye,
it became a massive

147
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,500
secret society that
you may have seen

148
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,875
paranoid videos about online.

149
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,250
And then there's our
greatest creation yet.

150
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,458
Daimidaler.

151
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,916
A superweapon to fight
the Penguin Empire.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,041
It is our first and
best line of defense.

153
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,416
And so, in conclusion,

154
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,166
it's you who shouldn't
be here, softie!

155
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,875
[KOUICHI groans]

156
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,583
Kouichi, no!
Administrator Matayoshi!

157
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,916
[KOUICHI]
Asshole.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,166
No one cock blocks Kouichi
