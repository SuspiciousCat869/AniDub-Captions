1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:12,250
Hyah! Daimidaler come here!

00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,500
[GIRL]
What is that thing?

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,833
[MICHAEL] Oh, heavens no!
What a waste of water!

4
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,916
[DENNIS] I see the
outline of Daimidaler!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
[JAKE] I see her panties!

6
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,916
I'm through running.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,208
It's time to fight!

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,666
[MORIKO] We're finally
breaking our dry spell.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,083
Yeah, but how much of
a pounding can she handle?

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,791
We're talking
about a new Type-6

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,083
that's never seen real battle

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,916
and a factor who's
awfuly rusty.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,458
She'll get it going.

14
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,291
You show 'em,
Kiriko Kiyuna.

15
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,833
That your titties are to
be feared and respected!

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,000
[RITZ] Kiriko, hiding in
that banged up robot

17
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,500
won't keep us from
crushing you flat!

18
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,125
Go now! Get her!

19
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,666
[JIM] Antarctic Number 11,
open your eyes!

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,375
Show off that
10,000 volt stare!

21
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,833
[DENNIS] Antarctic Blaster!

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,625
[11] Beam!

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,708
Kiriko, no!

24
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,458
Sorry, your girlfriend's toast.

25
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,083
[JIM]
Nothing's left of Daimidaler.

26
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,500
[JAKE]
That's weird.

27
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,791
The Antarctic Blaster was
set to a pretty low power.

28
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,416
You stinky,
fish-breath monsters!

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,708
How dare you explode Kiriko!

30
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,208
I swear I'll have my revenge.

31
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,833
I'll destroy you
penguin bastards!

32
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,166
And we'll destroy you
if you keep

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
calling our penguin
hunks the b-word.

34
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,833
And you know, your girlfriend
is still alive right above us.

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,666
Shouma, your girlfriend
is coming to save you!

36
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,708
[RITZ]
What an arrogant jerk.

37
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,083
Looking down on us.

38
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,125
No respect for our
penguin superiors!

39
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,375
She's in the sky, so there's
no need to hold back!

40
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,375
Antarctic Blaster, full power!

41
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,458
[NELSON] Yes, ma'am!

42
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,916
[MICHAEL]
Ready or not, here I come!

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,541
[DENNIS] Antarctic Blaster!

44
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,041
[11] Beam!

45
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,583
[11] Penguin?

[SHOUMA yells]

[SHOUMA]
Owchie-owchie.

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
[KIRIKO] Shouma,
are you all right?

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,791
Oh, Kiriko!

52
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,833
[MATAYOSHI]
Daimidailer Type-6!

53
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,416
800 megawatts of power.

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,083
Stronger and faster
than the Type-2.

55
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,125
And with a right arm that's
slightly more useable!

56
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,375
[GIRLS screaming]

57
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,416
[JIM]
Wow, Daimidaler's been lifting!

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,791
[NELSON]
What's the plan, Ritz?

59
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,458
We don't deviate from
our original mission!

60
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,291
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
No! You must retreat at once.

61
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,416
I command you!

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,208
That's not fair,
Your Highness!

63
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,083
We still have some
fight left in us!

64
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,291
And besides, we have
to pay them back

65
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,625
for hurting
Antarctic Number 11!

66
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR[
It's not equipped to handle

67
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,916
the length and girth
of that Type-6!

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,458
You must pull out immediately!

69
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,750
We won't forget this, Kiriko!

70
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,958
Next time we meet,
it'll be you who's fisted!

00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,583
[alarm ringing]

72
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,958
[KIRIKO] Shouma!

73
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,750
Yuck. I hate those two.

74
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,333
Listen Shouma,
there's one more thing

75
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,916
I wasn't honest with you about.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,208
What?

77
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,250
Well, I never told you...

78
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,208
Before we met, I was
a Daimidaler pilot.

79
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,166
Daimidaler?

80
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,000
I wanted... to be a normal
girl who did normal stuff.

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,916
Like dating a normal
boy like you.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,083
But now nothing's normal.

83
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,625
[SHOUMA] Hey, it's okay.

84
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,500
Kiriko, my love,
I don't know anything

85
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,333
about penguins or robots,
or robot penguins.

86
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,208
But, what I do
know, is this:

87
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,833
I want to be your
boyfriend and support you

88
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,666
in good times and bad.

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,750
And I don't care if that means
penguins will chase me,

90
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,500
try to make me their
love prisoner,

91
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,958
and do weird
things to my junk.

92
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,708
It's better than seeing my
Kiriko fight them alone.

93
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,041
That's my vow!

94
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,083
I'm such a lucky girl.

95
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,875
If we fight as one,
we can't lose.

96
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,541
You're right.

97

So much for my
big promotion!

today, with their music

and their TV-MA PDAs.

102
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,791
With Madanbashi
presumed "exploded,"

103
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,750
these two are the only
chance we've got left.

104
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,916
But they're so annoying!

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
There is a new Daimidaler.

106
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,875
It is a formidable
obstacle to our plans.

107
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,458
We must eliminate it.

108

[KIRIKO]
Question!

109
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,125
[MATAYOSHI]
What is it?

00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,250
[KIRIKO] Why do I
have to come back?

111
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,583
There are still
two other Factors.

112
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,166
[MATAYOSHI] Yes, there are
others we could turn to,

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
but there's a very specific,

114
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,666
very important reason
we chose you.

115
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,625
There are only three
factors available

Kiriko Kiyuna, Hozomi Touma,
and Ryosuka Haebaru.

118
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,625
And if alphabetized based on
Japanese Hiragana symbol sounds,

119
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,166
your name comes first!

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,666
That's the reason?

Well, whatever the language,
welcome back, Kiriko.

could have really used my help

something wrong?

it's nothing.

in a secret base and

from Kouichi and Kyoko.

00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,083
And win!

161
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,958
And the key to this
operation will be...

[RITZ moans]

163
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Who else, but Ritz!

164
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,041
That guy looks like a pimp.

165
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,291
I wish we worked for him.

166
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,708
[CELL PHONE VOICE]
The number you have dialed

167
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,833
is currently out of range
or being screened.

168
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,916
Please try again at a different
time, or from a new location.

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,375
Answer your phone!

170
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,708
[KIRIKO]
Administrator, hi!

171
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,500
[MATAYOSHI] If you think you're
gonna be late, you have to call!

172
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,416
I have a very tight
schedule to keep.

173
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,583
I'm driving you kids to
and from school every day

174
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,333
on top of my penguin
fighting duties!

175
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry,
Mister Matayoshi,

176
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,916
but our school doesn't allow us
to use cell phones on campus.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,833
Ugh, kill me.

178
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,750
I think it's important
that we follow the rules.

179
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,000
Right, hon?

180
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,458
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,458
I didn't mean for my love of
strict obedience at school

182
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,875
to cause you trouble at work.

183
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,750
No. I like it when
you're serious.

184
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,958
I think it's sexy.

185
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,208
Kiriko.

186
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
Oh, Shouma!

187
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,583
Kiriko...

188
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,041
[MATAYOSHI]
So annoying.

[11] Penguin!

192
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,625
[MATAYOSHI]
Penguin robot?!

193
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,708
[RITZ] Unlike Superman,
we'll take this fight

194
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,458
to an abandoned area.

195
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,208
[RITZ] Ah! Even out here
you make a mess!

196
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,458
Stupid, Daimidaler!

197
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,500
[JIM]
What a public nuisance.

198
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,666
[SHOUMA] It's like
seven minutes in heaven,

199
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,041
but in a robot
instead of a closet.

200
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,333
I can't believe they
brought back that robot.

201
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,083
This time, I'm melting
it down into scrap metal!

202
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,458
Ha!

203
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,375
We think you're more delusional
than your boyfriend!

204
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
[RITZ] Antarctic Number 11
has been completely rebuilt,

205
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,208
specifically to hurt Daimidaler
and make you cry like a b-word.

206
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,458
A baby!

207
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,416
[KIRIKO] Ready or not,
here I punch!

Barrier! Barrier!

210
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,625
No way!

211
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,375
She can't penetrate
that new barrier!

212
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,583
Like giant
robot birth control!

213
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,791
Just be normal, please.

214
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,041
[SEWASHIKO groans]

215
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,666
[RITZ] Kiriko, your opening
attack is so boring

216
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,541
it might as well be
a sleeper hold.

217
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,916
At this rate, you face certain
smashing at the hands

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of the new Antarctic
Number 11 robot.

Now upgraded with
our battle data!

220
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,833
[RITZ] Well, enough talking.

221
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,041
Time for you burn
alive horribly.

222
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,208

00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,250

227
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,375
[RITZ]
How you doing? Good?

228
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,708
Well, how about this?
The Penguin Aurora Spin!

229
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,500
We've perfected a whole
range of new attacks

230
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,916
inspired by our love of
penguin figure skating.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,791
[NELSON] Best of all,
since it's fully autonomous,

232
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,958
Ritz won't get her
trademark morning sickness,

233
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,500
no matter how much it spins!

234
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,833
[JIM] Though, I feel like
we're losing some of the comedy.

235
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,333
So, let the fun begin!

236
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,208
It's show time boys!

00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,416
Ow-owee-ouch!

Everything all right
over there, hon?

239
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,875
Yeah, I'm just a little sore.

[KIRIKO yells]

242
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm re-routing the Hi-ERO
particles to the defense system.

243
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,708
That should protect us
for a little while.

244
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,625
Yeah, but then where will we get
particles to go on the offense?

245
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,458
We could...

246
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,125
[MATAYOSHI]
Get grabby!

247
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,916
Start grabbing and
sucking each other.

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,166
Crank up your annoying
PDA to full power

249
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,416
and the particles will
flow like two dollar wine!

250
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,041
If you can do that,

251
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,875
you'll trigger Daimidaler
Type-6's special attack!

252
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,750
It's the only way to defeat
this ice-skating princess puss!

253
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,875
[KIRIKO]
Yes!

254
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,708
Alright, you heard
the man, Shouma!

255
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,291
Do whatever you want to me,
but be respectful.

256
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,791
What?!

257
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,458
This is no time for you to
hold back from that phat rack!

258
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,833
The special attacks need
a hardcore stream

259
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,833
of Hi-ERO to work! Hop to!

260
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,500
The fate of the world depends
upon you going "full pervert."

261
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,333
Now motorboat them
silky milkies!

262
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,458
Your hands are rival
expedition teams.

263
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,208
Your fingers are hikers
rappelling down mountainsides.

264
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,333
Tear her in half
like a starving bear

265
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,416
going through a tent
of sleeping campers!

266
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,333
I can't do this
alone, Kiriko.

267
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,083
Do your part!

268
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,625
Yes, sir!

269
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,583
My darling, I'm yours to do
with as you wish, so take me!

270
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,458
[MATAYOSHI] That's some
good dirty talk, Kiriko!

271
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,583
Oh, thank you!
I just went with the flow.

272
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,041
[MATAYOSHI]
Right! Keep it up!

273
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,125
Yes, sir!

274
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,833
[SHOUMA] No way,
this has to be a test.

275
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,583
My Kiriko would never
be cool with this.

276
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,708
I can still remember
the innocent girl

277
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,875
I fell in love with.
This is all my fault.

278
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,916
I let my hormones
get the best of me

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,250
when I should have
protected her!

280
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,500
I can't keep acting
this way toward Kiriko.

281
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,416
I have to...
treat her like a lady!

282
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
[MATAYOSHI]
What?

283
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
Gentlemen do not do
those things in public

284
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,416
to the ladies they love!

285
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,166
[MATAYOSHI] Do you
wanna die a virgin?!

286
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,125
[MORIKO] This kid's
a real lemon, huh?

287
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,708
[SEWASHIKO] He thinks
being a nice guy

288
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,833
will make women like him,

289
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,291
but he forgets that
we like bad boys.

290
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
[SORIKO] Shouma,
you better grow a pair

291
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,875
and start booby grabbing!

292
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
Unless, you've got a
better way to beat Ritz.

293
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,583
Well, maybe we could, like--

294
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,916
[RITZ] Don't tell us
you're giving up already?

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,625
You may be stopping, but
we're just getting started!

296
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
Special attack!

297
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,583
[RITZ and PENGUINS]
Penguin Aurora Spin!

Front tail targeting.

299
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,250

300

[NELSON]
Spin my front tail!

301
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,375
Super Spin Antarctic Blaster!

302
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,416
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA yell]

303
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,791
Well, hot dog. That was easy.

304
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,333
[SHOUMA] Oh, Kiriko!

305
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,666
I don't know what to do!

306
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,333
I want to act like a gentleman!

307
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,833
But at this rate,
staying hands-off

308
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,041
could get her
and me killed!

309
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
I have to find a way to
put Kiriko "in the mood"

310
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,041
without doing
anything perverted.

311
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,625
I know!

312
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,250
Kiriko, look at me right now!

313
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,500
Huh?

314
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,291
[SHOUMA] The best thing
my dad taught me...

315
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,708
The Gulliver Stick!

316
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,291
Huh? Uh huh?

317
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,416
[KIRIKO screams]

318
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,666
[ALL gasp]

319
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,916
[SORIKO]
Daimidaler Type-6, Kiriko.

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,916
Chakra generators, all green!

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,791
All Hi-ERO particles
arrayed in full burst mode!

322
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,083
You clearly got her
body quivering, Shouma!

323
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,833
That's a major league
Gulliver Stick you've got.

324
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,375
Yes, it worked!
We can fight back!

325
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,750
Right, honey?

326
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,333
[KIRIKO panting]

327
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,791
Uh, you all right?

328
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,500
[RITZ] You should have quit
when you had the chance.

329
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,958
Now we're really gonna
spin you to pieces!

330
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,333
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA yelp]

331
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,375
[SORIKO] Hi-ERO particles
fluctuating rapidly

332
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,958
between 0 and 200.

333
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,916
The numbers won't stabilize!

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,791
[SHOUMA] Something's
not right with her!

335
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,875
[MATAYOSHI]
Kiriko Kiyuna! What's wrong?

336
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,083
Was his stick too much
for you to handle?

337
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,500
[SHOUMA]
What?

338
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,333
[MATAYOSHI] It appears
the mere sight of Shouma's stick

339
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,375
has sent her into severe shock.

340
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,500
Oh Kiriko.

341
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,625
I'm sorry.
It's your Gulliver Stick...

342
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,208
I don't know why, but it's
just so hard to take in.

343
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,416
But it isn't real.

344
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,416
It's just an old
practical joke!

345
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,291
Yes, I know that.

346
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,291
But in that one moment,

347
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,500
it all... felt so real.

348
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,750
[KIRIKO screams]

349
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,708
The Daimidaler Type-6's attack
may be in full burst mode,

350
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,458
but Kiriko's will to fight
has totally bottomed out!

351
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,416
That damn Gulliver Stick.

352
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,875
In unskilled hands,
it's a double-edged sword.

353
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,125
[SHOUMA]
All right, I'll do it!

354
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,708
What?

355
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,333
[SHOUMA] This situation
is all my fault.

356
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,416
I'm the one who
zapped Kiriko's mojo.

357
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,208
It's up to me to
beat those penguins!

358
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,291
[MATAYOSHI]
But you're just a novice!

359
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,791
I know I can do this!

360
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,000
[MATAYOSHI]
Fine! Try not to die.

361
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,583
[RITZ]
Still wanna fight?

362
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,458
Guess we know this Type isn't
programmed with common sense.

363
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,791
[SHOUMA yelling]

364
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,541
You're not gonna lay
a flipper on my Kiriko!

365
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,333
Ready? Gulliver Punch!

366
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,833
[11]
Barrier.

367
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,791
[SHOUMA yells]

368
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,000
[11]
Pe-Penguin?

369
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,916
[SHOUMA] That wasn't
supposed to be a kick!

370
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,666
[ALL]
What?!

371
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,250
[JAKE]
His front tail broke off!

372
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,375
[SHOUMA]
Gulliver Kick!

373
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,750
[11] Barrier!

374
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,625
Trust me, that was
supposed to be a kick!

375
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,166
[MICHAEL]
Daimidaler eye gauging?

376
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,791
[DENNIS] Cheater-cheater,
Peter beater!

377
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,375
See now this is why
we hate humans so much!

378
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
We're getting lemonade
from our lemon!

379
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,875
It's a Shouma surprise!

380
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,291
Rikantz Seaberry
reprogrammed her robot

381
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,583
and now it's useless
against a novice!

382
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,166
[KIRIKO]
Oh, Shouma.

383
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,625
You're so cool!

384
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,708
Alright, my darling.

385
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm ready to get
back in the fight.

386
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,333
Kiriko, oh thank God!

387
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,708
[MATAYOSHI] Kick its ass,
Kiriko Kiyuna!

388
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,625
Show those punk penguins
the true power of the Type-6!

389
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,625
Sure thing!

390
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,166
Let's go for it, Shouma!

391
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,166
Okay!

392
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,125
Awesome!
Just follow my lead!

393
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,541
No problem!

394
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,500
[KIRIKO] Leg panel:
Turn the secondary knob.

395
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,208
Climb power on!

396
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,541
[SHOUMA]
Auto throttle on!

397
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,250
Pedestal aerial
control unit, AFS off!

398
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,291
[KIRIKO] Loading navigational
target display

399
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,125
from the aerial
information terminal!

400
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,291
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA]
Complete!

401

Daimidaler Type-6
Particles Disguise!

402
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,958
Young love kicks ass!

403
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,125
Oh, that's not fair!
The new pilots can transform?

404
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,041
And what an ugly form.

405
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,125
One big fat arm.

406
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,458
Scraggly hair.

407
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
Back to being stupid, old
Daimidaler, all right.

408
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,666
[JIM] Now see, I'd call
that form iconic.

409
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,833
Cool, even.

410
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,458
[DENNIS]
Um, shouldn't we be worried?

411
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,791
[RITZ] Not yet. We still
got one move left.

412
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:51,250
Antarctic Number 11 re-route all
remaining power for a Body Slam!

413
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,125
I'm ready when you are, Kiriko!

414
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,166
We'll end this fight
together, Shouma!

415
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,291
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA]
Daimidaler CP Slash!

416
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,625
[11]
Penguin!

417
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,166
[ALL]
Antarctic Number 11!

418
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,000
[SHOUMA giggles]

419
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,375
[KIRIKO giggles]

420
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,041
Our love won the day!

421
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,208
[SHOUMA] And without
being perverted!

422
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,125
You were amazing
under pressure.

423
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,708
[MATAYOSHI]
From annoying to heroes.

424
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,458
I'm convinced that the
key to saving Earth

425
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,250
is to let two love-starved teens

426
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,666
pilot a billion
dollar combat mech.

427
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,958
Argh! But I still
can't stand them!

428
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,333
I hate their love!

429
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,750
I mean, jeez!

430
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,458
Either hook up, or knock it
off with the kissy talk!

431
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,625
[NARRATOR]
A new heroine is born!

432
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,208
Lovey-dovey Kiriko!

433
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,166
As for you, Shouma, don't
be afraid to get frisky.

434
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,291
Increasing your country's
birthrate depends on you!

435
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,416
Oh, and try to control
your anger, Matayoshi.

436
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,291
Now go, Daimidaler!

437
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,666
Go, fight, and win!

438
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Don't get too big

439
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,416
in your britches,
Beauty Salon Prince.

440
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,250
Our ultimate victory is
a foregone conclusion.

441
00:21:55,333 --> 00:22:02,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR
laughs maniacally]

442
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,125
[NARRATOR]
Ultrasonic vibrations can remove

443
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,625
dental plaque
without even making

444
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,833
physical contact with the teeth.

445
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,375
Next Episode: "Convenient!
Electric Toothbrush."

446
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,416
Please look forward to it.
