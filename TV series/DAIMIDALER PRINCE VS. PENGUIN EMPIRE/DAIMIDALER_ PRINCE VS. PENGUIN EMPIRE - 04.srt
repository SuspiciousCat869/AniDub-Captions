1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,958
[KOUICHI]
He was a pretty amazing guy.

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,083
But still. Glad we
kicked his ass.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,708
[KYOKO]
Yeah.

4
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Hi-ERO particles.

5
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:17,250
They are the source of
Daimidaler's strength and power.

6
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,416
So, if a penguin
were to be infused

7
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,666
with Hi-ERO particles,
then surely he

8
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,083
would be able to
defeat Daimidaler.

9
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,791
[MICHAEL] Perhaps,
but I feel like this might

10
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,416
be impossible to achieve.

11
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
[DENNIS]
Quite right.

12
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,333
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We can do it!

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,625
In this task,
we must succeed.

14
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,958
Not only for ourselves,
but for Ritz,

15
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,375
who is providing
the Hi-ERO particles.

16
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,500
[NELSON]
Now commencing Test Number 6!

00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,250
[RITZ gasps]

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,416
[RITZ]
Oh, oh penguins!

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR gasps]
This light emanating from him

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,541
is truly the light
of Hi-ERO particles!

21
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,208
Hi-ERO Particle
Test Subject 6, Henry.

22
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,625
From this day forth, you will
be known as Hi-ERO penguin,

23
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,708
Commando 6!

24
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,958
[MICHAEL] Awesome!
[DENNIS] So cool!

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,708
[NELSON]
Check out those sweet bangs!

26
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,375
[6]
Please, call me. Commando 6!

27
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,833
[KOUICHI]
Wait! Just hear me out, Kyoko!

28
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,208
Hey, don't turn your back on me!
At least, not like this!

29
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,166
Get lost!

30
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,541
[KOUICHI]
Hold it!

31
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,166
Don't get hung up on
me hanging you up!

32
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,291
[KYOKO] No way!
I am not doing that!

33
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,750
[KOUICHI]
When I saw this last night

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,166
I had a stroke of inspiration!

35
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,916
Trying this could really
spice things up for us!

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,208
It'd definitely help
me fuel Daimidaler!

37
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,000
Won't you do it for Daimidaler?

38
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,750
[KYOKO growls]

39
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,583
[KYOKO] He's out of control!
You have to say something!

40
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,958
[MORIKO]
Fine, "something."

41
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,583
[SEWASHIKO] Make sure to
submit the data you collect

42
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,875
from trying that
disgusting pose!

[SORIKO screams]

44
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,000
[SORIKO]
How embarrassing!

45
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,583
[MORIKO]
Nice 7-10 split!

46
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,291
[SEWASHIKO]
It's striking, really!

He's back for more!

[WOMAN 4A] I'm starting to get
used to all these robots.

I barely even
notice them anymore.

[MAN 4B]
Hey, get lost!

[NELSON] Gee, I hope
Operation Daimi-doppelganger

53
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,625
works out.

54
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,375
[JIM] I know! I'm on
the edge of my seat.

[NELSON]
Oops, broad shoulders!

a little more graceful.

Hold it right there!

[NEWSLADY 4A] A second
Daimidaler has appeared.

Thankfully, it looks
as though the area

00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,833
has been fully evacuated.

was bad enough, but two?

of my untimely death!

All right, my evil, uglier twin.

[KYOKO]
Whoa!

00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,916
So that's who was hiding
inside the fake Daimidaler!

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,083
Another one of those big,
dumb penguin robots!

71
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,000
[6] Correct! Except
for the "dumb" part.

Don't underestimate him!

He said it! He said, "S-E-X" and
it made me feel funny inside!

that matters now,

is that we defeat Daimidaler!

in this mission, Your Highness?

Oh yeah, Penguin,
that's the spot!

beat the crap outta you.

I'd say this, but I hate Sex!

[MATAYOSHI]
He's a formidable opponent.

00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,000
As long as he's alive,

coming back for more.

to stop this monster.

whack every one of those

We've located 6.

312
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,541
[MICHAEL]
He's fighting.

313
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What?

314
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,750
6! What are you doing?

315
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,166
[6]
Your Highness.

316
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,666
I have committed one of
the most unforgivable sins

317
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
that a penguin can commit.

318
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,125
And now, I must
take responsibility!

319
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Don't be foolish!

320
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,541
Come back! That is an order!

321
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,416
Come back now, 6!

322
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,458
[KOUICHI]
This does not look good for us.

323
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,000
It's his chest, Kouichi.

324
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,333
[KYOKO]
Aim for his chest.

325
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,333
Huh? Where's this
coming from all of--?

326
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,625
[KYOKO]
Shut up and shoot!

327
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,375
[KOUICHI] Kyoko...
[KYOKO] Just shoot him now!

328
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,583
[6] For the eternal glory
of the Penguin Empire!

329
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,541
[KOUICHI]
Finger Beam!

330
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,083
[KOUICHI groans]

331
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,333
I wanted for us to
build a nest together.

332
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,833
[KYOKO gasps]

333
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,791
[KYOKO] "What I dreamt was
something of love so true.

334
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,166
What I wished was something
of happiness unbound.

335
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,500
All of that, here with you.
I now have found."

336
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,416
[KOUICHI]
We did it, Kyoko!

337
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,041
[KYOKO]
Why? Why did you shoot?

338
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,250
[KOUICHI]
Huh?

339
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,666
[KYOKO]
Sex...

340
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,291
He was a pretty amazing guy.

341
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,750
[KOUICHI] But still.
Glad we kicked his ass.

342
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,166
[KYOKO]
Yeah...

343
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,833
It's all thanks to you two.

344
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,750
Huh?

345
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,583
You guys really are fantastic!

346
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,500
I bow down before the twin
goddesses of breast-itude!

347
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,666
[KYOKO]
What's wrong with you?

348
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,208
That sounds a little
more like the Kyoko

349
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,208
I've come to know and tolerate.

350
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, you.

351
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,291
[KYOKO]
Hey, Kouichi?

352
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,291
[KOUICHI]
Hm?

353
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,500
[KYOKO]
Let's get some barbecue.

354
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,708
[KOUICHI]
Sounds good!

355
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,375
I really worked up an
appetite back there!

356
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,458
So, what kind of meat
do you like best?

357
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,875
Well, my favorite kind
is sweater meat!

358
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,125
Jeez! Perv.

359
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,458
Is that all you
know how to do?

360
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,208
[KYOKO]
Stupid.

361
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,125
[KYOKO] So that's what
happened this week.

362
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,000
Beauty Salon Prince
really is the worst.

363
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,833
Well, I'll see you later, Daddy.
I'll visit again soon.

364
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,125
[NARRATOR] And with that, a
fleeting dream came to an end.

365
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,583
Kyoko, your ample
bosom is not meant

366
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,458
to house the sweet
throb of love.

367
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,291
It exists solely to be
fervently fondled.

368
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,541
So hold your mammaries
high, Kyoko Sonan!

369
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,583
And keep fighting
the good fight.

370
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,791
Daimidaler!

371
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,916
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
6...

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Rest in peace.

373
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,583
We will not let your
sacrifice be in vain.

374
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] We will
defeat Daimidaler so that

375
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,125
the Penguin Empire may at last
seize control of this planet!

376
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:15,375
Great penguin commando.
The hero, 6!

377
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:20,916
[PENGUINS]
6! 6! 6! 6! 6!

378
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,875
[6] Oh, would that
I could go out there.

379
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:27,791
Henry! Welcome home!
Where have you been hiding?

380
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:37,333
[NARRATOR] A perverted,
mischievous, and cool man.

381
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,000
You will shine in the night sky,

382
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,750
as your tears fall
like shooting stars.

383
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:46,166
Next time: Mad Dance!
The Fearsome Penguin Flyers!

384
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,833
Please look forward to it.
