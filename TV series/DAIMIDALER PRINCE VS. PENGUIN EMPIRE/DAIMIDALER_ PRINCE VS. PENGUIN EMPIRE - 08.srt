1
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,750
[JIM] This feels like the
death march of the penguins.

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,708
[MICHAEL] The Antarctic
Number 11 was our ride,

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,541
and those lovesick
kids destroyed it.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,875
We have no other way home.

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,458
[RITZ]
Hey, speaking of home,

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,666
how much longer until we
get to the Penguin Castle?

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,041
[DENNIS] Hmm.

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,291
At our current rate,
probably two months.

9
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,833
You've gotta be kidding?

10
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,000
[JAKE] Is it just me,
or have we ended up having

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,500
to walk back after each of
our most recent deployments.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,791
[JIM] That's why I make sure
to pick up reading material

13
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,208
to make the time pass faster.

14
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,083
[DENNIS} I wouldn't mind
walking forever if it means

15
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,416
having a set of breasts
pressed against my flesh.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,416
See, everybody benefits when
you give us a piggy-back ride!

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,583
[NELSON] Dennis gets all
the back-to-rack contact!

18
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,916
[JIM] It's not fair!
We should take turns!

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,375
[RITZ] Damn it,
we're wandering around

20
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,875
in the middle of nowhere,

21
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,916
all because of Daimidaler
and that stupid Kiriko!

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,250
They'll pay for this!

23
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,125
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We shall now commence

24
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,166
testing of the penguin device.

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,750
[COMMANDO] Even though Ritz
and the others aren't back yet?

26
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,416
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Well,
there's nothing else to do

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,458
with them gone and
I'm getting bored.

28
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,791
All right, then.

29
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,041
Do we have any requests

30
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,333
for what you'd like to
see this device produce?

31
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,791
[COMMANDO]
Pornographic magazines, please!

32
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,166
[COMMANDO 2]
Ooh, adult films!

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,416
Something with a story.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,083
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Seems simple enough.

35
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,208
Now, let's begin.

36
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,458
Penguin device, activate!

37
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,666
[PENGUINS]
That's not porn!

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,708
Huh? No!

39
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,750
Why am I suddenly naked?

40
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,541
What just happened?

41
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,708
Oh, my dress.

42
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It's you, Macaroni!

43
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
Huh?

44
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,333
[MACARONI]
Your Highness, is that you?

45
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,041
Your Highness!
It's been so long!

46
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,750
[MACARONI giggles]

47
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,250
Your Highness!

48
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,708
[COMMANDO] Is this luscious
lady an old flame of yours,

49
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,291
you dirty birdie, you?

50
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,416
[COMMANDO 2] I could not
be any more jealous!

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,958
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What are you blathering about?

52
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,166
She's merely one of my
subordinates in the other world.

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,541
[COMMANDO]
Wait, "other world"?

54
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,041
I can't believe
it's really you!

55
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,791
We were so worried by your
disappearance, Your Highness.

56
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,916
We held candlelight
vigils and everything.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,291
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Aw, that's very sweet of you.

58
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,833
Hmm? Your jubblies!

59
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:48,958
[MACARONI gasps]

60
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,000
Your Highness,
what's gotten into you?

61
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,125
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
The sag, the bounce.

62
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,750
Yes, it's clear.

63
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,583
You're not wearing
a brassiere, Macaroni.

64
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,208
Sorry, but I'm a lady. I don't
leave home without my

65
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,333
over the shoulder
boulder holders.

66
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,708
[MACARONI gasps]
My bra!

67
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,000
It's not there!

68
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,833
Don't suppose you
have one lying around?

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,041
[MATAYOSHI]
Mister Ameku.

70
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,625
Now that you're part
of the staff here

71
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,375
at Beauty Salon Prince

72
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,541
it's time you got to
know the lay of the land,

73
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,333
which is why I'm giving
you this free tour.

74
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,375
[KIRIKO]
Oh, Shouma.

75
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,666
Thanks for giving up
your free time

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,791
to take this boring tour.

77
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,500
As long as
I'm with you.

78
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,666
Oh! It's a date!

79
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,833
[KIRIKO sighs]

80
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,916
What, will the two
of you stop breathing

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,291
if you're apart
for even a second?

82
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,625
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA]
Uh, sorry.

83
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,541
Come on!

84
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,791
As you both already know,

85
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,250
the penguins poisoned
the public's trust

86
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,208
in Beauty Salon Prince

87
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,708
forcing us to take
a temporary hiatus.

88
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,166
[MATAYOSHI] Well, after taking
the necessary measures,

89
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,208
we're finally
ready to reboot.

90
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:59,041
I present the H-E-P-R 06,
Daimidaler Type-6, Kiriko.

91
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,833
[MATAYOSHI] It's currently
the best, the newest,

92
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,708
and the strongest
Daimidaler in our arsenal.

93
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,916
With this magnificent beast,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,250
Beauty Salon Prince
will never lose again!

95
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,166
Now listen up.

96
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm counting on you.

97
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,875
That means the both of you.

98
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,875
With your extraordinary
powers working in tandum--

99
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,958
Oh, Kiriko,
you're so soft and warm!

100
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,875
You smell so good, Shouma!

101
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,000
[MATAYOSHI]
Give it a rest already!

102
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,333
Miss Kiyuna, you are
aware that Daimidaler

103
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,291
is fueled by
the Factor's power, correct?

104
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,541
I know that, yes.

105
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,500
[MATAYOSHI] And Mister Ameku,
it's up to you

106
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,291
to stimulate
Miss Kiyuna's power,

107
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,875
whatever it takes!
If you know what I mean.

108
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I get what you're saying.

109
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,458
But why are you being

110
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,166
such a grumpy
Gus all of a sudden?

111
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,458
There's no need to be a meanie,

112
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,291
we know what you're asking,
right smoochie?

113
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,875
[MATAYOSHI]
They're so sickeningly sweet!

114
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,333
I want to strangle them!

115
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,958
[MORIKO] Sir, we're in need
of some direction.

116
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,458
Yeah, and I'm in need
of some erectio--

117
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,500
Stop. Please, just stop.

118
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,375
Some building
materials were left

119
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,791
on our bowling lane and
they're getting in the way.

120
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
Hmm. That's the material...

121
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,875
Yeah, what is it?

122
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, I could give
you a private tour myself.

123
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,958
So why don't we just
sneak off on our own?

124
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,583
Oh, yes, I'd like that!

125
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,250
[SHOUMA] As long as you know
your way around this place.

126
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,291
[KIRIKO whines]
I am so lost right now!

127
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,416
Please don't be sad,
Kiriko, dear.

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,666
Oh, but I'm so useless!

129
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,166
[KIRIKO crying]

130
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,500
Huh?

131
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,166
Nonsense, my love.
It'll be like we're on a fun,

132
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,375
exciting adventure
together, right?

133
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,541
[SHOUMA]
And by the way,

134
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,791
you look super adorable

135
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,791
when you get all lost
and flustered like that.

136
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,791
[KIRIKO]
Aw, Shouma, you're too sweet!

137
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,250
[keypad beeps]

138
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,125
[SHOUMA] Uh...
I didn't mean to do that.

139
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,458
What is this place?

140
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,791
[KIRIKO] I don't know,
but it's creeping me out.

141
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,333
[SHOUMA]
Yeah, ditto.

142
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,375
Let's get outta here.

143
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,458
[door closing]

144
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,958
[SHOUMA]
Uh-oh.

145
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,791
Looks like a dead end.

146
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,583
Someone's a serious hoarder.

147
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,458
Reminds me of
my grandma's attic.

148
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,625
Let's turn back.

149
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,166
[KIRIKO]
Okay.

150
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,041
[SHOUMA]
Kiriko!

151
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,500
[KIRIKO and SHOUMA yelp]

152
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,250
You all right, dear?
You hurt anywhere?

153
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,458
No, are you hurt?

154
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,250
Nope, I'm A-Okay.

155
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,458
Even better now that
I know you feel alright.

156
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,250
And I'm happy that you
feel so nice yourself.

157
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,375
But we do have a bit of
a pickle on our hands.

158
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,208
[SHOUMA grunting]

159
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,208
Dang, it won't budge!

160
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,250
Oh no, we've been
buried alive!

161
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,333
[KIRIKO]
What do we do now?

162
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,833
[SHOUMA sighs]

163
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,666
[SHOUMA]
Please forgive me.

164
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,416
Shouma, what
are you doing?

165
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,666
[SHOUMA] Don't fight it.
Just lie there and be quiet.

166
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,833
Well, that's
a little forward.

167
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,833
This isn't the time or
the place to get all handsy.

168
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,916
[KIRIKO] Why is he suddenly
getting so frisky?

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,250
[KIRIKO moaning]
Is it the boxes?

170
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,458
Is he that literal?

171
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,416
Gentlemen do not do
those things in public

172
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,458
to the ladies they love!

173
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,666
[KIRIKO]
How does he go from that

174
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,916
to fondling me like this?

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,625
I don't understand boys!

176
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,458
[KIRIKO gasps]

177
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,041
No, please don't do that!

178
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,708
Your hands are like icicles!

179
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,500
Holy fudge, Shouma,
that feels so good!

180
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,333
All right, let's do it!

181
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,708
Now?

182
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,125
But I don't know if
I'm emotionally prepared

183
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,291
to go all the way yet.

184
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,500
What are you
talking about?

185
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,666
This has to
happen now!

186
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,666
Use your power to
get us outta here!

187
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,916
Yeah, now this makes
a lot more sense.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,250
Leave it to me!

189
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,000
[KIRIKO moans]

190
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,625
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA grunt]

191
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,708
So this is...?

192
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,458
The command center,
like I planned.

193
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,000
See, I told you
that I knew my way

194
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,750
around this
place. No problem.

195
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,541
What the hell did you do
to my command center?

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
[COMMANDO A] 
Ooh, it's a slingshot!

197
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,125
[COMMANDO B]
Definitely a slingshot!

198
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] It seems
there are no complications

199
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,500
with transporting
inanimate objects.

200
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,625
Whoa, did you just have

201
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
a profound epiphany,
Your Highness?

202
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
While the simple particles

203
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,500
of non-living material
make it through intact,

204
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,500
living things experience
some degree of entropy.

205
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,333
"Entropy"? What's that mean?

206
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It means they lose something

207
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,500
in the transmission.
Cells, fluids, memories,

208
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,083
even their wallet or
an article of clothing.

209
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,416
It's like the cosmic version of
losing your sock in the dryer.

210
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,083
Hold on, so that's what
happened to my brassiere?

211
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,375
[MACARONI] I wanna make sure
I understand, Your Highness.

212
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,375
You're planning
to create

213
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,500
a new empire here
on this world?

214
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Precisely.

215
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,000
And there may come a time
when I require your assistance.

216
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,416
Of course. 

217
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,875
We, the five strongest
warriors of the Penguin Empire

218
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,541
will be at your
service when you call.

219
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,208
[MACARONI]
Until then, Your Highness

220
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,083
and everybody of
this world, take care.

221
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Panties?

222
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,208
[DENNIS]
This doesn't look right.

223
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,375
I'm afraid we took
a wrong turn somewhere.

224
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,458
[RITZ]
Umm.

225
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,750
Yeah, we were
thinking the same thing.

226
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,916
Five hours back.

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
[JIM] What? Why didn't
you say something?

228
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,875
[DENNIS]
Huzzah, I did it!

229
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,041
Look, everyone!
I caught a jumbo shrimp!

230
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,708
[JAKE]
That's a scorpion!

231
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,833
[JIM groans]
My throat is parched

232
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,833
and I can no longer move.

233
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,791
Same here.

234
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,083
We're exhausted.

235
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,375
[DENNIS] Well, in that
case, I have no choice.

236
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,416
I will give the shrimp
I caught to you, Ritz.

237
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,250
Now, eat and replenish thyself!

238
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,958
[JIM] Dude, I'm telling you,
that's a scorpion.

239
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,208
[DENNIS yelps]
This shrimp just stung me!

240
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,291
[DENNIS groans]

241
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,250
[JAKE] Dennis, no!
Hang in there!

242
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,958
Dennis!

243
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,416
[DENNIS groans] A light.
I see a light.

244
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,291
[JIM] The poison has
spread to his brain!

245
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,250
It's making him hallucinate!

246
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,625
That's no hallucination!

247
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,041
[JAKE]
What is that?

248
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,500
--[JIM] A bird?
--[DENNIS] A plane?

249
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,250
[JAKE] Whatever it is,
it's coming right for us!

250
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,083
[ALL yell]

251
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,958
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

252
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Welcome home, Ritz.

253
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,583
You did a good job
on your mission.

254
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,958
[RITZ] Yay! Boy,
are we glad to see you!

255
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:56,875
[JIM]
Penguin Castle?

256
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,041
But I don't understand!

257
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,791
We were just in
the middle of the desert!

258
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,500
[DENNIS]
How'd we get here?

259
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
With that.

260
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,666
I teleported you all

261
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,666
using our fancy
new penguin device!

262
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,916
--[RITZ] Badass!
--[PENGUINS] Huzzah!

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
There's just one minor drawback.

264
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,125
"Drawback"?

265
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,916
[RITZ gasps] Ah!
Our panties are showing!

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,375
And they're not
even the cute ones!

267
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,750
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
So Ritz lost her skirt.

268
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,750
What about the rest of you?

269
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,000
[MICHAEL]
The penguin phone strap

270
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,291
I treasured
so dearly is gone!

271
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,875
[JAKE]
Say it isn't so!

272
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,041
[JIM] The pornography
I was reading is gone!

273
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,583
[MICHAEL]
Oh, the penguin-ity!

274
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,083
[DENNIS] The poison from that
shrimp is gone from my body!

275
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,750
[JAKE]
That's great, Dennis!

276
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,958
We don't get it,
Your Highness.

277
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,250
What's going on?

278
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,833
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Well, before I get to that.

279
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,541
Please, forgive me.

280
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,958
But why? For what?

281
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The penguin
device transportation

282
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,291
is close to perfect.

283
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,000
However, when a living
creature is transferred,

284
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,875
something of theirs vanishes,

285
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,625
and we've yet to find
a solution for that.

286
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,958
Well, that explains why
all of our stuff went missing.

287
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,250
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
That's right.

288
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,916
Despite knowing
the risks involved,

289
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,333
I still used the device
to teleport you here.

290
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,500
For putting you
in harm's way like that,

291
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,916
I am profoundly sorry.

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,041
[RITZ] You can hold your
head high, Your Highness.

293
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,833
We understand why
you did what you did,

294
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,541
and you have nothing
to feel bad about.

295
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
But I must take responsibility

296
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,333
for subjecting
you all to such danger.

297
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,708
No biggie!

298
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,458
[JIM] Well, if Ritz's skirt
has you on high alert.

299
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,166
[JAKE] We can cover her undies
with our fronties!

300
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,208
If all the porno
mags are gone,

301
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,291
we can satisfy every one of
you with our handy God Scrub!

302
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,166
[RITZ] And we can make another
penguin phone strap in no time!

303
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,958
If any one of us
loses something,

304
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,583
we'll work together
to fill that gaping void.

305
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,083
Because when you're part
of the Penguin Empire,

306
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,958
you're part of a family.

307
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,541
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You guys...

308
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,458
That's it!

309
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,875
We're all taking
a bath together!

310
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,125
[ALL]
Yay!

311
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ritz.

312
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,416
Post-bath, I'd like you
to get a full physical exam.

313
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
[RITZ]
Okay.

314
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,291
Are we preparing
for something special?

315
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] The penguin
device has no trouble

316
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,875
transporting
non-living objects,

317
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,250
so we can put that
operation into motion.

318
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,458
Whoa, holy crap! What is this?

319
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,458
What are you boys
going to do to us?

320
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,916
[JIM giggles]
Anything we please!

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,291
Now let's see
what you've got here!

322
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,833
[RITZ whimpers]
Don't look at us!

323
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,916
[DENNIS] Her nipples are as
rosy as a pair of pink posies.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,833
And as for her tulips...

325
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,750
No! Someone help!

326
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,583
[PENGUINS, RITZ scream]

327
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We're giving her a medical exam!

328
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,416
This is no time
to play doctor!

329
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,166
[RITZ] Why not do both
at the same time?

330
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,708
Can't a girl have
a little fun?

331
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
We're collecting data

332
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,708
for our next operation.
This is serious business.

333
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,583
Treat it as such.

334
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
Fine, be a clam jam.

335
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,375
'Kay, Nelson. Size us up now.

336
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,541
[NELSON]
All set!

337
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,500
[RITZ giggles]

338
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,791
That tickles!

339
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,833
[NELSON] Well, we've gone
over every inch of her.

340
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,958
[JAKE]
Wow, her bust is a C-cup?

341
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,041
[DENNIS] Those are some
dynamite breasts, Ritz!

342
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,750
[MICHAEL]
Truly spectacular!

343
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,041
Ahem. Are you
saying we're sexy?

344
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,625
[PENGUINS]
Super sexy!

345
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,791
[JIM]
Though, to be fair,

346
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Kiriko has some
mammoth mammaries herself.

347
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,416
Huh? You think that
girl's busted-ass bust

348
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,041
would best our rockin' rack
in a tit-to-tit competition?

349
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,458
[JIM]
I didn't say that.

350
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,958
I was merely proposing
hers might be larger than yours.

351
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,875
[NELSON] Ah, the sway
of her ample bosoms

352
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,708
is quite a splendid
sight to behold.

353
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,208
[JAKE] Those are some
dynamite breasts, Kiriko!

354
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,791
Okay! Enough!
Jeez, we get it!

355
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,583
Let's put her boobs
up against ours!

356
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,875
Then we can settle
once and for all

357
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,291
which of us has a better
set of sweater stuffers!

358
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,833
[EMPEROR PENGUIN]
In everyone's life,

359
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,750
there is a challenge
they must overcome.

360
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,166
Go measure Kiriko
Kiyuna's breasts

361
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,041
so we can put this
matter to rest.

362
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,666
[PENGUINS cheer]
With pleasure!

363
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,416
We'll win this battle
of the bulges easily!

364
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,291
No contest!

365
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
[SHOUMA]
You ready, Kiriko?

366
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,166
Am I ready for
what, Shouma?

367
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,625
Rock, paper, scissors!

368
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,041
Rock beats scissors!

00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,875
Oh, you sneaky rascal!

00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:46,708
Do-over.

Now to take my
victory prize.

You fill my life with
so much happiness.

I wanna sing in the streets
for everyone to hear.

You make my heart
race so fast

it's like I could win
a marathon in record time!

lovey-dovey-ness has increased,

[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasp]

for all the theatrics.

389

[JIM] We didn't come all
this way today to take

390

your precious
paramour away from you.

391

you come here for?

Sorry, Mister Ameku,

let you interfere.

So I, Miracle Penguin

Do you believe in magic?

Pick a card, any card.

[NELSON] My cards!
[DENNIS] How rude!

407
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,208
[DENNIS] Nelson was merely
trying to dazzle and amuse you!

408
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,833
Just shut up and go!

[JAKE]
You uncouth cretin!

410

If that's how you want
to proceed, so be it!

[DENNIS] Well, now that the
interloper's out of the picture,

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,291
we can appraise your bust, waist
and hip sizes, your weight,

418
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,291
as well as the color and
circumference of your areolas.

419
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,000
[laughs] I'll "accidentally"
graze your globes.

420
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,833
[JIM] I'll sneak
a discrete teat tweak.

421
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,583
[NELSON] I just wanna play
with your boobies!

422
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,500
My breasts sure are popular!

423
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,416
[KIRIKO] I don't want these
creep-wads feeling me up.

424
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,541
I've got it!

425
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,875
My boobs are all yours,

426
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,291
so have at 'em, you big,
sexy stud muffins!

427
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,458
[JIM]
Pardon?

428
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,041
[JAKE] Why isn't she
playing hard to get?

429
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,375
[DENNIS]
She's bluffing.

430
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,583
She thinks that if she
acts like a wanton harlot,

431
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,666
we'll be turned off.

432
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,041
[NELSON]
In that case...

433
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,291
[NELSON grunting]

434
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,041
Mmm, this girl has
several heaping handfuls!

435
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,958
So supple, so resilient!

436
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,791
[JAKE] Yes, yes, but are
they larger than Ritz's?

437
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,416
[KIRIKO] I don't get it.
Nothing's happening.

438
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,375
I thought if I baited
them into fondling me,

439
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,083
I'd generate some
Hi-ERO particles

440
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,833
and kick their penguin butts.

441
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,583
[JIM] She isn't putting
up any resistance!

442
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,541
[DENNIS] Huh. I guess she
really is just a wanton harlot.

443
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,166
[KIRIKO] Of course! I can only
produce Hi-ERO particles

444
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,416
when my beloved
Shouma stimulates me.

445
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,708
I'm such an idiot!
What do I do now?

446
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,833
[JIM]
Whoopsy!

447
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,458
I got a bit
preoccupied caressing her.

448
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,625
[NELSON]
That's right!

449
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,250
We still need to
measure all of her curves!

450
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,500
[DENNIS]
Good point. Allow me!

451
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,208
Don't do this!

452
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,583
[SHOUMA]
Stop!

453
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,916
[JAKE] You've awoken
from your trance already?

454
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,375
You penguin d-bags!

455
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,208
I'm not just gonna
let you treat my Kiriko

456
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,625
like some kind of sex object!

457
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,583
Special attack,
Gulliver Stick to the rescue!

458
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,541
Grabbing me with your
stick is so indecent!

459
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,041
Why would you
embarrass me like that?

460
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,416
I'm sorry, it was
the only thing I could think of!

461
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
[JIM]
Oh no!

462
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,083
The breasts are being guarded
by some sort of crotch-arm!

463
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,583
[JAKE] But that'll skew
the measurements!

464
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,291
What an underhanded trick!

465
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,666
[NELSON]
His stick won't last long.

466
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,125
Tugging himself through
his zipper will soon

467
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,041
make a mess of his pants,
rupturing the seam in two.

468
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,166
His pants can't
sustain the load!

469
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,083
No, not yet!

470
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,875
Sorry, Kirikooooo!

471
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,875
[JIM]
The Gulliver Stick is down!

472
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,291
[DENNIS]
And so are his pants!

473
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,750
[JAKE]
Now's our chance!

474
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,875
[KIRIKO gasps]

475
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,166
[DENNIS]
Marvelous!

476
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,416
[MICHAEL]
Indeed.

477
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,833
[JIM] Kiriko has a surprisingly
bountiful bosom.

478
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
[JAKE]
Now to measure it!

479
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,291
No!

480
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,291
[KIRIKO groans]
[SHOUMA grunts]

481
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,958
Oh god, Shouma!

482
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,250
Don't look at me!

483
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,166
No!

484
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,666
[JIM] Oh no, it's a
Hi-ERO particle burst!

485
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,541
Hmmph.

486
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,250
Daimidaler come here!

487
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:42,916
[JAKE]
Not again!

488
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,166
[DENNIS]
But we're unarmed!

489
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,333
Bringing in a giant robot

490
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,708
seems like overkill,
don't you think?

491
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,708
[JIM] All we wanted to do
was measure your body!

492
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,000
[SHOUMA]
Against her will!

493
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,708
[KIRIKO] Why do you want
my proportions so bad?

494
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,375
Ooh, are you buying me a dress?

495
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,625
[NELSON]
No!

496
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,041
Ritz merely wanted us
to prove scientifically

497
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,541
that she's much
prettier than you.

498
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,000
[JIM]
Isn't she adorable?

499
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,250
[JAKE]
She had some concerns,

500
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,666
but even without
collecting your data,

501
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,583
it's clear who
the winner will be.

502
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,875
[MICHAEL]
Oh yes, her breasts are

503
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,458
definitely much
larger than yours!

504
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,958
[KIRIKO]
Shouma a little help, please?

505
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,375
Uhh...

506
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,791
[KIRIKO]
Here you go!

507
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,833
[NELSON]
Look!

508
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,833
It's all of Kiriko's
measurements!

509
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,458
[KIRIKO] Just bust,
waist and hips!

510
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,416
A lady should never
reveal her weight!

511
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,333
[JAKE]
Hey! Nifty!

512
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,416
[NELSON]
Mission accomplished!

513
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,375
Now His Highness
won't have to spank us!

514
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,208
Well you got what you came for,
so get out of here!

515
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,916
[JAKE]
Thank you, Kiriko.

516
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
You are a credit to your race.

517
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,875
[NELSON] I'll show you that
magic trick next time!

518
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,708
Why'd you give in
to those weirdos?

519
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,958
Because I'm a girl.

520
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,833
And I'm not about
to let some other girl

521
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,708
claim she's prettier than me!

522
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,666
[KIRIKO] But, having
you measure me, Shouma.

523
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,500
That was kind of embarrassing.

524
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,375
[SHOUMA gulps]
Oh yeah, I can see that.

525
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,666
I'm really sorry
I had to do that to you.

526
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,083
Maybe, it might even things
out if you measure my--

527
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,000
Huh?

528
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,125
Uh, stick.

529
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,958
But only if you
want to, of course.

530
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,958
Love to!

531
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,666
[KIRIKO] 
Hey, we're back.

532
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,041
You arrogant, loathsome,
no good gutter trash!

533
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,291
[SHOUMA, KIRIKO gasp]

534
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
It's nice to see you, too,

535
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Beauty Salon Prince.

536
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,875
[MATAYOSHI] What do you
want, Penguin Emperor!

537
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,250
Whoa, so that's
the Penguin Emperor.

538
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,625
He's the emperor
of all the Penguins.

539
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,166
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
As you're no doubt aware,

540
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,208
we require a vast amount
of Hi-ERO particles.

541
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,458
Thus, we would
appreciate the cooperation

542
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,416
of the Factors you currently
have in your custody.

543
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,083
[MATAYOSHI]
Absolutely not!

544
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,458
There's no way
in Hell we'd ever let

545
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,708
the Penguin Empire have
even a single particle.

546
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,500
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
I regret to hear that.

547
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,041
We'll have no choice, then,

548
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,250
but to pursue aggressive
action immediately.

549
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,666
[MATAYOSHI] What do you
have up your sleeve?

550
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,791
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Operation New Penguin!

551
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,750
[MATAYOSHI]
Operation New Penguin?

552
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,291
What the hell is that?

553
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR giggles]
Is the suspense killing you?

554
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,000
Then allow me to elucidate.

555
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,458
This operation is
a new penguin operation!

556
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,875
[MATAYOSHI]
That elucidated nothing!

557
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,625
Yo, Kiriko! Let's finish
this once and for all

558
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,291
and see who's
the best of the breasts!

559
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,125
[BOTH gasp]
[KIRIKO] Don't you dare look!

560
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,583
Oh Dennis, please bring us

561
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,541
Kiriko's
unimpressive proportions.

562
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
[DENNIS]
Right away!

563
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,208
For you.

564
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,666
[RITZ gasps]

565
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,416
What? No! Bust 33.
Under the bust: 29.

566
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,958
You mean she's
a freakin' D-cup?

567
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,166
[DENNIS]
In case you forgot, you're a C!

568
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,208
[JIM]
Waist? 22 inches.

569
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,166
Hips? 33 inches.

570
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,250
[NELSON] Damn, that girl
got it goin' on!

571
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,208
[RITZ growls]

572
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,791
Ha! How do you like that?

573
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,291
Guess I won the battle
of the bod, beyotch!

574
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
Shut up or we will
end you, co--

575
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,375
[MATAYOSHI]
That couldn't have waited?

576
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,666
You stepped on my carefully
scripted declaration of war.

577
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,916
[JIM]
Your Highness!

578
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,250
Per your orders, we have
the device on standby!

579
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,708
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
Ah, yes, good work.

580
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,750
Penguin device, activate!

581
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,083
[JIM]
Holy guacamole!

582
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,083
[JAKE]
What the heck is that?

583
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
[PENGUIN EMPEROR laughs]

584
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,916
Rest assured,

585
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,375
I'll put your robot to
good use here, Humboldt.

586
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,041
[NARRATOR]
For the Ritz that they love

587
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,708
they would even sell
off their pornography.

588
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,875
That is the true
measure of a penguin.

589
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,666
Next episode,
"Warning! The Closed Gate."

590
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,916
Please look forward to it.
