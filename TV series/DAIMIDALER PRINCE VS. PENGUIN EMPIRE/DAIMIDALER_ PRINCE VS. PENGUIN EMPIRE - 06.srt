It was during the entrance
ceremony marking the start

of the new school year.

A beautiful face, silky hair,
and a voice as soothing

00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,541
as an industrial-size
jar of hand lotion.

10

All in all, she was
the woman of my dreams.

into her heart!

to tell her how I felt.

[BOTH gasp]

159
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,291
[SHOUMA]
Well, that was weird.

160
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,791
[KIRIKO] Maybe he couldn't
squeeze the hand brakes

161
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,166
'cause he has flippers
instead of, you know, hands.

162
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,416
[SHOUMA]
Shoulda worn a helmet.

163
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
[MICHAEL] There's more
where that came from!

164
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,000
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasp]

165
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,541
[MICHAEL] Michael!
[NELSON] Nelson!

166
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,458
[JAKE] Jake!
[JIM] Jim!

167
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,333
[DENNIS]
Dennis!

168
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,583
[BOTH gasp]

169
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,708
[PENGUINS] The penguin
commandos have arrived!

170
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,125
[DENIS]
You! Hi-ERO girl!

171
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,166
We must insist that
you come with us!

172
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,500
What could penguins
possibly want with Kiriko?

173
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,333
[JAKE] This doesn't
concern you, microphallus!

174
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,416
[SHOUMA gasps]

175
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,750
Please hand the
girl over, tiny-tool!

176
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,000
[NELSON]
Yeah, shrinky-dink!

177
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
[DENNIS] Mini-manhood!
[MICHAEL] Teeny weenie!

178
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,041
[SHOUMA]
I hate these guys!

179
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,916
Kiriko's my girlfriend
and I won't just

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,625
give her over to you!
I'll protect her!

181
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,666
[KIRIKO]
Oh, Shouma!

182
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,166
[JAKE]
My, what a brave young man.

183
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,416
Perhaps you'd like
to settle this

184
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
with a friendly competition?

185
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,875
[SHOUMA]
Whaddaya mean?

186
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,500
[JAKE] If you're triumphant,
we won't lay a flipper

187
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,916
on your little sweetheart.

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We shall duel as
gentlemen do, one-on-one.

189
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,250
All right, fine,
I accept your challenge!

190
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,375
[JAKE]
As for the terms.

191
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,416
[KIRIKO]
Huh?

192
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,000
[JAKE]
We will compare front tails!

193
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,083
[SHOUMA gasps]
I can't compete with that!

194
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,708
[NELSON] Look at that.
The ill-endowed boy is scared.

195
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,625
[DENNIS] You know, Jake,
he is but a child.

196
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,291
Perhaps you should give
him a bit of a handicap?

197
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:50,916
[JAKE]
Like so?

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,250
[PENGUINS]
Ooh!

199
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,458
[JIM] Bravo, Jake. It does
appear less intimidating

200
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,708
when it dangles.

201
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,625
Damn it, they're just
mocking me, aren't they?

202
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,625
But how can I possibly win
against his giant front tail?

203
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,625
[SHOUMA'S DAD]
Son, if you ever feel inadequate

204
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,250
in a locker room, remember this.

205
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,208
[SHOUMA gasps]
That trick my father showed me.

206
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,375
Dad. I finally need it!

207
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,041
Uh, Kiriko. Sorry, but I
need you to turn around

208
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,458
and cover up your ears for me.

209
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,291
Oh. Okay.

210
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,916
All right then, let's do this!

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,416
[JAKE]
Such confidence!

212
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,666
[SHOUMA grunts]
Now, get a load of...

213
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,375
...my Gulliver stick!

214
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,833
[NELSON] Hold on.
Did he say "Gulliver's dick"?

215
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,625
[JAKE]
Odd name for a fake penis.

216
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,791
[MICHAEL]
Does he think we're blind

217
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,791
'cause we don't have eyes?

218
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,208
[JIM]
Have you no shame?

219
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,416
[SHOUMA yells]
[KIRIKO gasps]

220
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,541
I step way outside
my comfort zone,

221
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,916
and then they mock me!

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,041
What's wrong with you?

223
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,541
What happened while
my back was turned

224
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,333
and my ears were covered?
What did you do to my boyfriend?

225
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,666
[JAKE]
We didn't do anything.

226
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,041
[KIRIKO]
This means war!

227
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,791
I'll kick all of your tails,
front and back! Shouma!

228
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458
Say something to excite me.

229
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,333
I know you're not
in the mood right now,

230
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,500
but please, just try
to make me glow!

231
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,083
They mocked my
Gulliver stick, Dad.

232
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,541
You said it would make
them think I was a big boy.

233
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,083
Not sexy.

234
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,500
[KIRIKO] If he can't
get my heart pumping,

235
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,541
I'll take matters
into my own hands.

236
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,666
[SHOUMA gasps]

237
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,833
[PENGUINS]
What?

238
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,875
Thank you, Shouma!
That's exactly what I needed!

239
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,041
I feel like I can take
on the whole world!

240
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,791
[JAKE]
So many Hi-ERO particles.

241
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,291
[KIRIKO] Kiriko Punch!

242
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,916
[KIRIKO] Kiriko Beam!
[PENGUINS groan]

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,208
Kiriko. Cutter!

244
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,375
[DENNIS] Your Hi-ERO particles
are truly impressive.

245
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,583
[KIRIKO]
That's the power of love!

246

[SHOUMA]
Oh, Kiriko.

247
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,333
I'm so happy you helped
yourself to my tongue

248
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,208
like it was a free breadstick.

00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,458
[KIRIKO giggles]
I'm glad it's complimentary!

250
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,250
[JIM] I can't bear to watch any
more of this sickening display

251
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,250
of adolescent love.

252
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,416
[NELSON]
Look to the skies instead!

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,541
Isn't it a lovely sunset?

254

Oh!

255
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,333

Oh yes, quite lovely!

256
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,916
[MICHAEL]
Lovely indeed!

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
[DENNIS] Let us frolic
in its majestic beauty!

258
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,375
[PENGUINS]
Yay!

259
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,458
My Kiriko, nothing on
Earth can get in the way

260
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,375
of our romantic love fest.

261
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,958
You're right about
that, sweetie.

262
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,208
[MATAYOSHI]
Actually, I'm afraid he is not.

263
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,500
You disappoint me, wasting
precious Hi-ERO particles

264
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,458
canoodling with some boy toy.

265
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,250
[KIRIKO]
Administrator Matayoshi?

266
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,333
How can you just show up
here and say that?

267
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,750
I don't understand!

268
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,541
Well, "canoodling" means
to engage in lustful behavior.

269
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,208
To fool around,
to play doctor, to smooch,

270
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,291
to make out, to hook up
and get busy!

271
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,875
I know what that means,
just not why you're here!

272
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,125
Hey, do you know this guy?

273
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,041
Uh, well, he's kinda,
sorta, maybe a--

274
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,791
[MATAYOSHI] Let me share
something with you, boy toy.

275
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,291
[SHOUMA]
Okay.

276
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,375
Kiriko's nipples are as pink
and perky as a piglet's ear!

277
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,875
[KIRIKO] Oh my God, why would
you ever say such a thing?

278
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,291
[MATAYOSHI]
Would you rather I call them

279
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,208
"brown and misshapen,
like a melted chocolate coin"?

280
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,208
[KIRIKO]
Don't say anything!

281
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,541
[SHOUMA]
Is he your ex?

282
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,750
[KIRIKO]
No, I swear!

283
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,000
I lead a group.

284
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,291
An elite organization
she was once part of.

285
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,583
Kazuo Matayoshi.

286
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,041
So you're like her boss?

287
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,291
Please give it a rest!

288
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
I'm trying to forget
that part of my life!

289
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,583
[MATAYOSHI]
Shut up! Miss Kiyuna.

290
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,291
Have you already forgotten
that the Penguin Empire

291
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,458
is hunting you down to get
at your Hi-ERO particles?

292
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,875
[KIRIKO gasps]

293
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,375
[KIRIKO]
But I don't...

294
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,583
I don't want this thing!

295
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,791
[MATAYOSHI]
Believe me.

296
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,458
There will come a day
when you need that.

297
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,416
So hold onto it.

298
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,458
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What happened to you?

299
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,791
[NELSON] We found a young lady
who might be a Factor,

300
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,458
but we failed to capture her.

301
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,000
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
What?

302
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,958
[DENNIS] Then we ran off and
didn't stop until we got here.

303
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,541
Except for a brief
ice cream detour.

304
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,041
[PENGUIN EMPEROR]
You were outmatched again?

305
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,625
Oh, penguins!

306
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
Hang in there!

307
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,625
[JAKE] We put up a good fight,
but it took a lot out of us.

308
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
Perhaps some rest
would serve us well.

309
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,000
[RITZ] Oh no! Jake!
Oh, she'll pay for this!

310
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,500
Nobody messes with our penguins
and gets away with it!

311
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,500
We're gonna go find
this Kiriko bitch

312
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,916
and whoop her ugly ass!

313
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,375
[PENGUIN EMPEROR] Bear in mind,
as a Factor candidate,

314
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,333
she's incredibly dangerous.

315
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,625
Ritz. Please bring the girl
back here in one piece.

316
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,541
You got it!

317
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,250
[CHIEKO]
So, it's come to my attention

318
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,916
that you began dating
Kiriko Kiyuna last month.

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,916
Well, now you gotta dump her!

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,250
[SHOUMA] I don't see how
that's any of your business.

321
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,750
[CHIEKO]
Okay.

322
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,333
Listen, there's been talk of
scrapping the recommendation

323
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,583
we were planning to send
to MIT on your behalf.

324
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,916
[SHOUMA]
What? But why?

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,708
[CHIEKO] Everyone at this
school is grossed out

326
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,500
by your nonstop public displays
of awkward affection.

327
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,125
t's like watching two
emojis trying to mate!

328
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,833
Hey! We have the feels!

329
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,958
I'm sorry if that makes a
few people uncomfortable--

330
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,916
[CHIEKO]
A few? It's everybody!

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And by the way, my raise
hinges on your success!

332
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,458
Think about how this affects me!

333
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,791
So it doesn't matter
what I want?

334
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,000
[CHIEKO]
Look, I get it.

335
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,166
You're at that age.
It's natural.

336
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,458
You just want a couple
of lady lumps to grab

337
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,875
and it makes no difference
who they're attached to,

338
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,333
so, grab onto mine.

339
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,833
[SHOUMA]
No, that's not what I want!

340
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,750
[CHIEKO]
Oh, playing hard to get?

341
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,666
Oops.

342
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,250
Why settle for bee
stings when you can

343
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,583
have the whole hive?
[SHOUMA whimpers]

344
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,416
[CHIEKO]
You can touch 'em all you want.

345
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,375
as long as you ditch Little Miss
Training Bra and study hard.

346
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,625
Get it?

347
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,958
[SHOUMA gasps]
I love Kiriko and only Kiriko!

348
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,458
And I won't break up with her,

349
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,291
no matter how many breasts
you shove in my face!

350
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,541
Wait!

351
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,041
[SHOUMA] I can't believe
I almost let Miss Chieko

352
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,583
suck me in with
her feminine wiles!

353
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm a disgusting
piece of garbage!

354
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,125
I need to apologize
to Kiriko right away!

355
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,958
I have to tell her
how I really feel!

356
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,541
I have to tell her I love her!

357
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,458
Where are you, Kiriko?

358
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,250
Uh, I think she's
in the locker room.

359
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,291
[SHOUMA]
Thank you!

360
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,958
Why are these so
hard to unclasp?

361
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,166
Kiriko I love you!

362
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,166
[KIRIKO gasps]
No!

363
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,583
[SHOUMA groans]

364
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,750
[KIRIKO]
Oh, Shouma!

365
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,833
[SHOUMA groans]

366
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,625
[KIRIKO]
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

367
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,708
Sure. Never been better.

368
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,666
Oh, you poor thing.

369
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,333
Show me where it hurts.

370
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,000
No. Really, I feel
swell right now.

371
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,000
Then again, every time
I'm near you it feels like

372
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,625
I'm swelling up with
so much happiness

373
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,333
I could just burst
at any moment.

374
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,833
That's exactly how I feel!

375
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:13,583
[KIRIKO] From now on, I'll have
Shouma's love in my life.

376
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,500
But, do I deserve it?

377
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,666
[BOTH gasp]

378
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,625
[NELSON]
So, we meet again.

379
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,625
These guys are
totally stalking us.

380
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,541
[RITZ]
Welcome to penguin school!

381
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,833
You must be Kiriko Kiyuna.

382
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't be nervous.

383
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
We're under strict
orders to bring the girl

384
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,208
who emits Hi-ERO particles,
which would be you,

385
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,916
back to the Emperor, unharmed.

386
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,625
[RITZ]
However...

387
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,916
[RITZ]
Don't mistake us not killing you

388
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,625
for us not hating your bony ass!

389
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,791
After what you did to them,
our poor little penguins

390
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,291
ran all the way home,
completely wiped out.

391
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,416
It took three whole days for
their front tails to recover!

392
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,208
And for that, we will
never forgive you, bitch!

393
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,791
Hey! There is no need
for name-calling!

394
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,666
Okay, Kiriko, use your light
and send these guys packing.

395
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,041
Yeah. Let's get my
pistons pumping!

396
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
[RITZ] Hey, what are
you guys up to?

397
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,833
[SHOUMA]
This should get you going.

398
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,333
[JAKE] These kids today!
Have they no decency?

399
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,916
[JIM]
This is a public place!

400
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,250
[RITZ] Uh. What's goin'
on over there, kids?

401
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,375
[SHOUMA, KIRIKO]
Uh.

402
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,583
Is something wrong?

403
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,041
Maybe I've gotten too
used to kissing you?

404
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,791
I don't make your
heart aflutter anymore?

405
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,666
[KIRIKO] What do we do?
What do we do?

406
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,333
I can't produce any
Hi-ERO particles!

407
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,541
[SHOUMA] Calm down,
there has to be some other way!

408
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,416
Seriously, you thought
you'd get your rocks off

409
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,875
from just a kiss? Adorable.

410
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,791
What do you mean,
"just a kiss?"

411
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,458
Yeah, how else do boys and girls

412
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,666
please each other
with their mouths?

413
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,916
[RITZ]
That's just sad.

414
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,416
As long as you're
gonna be all gross

415
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,833
and lovey-dovey in public,
you might as well do it right.

416
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,250
Nelson.

417
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,166
[NELSON]
Yes, ma'am!

418
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,708
[KIRIKO]
What are you doing?

419
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,500
[RITZ]
Sex ed class is now in session!

420
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,208
And we're gonna teach
you ripe young virgins

421
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,083
a thing or two about
a thing or two.

422
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,416
First up, the titties!

423
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,583
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasp]

424
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah. That's it, Nelson.

425
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,750
Go to town on them
all you want today.

426
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,833
[NELSON]
No prob!

427
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,208
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasp]
[RITZ] Nelson!

428
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,250
[RITZ] We said, "Go to town,"
not "Show the town!"

429
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,875
[NELSON]
I'm improvising!

430
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,125
[RITZ]
You dirty dog!

431
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,166
[JIM] Why does Nelson
get to have all the fun?

432
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,500
[DENNIS]
Let us join in, too.

433
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,208
[SHOUMA] She emits
the same light as Kiriko!

434
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,583
[RITZ] 'Kay. Stop.
[NELSON] Yes, ma'am.

435
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,625
So you see? It's all about body,
touch and skinship.

436
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,000
We do this kind of stuff
with our penguins every day

437
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,666
and it still gets
my kitty purring.

438
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,791
[RITZ] We're way past a
couple of kids who get off

439
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,333
on just a little tonsil hockey.

440
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,166
Hey! Don't you look down on us!

441
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,916
We could do that,
too, no problem!

442
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,666
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

443
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, we didn't realize
you were so advanced.

444
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,125
Well, in that case, do you
think you can handle this?

445
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,208
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasp]
[RITZ] Take a good look.

446
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,583
'Cause this is how real
grown-ups get freaky

447
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,250
with their bad selves!

448
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,291
It's called God Scrub! Boom!

449
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,125
[PENGUINS]
Oh yeah, there it is!

450
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,791
[KIRIKO, SHOUMA gasping]

451
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,333
[RITZ giggles]
You see how Nelson's squirming?

452
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,208
We'd say it feels pretty
damn good for him.

453
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,333
[NELSON]
Oh, fantastic!

454
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,708
[MICHAEL] Oh my, what
a plethora of pleasure!

455
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,041
[JAKE]
He won't last long!

456
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,625
[DENNIS]
We're so randy!

457
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,833
[RITZ]
Big finish!

458
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,083
[NELSON]
Ah-Ugh!

459
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,583
It's a handy skill to
have in your toolbox.

460
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,000
[KIRIKO]
I can't do that.

461
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,750
Wow, how pathetic.
Well playtime's over.

462
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,708
You've gotta come with us,
Miss Uptight prude!

463
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,125
[SHOUMA]
This is bad!

464
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,750
I have to figure out some
way to get Kiriko excited!

465
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,958
That's it!

466
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,125
[SHOUMA]
Kiriko.

467
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,291
I need you to trust me
and do what I say.

468
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,625
Of course!

469
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,791
Turn around and raise
your arms. Over your head.

470
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,083
Um. Like this?

471
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,416
[SHOUMA yells]

472
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,000
[KIRIKO gasps]

473
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,416
No!

474
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,458
[RITZ]
Hi-ERO particles?

475
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,666
[SHOUMA]
Yes! It worked!

476
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,041
[KIRIKO]
Shouma!

477
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,958
Uh-oh!

478
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,708
[KIRIKO]
You pervert!

479
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,458
[RITZ]
Michael!

480
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,083
Way to go! Let's
make a break for it!

481
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,708
Okay.

482
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,416
Don't let 'em escape!
We have to capture them!

483
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,416
[SHOUMA, KIRIKO panting]

484
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,083
[KIRIKO]
Shouma!

485
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,041
[RITZ] It's cute you thought
you could get away from us,

486
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,583
but as you can see,
you were wrong.

487
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,458
[KIRIKO]
Put Shouma down!

488
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,000
Very impressive. Your Hi-ERO
particles back there

489
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,625
were comparable to Kouichi's.

490
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,208
A power like yours would
definitely be a major asset

491
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,291
to the Penguin Empire. Too bad!

492
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,291
You deserve the death
penalty for attacking

493
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,666
dear Michael like that!

494
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,250
We're making it our personal
mission to destroy you!

495
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,083
[KIRIKO gasps]

496
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,916
Kiriko!

497
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,916
[KIRIKO]
Even with my Hi-ERO particles

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,416
I can't win against
a giant penguin robot.

499
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,250
But I've gotta do something.
They've got Shouma!

500
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,625
[RITZ] Hmm, it's not enough
to hurt you physically.

501
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,541
We wanna torture you
psychologically, too!

502
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,333
[KIRIKO]
What are you gonna do to him?

503
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,583
[RITZ] Oh, we are gonna
do dirty, dirty things

504
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,833
to your precious
little boyfriend.

505
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,750
[KIRIKO] Huh?
[RITZ] All kinds of things.

506
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,291
[KIRIKO] What?
[RITZ] Aww, don't worry,

507
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,458
big boy, we'll be gentle.

508
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,583
Hey! Hands off!

509
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,375
Stop it! You leave
my man alone!

510
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,833
[KIRIKO screams]

511
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,625
[RITZ]
Oh man, this is too funny!

512
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,125
You're full-on freaking
out and we love it!

513
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,500
Does this doofus really
mean that much to you?

514
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,166
[KIRIKO] So help me,
if you do that again, I swear.

515
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,708
[RITZ] You swear?
Now we gotta hear that!

516
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,375
No, bad touch! Bad touch!

517
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,041
[NELSON]
Here comes the God Scrub!

518
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,458
[JIM]
Wish that were me!

519
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,458
[DENNIS]
We are so randy!

520
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,041
Oh, Kiriko, I love you!

521
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,750
No matter what this
dirty whore does to me,

522
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:16,666
it's you that I love! You will
always be the only girl for me!

523
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,083
You sicken us.

524
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,083
[KIRIKO]
Shouma, I...

525
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,458
[SHOUMA]
Huh?

526
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,791
[KIRIKO]
There's something...

527
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,583
Something I have
to tell you, Shouma.

528
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,666
[RITZ]
Huh?

529
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,708
[SHOUMA]
Really? Right now? What is it?

530
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,583
[KIRIKO]
I've been lying to you, Shouma.

531
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,250
[SHOUMA]
Huh?

532
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,708
[KIRIKO] But I can't bear
to do it to you anymore.

533
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,791
I have to unburden myself
and tell you the truth.

534
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,500
About what?

535
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,000
In order for me
to go through life

536
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,625
passing as normal, fitting in.

537
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,083
I was always forced to
suppress this glow of mine.

538
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,833
I lived in constant fear.

539
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,083
Every day, worried that I
would finally be found out.

540
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,750
Then one day,

541
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,208
[KIRIKO]
an awkward boy appeared.

542
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,666
I couldn't believe
there was somebody

543
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,916
who could keep
my light in check.

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,375
And on top of that, this
somebody actually liked me.

545
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,000
He was loyal to me
and it was all just so--

546
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
Just so convenient.

547
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,916
[SHOUMA gasps]

548
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,083
[KIRIKO] The truth is
I started dating you

549
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,666
so I could use you.
And for that.

550
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,000
I am truly sorry.

551
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,541
[SHOUMA]
I don't--

552
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,625
You're telling me that all of
this was nothing but a lie?

553
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,666
[KIRIKO]
I hated lying to you, Shouma.

554
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,916
It killed me.

555
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,250
All I wanted was to protect you,
but I just couldn't lie anymore.

556
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,083
This sucks. But I don't care!

557
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,666
It won't change the way
that I feel about you at all!

558
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,125
[KIRIKO]
I have one more confession.

559
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,458
Huh?

560
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,833
I love you so much!

561
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,000
[KIRIKO]
You're cool and kind and smart!

562
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,500
I love the Shouma that's
such a good friend to people!

563
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,375
But I also love the
Shouma that only I know!

564
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,500
I'm totally obsessed with you.

565
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,041
I can't sleep at night 'cause
I'm only thinking of you!

566
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,333
[KIRIKO] And then even when I do
sleep, all I dream about is you!

567
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,000
In class, I think about
how when we're married,

568
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,083
my name'll be Kiriko Ameku
and I doodle it

569
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,666
over and over again.

570
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,250
Every time I look at your face,
I feel my heart stop beating.

571
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,166
I love you so much
it hurts! I love you!

572
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,041
I wanna shout it so loud that
the whole world can hear.

573
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,583
Kiriko Kiyuna is completely

574
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,208
and utterly in love
with Shouma Ameku!

575
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,083
[RITZ] Didn't you just finish
saying how you were

576
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,083
only dating this
loser to use him?

577
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,750
[KIRIKO]
Yes, at first I was.

578
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,916
But every day, I fell
more and more hopelessly

579
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,833
in love with this
wonderful, sweet boy.

580
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,458
And now I'm head
over heels for him!

581
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
I had to clear the air first.

582
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,083
I didn't want there to be
any secrets between us

583
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,375
because I want us to
be together forever!

584
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,375
[RITZ]
Ah, got it.

585
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,208
Then it should be
especially painful for you

586
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,458
to watch the love of
your life get a God Scrub

587
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,708
so intense he may
never walk again!

588
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,083
Hey, you leave my
ding-a-ling alone!

589
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,708
[KIRIKO]
I don't wanna fight,

590
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,375
and I don't wanna give
up my peaceful life.

591
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,250
But if I have to...

592
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,250
To protect Shouma...

593
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,208
[KIRIKO]
Daimidaler come here!

594
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,708
[NARRATOR] As long as
there are front tails,

595
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,208
I'm sure "it" must exist, too.
A world protected by love.

596
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:46,041
Next episode: Hurrah!
Antarctic Number 11 Appears

597
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,125
Please look forward to it.
