1
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,833
[NARRATOR] The showers on
the Tiramisu are out of order,


2
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,291
and so the crew has come
to the Cosmo Bath house.

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,916
[LIGIER] Wow. I've never
been to a bathhouse before.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,250
I'll show you
the ropes, honey.

5
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,750
Okay! You guys have fun.

6
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,083
I'll see you in a few hours.

7
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,291
[NARRATOR]
Subaru doesn't wish to be here.

8
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,708
He was dragged from his
stinky cockpit by force.

9
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,000
[SUBARU]
I don't care how stinky I get.

10
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,833
I won't let them see my nipples
just because the shower's broke!

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,541
[NARRATOR]
Subaru remains self-conscious

12
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,791
about his freakish,
unsightly nipples.

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,750
S'cuse me. You don't have any
private showers here, do you?

14
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,833
We used to, but folks would
service themselves in there.

15
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,208
They did what?

16
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,125
He means, they were punchin'
the clown in the shower.

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,791
[MEN chattering]

18
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,375
[MAN E]
Yeah, man. It was a rough ride!

19
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,625
[SUBARU] Their nipples
are all perfectly placed!

20

[SHINGO grunting]

21
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,083
[GRANDPA]
There!

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,666
[VULGAR]
Yoink! Ha, ha, ha.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,458
Hey, keep your hands
off my towel!

24
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,083
Why are you so squirrelly?

25
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,916
C'mon, let's hit the tub. Nice.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,208
[SUBARU yelps]

27
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,625
[SUBARU]
Why are you so unfamiliar

28
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,500
with the concept of delicacy?

29
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,791
Whatever, I'll just
scrub down and get out.

30
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,500
Wow, this place is
nicer than I thought.

31
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,791
[GRANDPA]
You can't get in the bath

32
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,625
until you've washed off, Shingo.

33
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,833
Sorry, but my name is Subaru.

34
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,333
[GRANDPA]
Hmm?

35
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,041
Strange, I thought you
were my grandson.

36
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,208
I wonder where he is.

37
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,083
[SUBARU] What's the deal
with that old guy?

38
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,875
[VULGAR]
Hey princess.

39
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,166
You know what the difference is
between conditioner and lube?

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,500
Dunno. Can we not talk?

41
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,000
[SUBARU] Damn,
this barely lathers at all.

42
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,083
Uh?

43
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,791
[VULGAR humming]

44
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,750
[SUBARU] Ugh, is he
really scrubbing his hair

45
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,375
with body wash?

46
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,333
[VULGAR grunting]

47
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,041
[gasps]

48
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,375
What's the deal?

49
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,541
Why're you takin' so long
to scrub up, Pee Pants?

50
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,791
Here, let me help.

51
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,000
Lieutenant. Cut it out.
I can wash myself, okay?

52
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,041
[VULGAR] Just try not
to get too worked up.

53
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,708
You're hurting me!
I have sensitive skin!

54
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,875
[VULGAR] It's not that hard,
don't be a baby.

55
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,125
[SUBARU] Does he even know
what moderation is?

56
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,041
Hey. You should really
try to eat more,

57
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,375
you're lookin' kinda scrawny.

58
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,958
[screams]

59
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,916
[SUBARU]
I'd better escape to the bath.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
[SUBARU]
Uh! It's too hot.

61
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,916
Oh, it's just right.

62
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,208
[SUBARU]
I haven't taken this much time

63
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,291
in the bath in a while.

64
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,750
[VULGAR sighs]

65
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,250
There are plenty of free baths,
why'd you get in mine?

66
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,875
Oh, did my balls displace
too much of the water?

67
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,000
I was finally starting
to feel relaxed.

68
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,791
With all due respect, this
is my special private time.

69
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,750
Aw, ya find my manly
presence distracting?

70
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,958
If ya wanna squeeze
the guns, just ask.

71
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,583
[sighs]

72
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,333
[LIGIER] You have such
youthful skin, Shigeko.

73
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,666
[SHIGERUKO]
Quit'chur flirtin'!

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,000
It won't get ya anywhere
with an old coot like me!

75
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,500
Plus your figure's better
than mine ever was.

76
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,250
Just look at'cha!

77
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,708
[SUBARU gasps]

78
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,875
[SHIGERUKO] I wouldn't mind
lettin' you marry my son.

79
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,666
[LIGIER]
That's kind, but--

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,041
[SUBARU]
Lieutenant Leroy's voice.

81
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,666
There's just one thin wall
separating me from her!

82
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,125
[SUBARU gasping]
Oh, no...

83
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,250
[VULGAR]
That you, Leroy?

84
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,250
[LIGIER]
Yep! What is it, Lieutenant?

85
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,333
Just wonderin' how the
water's feelin' on your side.

86
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,458
[LIGIER] It's probably
the same as on yours.

87
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,458
[SUBARU gasping]

88
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,041
[SUBARU]
They're all naked.

89
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,666
How can they carry on
a normal conversation?

90
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,916
[NARRATOR] Still in the
throes of adolescence,

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,875
Subaru Ichinose could not
hide his bewilderment.

92
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,750
[VULGAR sighs]
Guess I'll leave you to it.

93
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,708
[SUBARU]
Uh. Okay.

94
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,958
[VULGAR] If I stay longer,
the prunes'll turn to raisins,

95
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,916
am I right?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,208
[SUBARU]
I can relate to that.

97
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,625
[MYSTERIOUS PUBE sighs]

98
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,041
[SUBARU]
Uh. Pube?

99
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,291
But how are you
still alive? Wait.

00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,791
[SUBARU]
No. That's not him.

101
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,750
Whose pube... are you?

102
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,791
[MYSTERIOUS PUBE] It's a
pleasure to meet you, Ensign.

103
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,291
Truly. I hail from
LTJG Vulgar Hummer.

104
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,666
[SUBARU]
You do?

105
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,791
[VULGAR'S PUBE] Please forgive
my sudden intrusion.

106
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,083
It's just that there aren't
many other situations

107
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,416
where I'd get a chance
to speak to you.

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,458
So you were wanting
to talk to me?

109
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,041
Okay, what about?

110
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,333
[VULGAR'S PUBE] My progenitor
has caused you such trouble.

111
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,583
I wanted to apologize for him.

112
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,333
That's just the kind
of guy he is.

113
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm pretty much used
to it now by now.

114
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,500
I know he doesn't mean any harm.

115
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,750
[VULGAR'S PUBE] Thank you
for being so understanding.

116
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,166
He really isn't a bad person.

117
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,041
[SUBARU] It seems that pubes
have different personalities

118
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,583
than their humans.

119
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,208
Yeah, I agree.

120
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,083
He's a nuisance,
but I don't hate the guy.

121
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,458
[VULGAR'S PUBE] Deep down,
he's a gentle person

122
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,666
who's worried about the ex-wife
and son he left behind on Earth.

123
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,041
You mean he's divorced?

124
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,416
[VULGAR'S PUBE] Yes.
After weighing the advantages

125
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,541
of protecting Earth versus
protecting his family,

126
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,583
he concluded that protecting
Earth would do both.

127
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,500
[SUBARU] It doesn't really
sound like the thought

128
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,583
it out that well.

129
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,416
[VULGAR'S PUBE]
He's bad with emotions.

130
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,125
But he cares for his family,
and for the <i>Tiramisu</i> 's crew.

131
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,250
Even you.

132
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,000
I guess I'm about done bathing.

133
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:11,875
[VULGAR'S PUBE]
Ensign.

134
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,500
What's up?

135
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,333
[VULGAR'S PUBE] You won't tell
him I said all this, will you?

136
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,291
Well, if I did,
he wouldn't believe me.

137
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,250
[VULGAR'S PUBE]
I suppose not.

138
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,208
[SHIGERUKO singing]

139
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,250
[SUBARU] So that's the
face of a father, huh?

140
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,833
He's nothing like my old man.

141

[NARRATOR]
Space Age 157.

142
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,750
After learning about
Lieutenant Vulgar's past...

143
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,916
[SUBARU gasps]

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,208
[NARRATOR]
...Subaru found that his clothes

145
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,333
had been stolen by mistake.

146
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,000
Wow Grandpa! You look like
you're in the Space Force!

147
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,041
You can't! Give me back
my space suit!

148
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,708
[NARRATOR] Fearful that
he'd be unable to sortie

149
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,208
without his suit,

150
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,000
Subaru exposed his malformed
nipples... and his danglies.
