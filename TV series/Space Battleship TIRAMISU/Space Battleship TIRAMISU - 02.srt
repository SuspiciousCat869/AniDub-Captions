All units have returned to base.

Shifting to battle
readiness level 5.


3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,625
That was some good work, Subaru.

4
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,041
[SUBARU] I love the warm
embrace of my cockpit.

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,458
I'm safe here.

6
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,291
It's my sanctuary.

00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,500
But...

8
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,875
[VULGAR]
Hey, slugger.

9
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,958
Here we go...

00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,750
Quit rushin' the enemy
just to show off

00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,833
the size of your doinker.

12
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,958
[sniffs] Ah, jeez, kid you smell
like balls and failure.

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,750
I get that we're all men here,
but hygiene's still important.

14
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,458
Go sniff somebody else!

00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,833
Just messin' with ya.

16
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,500
Man, I'm gettin' pretty
ripe over here, too.

17
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,958
I'm going to talk
to the captain now!

18
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,208
[SUBARU]
Shut up!

19
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:29,083
Oh, how I long for the
solitude of my cockpit.

20
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,375
[VENTURI] Absolutely out
of the question, Ensign.

21
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,416
Don't make me discipline you
for violating the regs.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,041
But please, Captain Venturi--

23
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,041
I said no, and that's final.

24
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,250
I will not allow you to keep
a dog aboard the <i>Tiramisu</i> !

00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,625
[NARRATOR] Having forgotten
that he was in a war zone,

26
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,916
Subaru adopted a stray dog.

[barks]

28
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,833
[VENTURI] You obviously don't
know that when Space Chihuahuas

29
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,625
are exposed to oxygen
they increase in size.

30
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,375
And don't get me started
on their temperament.

31
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,750
They're vicious curs
with huge appetites.

32
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,875
That creature will eat
through everything.

33
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,500
Sir, Chibi is a gentle soul
who wouldn't harm a fly!

34
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,000
That's enough!

35
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,625
Ace pilot or not, you dare
pull one more stunt like this

36
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,541
and I'll have you up
for a court-martial!

37
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,041
Now put that space dog

38
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,875
back where you found it,
understand me?

39
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,541
Yes. Roger that.

00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,125
[SUBARU]
Dammit!

41
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,916
I ought to court-martial <i>him</i> !

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,083
I hate everything about
life on this stupid ship.

43
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,000
Sweet boy. You don't want
to be stuck here, either.

44
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,708
You need someplace comfort--

[gasps]

46
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,458
[SUBARU]
Of course! My cockpit!

47
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,166
That's the answer!

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,208
[laughs] Come on, Chibi.

49
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,625
Let's get back to the hangar.

50
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,833
[SUBARU] I will always have--no,
we will always have, my cockpit!

00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,125
Here we go, boy.

52
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,166
The Durandal will be
your home from now on.

[SUBARU grunts]
I gotcha. Don't worry.

00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,541
It's nice and
air-conditioned inside.

Here, I brought you
one of the yummy rolls

How'd you grow so fast?!

61
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,541
Dammit, the captain
was right about him.

62
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, Subaru.
What's going on in there?

63
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,916
I can't see you on the monitor.
What happened?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,583
Be advised: the Durandal's
making an emergency sortie.

I'm sorry.

[NARRATOR]
With a heavy heart,

68
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,541
Subaru ultimately decided to
follow the captain's orders

69
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,958
and put Chibi back
where he found him.

70
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,375
Don't look at me
like that, Chibi.

71
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,375
I had no choice.

he would get that big.

[NARRATOR] Sad over losing
his precious "Chibi,"

78
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,250
Subaru endured a lecture
from the mechanic

79
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,375
who installed the
D Photon Launcher,

80
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,666
a new weapon for
his next mission.

You kids are always comin'
home with critters, arent'cha?

82
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,333
I used to find roly-polies
in my little one's pockets

83
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,041
all the time. Drove me nuts.

00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
Bugs, huh?
That's different, though.

85
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,875
Stop right there!

have to tell you?

Don't touch the button on top!

Right, sorry, ma'am.

00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,083
[NARRATOR]
Her title may be "mechanic,"

90
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,791
but should be "muther."

91
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,916
The Launcher's designed

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,458
for long-distance
precision shooting,

93
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,625
so you have to make sure to
set your coordinates before

94
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,541
you fire. Now, give it another
try while I watch, okay?

95
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,416
Of course, ma'am.

96
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,000
Poor baby, you look
so nervous.

97
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,041
Well, the photon beam won't
go off yet, don't you worry.

98
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,625
I haven't hooked
the photon cable

99
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,875
up to the robot yet,
so you're fine.

100
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:52,250
Now be a man and give it
a nice, firm squeeze, m'kay?

101
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,416
Don't want the enemy
to get the drop on you.

102
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,333
Imagine how sad your poor
mama would be if you died.

103
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,791
I got a kid about your age
back on Earth, you know.

104
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,583
Sorry, your name is
Honda Shigeruko, right?

105
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,083
Call me Shigeko.

106
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:09,666
Shigeko, I'm afraid my
mother is no longer with us.

107
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,708
Huh?

108
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,375
[SUBARU]
They tell me that it happened

109
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,166
during the Second Earth Attack.

110
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,791
It was a long time ago.

111
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,583
I was too little to remember.

112
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,208
Oh, you poor boy.
How terrible for you.

113
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,583
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry. I should go.

114
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,083
[SHIGERUKO]
Hey, where're you off to?!

115
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,041
[SUBARU] I'll do my best
tomorrow, okay?

116
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,000
[SHIGERUKO]
Wait! You forgot something!

117
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,666
[CODY]
Okay, Subaru, listen up.

118
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,833
You'll only have
one chance at this.

119
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,291
They're building
a field base here.

120
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,958
Take out the control tower,
as soon as you do that,

121
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,875
Vulgar's team will attack.

122
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:42,708
Get it right.

You're the only one who--

124
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,125
Subaru. Are you listening?

125
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,500
Hey, Subaru!
Failure is not an option.

Something is very wrong here.

What's up?

129
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,458
[SUBARU] It looks like someone
went on a decorating spree.

130
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,375

Was this Shigeko's doing?

Sorry. I don't know
who's responsible.

134
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,000
But right now you need
to get your s--- together

135
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,375
and focus on that launcher.

136
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,750

I can't!

137
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,666

he missed his target.
