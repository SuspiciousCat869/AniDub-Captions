1
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,041
I'm freaking out.
Are you Isuzu or not?


2
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,458
Come with me, Subaru.


3
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,041
I'm here to take you to a world

4
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,625
that is better suited
to your needs.

5
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:58,958
[gasps]

6
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,083
[ISUZU]
I know firsthand

7
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:03,083
just how stressful
it is for you here.

8
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,333
But all of that can end today.

9
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,625
The Metus Germen is
an isolated fortress

10
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,583
far away from
suffering and idiocy.

11
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,500
But how far?

12
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,916
[ISUZU]
Does it really matter?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not like you have
any family here.

14
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:15,833
[gasps]

15
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,458
Watch this!

16
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,916
This is my mecha built with
the wisdom of the Fifth Note.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,833
Kurukeion!

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,666
Step into my cockpit and
we'll discuss this further.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,416
Let me just grab the ol'
keys and then we can--

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,458
Crap! Where the hell
did I put the keys?

21
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,500
[NARRATOR] We interrupt
this suspenseful moment

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,416
to look for something important.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,333
[ISUZU]
Hold on.

24
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,875
[SUBARU]
Uh. You need me to help?

25
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,000
[ISUZU]
Mother of Pearl.

26
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,833
If I can't find it,
we're in trouble!

27
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,833
Maybe you should try
to retrace your steps?

28
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,166
[ISUZU]
I just had it!

29
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,625
Where'd it go?

30
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,250
Who does this?
It's a little black guy.

31
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,916
Have you seen it anywhere?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,750
I didn't even know
you were alive,

33
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,666
much less that you might be
losing your things on my ship.

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,750
Ugh! There must be some dirty
thieves running around!

35
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,250
I can't believe this is
happening to me!

36
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,958
Ugh! Why does everyone
want in my cockpit?

37
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,041
This is the worst!

38
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,666
[SUBARU]
Well that seems... dramatic.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,916
[SUBARU]
Okay, take a breath.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Have you tried looking
in all the pockets?

41
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,916
It might've fallen out
when you put the bag--

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,250
Oh, please!

43
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,166
You think I don't know
the anatomy of my own bag?

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,500
Look here. Some jealous
bitch stole it! Oh.

45
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,083
Could this be the little black
thing we're looking for?

46
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,791
It was at the bottom
of your bag.

47
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,333
Hey. How 'bout that.

48
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,958
See. I knew we'd
find it eventually.

49
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,666
Team work makes the dream work!

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,833
Ya know, you've always
been good at scavenging.

51
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,166
Just like a cute
little squirrel.

52
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,333
[SUBARU]
Yep, it's him.

53
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,208
He hasn't changed.

54
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,875
[ISUZU] Are you still feeling
guilty about what happened?

55
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,125
No.

56
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,541
Okay good. 'Cause they're
just unconscious.

57
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,375
The <i>Tiramisu</i> isn't a threat
to me without you on it.

58
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, you and that tiny cockpit.

59
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,291
Great. Good to know.

60
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,666
[SUBARU] It's uncomfortably
clean in here.

61
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,166
There is absolutely
zero clutter.

62
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,708
Nice minimalist vibe.

63
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,166
Sleek. Modern.

64
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,875
Uh? What's that yellow thing?

65
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,291
Feels like a cookie tin.

66
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,958
I'd kill for a snickerdoodle.

67
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,166
[ISUZU] ...that's why I'd
check in with you so often.

68
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,125
[SUBARU]
Oh great. Letters?

69
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,666
"Dear Suzie"? What?

70
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

71
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,833
Isuzu's nickname is... Suzie?!

72
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,083
--[ISUZU] What are you doing?
--Uh. Nothing!

73
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,666
As I was saying, we are
the chosen ones.

74
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,458
You and I will end this war
together as brothers.

75
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,375
That sounds fun, but,
I still haven't--

76
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,083
[ISUZU]
Stop everything right now!

77
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,708
We have a serious problem!

78
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,375
What's going on?

79
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,416
I can't believe this.
Un-freakin'-real.

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,583
I left my eye thingy
on the <i>Tiramisu</i> !

81
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,875
[SUBARU]
Not the eye thingy!

82
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,791
Farts! I can't with this day!

83
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,708
That thing was
ridiculously expensive!

84
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,500
Seriously, it's the
fourth one I've lost!

85
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,291
[NARRATOR] It was a reunion he
never thought would happen,

86
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,500
and now, wished it hadn't.

87
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,750
[RESEARCHER 7A] Synchronization
with pilot complete.

88
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,000
Brainwaves normal.

89
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,791
So, what do you think, Subaru?

90
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,291
That new cockpit sure
looks good on you.

91
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,250
I still don't get it.

92
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,958
I feel like this might
be the third time

93
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,541
I've explained this to you.

94
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,208
You're a Chosen One who's
awakened the Universe Sense

95
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,583
and we need to
update your cockpit

96
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,458
so we can unleash
your full potential.

97
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,833
You're going to update it?

98
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,291
That's right. For now,
I want you to put

99
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,875
all of your energy
into experiencing

100
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,833
this new cockpit's power.

101
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,208
We're going to fill it
with a special liquid.

102
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,916
This will link your brainwaves
directly to your craft.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,083
All you have to do is
think and the Durandal

104
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:26,208
will move exactly
as you envision it.

105
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,541
Wow. That's awesome.

106
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,375
Damn straight! Your world
is about to change.

107
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,250
This cockpit will
become your sanctuary

108
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,125
both in reality
and in your mind!

109
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,666
Cockpit. I miss it so much.

110
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,458
[gasps]

111
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,791
[ISUZU]
Here it comes.

112
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,125
Breathe the liquid in just
like you breathe in air.

113
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,416
It'll relax your lungs and free
them from the demands of oxygen.

114
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,041
Seriously?

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nope! Can't do it!

116
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm freakin' out!
We have to stop!

117
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,291
My lungs aren't having it!

118
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,875
Uh!

119
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,958
I need to at least splash some
on my face first or something!

120
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,250
Are you kidding me?!

121
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,083
We've been at this
for an hour now!

122
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,958
Open your mouth and
suck it down! Suck it!

123
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,625
Like a straw in a milkshake!

124
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,250
Like a kid on a lollipop!

125
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,625
Throw your neck back
and swallow it!

126
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,583
[ISUZU growls]
Lieutenant Maybach!

127
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,750
Yeah?

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
[ISUZU]
Now watch and learn.

129
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,291
Maybach and the rest of my crew
have mastered this technique.

130
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,708
Everyone here has awakened
the Universe Sense like you.

131
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,791
[MAYBACH]
Hey Suba-Whatever your name is.

132
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,166
[gasps]

133
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,125
[MAYBACH laughs] Looks just
like takin' a bath, huh?

134
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,125
He can he talk when
he's underwater?

135
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,916
So you can hear him?

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,083
The liquid acts as a
form of transmitter,

137
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,750
but only for those with
the Universe Sense.

138
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,333
[SUBARU]
That's disgusting.

139
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,541
I do not want to get in
the tank after that guy.

140
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,916
Uh. Can we drain it first
and then fill it up again?

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,208
[ISUZU]
Why would I do that?

142
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,041
That's wasteful!

143
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,291
Oh. I guess you're right.

144
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,166
[SUBARU]
Disgusting, it's all cloudy

145
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,333
and full of fat guy floaties.

146
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,833
Nope! Can't do it!

147
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,250
What's your problem?

148
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,125
Are you trying to embarrass me
in front of the crew?

149
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,666
Y'know what? You get in here
with all the skin-fold-lint

150
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,500
and let's see how
well you can breathe!

151
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
If you can do it, I'll do it!

152
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,041
Me? But how?

153
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,125
I can't.

154
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,541
Why not?

155
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,000
[ISUZU]
Because...

156
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,875
...I'm not like you, okay?

157
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,833
I'm the only one here
who hasn't awakened!

158
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,125
I've never done it before!

159
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,458
Huh?

160
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,541
[ISUZU] I'm just normal!
I don't have nine senses!

161
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,458
Well, we don't exactly know
that to be true, yet.

162
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,458
Captain Suzie is a special case.

163
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,958
That's true.

164
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,000
It may be that Captain Suzie
just hasn't realized it yet.

165
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,625
I think since he's got family
here for emotional support,

166
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,000
it might be a good time for
us to finally test it out!

167
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,916
[ISUZU] C'mon guys!
I haven't awakened yet!

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
Let's get these clothes off you!

169
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,416
Hey! Cut that out!
Who's got my eye thingy?

170
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,916
[RESEARCHER 7A]
Look at those abs of steel!

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,583
[SUBARU] So this is how my
brother is around his friends.

172
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,000
[NARRATOR] Subaru couldn't
quite put into words

173
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,708
what he was feeling
in that moment.

174
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,791
But he knew something
was, well, strange.

175
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,750
[ISUZU]
...my brother is watching!

176
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,916
Wait, maybe he likes to.
