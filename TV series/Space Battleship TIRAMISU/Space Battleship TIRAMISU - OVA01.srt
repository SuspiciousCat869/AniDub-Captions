00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,041
[NARRATOR]
Metus Captain Isuzu,


2
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,625
who also happens to
be Subaru's brother,


3
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,375
has infiltrated the <i>Tiramisu</i>

4
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,625
under the guise of a Durandal
operator named "Cody."

5
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,000
His goal is to get
closer to Subaru

6
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,333
and monitor the awakening
of his Universe Sense.

7
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,583
[ISUZU sighs]

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,583
Oh, man. I can't believe
they're still fooled!

9
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,833
See that, through the screen

10
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,333
nobody will ever
know the difference.

11
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,041
Just gotta get the lighting
right and you'll be golden.

12
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,083
That Maybach really makes you
feel like you're in good hands.

13
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,000
Grubby, disgusting hands, but...

14
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,333
[beeping]

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,166
How's it goin'? Was I right?

16
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,875
All is well. No sign
of intelligent life

17
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,041
in the Earth Union,
if you know what I mean.

18
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,958
Just remember what
we talked about.

19
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,583
Don't let them find you out
or we're all screwed.

20
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,875
[ISUZU]
Yeah, I know.

21
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,125
[SUBARU] Cody, come in!
I've got a problem!

22
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,916
[ISUZU]
Well, showtime.

23
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,333
What is it, Subaru?
Your breathing's increased.

24
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,333
Check my oxygen reserves.

25
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,541
Huh. Looks like they're
over 80% full.

26
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,583
I don't see an issue.

27
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,125
[ISUZU] Crap! I was looking
at my video game!

28
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,333
Wait, scratch that!

29
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,041
What's wrong?
You okay, Soob?

30
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,833
This can't be...

31
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,125
[ISUZU]
Did he really run out of oxygen?

32
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,708
But the level's fine on this
screen too, what gives?

33
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,625
Something with
the Durandal maybe?

34
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,875
It doesn't make sense,
why would he be--

35
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,875
Don't have a diva fit if
communication cuts off.

36
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,416
That happens all the
time in battle zones.

37
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,583
[ISUZU]
Does it though?

38
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,166
'Cause Subaru's bed wetting
kinda sounded like it's rare.

39
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,875
He should read this book.

40
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,458
Need to calm down a pilot who's
about to piss his spacesuit?

41
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,166
No matter how bad things may be

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,333
the magic words are
always "no problem."

43
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:43,541
Hearing that from a person they
trust can make anybody relax.

44
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,083
[ISUZU]
Oh! I said that!

45
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,541
Maybach's advice is so good,

46
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,333
I followed it without
thinking about it.

47
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,791
[ISUZU]
Heh!

48
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,083
[ISUZU] So, today's
Option A is pork skewers.

49
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,083
Ah. Lookin' good, secret sauce.

50
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,041
[ISUZU] Everything else
here is a space tragedy

51
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,291
but Food Staff is killing it.

52
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,250
Just like Earth food.

53
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,125
Did you really just
double-dip?

54
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,250
What? No, who does that?

55
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,750
Well, I thought only Subaru did,

56
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,041
but it looks like you
proved me wrong.

57
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,458
Bunch of animals.

58
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,416
[ISUZU]
Blood is thicker than sauce!

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,083
[NARRATOR] Isuzu was oddly
thrilled that someone had

60
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,166
noticed a similarity between
him and his brother.

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,916
[SUBARU] Cody!
Something is very wrong here.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,333
[ISUZU]
What's up?

63
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,875
[ISUZU]
Is his life in danger?

64
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,750
[SUBARU] It looks like someone
went on a decorating spree.

65
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,625
My cockpit has been violated!

66
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,791
Tell me. Was this
Shigeko's doing?

67
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,125
[ISUZU] Who knew he was
so high-maintenance?

68
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,708
Sorry. I don't know
who's responsible.

69
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,541
But right now you need
to get your s--- together

70
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,500
and focus on that launcher.

71
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,875
[SUBARU]
I can't!

72
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,708
Not when someone reorganized
without my permission.

73
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,250
My name is written on my helmet!

74
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,458
[ISUZU] When did you grow up
to be such a pain in the ass?

75
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,500
[ISUZU]
Uh. Subaru, it's time.

76
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:08,250
How could you do this to me?
The cockpit is my sanctuary!

77
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:12,625
Shigeko!

78
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,541
[NARRATOR]
In year Space Age 0156 Subaru

79
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,250
was so emotionally distraught
he missed his target.

80
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,750
[ISUZU]
Run. Now! Get outta there!

81
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,250
[NARRATOR]
As Cody,

82
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,958
Isuzu continued to support
Subaru both on and off the job.

83
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,541
Tending to his
brother's many crises

84
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,791
to gradually gain his trust.

85
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,000
[sighs]

[beeping]

87
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,166
Hey, Maybach. Something wrong?

88
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,416
Woo, sorry to catch
you in your jam jams.

89
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,458
We need you to grab a sample
from your brother, "Ebenezer."

90
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,041
Really? You mean you've
gotten that far?

91
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,458
Uh-huh. We've been plannin'
to do a little somethin'

92
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,416
special for you, Captain Suzie.

93
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,208
Came out even better
than we expected!

94
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,000
Aw, you shouldn't have!

95
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,458
You're doin' well,
don't ef it up.

96
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,916
A sample from Subaru, huh?

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,291
I know just what to do.

98
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,666
[SHIGERUKO yawns]

99
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,666
[ISUZU gasps]

100
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,708
It's passed your
bedtime, Subaru.

101
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,791
Why're you still up?

102
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,708
Uh, well, I...
I'm glad you asked!

103
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,166
I had to pee!

104
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,000
But, I'm going back to my
precious cockpit right now!

105
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,708
[SHIGERUKO]
What's with the stupid patch?

106
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,750
Ya got the pink eye?

107
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,125
[ISUZU]
Pink eye? Eww!

108
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,208
N-No there's a normal,
non-sketchy reason.

109
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,416
Just dust in my eye!

110
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
[SHIGERUKO]
Bless your heart.

111
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,958
I suggest you put
in some eye drops

112
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,250
and stop rubbin' your eyes
after ya make boom boom.

113
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,750
There's some over on the egg
shelf if you need 'em.

114
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,458
[ISUZU sighs]

115
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,541
[ISUZU] Wait, did she just
say they keep the eyedrops

116
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,666
on the egg shelf?
Is that a thing?

117
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,708
[ISUZU]
When I look at him up close

118
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,875
I can see how big he's grown.

119
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,125
Uh?

120
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,833
[ISUZU] Hey! I lost that
toy when I was little!

121
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,625
He had it all this time?

122
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh well, at least you
took good care of him.

123
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,875
I'll let you hold
onto him for a while.

[music continues]

127
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
[ISUZU]
Crap!

128
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,791
[SUBARU]
Help! A space ghost got me!

129
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,333
[NARRATOR] Subaru cried
"ghost" to everyone on the ship,

130
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,291
but no one took him seriously.

131
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,750
This caused him to spend
more and more time

132
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,125
confined to his
beloved cockpit.

133
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,875
This sucks, Cody. They all
think I'm an idiot now.

134
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,458
It's okay, Subaru. I believe
your space ghost story.

135
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,458
[NARRATOR] Having caused
Subaru's humiliation,

136
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,625
Isuzu almost felt a tinge
of guilt. But...

137
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,500
[ISUZU] Maybe you shouldn't
have kidnapped Mr. Robot,

138
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,500
dumb jerk-face.
