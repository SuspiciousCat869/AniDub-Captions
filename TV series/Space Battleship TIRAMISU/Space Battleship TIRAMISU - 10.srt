00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,916
[RESEARCHER 10A]
Crap! I think we lost him!

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,708
[RESEARCHER 10B] Never seen
anyone move like that!

4
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,875
[RESEARCHER 10C] He was
like a space spider monkey!

5
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,083
[ISUZU]
The copy is complete.

6
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,583
And you finished it
in just two hours.

7
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,708
[FODEN]
Impressive, huh?

8
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,416
We didn't think we'd
have enough paint.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,625
[SUBARU B grunts]

10
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,750
Finding enough to keep
you busy out there?

11
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:15,416
You know, your timing couldn't
be more perfect, Subaru B.

12
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,916
I've got a little
surprise for you.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,958
[ISUZU]
He appears to be stabilized.

14
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,000
This dark craft is
made to compliment

15
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,250
your insanely high
Universe level.

16
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,541
It's Durandal Zwei
and it's all for you.

17
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,500
We call it the Black Demon.

18
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,750
[SUBARU B]
A mecha that's all mine?

19
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,083
[ISUZU]
That's right.

20
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,416
The better to defeat your
copy with, my dear. Uh?!

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,291
[SUBARU B]
My own mecha.

22
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,708
To defeat my copy.

23
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,708
[ISUZU]
Whoa. Where are you going?

24
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,125
Just hold the phone!
That one's mine!

25
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,500
Yours is the shiny black
demon thing over there.

26
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:55,208
[SUBARU B growls]
No! I hate black things!

27
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,541
Uh, 'kay. Let's start over.

28
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,625
Everyone take a deep
breath, for real.

29
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,083
I used to feel the same way,
because you could see dirt

30
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,791
so much easier.
But it turns out,

31
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,041
white actually
gets way filthier.

32
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,416
And so... [yelps]

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,375
Uh! Oh, you like my eye thingy?

34
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:15,416
If you pilot the black demon,
I'll give it to you. Eh?

35
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,625
[SUBARU B laughing]

36
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,208
[ISUZU] You don't wanna
get too far ahead.

37
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,291
Make sure you're
staying close. Uh--!

38
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,000
[ISUZU] He's like a
mutant clone of Subaru.

39
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,333
Highly unstable,

40
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,375
but his Universe values
are much greater.

41
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,916
[SUBARU B laughing]

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,833
[ISUZU] All right Brother Soob,
let's settle this, shall we?

43
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,458
[ISUZU]
Kerukeion: Griffin mode!

44
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,583
[ISUZU] Ah! What the hell
is wrong with you?

45
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,208
[SUBARU B laughing]

46
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,833
[ISUZU]
Stop it!

47
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,333
Hey!

48
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,500
Griffin Mode does not mean ride
me like a mechanical bull!

49
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,333
[SUBARU B growling]

[computer pings]

51
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,291
[SUBARU B] There it is!
The white one! I found you!

52
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,958
[SUBARU B]
I want white one!

53
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,791
Is that a black Durandal?

54
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,541
[PAC2-AR]
It's heading right toward us!

55
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,000
Get ready! You'll have to fight!

56
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,000
[SUBARU yells]

57
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,291
[SUBARU]
It's fast!

58
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,541
[ISUZU]
Do you see this?

59
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,833
This happened when you decided
to start a space rodeo!

60
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,708
The jaw line is all jacked now!

61
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,666
C'mon, we're going back!

62
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,500
[SUBARU]
What the...

63
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,083
Why did Isuzu come out here?

64
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,458
[PAC2-AR] I don't want
it to get weird, but,

65
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,750
that black Durandal
is stronger than yours.

66
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,541
Also. I'm pretty sure it's
enhanced with Metus Technology.

67
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,083
Makes sense as to
why it was so fast.

68
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,916
[PAC2-AR]
But these new HMV parts

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,708
will let you fight on a
more level playing field!

70
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,041
Load me up! I'm gonna
destroy that black mecha!

71
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,875
Wait and see!

72
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,291
Just clear me for
launch, PAC2-AR!

73
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,750
[PAC2-AR]
Poor Subaru.

74
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,375
He's seems to blame himself

75
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,500
for the loss of his
poor follicle friend.

76
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,625
[SUBARU] At least the Cockpit
will never leave me!

77
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,458
It's because these
sad battles won't end

78
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,500
that we're all still... sad.

79
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,166
But not today.
Today, I end this war!

80
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,500
[PAC2-AR] Rate of speed is
currently 12 G's!

82
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,958
[SUBARU grunts] There's Isuzu

duty, or a sense of rage...

00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,333
[COP 10A] Slow down and
pull over immediately.

00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,916
Yes, you, in the
white mobile unit!

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,541
[SUBARU]
Is this some kind of speed trap?

87
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,250
[NARRATOR] ...Subaru broke
the law that day.

88
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,875
[SUBARU]
Great, here he comes.

89
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,958
[COP 10A]
Union Space Police.

90
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,583
I need you to roll down
your window, please.

91
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,666
[SUBARU]
Uh. Hi.

92
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,166
What seems to be the problem?

93
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,750
[COP 10A]
Gotta make boom boom?

94
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,333
Goin' pretty fast there.

95
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,833
Caught ya with
the ol' speed gun.

96
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,958
They got cameras now.
Look at that quality.

97
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,916
I'm gonna need to
see your license.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,791
Right...

99
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,875
[SUBARU]
Gross.

100
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,833
My face looks terrible
under G-force.

101
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,625
[COP 10A] Why don't you
just step out of the mecha

102
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,958
and follow me.

103
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,833
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,583
[COP 10A] Late for a hot date
or somethin', son?

105
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,291
No, sir. I was actually
on my way to stop a war.

106
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,458
Yeah...

107
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,000
Just need your signature
at the bottom

108
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,875
saying you'll pay the fine.

109
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,958
[SUBARU]
Ugh. Eighteen thousand?

110
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,125
Well there go my fun-time funds.

111
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,333
[sighs]

112
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,291
What's that?

113
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,833
Do I smell a little somethin'?

114
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,166
Huh? I would never drink
before a big sortie.

115
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,083
Plus, I'm underage.

116
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,416
[SUBARU] He better not
mean those stupid

117
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,916
saké pickled veggies in
my catered lunch box!

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,833
I ate freakin' all of them!

119
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,500
Here. Take this thing and
breathe into the straw.

120
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,750
[SUBARU]
Fine...

121
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,500
[SUBARU] Great, Subaru.
Way to ruin your life!

122
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,041
[SUBARU gasping]

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,833
[SUBARU]
It's the enemy!

124
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,875
Hey, sir?

125
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,583
He must be unconscious.

126
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,625
What now? Do I just
use this thing to fight?

127
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,583
[gasps] Perfect!

128
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,625
[SUBARU]
Now I'm the law.

129
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,541
And I'm going to end this war!

130
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,416
[SUBARU] I need something
that'll block the enemy's saber.

131
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,125
Oh! What's that?

132
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,958
[SUBARU]
A people pusher?

133
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,875
No you don't!

134
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,833
[NARRATOR] The people pusher
is used by space authorities

135
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,583
to apprehend someone
from a safe distance.

136
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,333
Usually, by pinning
them against a wall.

137
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,208
However, in space,
there is no wall.

Space Age 0157.

139
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,375
Not only did Subaru have to pay
a hefty fine for speeding,

140
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,041
he also spent almost 40 minutes
searching for a suitable wall.

141
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,208
[SUBARU] Where the hell
is the damn wall?!
