00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,708
[NARRATOR] After a number
of hellacious battles


2
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,208
in who-knows-where,
with who-knows-what,


3
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,583
the Durandal was finally showing
signs of exhaustion.


4
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,291
As was its pilot,
Subaru Ichinose.

5
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,583
[SHIGERUKO]
Nope. Doesn't look good!

6
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,916
It gets rollin'
and then just stops.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,083
[PAC2-AR] Do you still think
it's the fusion engine?

8
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,333
Damn straight.

9
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,541
It's so unstable
it needs therapy.

10
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,833
There's nothin' more
I can do for it.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,000
[PAC2-AR] Should we plan
a memorial service?

12
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,166
No, not yet.

13
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,333
I need to chat with
the developer first.

14
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,791
Seriously?

15
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,083
[SUBARU]
That would be my dad.

16
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,125
[SUBARU]
Heh! There!

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,250
[ISUZU] Uh! Who said you
could put my sticker there?!

18
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,000
Dad's so gonna murder you.

19
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,750
Dad's busy researching!

20
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,416
He's not even payin'
attention to us.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,875
He won't notice.

22
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,000
[SOICHIRO]
We can't just stand by

23
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,208
waiting for Grand Mars's wisdom.

24
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,833
We need to find a way
to surpass it somehow.

25
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,708
[SUBARU laughs]

26
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,666
[sighs] Huh? What?!

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,708
No way!

28
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,125
Subaru, you're the worst!

29
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,666
You wasted one of the most
rarest stickers possible!

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,791
I had to get like a million
packs to find this one!

31
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,166
Oh. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,791
From now on keep
your peter clamps

33
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,083
off my things unless you ask!

34
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,875
How the hell did those two
get up here this time?

35
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,416
Hey! You two better
cool it up there!

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,791
You're doing it wrong.

37
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,375
You're supposed to peel
it from the edge first.

38
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,625
[SOICHIRO screaming]

39
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,708
[SUBARU]
See? You got it!

40
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,166
[ISUZU groans]
It's all floppy.

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,833
Put it back on the paper.

42
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,708
[SOICHIRO groaning]

43
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,750
What's your deal?
You're always messing stuff up.

44
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,833
It's like you just want
Dad to get mad at me.

45
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,458
If he kills me because of you,
I'll never speak to you again.

46
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,333
[SUBARU grunts]

47
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,791
[screams]

48
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,625
[SOICHIRO screaming]

49
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,541
[BOTH groan]

50
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,125
[RESEARCHER 12A] What happened?!
Are you okay? Talk to me!

51
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,333
[RESEARCHER 12B]
Isuzu! You need some help...

52
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,500
So that's a cockpit? So cool!

53
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,625
[SUBARU] When the Durandal
and I are together,

54
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,333
we can defeat anyone.

55
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,416
No! Wait!

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,333
Durandal, please!

57
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,416
Can't we talk about this?!

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,208
Wait, where are you going?!

59
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,458
We have to sortie!
Don't leave!

60
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,416
You're the only one
who understands.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,291
Please don't leave,
just hold me.

62
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,666
[grunts] Durandal, no!

63
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,041
What the heck?!

64
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,875
[PAC2-AR] That dark Durandal
knock-off is attacking!

65
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,083
[SUBARU]
Dammit!

66
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,791
Whaddaya think you're doing?
It's not fixed!

67
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,833
So what?! It still kinda
functions, doesn't it?

68
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,041
I guess.

69
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,708
If you're okay with
the engine cutting out

70
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
when you're fightin'!

71
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,958
Don't be an idiot. Come with
me, I'll give you the spare.

72
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,791
A spare? Since when?

73
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,416
[SHIGERUKO]
He's seen better days for sure,

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,291
but I kept him around for
exactly these kinds of pickles.

75
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,666
[SUBARU]
You gotta be kidding.

76
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,541
They still have one of these?

77
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,916
Nothing about that thing
says, "space boss"!

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,708
[NARRATOR] Subaru's space image
was important to him,

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,666
and piloting the reserve
robot was a mini tragedy.

80
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,708
[SHIGERUKO]
You're gonna thank me later!

81
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,750
[SUBARU]
We'll see about that.

82
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,875
How 'bout giving me somethin'

83
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,541
that won't shatter
during an attack?

84
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,125
Quit cryin'!

85
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,708
It's reinforced glass like the
kind they use on helicopters!

86
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,125
She cannot be serious,
ugh, helicopter glass...

87
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,208
[gasps]

88
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,208
[SUBARU] Gross! It smells like
sweat, oil, and rotted beans.

89
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,541
Like the dirty whites I
used to chase Isuzu with!

90
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,750
[SUBARU] It's fine, I'll just
try breathing through my mouth.

91
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,916
What the hell is--?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,875
Is that a dream catcher?

93
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,375
[SUBARU screams]
Then the handle's all sticky.

94
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,708
What kind of animal was
piloting this thing?!

95
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,541
I can't do it!
It's freakin' brutal in there!

96
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,791
Could you go to the Durandal
and get me wet wipes,

97
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,250
air freshener, and a candle?

98
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,250
[VULGAR]
I did not just hear that!

99
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,125
The only thing
getting wiped is you!

100
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,083
This is how it's done
in a man's world.

101
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,416
You don't get to
decorate this one

102
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,291
with all your dainty
knickknacks!

103
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,791
[SUBARU] I can do that
and still be a man.

104
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,416
[VULGAR]
I'll fight the copy robot.

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,666
You put your big boy pants on
and back me up... in this!

106
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,708
[SUBARU]
All right, fine.

107
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,166
You wanna see a man?

108
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,083
[screams]

109
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,291
[SUBARU] I love the smell
of sweat and rust!

110
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,833
And this pull starter is
giving me life right now!

111
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,041
Because I am a man!

112
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,375
[SUBARU]
Got it!

113
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,875
[music plays]

114
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,625
[SUBARU gasps] There is no
reason for it to be that loud!

115
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,958
Who blasts yacht rock
during a sortie?

116
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,125
Hey, Princess, are you there?

117
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,500
[VULGAR] I'm out here toying
with the robo-roach.

118
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,500
But I'm getting kinda bored.

119
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,541
I'm gonna lead it to you.

120
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,791
[VULGAR] See if you can handle
the D Photon Launcher.

121
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,916
It's one of those things
that should be easy to do

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
if you're a man.

123
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,708
So if you fail,
we'll know your secret.

124
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,291
I got it.

125
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,875
[SUBARU]
Except, I can't lift anything,

126
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,708
'cause the genius who built
this gave me drills for hands.

127
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,208
But that's fine--
because I'm a hero!

128
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,666
Where the hell is my scope?

129
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
Just great!

130
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,083
I got this. I'm a man.
It's easy.

131
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:40,583
[SUBARU grunting]

132
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,083
So gross!

133
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,416
Why does everything
in here smell like ass?!

134
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,708
Oh! Is that someone's
half eaten fish snack

135
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,125
on top of a crusty leaf?

[SUBARU gasps]
Ya know what?

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,458
Screw you, Previous Pilot!

138
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,666
I hate you so much!

Space Age 0157.

140
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,208
As Vulgar was
struggling to escape,

141
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,166
Lieutenant Leroy heard his cries

142
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,291
and she rushed to
the scene to help.
