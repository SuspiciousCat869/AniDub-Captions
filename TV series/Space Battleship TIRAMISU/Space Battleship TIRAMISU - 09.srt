1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,666
[SHIGERUKO] Here comes
Mamma to save the day!


2
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,458
Someone needs to
give me a raise.

3
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,708
I went lookin' everywhere
for this thing.

4
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,583
Ya know where I found it?

5
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,416
Subaru's cockpit!

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,125
[SUBARU]
You gotta be kidding me!

7
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,208
[PAC2-AR] Wow! I have
no idea how it got there!

8
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,208
But I am so very happy
that you found it.

9
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,916
[SUBARU] Like I want
an arm in my cockpit.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It was all fisted up and shoved
up underneath your seat.

11
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,541
[PAC2-AR] Thank goodness I don't
have to cancel my credit card!

12
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,083
Okay, back up.
I did not take her arm!

13
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,208
You son of a bitch.

14
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,250
So you want to just
cruise back in here

15
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,291
and start stealing appendages?

16
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,833
You're a grown-ass pilot!
Stop being jealous of a machine!

17
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,416
It wasn't me.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,541
[PAC2-AR giggles]

19
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,208
PAC2-AR did this! Watch!

20
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,666
She changes when you
guys aren't looking!

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,041
She hid the arm!

22
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,041
[PAC2-AR] You're hurting me!
Beep beep! Please stop!

23
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:46,875
Beep boop beep!

24
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,125
Get off her, Pee Pants!

25
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,958
No means no, Subaru! Let go!

26
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,416
[PAC2-AR]
Stop choking me. Beep boop!

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,791
[SUBARU]
Just a darn minute!

28
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
She's got a personality
adjustment switch?

29
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,875
And it's on Maximum Evil!

30
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,708
All I have to do is move
the switch and she'll be nice!

31
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,041
Put the robot down,
you little freak.

32
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,666
It's startin' to get real weird.

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,208
[PAC2-AR] I apologize for
upsetting you, Mr. Subaru.

34
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,500
Please tell me what
I did to deserve this!

35
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,958
You need a new attitude!

36
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,541
And I'm gonna give it to you!

37
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,250
And then you're going to tell
the truth about what you did!

38
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,541
Got that?

39
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,750
[SUBARU]
Aw, crap!

40
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,791
The freakin' switch is rusted!

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,166
[SUBARU]
Oh come on, move!

42
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,750
Someone needs to return
this crap the manufacturer!

43
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,208
"Bike Mode"? That'll work!

44
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,916
[PAC2-AR]
Now functioning in Bike Mode.

45
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,333
[SUBARU]
Be right back! I need a minute!

46
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,375
[LIGIER]
Where are you going?!

47
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,000
[VULGAR]
Wait. Don't break her!

48
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,208
I'm gonna find your box

49
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,000
then stuff you in it
like a metal pretzel.

50
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,333
[PAC2-AR]
Ouch! Ouch! Okay I get it! Ouch!

51
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,250
[SUBARU]
There's gotta be a return slip.

52
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,875
As soon as I fill
it out, she's gone!

53
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,500
[SUBARU]
Where's the damn box?

54
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,375
[PAC2-AR]
On the top shelf in the closet.

55
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,958
You know, you should
really throw away

56
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,333
some of these old game boxes

57
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,916
before you end up on one
of those hoarding shows

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Shut up.

59
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,708
Here it is.

60
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,833
[gasps]

61
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,583
[SUBARU]
You're discounted?! Of course!

62
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,583
Why wouldn't you be one
of those shady no manual,

63
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,625
no warranty, dollar store,
"as is" robo-knock offs!

64
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,166
Damn it!

65
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,708
That means I'm not
allowed to return you!

66
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,291
You cheap bastards!

67
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,833
[NARRATOR] Subaru ended up not
needing to send PAC2-AR back,

68
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:33,208
a security camera later revealed
the truth about her actions.

69
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,416
Shigeruko permanently set the
personality to Maximum Good,

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,916
and PAC2-AR finally
became the Assist-a-bot

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,125
of everyone's dreams.

72
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,416
[PAC2-AR]
Great work, Subaru!

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,625
You've wiped out every
enemy craft in this sector

74
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,125
and in record time!

75
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,083
Aw, thank you, PAC2-AR!

76
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,958
My brother-- I mean,

77
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,750
Cody, would be very pleased
with the job you're doing.

78
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,458
[PAC2-AR] I'm happy I could
be of service, "Mr. Soob."

79
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,708
[SUBARU] Guess this means
Isuzu's not coming.

80
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,208
--Figures.
--[beeping]

81
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,791
[PAC2-AR]
Incoming orders.

82
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,541
The <i>Tiramisu</i> wants us to wait
here for Vulgar's team.

83
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,500
[SUBARU] Well, shoot! Bring up
the next episode, then!

84
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,375
[PAC2-AR]
Copy!

85
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,500
Downloaded and ready, sir!

00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
[moans]

87
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,000
[PAC2-AR] I'm so happy to be
sharing quality bonding time,

88
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,083
let's talk about feelings--

89
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,000
[SUBARU]
Shut it! Zombies are happening.

90
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,416
There's the man! Get it, Dave!

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,750
No one else handles a Chinese
broadsword like that,

92
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,125
and he's so European.

93
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,625
[PAC2-AR]
Oh! Almost forgot!

94
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,250
Dave dies in season two!

95
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,333
It comes out of nowhere!

96
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,041
[SUBARU gasps]
Why would you say that?!

97
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,583
[PAC2-AR]
I wanted you to be prepared.

98
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,791
Shocks like those can
take you by surprise!

99
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,375
Uh.

100
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,750
Well, sometimes that's what's
fun about these kind of shows.

101
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,750
[PUBE singing]

102
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,958
[PUBE]
Oh! Hey, amigo!

103
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,083
Long time no see!

104
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,833
It's Pube!

105
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,375
[PUBE]
Yes, it is my triumphant return.

106
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,000
Uh. Wait.

107
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,625
How'd you get out
of the mint case?

108
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,500
[PUBE]
You kept me? How sweet!

109
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
And a bit weird, yes?

110
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,708
But you should know that once
we fall, another grows back.

111
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,125
Enough about that.

112
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,125
I want you to meet
someone special.

113
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,333
<i>Mi amore</i> ?

114
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,583
[PUBE'S WIFE]
Hi!

115
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,125
Oh, my husband has told
me so much about you!

116
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,166
Your... what?

117
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,875
[PUBE]
That's right. I got married!

118
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,458
[laughs] Hang on,
if she's from me, too,

119
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,791
then aren't you related?

120
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,416
[PUBE]
Let me explain...

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,166
[PAC2-AR] He sure talks
to his pubic hair a lot

122
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,166
when his Universe
Sense is activated.

123
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,041
He's registering 89.95% happier

124
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,708
talking to stray
follicles than to me.

125
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,416
I should work harder
for his attention.

126
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,750
I know!

127
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,875
I'll download full seasons
of the shows he watches!

128
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,666
Then, we can watch
them together!

129
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,125
[PUBE]
Wait! An enemy!

130
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:56,958
And he's speedy!

131
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,041
Right now?

132
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,541
I wonder. Is it my brother?

133
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,000
PAC2-AR! Uh?!

134
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,083
What's with the ad?!

135
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
I can't see where I'm going!

136
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,875
[PAC2-AR]
I'm sorry!

137
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,416
This site forces ad content
while downloading!

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,166
[SUBARU] I didn't ask you
to download anything!

[PUBE]

We gotta unplug the
back of the monitor!

141
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,916
But this is not an HDMI cable!

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,958
[PAC2-AR]
I know!

143
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,625
I have a composite input!

144
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
The video plug is
the yellow one.

145
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,500
Can you see it?

146
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,083
[PUBE]
Composite input.

147
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
Ok, by the root! Pull!

148
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416

I'm pullin'!

149
