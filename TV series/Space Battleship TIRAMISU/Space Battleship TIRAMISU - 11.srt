As you may be aware,

00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,291
protests against the military
are happening on Earth.

[VENTURI]
The Earth Union Government

4
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,583
has responded with a media-based
public image strategy.

5
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,833
Therefore, starting
sometime today,

6
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,708
a crew from StrifeTime TV will
be filming aboard our ship.

7
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,541
Welcome to Hollywood.

Sir!

10
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,791
For some bizarre reason,

11
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,166
they want to spend their
time following you.

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,875
I'm trusting you'll cooperate
and show them around.

00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,750
With all due respect, sir.

14
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,833
I think we've all got
more important things

15
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,541
we should be doing.

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,666
Like going after that
wanna-be black Durandal.

Hey, why don't you
stop being a pansy?

for the ladies.

They can film the floor
for all I care.

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll just have to end the war
before they get here.

going to love you.

You're nowhere near
as flakey as the captain said.

That's comforting!

look at the camera.

Oh, and I'll be feeding you
questions, but don't look at me.

you can, okay sport?

First off. Um...

This must be kinda like driving
an excavator amiright?

Uh, I wouldn't know.
