1
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,208
What happened to Subaru?

2
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,291
He's acting like a completely
different pilot!

3
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,166
He's probably out
changin' his diaper.

4
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,625
I tried to get him on the radio,
but he didn't say anything back.

5
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,666
[LIGIER] Maybe the Durandel's
malfunctioning.

6
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,833
Well, whatever this is, I'm sure
Honor Roll can handle it.

7
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,458
For the moment,
let's focus on the fight!

8
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,916
[LIGIER]
Roger that!

10

[NARRATOR] How did Subaru
end up with a girthy mouthful

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,541
of <i>ehomaki</i> mid battle?
Let's find out.

12
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,375
[SHIGERUKO]
Hey, Subaru! C'mere a sec.

13
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,333
Uh? Is something
the matter, Shigeko?

14
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,000
Nah, I gotta little somethin'
for ya, that's all.

15
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,875
Whipped up some of my special
<i>ehomaki</i> for Setsubun.

16
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,416
Take it, kid, you could
use a little feedin' up.

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,625
Thank you very much ma'am.

18
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:44,541
[SHIGERUKO]
Oh, there ya are! Here.

19
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,125
[SUBARU]
<i>Ehomaki</i> ...

20
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,833
It wasn't really a thing in
the part of Japan I'm from.

21
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,875
[SUBARU] Why's it smell
like pickled balls?

22
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,375
What is that?

23
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:05,041
[PAC2-AR] It's a sardine head
impaled by a holly branch!

24
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,750
Did you see who
pulled this prank?

25
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,916
[PAC2-AR] Shigeko's the one
who hung it here.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,750
Curse that woman.

27
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,875
[PAC2-AR] It's a custom
to hang these on Setsubun

28
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,541
to ward off evil spirits.

29
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,625
I'm sure she was just
worried about you, Subaru.

30
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,875
But if this putrid smell gets
infused into my cockpit

31
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,250
it'll be like hell in there.

32
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,625
[SUBARU] She also give me
this weird burrito thing.

33
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,166
[PAC2-AR] Oh, that must
be handmade <i>ehomaki</i> .

34
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,875
Eating it in one go while facing
the year's lucky direction

35
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,916
--brings good fortune!
--[beeping]

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,625
It's probably all nonsense.

37
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,125
But since she went
to all the trouble.

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,208
[PAC2-AR] My research shows
that it was made up

39
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,916
by convenience stores
to boost sales,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,791
but Subaru doesn't
need to know that.

41
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,333
[SUBARU] I should've waited
until after the battle

42
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:56,541
to bite in. Now I have to
finish it in silence!

43
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,750
Wait.

44
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,333
I also have to look in
the lucky direction!

45
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,875
[muffled] Hey, which way is
supposed to be lucky?

46
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,333
[PAC2-AR] Sorry, but I
can't understand you.

47
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,125
[PAC2-AR] Wait, given
the circumstances,

48
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,625
the answer to what he's
probably asking is--

49
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,958
[PAC2-AR]
This year's lucky direction

50
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,791
is towards this star, Subaru!

51
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,125
[SUBARU] There are a lot
of stars out here!

52
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,833
[PAC2-AR] Yeah, but this
is the brightest star of

53
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,083
the Ursa Minor,
AKA the North Star!

54
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,291
Which means you should
look south-southeast!

55
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,666
[SUBARU]
So this way. Got it!

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,250
[PAC2-AR]
And a bit to the right!

57
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,208
[SUBARU] Wait, how much is a
"bit?" I can't just eyeball it!

58
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,166
[PAC2-AR] Sorry, but
the colloquial instructions

59
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,791
given in Japan are imprecise.
The bearings used in the Chinese

60
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,791
systems are a little
more exact, but--

61
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,041
[SUBARU]
PAC2-R isn't gonna be any help.

62
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,166
I need to figure
this out myself.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,750
C'mon. Which way's lucky?

64
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,416
I'll use my universe sense!

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,875
[NARRATOR] Despite the danger
around him, Subaru focused

66
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,166
all his senses on finding
his personal lucky direction.

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,125
Okay, again with this?

68
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,708
[SUBARU] I found it!
My lucky direction!

[SUBARU grunting]

70
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,750
[SUBARU] No way. The second
half is pure seafood?

71
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right! It's what
makes my <i>ehomaki</i> special!

72
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,458
[SUBARU]
How could she?

73
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,916
Doesn't she know seafood
makes you crave soy sauce?

74
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:19,125
[SUBARU] I'll just have to
let it sink into the roll.

75
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,208
[SUBARU grunts, gasps]

76
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,916
[SUBARU] Oh, come on!
I freakin' botched the tear!

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,166
[PAC2-AR]
Uh oh, now you've done it!

78
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
[SUBARU] Why don't they
just make it so you can

79
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,000
tear them anywhere?!

80
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,583
Fine then! You wanna
play rough? Let's go!

81
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,250
[SUBARU]
Oh crap! My beautiful cockpit!

82
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,000
[PAC2-AR] If you don't clean
for the next few months

83
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,791
it could cause minor corrosion!

84
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:44,916
[SUBARU]
What now?

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,375
Don't give up, Subaru.

86
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,875
There has to be
a way out of this!

87
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,083
Hm?

88
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,291
[SUBARU] I could use
the <i>ehomaki</i> as a straw and

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,208
suck up the soy sauce!

90
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,875

[SUBARU] Gotta finish
eating this somehow.

93
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,291
I'll just stick on as
much soy sauce as I can!

94
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
[SUBARU]
One more bite and I'm there!

95
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,708

102
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,083

Is that burnt soy sauce?

00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,625
[PAC2-AR] Th-Th-The soy sauce
you spilled everywhere

104
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,458
must've slipped into a crack
in the c-c-control panel.

105
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,875
It would seem that you've
shorted the w-w-weapons system.
