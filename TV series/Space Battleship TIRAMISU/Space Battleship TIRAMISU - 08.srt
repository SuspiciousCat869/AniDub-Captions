1
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,375
[SUBARU] I had no idea people
actually lived in the fortress.


2
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,125
There aren't as many
as you might think.

3
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,958
It's mostly just the
soldier's families.

4
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,875
So we're just cruising
around the neighborhood

5
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,916
casually in your battle robot?

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,958
It's more than a robot.

7
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,333
The Kerukeion was built on
the wisdom of the Fifth Note.

8
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,625
It's an icon of
our civilization.

9
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,083
When the people see it,
they feel inspired.

10
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,458
It's our duty as important
military... guys

11
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,458
to spread reassurance and joy.

12
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,666
Make a left at the
little fruit stand.

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,250
Uh. 'Kay.

14
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,375
[NARRATOR] It was a challenge
Subaru had yet to overcome.

15
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,458
[gasps]

16
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,208
[NARRATOR] Mastering the art
of the left turn.

17
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,333
[ISUZU]
Oh, no, you didn't!

18
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,666
Get your s--- together!

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,750
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,541
I thought it would be
harder to steer!

21
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,416
But look at that.
Barely even a scratch.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,833
[screams] Look what you did,
it's all scratched to hell!

23
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,666
I knew you were doing it wrong!
Your grip was too tight!

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,458
You're being a little
dramatic right now.

25
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,125
[ISUZU] It went all
the way to the metal!

26
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,583
Subaru, you are the worst!

27
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,500
Of course it had to happen right
after my premium went up!

28
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,583
You're so ruining my
life right now!

29
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,875
Just take a breath.
It'll be okay.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,083
See? Now it's not as obvious.

31
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,916
Yeah, let's just lube it up
and that'll solve everything!

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,750
Is that gonna work for you if I
crash your pansy Durandal?

33
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,791
No. It's not. I'm sorry.

34
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,875
[ISUZU]
Compensate me.

35
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,083
Huh?

36
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,541
[ISUZU] That's the only way
to resolve this.

37
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,000
[SUBARU]
Did he say "compensate"?

38
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,708
Hang tight. I'm just gonna
borrow this for a sec!

39
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,875
[ISUZU]
You will not!

40
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,083
[SUBARU] Look! If you
move the shield higher,

41
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,958
no one can even tell
there's a scratch!

42
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,250
Pretty genius, huh?

43
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,166
Who's your favorite?

44
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,458
[ISUZU growls]

45
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,791
[SUBARU]
You want me to move it back?

46
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,916
[MAYBACH]
That's enough!

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,875
Exit the commander's
craft immediately.

48
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,708
[SUBARU]
He'd rather battle here?

49
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,083
He'd better expect some
holes in his fortress.

50
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,416
[SUBARU grunts]

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,666
[MAYBACH] Get out now
and pay for the damages!

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,500
[ISUZU]
Stop! You're making it worse!

53
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,208
I beg you! My insurance is
already through the roof.

54
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,458
I can't handle another
claim! Please!

55
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,125
Insurance? Well, damn.

56
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,125
[SUBARU]
You're worse than I thought.

57
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,166
[SUBARU]
I'm sorry!

58
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,291
[FODEN, ISUZU gasp]

59
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,166
[SUBARU]
Screw this.

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,541
I don't belong here, either!

61
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,791
Freeze! Now!

62
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,000
[ISUZU]
Hold it!

63
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,166
There's no sense in
scaring the civilians.

64
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,000
We've done enough here.

65
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,458
[ISUZU]
A biological copy of Subaru

66
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,291
is growing in the
lab as we speak.

67
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,875
We're covered.

68
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,041
It would seem that the two of us
are destined to fight after all.

69
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,708
Right, Soob?

70
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,750
[SUBARU] Looks like I finally
managed to lose them.

71
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,375
Boy, was he pissed.

72
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,416
I'm actually surprised
he's not comin' after me.

73
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,416
[SUBARU]
It makes me wonder, though.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,791
Is there anywhere in the
universe for me and Durandal?

75
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,333
[SUBARU]
I feel bad.

76
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,833
I was kind of an A-hole
to Shigeko before I left.

77
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,208
They're probably
struggling in battle.

78
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,208
I should be there to help.

79
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,750
[SUBARU]
I guess I'll go back.

80
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,583
[SUBARU] How am I going to
explain all this to them?

81
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,750
[gasps]

82
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,416
[NARRATOR] While Subaru
was literally jumping ship,

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,416
someone new was
occupying his space.

84
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,083
[SUBARU]
Is that a robot?

85
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,125
Uh. Hi?

86
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,083
[PAC2-AR]
Ah! Jumpin' spark plugs!

87
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,041
You scared me! Don't tell me!

88
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,500
You are...

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,916
[PAC2-AR]
...Mr. Subaru!

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,583
Oh, it's a situation!

91
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,958
We've got a beep bop
boop bop situation!

92
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,416
Beep-beep situation!

93
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
[SUBARU]
A "beep beep situation"?

94
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh, hey, Princess.

95
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,708
Glad you could make it.

96
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,916
Subaru Ichinose,
reporting for duty!

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,583
[LIGIER]
I see you've met our new member.

98
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,166
She joined us
while you were out.

99
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,666
She's our new bot assistant!
She's so precious.

100
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,000
[PAC2-AR]
You may call me PAC2-AR!

101
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,125
Uh... My glasses!

102
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,333
[VULGAR laughs]
Glasses?

103
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,208
Shouldn't you be
lookin' for your head?!

104
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,291
That is adorable!

105
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,416
[SHIGERUKO]
Here ya go, kiddo.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,125
A little clumsy aren't ya?

107
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,875
You make even the dumbest
things look cute!

108
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey, I'm thinking we throw our
little robot here a party later.

109
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,166
[PAC2-AR] As long as I
only drink industrial oil.

110
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,458
[CREW laughing, chattering]

111
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,166
[LIGIER]
Take care! We'll see you later!

112
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,041
[VULGAR]
Text me.

113
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,333
[SHIGERUKO]
Bye, baby!

114
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,750
[PAC2-AR] Bye-bye!
See you next time, friends!

115
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,833
[SUBARU]
Hm?

116
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,875
What's that?

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,458
[PAC2-AR]
How exhausting, am I right?

118
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,625
How do you handle it here?

119
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,666
[coughs]

120
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,375
[SUBARU]
What the hell just happened?

121
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,291
[PAC2-AR] What'd you think of
that stupid beep bop bop

122
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,916
"where's my glasses thing"
when my head fell off?

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,166
It's all an act.

124
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,375
Was I a convincing Ditz?
They eat that crap up.

125
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,833
[gasps]

126
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,250
[PAC2-AR]
What a bunch of pathetic idiots.

127
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,833
You could dump in their bed as
long as you're cute about it.

128
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,250
[SUBARU]
Uh, okay.

129
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,500
[PAC2-AR] They can't get enough
of me going "beep beep"

130
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,750
and kissing their asses all day.

131
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,291
Don't you dare breathe a
word of this, you got that?

132
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,583
[SUBARU]
What the...?

133
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,125
This robot is a sociopath!

134
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,166
[PAC2-AR] Oh, no! Something
awful has happened!

135
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,375
What?

136
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,208
What's the matter, Pac2-AR?
What happened?

137
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,458
[PAC2-AR] I just woke up from
a nap and both my wallet

138
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,500
and my right arm are missing!
Beep boop! Beep boop!

139
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,666
[VULGAR] Oh yeah look,
your whole arm's missing.

140
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,333
[LIGIER] I promise we don't have
any thieves on the ship.

141
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,916
[PAC2-AR]
It's my fault.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,208
I always keep my valuables in my
hands when I go into sleep mode.

143
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,250
Here comes Mamma
to save the day!

144
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,916
Someone needs to
give me a raise.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,208
I went lookin' everywhere
for this thing.

146
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,208
Ya know where I found it?

147
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,416
Subaru's cockpit!

148
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,958
[SUBARU]
You gotta be kidding me!

149
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,333
[PAC2-AR] Wow! I have
no idea how it got there!

150
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,250
But I am so very happy
that you found it.

151
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,541
[gasps]
