1
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,083
Robo One, ready to launch.


2
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,041
Up, up, and away!


3
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,416
Uh?


4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,916
Hey, Subaru.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,291
Daddy's coming home early
tonight to have dinner with us.

6
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,333
Really?

7
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,833
[SUBARU'S MOM]
Yep, really!

8
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,458
Oh, boy!

9
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,083
I've made lots of
rice for sushi.

10
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,041
Go put your toys away
and come help.

11
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,541
Okay! Can we also
make some <i>tamago</i> ?

12
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,250
I had a feeling you'd ask.

13
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,583
Yes, there's plenty
of eggs, just for you!

14
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,416
All right, get your brother
and tell him to come help us.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,250
Quickly!

16
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,375
'Kay!

17
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,291
[SUBARU]
Hey, we're having sushi,

18
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,666
and Mom said that
we could help!

19
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,375
That was weird.

20
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,708
Haven't dreamt of
Mother in a while.

21
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,416
Let's try this again

22
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,500
'Course it still isn't working.

23
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,000
[NARRATOR]
Subaru has been drifting

24
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,291
through space for several days.

25
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,666
He hasn't been able to
contact the <i>Tiramisu</i> .

26
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,875
[SUBARU]
I'm so not getting rescued.

27
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,541
You're chasing that
ship too far!

28
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:14,041
It's the only one out here!
Go home if you don't wanna work!

29
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,166
[VULGAR] You're gonna get
stranded, numbnuts.

30
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,500
[SUBARU]
This ends right now!

31
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,416
[gasps]

32
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,375
[alarm blares]

33
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,791
Damn it, what now?!

34
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,125
Subaru, what's going on?
You need to get back to base!

35
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,083
I'd love to, but my
engine's freakin' out!

36
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,583
[SUBARU]
It finally came.

37
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,791
The Day Vulgar Was Right.

38
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,000
I never thought the
Durandal's fusion engine

39
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,833
would turn on me like this.

40
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:47,500
Screw it. That's not
even the worst part.

41
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
[SUBARU]
What I need to figure out is...

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,291
...what the hell am I gonna
eat with all that rice?!

43
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,875
[NARRATOR]
It was every pilot's nightmare.

44
00:02:55,958 --> 00:03:00,916
Stranded in space, with a
significant lack of condiments.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,333
[SUBARU] I should've added more
variety to my emergency rations.

46
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,458
I can't just eat rice
on rice on rice

47
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,500
without some kind of side dish.

48
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,833
[microwave dings]

49
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,875
[SUBARU] Looks like the battery
power's on its last legs.

50
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,000
You may not be long for
this world, microwave.

51
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,583
[NARRATOR] Then, with no sense
of logic or real motivation,

52
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,958
Subaru decided to eat the rice
off his control lever.

53
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,125
[SUBARU]
It tastes better this way!

54
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,041
But why? I bet it's the sweat

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,000
from my hand soaking through
and leaving salt on the lever!

56
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,458
And that means...

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,708
...if I eat it directly off
my hand, it'll be perfect!

58
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,916
Holy space balls this is good!

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,041
Back-of-the-hand-rice
is where it's at!

60
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,666
I could eat this every day!

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,625
[NARRATOR] As he savored the
taste of his hand-flavored rice,

62
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,958
Subaru had a memory.

63
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,375
When his mother was alive,

64
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,166
she would put rice on the back
of her hand to taste it.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,375
I've made lots of
rice for sushi.

66
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,791
Go put your toys away
and come help.

67
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,708
[SUBARU]
That's why she did it.

68
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,583
Because it tasted
better that way.

69
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,833
Wow.

70
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,625
I can't always remember
her voice or her face,

71
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,375
but this memory is very clear.

72
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,333
[SUBARU]
Keep it together!

73
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,583
I can't get emotional right now.

74
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,375
[SUBARU] Wait. If the salt on
my hand tastes this good.

75
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,041
Then that means...

76
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,958
[SUBARU] Areas of my body
that make more movement

77
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,083
should be even tastier!

78
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,750
[SUBARU]
I was right!

79
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:54,333
Man, I'm on this like
a horse on a salt lick!

80
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,541
I bet this is where
the mouthgasms happen.

81
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,375
Damn it! I can't reach.

82
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,250
Screw you, shoulder!

83
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,625
That's fine. I have a Plan B!

84
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,416
[SUBARU]
Maybe not.

85
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,833
There's no salt
and it's not sticking.

86
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,083
Hm?

87
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,250
What if I use my helmet?

88
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,791
How'd I get to be so smart?

89
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,291
Now I just gotta
decorate it a little.

90
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,708
Lookin' good!

91
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,375
Throw a little flag on top,

92
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,791
and it's like one of
those kids meals!

93
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,125
[SUBARU]
Reminds me of when we would all

94
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,583
go out to dinner
together as a family.

95
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,333
Oh, shut up.

96
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,666
Why am I so sentimental today?

97
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,291
[SUBARU]
Let's be real.

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,416
[SUBARU]
It's still just sweaty rice.

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,666
I'm so glad there's no one
out here to see me like this.

100
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,083
Half-naked eating sweat-rice
in the shape of a helmet.

101
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,583
There's no one out here.

102
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,666
[laughing] There's no one
coming to rescue me.

103
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm so far from the <i>Tiramisu</i> no
one could even contact me

104
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,375
if they tried!

105
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,166
Well, since I'm about to die...

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,333
...may as well eat off the
saltiest part possible!

[SUBARU gasps]

108
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,375
[SUBARU]
I love my sweet cockpit.

109
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,291
I can eat inside it
any way I want.

110

Isn't that right, Momma?

all the way out there?

115
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,333
I have no idea.

116
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,458
[VULGAR] Well, I'm about to burn
through the cockpit hatch.

Please don't open the door yet!
