1
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,666
[NARRATOR]
We begin with a reunion.


2
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,125
Ace Pilot Subaru Ichinose
and his beloved Durandal


3
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,958
were together again.

4
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,916
[SUBARU]
Sweet, sweet sanctuary.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,333
I've missed it here.

6
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,000
[gasps]

7
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,875
[INTERCOM VOICE 1A] Supply
vessel <i>Ashigara</i> is now docked.

8
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,333
All crew members will have
20 minutes to visit her,

9
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,583
beginning with the pilots.

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,291
She's here.

11
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,291
[NARRATOR] Supply vessels
are scattered throughout

12
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,166
Earth Union-controlled airspace

13
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,708
spreading joy and snacks
to space crews far and wide.

14
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,833
[SUBARU]
Cockpit, you know I love you.

15
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,541
But it is snack time!

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,000
[chiming]

17
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,166
[SUBARU] Who's about to eat
a quarter of his paycheck?

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,916
This guy!

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,875
Hey, new flavor!

20
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,291
[SUBARU]
Gettin' it!

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,958
If this place had disco pants,
they'd have everything.

22
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,000
[VULGAR]
There she is!

23
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,750
You really want to
work on a food baby

24
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,166
right before you sortie?

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,791
How I choose to pleasure myself
is none of your concern.

26
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,458
And I have excellent
portion control. Ass.

27
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,416
Sure know how to use
your mouth, doncha?

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,833
Virgin School's workin'!

29
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,666
[SUBARU grunts]
Whatever.

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,041
[VULGAR sighs]
Douche.

31
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,625
[NARRATOR] As Subaru was showing
space enemies who's boss...

32
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,750
[CODY]
Get it together!

33
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,583
You're all over the place today!

34
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,083
[NARRATOR]
He was fighting even harder

35
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,041
not to wet his space suit.

36
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,583
[SUBARU] I have excellent
portion control.

37
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,791
Control, control, control.

38
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,708
[SUBARU grunts]

39
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,083
[CODY]
Subaru, do you copy?!

40
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,416
[SUBARU screams]
Dammit!

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
I need you guys to hurry
up and die already!

42
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,833
Why can't I be anyone
else but me right now?!

43
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,083
Don't pee, don't pee, don't pee!

44
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,375
What the hell is wrong with me?

45
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,708
What kind of moron loads up

46
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,708
on soda and ice cream
before a freakin' sortie?

47
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,958
No one should ever pay me!

48
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,208
All I do is eat myself
out of a job!

49
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,583
Subaru, listen! I'm trying
to help you out here!

50
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,875
[SUBARU]
Help your face... shut up...

51
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,583
Get it together, bladder.

52
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,041
We need a plan!

53
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,500
I'm halfway between ships.

54
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,916
It's game over whether I
turn back or keep going.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,875
Uh? A bottle!
Will it fit in there?

56
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,625
Wait! I'm a genius!

57
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,583
The bag!

58
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,208
I'll put this around the bottle!

59
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,625
Crap! Why is there a hole in it?

60
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,041
This is all your fault!

61
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,583
Don't look at me
in that tone of box!

62
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,666
[beeping]

63
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,666
[SUBARU gasps]
Not now!

64
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,916
Don't you move.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,375
Hold out for me, Durandal!

66
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,041
I'll just take a quick leak.

67
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,708
[SUBARU gasps]
Aw, man!

68
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,500
She'll see my lil co-pilot!

69
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,666
I have to breathe it out.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,291
I'm about to unleash the beaver.

71
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,708
I mean the dam.

72
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,208
I'll have to surrender.

73
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,458
No, screw that!

74
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,708
This is Subaru Ichinose,

75
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,500
returning to the Supply Vessel!

76
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,333
Durandal, full purge!

77
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,833
I got it!

78
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,333
Okay, here it goes.

79
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,208
No!

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,416
[SUBARU]
It's over.

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,791
I'm done for.

82
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,291
[NARRATOR]
When he reached the end,

83
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,041
Subaru was at least able to buy
a change of underpants.

84
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,333
[CODY] Hey Soob. I'm gonna need
you to head out and give Leroy,

85
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,208
Vulgar, and their
crew some backup.

86
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,833
You're about to make contact
with the fleet, okay?

87
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,291
Are you listenin' to me?

88
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,458
Do I have the option
of not listening?

89
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,666
Right.

90
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,666
I'll leave you to it.

91
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,875
[SUBARU] When was the last time
I cleaned these crevices?

92
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,833
[NARRATOR] Subaru's obsession
with his cockpit knew no bounds.

93
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,666
He loved every shiny inch of it,

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,666
and he took note of even
the smallest details.

95
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,958
[SUBARU]
Is that a pube on my stick?

96
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,375
[SUBARU gasps]

97
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,750
That's gross. Why would--

98
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,500
[PUBE]
Not so fast, Muchacho!

99
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,500
You must first answer
this question.

100
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,666
[SUBARU]
Did that pube just talk to me?!

101
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,875
This is crazy.

102
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,833
I've been holed up in
a cockpit too long.

103
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:38,041
Or maybe... I have
Universe Spaceman Powers!

104
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
[NARRATOR]
He means "The Universe Sense."

105
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:44,750
It's a rare sixth sense that
some space immigrants possess.

106
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,291
It's not unreasonable
that with his keen senses

107
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,958
and at times disturbing
concentration, he could have it.

108
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,416
[sighs] Look I just say
what they tell me...

109
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,791
[PUBE]
I must know.

110
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,541
Your favorite baseball team.

111
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,666
I'm going to guess
Giants, because, well...

112
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,750
Actually, I kinda
like the Dragons.

113
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,916
[PUBE]
<i>Ay dios mio</i> !

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,750
That was my second guess!

115
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,625
You know they changed their
colors from pink to blue, yes?

116
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,333
Everybody was upset.
But I say, so what!

117
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,416
If they are handling
the balls well,

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,250
you don't care if they
are pink or blue.

119
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,958
[SUBARU]
That's it. I can't do this.

120
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,416
[PUBE]
Enough about that.

121
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Where are you from?

122
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,416
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

123
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,166
[PUBE]
South of the border!

124
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,208
[SUBARU]
Okay, done.

125
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,041
I don't need comedy from a pube.

126
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,916
[PUBE]
Slow down, Hermano!

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,166
Not so fast!

128
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,958
Why must you assume I
have fallen from you?

129
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,708
[gasps] You didn't?

130
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,625
[PUBE]
Perhaps, yes, but perhaps no.

131
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,333
What if I was plucked
from a woman?

132
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,583
For real?

133
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,833
[PUBE]
Maybe. There is a sensual,

134
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,416
bouncy senorita on
the ship with you, yes?

135
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
You talkin' about
Lieutenant Leroy?

136
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,333
[PUBE] Why don't you come
closer and smell me?

137
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,833
See how your body reacts!

138
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,375
[laughs] No that's okay.

139
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,916
I doubt you would
be hers anyway.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,041
[PUBE]
Why not? I am very sexy! No?

141
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,583
[NARRATOR]
And just like that,

142
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,125
Subaru was sharing laughter,
feelings, and dreams.

143
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,666
He had made a new friend.

144
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,000
Tell me, ever thought about
trying one of those flat irons?

145
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,333
[PUBE]
You cannot tame this stallion.

146
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,791
[PUBE gasps]
Okay, amigo, <i>vamos</i> !

147
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,666
Back to work!

148
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,083
I am sensing heat coming close.

149
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,625
The enemy...

150
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,333
[SUBARU]
Excuse me!

151
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm trying to have a chat
with my new friend here!

152
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,208
[PUBE whistles]
<i>Muy bien</i> !

153
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,625
It's no surprise I am from
your strong, bulbous cojones!

154
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,958
Heh. Ah man, you really were
my pube this whole time.

155
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:40,250
[PUBE laughs] I gave you a
bit of a thrill, though, eh?

156
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,250
[NARRATOR] Subaru's Universe
Sense eventually went away,

157
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,833
and so did the voice
of his pubic hair.

158
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,375
But he still carries it with him
in a special place to remember.

159
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,000
Hey. You got yourself
a souvenir?

160
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,333
