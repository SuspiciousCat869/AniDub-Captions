Commencing final checklist.

[SUBARU panting]

4
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,458
[SUBARU] There's nothing more
important to me than my cockpit.

00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,250
[INTERCOM VOICE 1A] Durandal
attached to launch catapult.

6
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,166
Preparing for takeoff.

7
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,958
[SUBARU]
It makes me feel warm.

8
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,041
Like I'm back inside
my mother's womb.

9
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,875
It's the only place
in the universe

10
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,500
that I can go to be
completely alone.

11
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,041
I wanna stay here, snug in
my cockpit, for all eternity.

12
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,000
Subaru. Five hostiles.
You ready?

13
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,541
What if I say "no," Cody.

14
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,875
Would you fly out here and
shoot them down instead?

15
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,333
Let's not find out.

16
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,500
[SUBARU]
I got this.

17
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,875
Give me five, no,
make it three minutes.

18
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,208
[CODY]
And that's why you're the Ace.

19
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,166
I knew I could rely on you.

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,125
We'll launch you in two minutes.

21
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,416
Prepare for immediate contact.

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,125
Don't die, Subaru.

23
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,000
Roger that.

24
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,208
[CODY laughs]

25
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,791
[SUBARU]
So, two minutes, huh?

26
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,916
That's plenty of time...

27
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,791
...for some pre-flight pork!

28
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,208
[NARRATOR]
This fried pork cutlet

29
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,333
was more than just a snack
to Subaru Ichinose.

30
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,125
It was a symbol of comfort.

31
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,291
[VULGAR]
Me? Oh yeah, I'd bang her.

32
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:16,375
If the chick is hot, I'll jump
her and her mecha, enemy or not.

33
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,125
[SUBARU]
Kale... Kidney beans...

34
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,166
[NARRATOR] Subaru was unable
to banter with the other pilots,

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,333
who were older and
more experienced.

36
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,208
Instead, he spent his downtime

37
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,708
memorizing the nutrition
labels of space smoothies.

38
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,875
Whatcha doin there, slugger?

39
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,833
Checkin' the label to make sure
you got plenty of boner fuel?

40
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,458
Don't want you dyin' out
there a virgin, amirite.

41
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,083
Get offa me.

42
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,208
You're wrong.

43
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,958
I know I'm gonna
make it home alive.

44
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,041
[NARRATOR] To Subaru,
this meal was best alone.

45
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,458
Alone and... cockpitted?

46
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,000
Cutlet ready to la-- Uh?!

47
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,541
What a fool, I almost
forgot the sauce.

48
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,500
Here in this sacred place,

49
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,375
there's no one to criticize
me for double dipping.

50
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,875
I can do whatever
I please with you.

51
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,208
Wait, no! The breading!

52
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,291
This is the worst thing
that could possibly happen

53
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,625
in Durandal's cockpit.

54
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,666
My sanctuaries interiors
can't be coated in grease.

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,166
I've got to get to the napkins!

56
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,208
Only then will I
avoid this tragedy!

57
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,416
C'mon!

58
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,500
[SUBARU]
No, no, no, no!

[INTERCOM VOICE 1A]
Twenty seconds to takeoff.

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,583
[screams] Oh c'mon!
The cabbage too?!

61
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,666
Anything but the
reeking cabbage!

62
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,791
[INTERCOM VOICE 1A]
Catapult thrust is normal.

63
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,833
Launch is all clear.

00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,500
Wait, not yet, do you copy?!

65
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,083
There's a pork crisis!

66
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,208
[INTERCOM VOICE 1A]
Durandal, launch.

67
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:42,208
I didn't even get a single bite!

68
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,083
Nice work out there, Subaru.

69
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,208
Hostiles eliminated.
Mission accomplished.

70
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:58,041
Subaru Ichinose,
returning to home base.

71
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,500
[VULGAR] So, guys with pretty
faces have pretty asses, too.

Hey, what the hell, man,
no peeping in the shower!

74
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,916
[VULGAR] So I guess honor
students get to take their time,

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,291
even when it wastes hot water.

76
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,291
Do you have something
against privacy?

77
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,583
I don't know why you
bother coverin' up.

We're both men, right?

Unless there's somethin'
you're keeping a secret.

Subaru had always tried to hide

his misaligned nipples--

82
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,958

different directions.

I think we're done here.

[SUBARU]
Something's wrong.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,041
I'm finding it difficult
to breathe normally.

95
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,791
But this is supposed
to be my safe space.

96
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,708
Cody, come in!
I've got a problem!

97
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,958
What is it, Subaru?
Your breathing's increased.

98
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,208
Check my oxygen reserves.

99
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,208
[CODY]
Huh.

100
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,375
Looks like they're
over 80% full.

101
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,041
I don't see an issue.

102
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,708
[SUBARU]
I don't on my end, either.

103
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,083
Wait, no.

104
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,583
[NARRATOR]
In the heat of battle,


105
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,333
Subaru realized he was wearing


106
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,500
his unnecessary
t-shirt backward.


107
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,458
And inside out, as well.


108
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,041
This explains my discomfort!

109
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,500
Incoming!

110
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,375
Life and death hang
in the balance.

111
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,750
But I can't concentrate
with my shirt on my throat.

112
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,250
I had to rush getting dressed,
so I didn't realize...

113
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,500
You're to blame.

114
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,166
This is your fault!

115
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,000
Calm down, Subaru,
you've got this.

116
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,166
This is your sanctuary.
You must protect it.

117
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,916
You're the owner of this
magnificent cockpit,

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,416
and you can do anything!

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,250
Changing your shirt
while fighting is nothing!

120
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,583
Just get it done, idiot!

121
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,625
Right arm!

00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,000
Left arm!

123
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,333
And now wait until the
right moment to rip it off,

124
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,916
taking care not to stretch
the fabric as I go.

125
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,166
[SUBARU]
Now!

126
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,708
[SUBARU]
It's no good!

127
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,083
I can't get it over my helmet.

128
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,750
I... I can't see!

Dammit.

00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,041
How dare you?!

00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,125
[NARRATOR]
In this moment,

133
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,916
something deep within
Subaru snapped.

00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,875
[SUBARU] Die, die, die,
die, die, die, die.

[NARRATOR] Though unwilling
to reveal his body

to anyone in real life,

137
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,791
in his cockpit,
he let it all hang out.

138
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,375

...die!

Gotcha. On you go.

Farewell.

In year Space Age 0156,

Subaru Ichinose cast
his favorite shirt

into the vacuum of space.

145
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,958
Will this ace pilot be able
to protect planet Earth

146
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,333
better than he protected
his underwear?
