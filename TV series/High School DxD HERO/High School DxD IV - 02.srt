just so you can go
gallivanting all over Kyoto.

Come on! It wasn't my idea.

00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm going for
a school trip, you know?

but that's two entire days

00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,785
I won't be able
to get my hands on you.

Really.

And so, that's why I'm going
to fill up on you now.

You're so funny.

I meant I want to experience
your manly essence.

And in turn, I want to feel
your hands all over me.

Yeah, that sounds amazing,

19

but we shouldn't
since you're a senior.

There's no such thing as seniors
or juniors in the boudoir.

I've heard of using pillows

Kiyomizu Temple.

Oh, what about that

Oh! You mean Kinkakuji.

for you:

Even if our tour groups
are the same

we're still in totally

as I can before you leave.

from using
the Juggernaut Drive

[ISSEI] I guess
that makes sense, but...

96
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,223
There are too many
people at your house,

97
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,849
so it can be rather
difficult for me

to focus on
healing you properly.

it's called Bedroom Arts.

Hold up, can you please
define "bedroom arts."

are a necessary evil

from doing the deed
on school grounds.

that my family
is having a gathering.

we'll go before your trip.

you're interested in

134
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,314
Yes! In fact, I was hoping
to open a Norse magic school

in the Gremory domain
in the near future.

00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,028
to try and raise
a few Valkyrie devils.

00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,363
[RIAS]
Father told us.

160
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,530
How are you?

161
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,532
I hope well.
So good to see you.

162
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,702
There was no need to go
out of your way to see me,

163
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,120
but thanks.

164
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,747
This is a nice surprise!

165
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,707
If it isn't the
Ruin Princess herself

166
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,917
and the Red Dragon.

167
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,877
[RIAS]
Sairaorg!

168
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,253
I wish you would have told me

169
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,297
you were stopping
in for a visit.

170
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,256
[SIR ZECHS]
Good news is

171
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,508
he was kind enough
to bring along

172
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,969
some of that famous fruit
from the Bael domain.

173
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,887
Also, we used this opportunity

174
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,889
to discuss the details
of the Rating Game

175
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,016
you and he
will be participating in.

176
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,103
Outside of the usual
field rule requirements,

177
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,230
Sairaorg has also
requested to remove

178
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,024
any complicated rules of battle
within the Rating Game.

179
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,655
So basically, what
you're saying is that

180
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,324
you're going to allow all
of our various powers in combat?

181
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,035
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm wanting.

182
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,413
If I can't take your people on
at full strength,

183
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,872
then I have
no business claiming

184
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,749
to be the heir
of a great devil family.

185
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,045
Indeed.

186
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,880
Sairaorg, weren't you
hoping to exchange

187
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,425
‐a few blows with Issei?
‐Yes.

188
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,302
Perfect, then why don't we
set up a quick bout right now?

189
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,805
[gasps] Like right now,
right now?

190
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
[SIR ZECHS]
What are your thoughts, Rias?

191
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,017
Fine by me.

192
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,602
I mean, if the Great Devil
wishes for it,

193
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,188
then, guess
I can't really refuse.

194
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,482
Issei, think you can handle it?

195
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,860
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

196
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,153
Most excellent.

197
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,321
I'm looking forward to seeing
what kind of power

198
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,365
the Red Dragon Emperor
possesses.

199
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,075
Aren't you, Sairaorg?

200
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,702
[SAIRAORG]
I've been looking forward

201
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,954
to this day for a while now.

202
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,754
[SIR ZECHS]
Now, begin the match!

‐[DDRAIG] Leave it to me!

205
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,054
One, two, three!

206
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,930
[SAIRAORG]
This should be interesting.

207
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,647
Hmmph.

208
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,193
[DDRAIG]
Welsh Dragon. Balance Breaker!

209
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,575
[ISSEI thinking]
Damn! He's too fast!

210
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,119
Guess I'll have to go
with a suicidal charge!

211
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,580
[ISSEI‐JUGGERNAUT yells]

212
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,795
Not bad, Issei.

213
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,129
That was a decent attack,

214
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,507
though maybe a little
too straightforward.

215
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,716
[gasps]

216
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,260
That move might
take down a weaker devil,

217
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,805
but I'm...

218
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,473
stronger!

[ISSEI‐JUGGERNAUT]
What the hell?

221
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,695
That was my favorite
free‐time arm.

222
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,198
It's numb,
but I don't think it's broken.

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,908
Ddraig, can you
repair the armor?

224
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,618
[DDRAIG]
Yes. I'm on it.

225
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,372
[SAIRAORG]
Oh, you're still standing?

226
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,250
No matter, I'm just
getting warmed up.

227
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,001
[ISSEI thinking]
Warmed up?

You almost broke

What a beast!

240
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,916
Is this guy really
in the same generation

241
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,544
as the prez
and Diodora Astaroth?

242
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,088
[DDRAIG]
Yes. Even I'm surprised.

243
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,049
A power‐type that's
raised his physical strength

244
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,302
to its utmost
destructive limit?

245
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,720
How interesting!

246
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,347
I'll admit he's peaked
my curiosity.

247
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
[ISSEI thinking]
He should've inherited

the Power of Destruction,

249
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,645
but instead he was born into
a devil household without it.

250
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,023
The only thing he had
was his own body.

251
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,858
He became so strong on his own

252
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,818
that he was chosen
as the next heir.

253
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,987
This guy doesn't
half‐ass anything.

You on some kinda
'roid juice cleanse?

You don't need drugs when
you believe in your own body.

did he make that sound cool?

I can beat Sairaorg!

Hmm. I get it now,

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,267
but honestly I could never
look down on the person

299
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,852
who went against
the old Satan faction

300

About fighting Sairaorg?

410

He's a real badass.

And yet, his punches
felt like mine some how.

Indeed, they were.

413
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,297
Sairaorg has trained fervently

414
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,340
to fill the gaps
where he was lacking.

415
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,342
That is how he became so strong,

416
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,637
thus possessing something
other devils do not have.

417

It almost seems foolish,

because I'm the same way.

to facing our opponents.

[SIR ZECHS]
Usually when people battle him,

425
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,948
they give up before the bout
is anywhere close to over.

426
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,992
Their demonic power fails,

427
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
and they're overwhelmed
by his sheer strength.

428
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,122
And any demon who believes
demonic power equals status

429
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,665
would quickly lose heart.

are you still gonna call Rias

Uh...

I never thought about it,

445
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,371
but I guess
after she graduates,

446
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,082
she technically won't be
our President anymore.

But even without that title,

of so much admiration.

So as long as we have this ID,

474
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,978
we can see all the temples
like Kiyomizu,

475
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,771
Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji?

476
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,189
Yes, that's right!

477
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,442
Basically, it's a pass that
will allow even a devil

478
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,610
to enter the temples in Kyoto.

479
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,571
Go on now
have a good time.

this is for you.

Take care, Rias.

Have a good trip.

00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,297
We'll bring you a souvenir.

That's very kind of you.

I should get going too.

President?

Oh, Issei, as it turns out,
I'm no better than Akeno.

00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,898
The truth is I'm going
to miss you terribly.

I've tried to hide it,
but I adore your stupid face.

496
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,528
I find myself missing it
when you're gone

497
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,071
for long periods of time,

498

and I know that's
totally pathetic.

It's only for a few days.

Besides, you'll have Koneko
and Gasper to keep you company.

Yes, that's true.

Uh, Rias?

I wanted to send
you off with a kiss.

[chuckles] There you again
with that stupid face.

506
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,474
A kiss from me
shouldn't be a surprise.

507
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,684
And yet shockingly,
the kiss somehow managed

508
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,144
to take me by total surprise.

With that,

I'll be able to stand being
apart from you for a few days.

Hurry back, 'kay? Go!
