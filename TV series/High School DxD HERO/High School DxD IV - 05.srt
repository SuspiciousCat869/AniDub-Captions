I guess the rumors

about the Gremory family
are true.

Your naivety is charming.

00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,618
See, even though your physical
and demonic power are pitiful,

171
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,162
your ability to gather people
and delegate tasks

172
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,164
is actually rather admirable.

173

Undoubtedly, it is that skill
which will likely make you

the most dangerous of
the Red Dragon Emperors.

What exactly does
the Hero Faction want?

[CAO CAO] Not that I'd expect
a fallen angel to understand,

but our mission is simple.

179
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,888
We merely want
to test our limits,

180
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,099
and see how far we can go
as humans.

[AZAZEL‐JUGGERNAUT]
But why?

182

[CAO CAO]
Think about it:

183
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,771
Devils, dragons, fallen angels,
and everything in between.

184
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,189
They have incredible power,

185

yet it's always humans
who ultimately defeat them.

It's embarrassing,
all things considered.

this challenge,

as a human fighting
among the gods.

What do you mean
by "unsettling"?

288
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,433
Historically, Kyoto
is a city built on balance.

289
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,643
It was designed
using the sacred principals

290
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,645
of both feng shui
and onmyoudou.

291
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,981
Because of that,
there are several power spots

292
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,190
scattered around the city.

293
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,067
However, the chi
from those spots

294
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,029
has been redirected
towards Nijo Castle.

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,406
So, what do you think's
gonna happen then?

is on standby.

Right.

305

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
be our highest priority.

00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,805
We have no idea
what Cao Cao is capable of,

so I won't be
sending you out alone.

00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,976
I've called in
someone to help

00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,437
who is pretty good at handling
these types of situations.

311
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,898
You did?
Who is it then?

312
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,567
Well, I'd rather
not ruin the surprise,

313
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,361
but you'll know them
when you see them.

314
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,820
In the meantime, just focus

315
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,406
on holding your ground
until they get there.

316
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,241
Some good and bad news.

317
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,577
I was able to get
two vials of Phoenix Tears,

318
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,038
but unfortunately,
that's all I could round up.

319
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,415
‐Just two?
‐But that won't be enough.

320
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,377
I'm sorry, everyone,
it's the best I could manage.

321
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,670
Each group gets one,
so use it wisely.

322
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,047
And one more thing.

323
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,174
‐Listen, Saji.
‐[SAJI] Yes?

324
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,385
I want you to go
with the Gremory Family.

325
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,470
‐[SAJI] Uh...
‐Your dragon king form.

326
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,931
It might prove to be useful.

327
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,766
So, I need you there
to support Issei.

328
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,184
But, sir‐‐

329
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,852
[AZAZEL] Issei,
that makes you responsible

330
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,230
for bringing Saji back
if he goes out of control.

331
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,231
Right.

332
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,732
You sure?

333
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,402
After all the shit you gave me
back during the Sitri game,

334
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,278
I'd much rather
have you as an ally.

335
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,531
Don't worry,
I've got your back on this one.

336
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,698
Thanks, Issei.

337
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,492
One final note before we go.

338
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,202
It's regarding
the Hero Faction.

339
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,122
We've got devils, angels,
fallen angels and yokai.

340
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,749
They've come from all over
to help us defeat Cao Cao.

341
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,460
We'll make sure they're
each in place for the attack.

342
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,838
Don't you worry,
if any baddies try to escape,

343
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,964
we'll make sure
to punish them!

344
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,882
I think that's everything.

345
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,634
Once we're finished
with preparations,

346
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,095
you should head for your
designated locations.

347
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,389
I will be supervising
the battle from here.

348
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,807
I can't go with you.

349
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,934
So, don't you dare die on me.

350
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,062
This trip isn't over until
everyone makes it back home.

351
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,815
Protect Kyoto and yourselves.
Got it?

352
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,275
[GROUP]
Yes.

353
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,152
[low rumbling]

354
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,488
[GASPER] Wow,
that was really tough.

355
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,658
To think, members of
the Old Satan Faction got in.

356
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,952
It's hard to believe.

357
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,121
‐[KONEKO] You cool, Rias?
‐[RIAS] Hmm?

358
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,540
‐[RIAS] I feel a little uneasy.
‐[KONEKO gasps]

359
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,542
Why? Do you sense a douchebag?

360
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,878
I think it's...

361
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,296
about Issei.

362
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,673
Rightfully so.

363
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,425
I mean, he's off in Kyoto
surrounded by

364
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,136
tons of innocent, cute girls
and you're stuck here.

365
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,930
‐[AKENO giggles]
‐[KONEKO] I'm worried.

366
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,893
Issei! Hey!

367
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,854
Yeah?
You need me?

368
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,314
Seems there's been
an incident.

369
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,983
Another molester struck
right outside the hotel.

370
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,027
I happened
to be passing by

371
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,488
so I helped detain
the perv responsible.

372
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,406
Afterwards,
this popped out of his body.

373
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,033
Recognize it?

374
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,409
[DDRAIG]
It can't be.

375
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,619
What is it, Ddraig?

376
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,912
[DDRAIG]
Believe it or not,

377
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,371
that's the thing
that jumped out of you

378
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,664
back on the bullet train.

379
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,333
It's what was in the box.

380
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,375
[gasps]

381
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,381
[ISSEI] Are you kidding me?
This is my potential?!

382
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,966
Yep. Makes sense.

383
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,384
When I examined the object,

384
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,720
it definitely had
a very Issei feel.

385
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,349
[DDRAIG]
Yes, it seems so.

386
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,352
But wait.
How very strange.

387
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,354
‐[ISSEI] What is?
‐[DDRAIG] Your potential.

388
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,397
It seems that
it traveled around Kyoto

389
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,358
by jumping
from person to person,

390
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,859
using them as vessels to grab

391
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,071
every available boob
it could along the way.

392
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,865
[screams]

393
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,700
Issei's potential
was the culprit

394
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,077
behind all
the molester cases,

395
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,745
so in a way I guess
it was an epidemic.

396
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,080
[SAJI gasping]

397
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,540
No way!

398
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,041
[AZAZEL]
Interesting.

399
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,085
What can the perv‐orb do?

400
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,378
[DDRAIG]
No idea,

401
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,339
but I can sense that
it possesses a strong power.

402
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,632
[AZAZEL chuckles]

403
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,092
Basically, thanks to Issei,

404
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,052
we'll have to follow up
on the molesters.

405
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,596
Great. It's not like
I have anything better to do.

406
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,431
[ISSEI] Sorry
my potential is a horn dog.

[ROSSWEISSE retching]

413
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,318
Hmm? What's wrong?

414
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,571
Just inner turmoil.

415
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,532
Like questioning my existence.

416
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,118
I was wondering
what makes somebody a hero.

417
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,869
When I was a human,

418
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,372
heroes were people
that I worshiped.

419
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,083
But these days,
I'm not so certain.

420
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,042
[AZAZEL]
Really?

421
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,544
Let me get this straight.

422
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,129
You think you can't be a hero

423
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,256
because you just happen
to be a devil?

424
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,968
Listen. What do you want to be?
It's up to you.

425
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,973
Duh, a high‐ranking devil
and the Harem King, obviously!

426
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,600
Ha, but seriously,

427
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,852
for right now I just want
to work hard for the prez

and all my friends.

429
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,355
It's a pretty decent goal.

430
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,649
As long as that's
what you want.

431
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,943
It's important to remain
true to yourself.

I promise we're gonna

Hello there.
It's been a while.

00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,994
I'm guessing
you don't remember me.

I'm not surprised.

I'm just another

00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,303
You had a Sacred Gear
that could control shadows!

494
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,679
I'm touched you remember,

495
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,181
but this time
I'm gonna show you

00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,850
what a shadow user
can really do!

What do you think?

I look like you, right?

504
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,581
I admired your armor so much
the last time we fought,

505
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,958
I decided I wanted
a set of my own.

506
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,835
So, I went on a field trip

507
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,755
and obtained
Night Reflection Death Cross.

508

Now, then.
